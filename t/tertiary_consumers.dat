5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that {{produce their own}} food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.|$|E
50|$|Within an {{ecological}} food chain, consumers are categorized into three groups: primary consumers, secondary consumers, and the <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers.</b> Primary consumers are herbivores, feeding on plants. Secondary consumers, {{on the other}} hand, are carnivores, and prey on other animals. Omnivores, who feed on both plants and animals, {{can also be considered}} a secondary consumer. <b>Tertiary</b> <b>consumers,</b> sometimes also known as apex predators, are usually at the top of food chains, capable of feeding on secondary consumers and primary consumers. <b>Tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> can be either fully carnivorous or omnivorous.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of peacock bass in Panama has caused significant {{damage to the}} native fish assemblage, by eliminating seven out of 11 previously common fish species, and significantly reducing three others.

5000|$|The {{efficiency}} {{with which}} energy or biomass {{is transferred from}} one trophic level to the next is called the ecological efficiency. Consumers at each level convert on average only about 10% of the chemical energy in their food to their own organic tissue (the ten-percent law). For this reason, food chains rarely extend for more than 5 or 6 levels. At the lowest trophic level (the bottom of the food chain), plants convert about 1% of the sunlight they receive into chemical energy. It follows from this that the total energy originally present in the incident sunlight that is finally embodied in a <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer</b> is about 0.001% ...|$|R

It is a light grayish brown, paler ventrally, with a long snout and large greenish eyes. [...] This deep water shark has two dorsal fins with long, grooved spines and the second dorsal fin smaller than the first. Its upper teeth are blade-like and lower have finely serrated edges. This <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer</b> feeds on mainly fish such as bony fish, but also cephalopods such as squid and other invertebrates like crustaceans. The gulper shark is currently a vulnerable species mainly because of exploitation by humans and their abnormally long gestation period and low fecundity, preventing their population from recovering.|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} decade, the Arctic region has faced {{some of its}} highest {{temperatures}} within the instrumental record. Furthermore, within the past 2000 years, summer temperature highs have never been harsher, based on paleo-climate reconstructions. This warming is due to climate feedbacks mechanisms based on sea-ice melt. As sea ice melts, it frees up more open ocean water to be further heated, thus bringing about a positive feedback. Ocean water retains more heat than sea ice; additionally the albedo of sea ice {{is much higher than}} that of ocean water. Ringed seals require sea ice to live and reproduce. They live most of their lives alone, only grouping together into colonies when they are on sea ice to molt, mate, or rest. Without access to sea ice, ringed seals are unable to sustain life, which further affects trophic levels both above and below. Ringed seals are both predators and prey. A predator to zooplankton and fish, the ringed seal is considered a primary consumer as well as a secondary <b>consumer.</b> But the <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer,</b> or top predator, in the Arctic is the polar bear, feeding mostly on seals, including the ringed seal. Yet through further exploration, the potential fates of this Arctic food web seem to be ambiguous, leading to a very important trade off of polar bear mortality and ringed seal sustenance.|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation was}} conducted in Lake Taihu in autumn of 2013 and 2014, {{in order to understand}} the environmental fate of microcystins (MCs) and evaluate the health risk from MCs. Samples of water, algal cells, macrophytes, shrimps and fish were taken to detect MCs by HPLC-MS/MS after solid phase extraction. Widespread MC contamination in water, algal cells, macrophytes, shrimps and fish was found in Lake Taihu. The ubiquitous presence of MCs in water, algal cells and biota was found in 100 % of samples. MC accumulation was in the order of primary producer > <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer</b> > secondary consumer > primary consumer. The highest levels of MCs in macrophytes, shrimps and fish tissue were found in Potamogeton maackianus, Exopalaemon modestus, and Hyporhamphus intermedius, respectively. The MCs level in shrimps and the tissues of three fish species, Neosalanx tangkahkeii taihuensis, Coilia ectenes and silver carp, was closely linked to their dietary exposure. Ceratophyllum demersum L. was an ideal plant for introduction into lakes to protect against Microcystis blooms and MCs, due to its ability to absorb nutrients, accumulate large amounts of MCs and tolerate these toxins compared to other macrophytes. The average daily intakes (ADIs) of MCs for Exopalaemon modestus and three fish species, Coilia ectenes, Hyporhamphus intermedius and Carassius carassius, were all above the tolerable daily intakes (TDI) set by the World Health Organization (WHO), implying there existed potential threats to human health...|$|R

40|$|Assessment of isotopic {{compositions}} at {{the base}} of food webs is a prerequisite for using stable isotope analysis to assess foraging locations and trophic positions of marine organisms. Our study represents a unique application of stable-isotope analyses across multiple trophic levels (primary producer, primary <b>consumer</b> and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer)</b> and over a large spatial scale in two pelagic marine ecosystems. We found that delta N- 15 values of particulate organic matter (POM), barnacles and phenylalanine from the muscle tissue of yellowfin tuna all showed similar spatial patterns. This consistency suggests that isotopic analysis of any of these can provide a reasonable proxy for isotopic variability {{at the base}} of the food web. Secondly, variations in the delta N- 15 values of yellowfin tuna bulk-muscle tissues paralleled the spatial trends observed in all of these isotopic baseline proxies. Variation in isotopic composition {{at the base of}} the food web, rather than differences in tuna diet, explained the 11 parts per thousand variability observed in the bulk-tissue delta N- 15 values of yellowfin tuna. Evaluating the trophic position of yellowfin tuna using amino-acid isotopic compositions across the western Indian and equatorial Pacific Oceans strongly suggests these tuna occupy similar trophic positions, albeit absolute trophic positions estimated by this method were lower than expected. This study reinforces the importance of considering isotopic baseline variability for diet studies, and provides new insights into methods that can be applied to generate nitrogen isoscapes for worldwide comparisons of top predators in marine ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|We used stable C and N isotope {{ratios of}} tissues from 29 fish species {{from a large}} {{subtropical}} lagoon in southern Brazil to examine spatial variability in isotopic composition and vertical trophic structure across freshwater and estuarine habitats. Nitrogen isotope ratios indicated a smooth gradation in trophic positions among species, with most fishes occupying the secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer</b> level. Fish assemblages showed a significant shift in their carbon isotopic signatures between freshwater and estuarine sites. Depleted carbon signatures (from _ 24. 7 & to _ 17. 8 &) were found in freshwater, whereas more enriched signatures (from _ 19. 1 & to _ 12. 3 &) were obtained within the estuarine zone downstream. Based on our survey of the C 3 and C 4 plants and isotopic values for phytoplankton and benthic microalgae reported for ecosystems elsewhere, we hypothesized that the observed d 13 C differences in the fish assemblage between freshwater and estuarine sites {{is due to a}} shift from assimilating organic matter ultimately derived from C 3 freshwater marsh vegetation and phytoplankton at the freshwater site (d 13 C ranging from _ 25 & to _ 19 &), to C 4 salt-marsh (e. g. Spartina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), benthic microalgae and marine phytoplankton at the estuarine sites (from _ 18 & to _ 12 &). Our results suggested that fish assemblages are generally supported by autochthonous primary production. Freshwater fishes that likely were displaced downstream into the estuary during periods of high freshwater discharge had depleted d 13 C values that were characteristic of the upper lagoon.

40|$|Abstract—We {{studied the}} {{biomagnification}} of total mercury and methylmercury in a subtropical freshwater lake, Caddo Lake, Texas and Louisiana, USA. The {{present study is}} unique in that it not only included invertebrates (seven species) and fish (six species) but also an amphibian (one species), reptiles (three species), and mammals (three species). Nonfish vertebrates such as those included {{in the present study}} are often not included in assessments of trophic transfer of Hg. Mean trophic position (determined using stable isotopes of nitrogen) ranged from 2. 0 (indicative of a primary consumer) to 3. 8 (indicative of a <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumer).</b> Mean total Hg concentrations ranged from 36 to 3, 292 ng/g dry weight in muscle and whole body and from 150 to 30, 171 ng/g dry weight in liver. Most of the Hg in muscle and whole-body tissue was found as methylmercury, and at least 50 % of the Hg found in liver was in the inorganic form (with the exception of largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides). Mercury concentrations were positively correlated with trophic position, indicating that biomagnification occurs in the food web of Caddo Lake. The food web magnification factors (FWMFs; slope of the relationship between mean Hg concentration and trophic position) for both total Hg andmethylmercury were similar to those observed in other studies. Because most of the total Hg in consumers was methylmercury, the FWMF for methylmercury was not significantly different from the FWMF for total Hg. Some vertebrates examined in the present study had low Hg concentrations in their tissues similar to those observed in invertebrates, whereas others had concentrations of Hg in their tissues that in previous studies have been associate...|$|R
50|$|Predators {{are often}} another organism's prey, and {{likewise}} prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes {{may be the}} prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, {{but there are also}} <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> eating these carnivores, quaternary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses). A predator at the top of any food chain is called an apex predator; examples include the sperm whale, Komodo dragon, tiger, and most eagles and owls. Many predators eat from multiple levels of the food chain. A carnivore may eat both secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers,</b> and its prey may itself be difficult to classify for similar reasons. Organisms showing both carnivory and herbivory are known as omnivores. Even herbivores such as the giant panda may supplement their diet with meat.|$|E
50|$|There are {{generally}} {{two types of}} functional groups that range between flora and specific animal populations. Groups that relate to vegetation science, or flora, are known as plant functional types. Also referred to as PFT for short, those of such often share identical photosynthetic processes and require comparable nutrients. As an example, plants that undergo photosynthesis share an identical purpose in producing chemical energy for others. In contrast, those within the animal science range are called guilds, typically sharing feeding types. This could be easily simplified when viewing trophic levels. Examples include primary consumers, secondary consumers, <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers,</b> and quaternary consumers.|$|E
50|$|The {{energy is}} passed on from trophic level to trophic level {{and each time}} about 90% of the energy is lost, with some being lost as heat into the {{environment}} (an effect of respiration) and some being lost as incompletely digested food (egesta).

This means the top consumer of a food chain receives the least energy, {{as a lot of}} the food chain's energy has been lost between trophic levels.

Mine water has to be treated to prevent its contaminating other clean water sources, such as nearby Grand Lake, which already has elevated levels of lead due to mining activities. Photosynthetic organisms in the water have no means to dispose of heavy metals they absorb and accumulate these. Any animal or fish that feeds on this primary producer accumulates the higher concentrations of these contaminants, as the primary producer has a higher concentration of heavy metals relative to the water. Secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> accumulate even higher concentrations of such metals in a process called biomagnification).

40|$|In {{addition}} to the commonly accepted importance of the vampire bat in the maintenance and transmission of the rabies virus (RABV) in South America, RABV infection of other species is widely evidenced, challenging {{their role in the}} viral cycle. To identify the bioecological drivers of RABV circulation in neotropical bat communities, we conducted a molecular and serological survey on almost 1, 000 bats from 30 species, and a 4 -year longitudinal survey in two colonies of vampire bats in French Guiana. RABV was molecularly detected in a common vampire and in a frugivorous bat. The sequences corresponded to haematophagous bat-related strains and were close to viruses circulating in the Brazilian Amazon region. Species' seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 20 %, and the risk of seropositivity was higher in bats with a haematophagous diet, living in monospecific colonies and in dense forests. The longitudinal survey showed substantial temporal fluctuations, with individual waves of seroconversions and waning immunity. The high prevalences observed in bat communities, in most habitats and in species that do not share the same microhabitats and bioecological patterns, the temporal variations, and a rather short period of detectable antibodies as observed in recaptured vampires suggest (i) frequent exposure of animals, (ii) an ability of the infected host to control and eliminate the virus, (iii) more relaxed modes of exposure between bats than the commonly assumed infection via direct contact with saliva of infected animals, all of which should be further investigated. We hypothesize that RABV circulation in French Guiana is mainly maintained in the pristine forest habitats that may provide sufficient food resources to allow vampire bats, the main prevalent species, to survive and RABV to be propagated. However, on the forest edge and in disturbed areas, human activities may induce more insidious effects such as defaunation. One of the ecological consequences is the disappearance of resources for <b>tertiary</b> or secondary <b>consumers.</b> Populations of vampires may then shift to alternative resources such as cattle, domestic animals and humans. Therefore, a good forest status, allowing both a dilution effect in highly rich bat communities and the maintenance of large populations of medium-sized and large mammals used as prey by vampires, should prevent their migration to anthropized areas...|$|R
40|$|During August and September 2001, 363 wine {{consumers}} {{shopping for}} wine at eight wine retail stores in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia, were extensively surveyed about their activities, interests and opinions about wine and their wine purchasing behaviour. The {{study consisted of}} two major parts. The first was to identify the segments that form the South Australian wine market and the second was to identify the preferred risk reduction strategies of each of those segments and link those to the wine retail environment. The underlying assumption was that retailers could manipulate their retail mix to encompass the preferred strategies of their target market, thus providing {{the basis for a}} potential competitive advantage. This data was analysed and the major results are summarised below. The study identified five distinct segments, each with their own characteristics and behaviours. These were: • Segment 1 – Conservative, Wine Knowledgeable Wine Drinkers (20. 9 % of the total market) These consumers are generally well educated, knowledgeable and predominantly male, whose buying habits are reasonably predictable from year to year. They are the consumers who may previously have been stereotyped as “connoisseurs”. • Segment 2 – Image Oriented, Knowledge Seeking Wine Consumers (22. 3 %) These are likely to be <b>tertiary</b> educated, professional <b>consumers</b> whose purchases are dictated by opinion leaders. They have some wine knowledge and are actively seeking to increase that knowledge. They are concerned with the image associated with drinking wine. • Segment 3 – Basic Wine Drinker (16. 8 %) This consumer is not concerned with any of the “airs and graces” associated with drinking wine. They drink wine because they enjoy it and they are likely to make their wine purchases from a number of safe brands that have previously met their needs. vii • Segment 4 – Experimenter, Highly Knowledgeable Wine Drinker (19. 0 %) These consumers have become somewhat “bored” with what they perceive as the run of the mill wines on offer and are seeking new and different wines to excite their palates. They are very wine knowledgeable and seek out other people with knowledge to assist in their quest for different wines and as a result, they tend to experiment when purchasing wine. • Segment 5 – Enjoyment Oriented, Social Wine Drinkers (20. 9 %) These consumers are predominantly female and enjoy a glass of wine with their friends on a weekend. Their purchasing behaviour can be spontaneous and the packaging and labelling of the wine plays a part in their decisions, indicating that they might be attracted to the so-called “concept” brand category on the market. From a wine industry perspective, this construct of the market is important, as segments 1, 2 and 4 all have an average spend per bottle of wine in excess of $ 20. This indicates that they purchase wine in the super premium category and above, the categories in which many of the boutique and smaller producers have positioned their products. The knowledge that about 60 % of the market are potential customers may prove comforting to these producers. The second part of the study revealed that the two most preferred strategies were that consumers seek information about their purchases prior to buying and that they sought reassurance through tasting prior to buying. The incidence of the use of these strategies increased as the price of the wine increased. When the practical implications for wine retailers were examined, the data revealed that each segment relied on the assortment of wines on offer as their risk reduction strategy of choice. This had different implications for individual wine retailers, depending on their positioning and target markets. The implications for each of the segments are summarised as: • Segment 1 – Conservative, Wine Knowledgeable Wine Drinkers A range of super premium wines from the larger producers. viii • Segment 2 – Image Oriented, Knowledge Seeking Wine Consumers An assortment of medal and trophy winning wines and wines that have received favourable press coverage. • Segment 3 – Basic Wine Drinkers An assortment of commercial wines. • Segment 4 – Experimenter, Highly Knowledgeable Wine Drinkers A range of wines perceived as new, innovative, different or exciting. • Segment 5 – Enjoyment Oriented, Social Wine Drinkers A range of more commercial wines that should include some concept brands that appeal to mainly female consumers. The research study also examined the relationship between a consumer’s level of wine knowledge {{and the quality of the}} wine they consumed. It concluded that a consumer with a greater level of wine knowledge is likely to spend (on average) more per bottle of wine than a consumer with less wine knowledge.

Decapod crustaceans (31. 71 ± 3. 92 %) and teleost fishes (16. 45 ± 3. 43 %) made the largest contribution to the standardised diet of the Myliobatoidei. Teleost fishes (37. 40 ± 16. 09 %) and polychaete worms (31. 96 ± 14. 22 %) were the most prominent prey categories in the standardised diet of the suborder Torpedinoidei. Cluster analysis identified nine major trophic guilds the largest of which were decapod crustaceans (24 species), teleost fishes (11 species) and molluscs (11 species). Trophic level estimates for rays ranged from 3. 10 for Potamotrygon falkneri to 4. 24 for Gymnura australis, Torpedo marmorata and T. nobiliana. Secondary consumers with a T L < 4. 00 represented 84 % of the species examined, with the remaining 12 species (16 %) classified as <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> (T L ≥ 4. 00). <b>Tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> included electric rays (Torpedo, 3 spp. and Hypnos, 1 sp.), butterfly rays (Gymnura, 4 spp.), stingrays (2 spp.) and Potamotrygonid stingrays (2 spp.).

40|$|Arthropods {{are a major}} {{component}} of the marine zooplankton, functioning as intermediates between primary producers and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> in pelagic food webs. They have likely occupied the water column ecospace since the early Cambrian, co-evolving with several major plankton groups through the Phanerozoic. Analysis of the fossil record of arthropods indicates that a zooplanktonic lifestyle has arisen independently across several arthropod groups, and that the arthropod body plan has shown adaptability to fundamental environmental change. Key anatomical adaptations and reproductive strategies that are compatible with and/or facilitate a zooplanktonic lifestyle include well-developed swimming appendages, buoyancy, an active metabolism supported by efficient respiration, visual or photoreception organs for use in detecting mates, food and predators, and the nurturing of young within the exoskeleton. Many of these characters are apparent in the earliest record of arthropods. The development and diversification of arthropod zooplankton into the food chain helped enable large secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> to enter the water column and also contributed to the export of organic matter to the seabed via the faecal stream. Although the fossil record of arthropod zooplankton is extremely poor for most of the Phanerozoic, their position in marine food webs suggests they have been fundamental to rebuilding marine trophic structure following major extinction events, and to maintaining marine plankton diversity through Phanerozoic time.

Invertebrate organisms play important roles in the diets of many shorebird and fish species, and can profoundly influence the abundance and species composition of these <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers</b> (Bottom and Jones, 1990; Skagen and Oman, 1996; Stillman et at., 2000). Invertebrates also play an integral role in the recycling of nutrients and conservation of water quality within estuarine systems (Harris, 1999; Peterson and Heck, 1999). Understanding temporal and spatial change in invertebrate community structure, and the factors underpinning them, is therefore essential to the better management of these waterways [...] Introduction...|$|E
40|$|Copepods, minute crustaceans, {{are vital}} {{constituents}} of marine food web dynamics in tropical ecosystems. Ecologically, copepods provide {{the link between}} primary production and <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers.</b> Changes in population structure and densities may impact ecosystem stability and production on small to large spatial scales. The present study examined {{the influence of the}} Florida Current on copepod population densities off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida due to limited data in the area. Samples were collected during February and July 2007 at two locations, Stations A and B. Station A, dependent on current dynamics, fluctuated between the most western boundary and the inshore waters adjacent to the coast. Station B was typically located within the Florida Current showing great influence from the current’s physical factors. The current, acted as a physical barrier, entrapping species at near shore stations, increasing population densities by increased nutrient loads through upwelling and land runoff. The movement of the current inshore showed a greater resurgence of oceanic species at each station. However, {{the western edge of the}} current, acting as a barrier, yielded the lowest population densities overall and among all copepod orders. The decrease can influence food web dynamics and the prey availability to higher <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers.</b> Population dynamics were ascertained by relative copepod densities identified to the lowest possible taxa and enumerated. Calanoid copepods were dominant in zooplankton samples, showing high instances of Calanus and Undinula, followed by Poecilostomatoida, highly represented by Corycaeus and Oncaea, and Cyclopoida. Poecilostomatoid densities were numerically important, where in some samples Corycaeus contributed to 42 % of overall copepod densities. Previous studies have led to their underestimation, due to gear selectivity and extrusion directly related to their prosome length. Diversity levels revealed an overall diverse habitat, typical of tropical environments. However, there was greater diversity in coastal waters as compared to the Florida Current which was only found oceanic species present...|$|E
40|$|Human {{exposure}} to the neurotoxin, methylmercury (MeHg), occurs primarily through the consumption of contaminated fish that are present even in pristine freshwater ecosystems. Lake Kinneret is the sole freshwater lake in Israel and supports an important commercial fishery. We examined total mercury (THg; often equivalent to MeHg in fish muscle tissue) for nine fish species in Lake Kinneret. Concentrations were low for all fish species, 6 - 409 ng/g, and below 500 ng/g MeHg, the level generally considered safe for human consumption. Of particular relevance are the very low levels of THg (< 60 ng/g) in Galilee St. Peter’s fish (Sarotherodon galilaeus) and lavnun (Acanthobrama terrascantae), the most commercially important species in Lake Kinneret. Biomagnification was apparent among trophic guilds, with THg concentrations increasing from primary to secondary to <b>tertiary</b> <b>consumers.</b> This study suggests that consumption of commercial species, especially primary consumers, will result in low MeHg {{exposure to}} humans...|$|E
