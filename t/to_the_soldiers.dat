5|$|Although {{the main}} focus of Australia's {{military}} during World War I was overseas in Europe and the Middle East, there was still a necessity to maintain troops in Australia on home service to carry out a number of essential tasks. As the AIF was otherwise engaged these duties out of necessity fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> of the militia and a small number of regular soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Almost 35,000 South Australians {{served in}} the First World War. This number {{amounted}} to 8.5% of the South Australian population at the time, or 37.7% of men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 44. Of those who served, over 5,000 South Australians died. In response to these deaths, Archibald Peake, the premier of South Australia, asked the state parliament to fund a memorial commemorating the victory and the sacrifice of those who had fought and fallen. The motion was presented in March 1919, and it received unanimous support in the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council. With the passing of this motion, the South Australian Government became the first in Australia to elect to build a memorial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> of the First World War.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{felt the}} money from the bonds should not go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers,</b> but the speculators that had bought the bonds from the soldiers, who had shown little faith in the country's future. The process of {{attempting}} to track down the original bond holders along with the government showing discrimination among the classes of holders if the war veterans were to be compensated also weighed in as factors for Hamilton. As for the state debts, Hamilton suggested to consolidate it with the national debt and label it as federal debt, for the sake of efficiency on a national scale.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} lieutenant colonel in 1796, leading a local militia from that year to 1802. When he left, he granted all his military wages from that period <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> of his unit. He {{was appointed}} colonel on March 24, 1802, and donated $2,435 for the clothing of the soldiers. He further donated $1,000,000 {{to build a}} navy, along with Juan Larrea and Domingo Matheu. He fought in the 1806 British invasions of the Río de la Plata, leading a resistance in the Gálvez bridge. He stood for 20 hours, with only 400 soldiers, against an overwhelming British force. He managed to escape with 50 soldiers, and aided the brigadier Hilarión de la Quintana.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 the Royal British Legion Oldpark/Cavehill {{branch in}} Belfast raised {{money from the}} sale of badges to erect a {{memorial}} to the men. On 28 May 2010, a memorial stone was placed {{at the site of the}} killings on Squire's Hill by the families and former regimental colleagues of the three soldiers. The next day a 15-foot obelisk incorporating carved images of the deceased was dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> at nearby Ballysillan Avenue. A service of remembrance with regimental drums and colours was then held at Ballysillan leisure centre attended by around 1000 people including Lord Mayor of Belfast Naomi Long and North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds.|$|E

The writer takes down notes and asks questions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldier,</b> and gives answers of his own <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldier's</b> questions. <b>The</b> novel faced heavy criticism {{at the time of its}} publication for its violence and vulgarity.|$|R
5|$|On 11October Valckenier unsuccessfully {{requested}} that officers control their troops {{and stop the}} looting. Two days later the council established a reward of two ducats for every Chinese head surrendered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> as an incentive for the other ethnic groups {{to assist in the}} purge. As a result, ethnic Chinese who had survived the initial assault were hunted by gangs of irregulars, who killed those Chinese they found for the reward. The Dutch worked with natives in different parts of Batavia; ethnic Bugis and Balinese grenadiers were sent to reinforce the Dutch on 14October. On 22October Valckenier called for all killings to cease. In a lengthy letter in which he blamed the unrest entirely on the Chinese rebels, Valckenier offered an amnesty to all Chinese, except for the leaders of the unrest, on whose heads he placed a bounty of up to 500 rijksdaalders.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February 2004, I Corps forward {{headquarters}} {{deployed to}} Iraq. The element, called Task Force Olympia, deployed to Mosul, Iraq in January 2004, where it assumed its mission from the 101st Airborne Division {{to form a}} headquarters to exercise command and control of all coalition and Iraqi forces in northern Iraq. It coordinated the efforts of both of the active Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, attached engineers, civil affairs, signal, and other supporting units as well as Iraqi security forces, eventually numbering more than 12,000. The Iraqi security forces included four Civil Defense Corps battalions, three Border Police battalions, several thousand members of the Iraq Facility Protection Security Forces and an Armed Forces battalion. After {{more than a year}} in Iraq, the corps forward headquarters handed over responsibility for northern Iraq <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> of Task Force Freedom and 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in February 2005.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 15 May 218, Elagabalus was taken, by either Julia Maesa or Gannys, to the camp of the Legio III Gallica at Raphanea and {{presented}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> stationed there. In one account of the events, Elegabalus was saluted as Antoninus by the soldiers, after his father Caracalla whose official name was Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Enticed by Julia's bribes, the legion proclaimed Elagabalus the righful Emperor of Rome on 16 May 218. In Gibbon's opinion, Macrinus {{might have been able}} to stop the rebellion in this early stage, but failed to contain it because he was unable to decide on an appropriate course of action and instead remained at Antioch.|$|E

5|$|The living {{conditions}} at the fort were poor. It was surrounded by marshes, with a poor road network, and the garrison had to survive on collected rainwater. A trader called a sutler built a house inside the southern entrance, growing vegetables within the south-west bastion and enjoying an effective monopoly on selling food <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers.</b> New barracks for the officers and enlisted men were rebuilt in 1772, but the officers often preferred to live across the river in the more urban setting of Gravesend, near the military headquarters there. A cricket match in 1776 between men from the Kentish and Essex sides of the Thames reportedly ended in bloodshed when guns were seized from the guardroom; newspapers recounted how an Essex man and a sergeant were shot dead, and a soldier was bayonetted, before both sides fled the scene. It is uncertain how accurate the newspaper account was, although the historians Andrew Saunders and Charles Kightly give it some credence.|$|E
5|$|The {{precipitate}} {{action of}} the Hospitallers could have caused Richard's whole strategy to unravel. However, he recognised that the counterattack, once started, had to be supported by all his army and ordered the signal for a general charge to be sounded. Unsupported, the Hospitallers and the other rear units involved in the initial breakout would have been overwhelmed by the superior numbers of the enemy. The Frankish infantry opened gaps in their ranks for the knights to pass through and the attack naturally developed in echelon from the rear to the van. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> of Saladin's army, as Baha al-Din noted, the sudden change from passivity to ferocious activity {{on the part of}} the Crusaders was disconcerting, and appeared to be the result of a preconceived plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlers}} took shelter {{inside the}} fort {{while the men}} and boys took up their positions at the portholes inside the fort. A vicious firefight erupted, involving around 150 of Black Hawk's British Band. The battle raged {{for about an hour}} with heavy gunfire from both sides. At the battle's onset many of the settlement's women had been huddled in and around the cabins, but several married woman, including Elizabeth Armstrong, rallied the women and older children to provide support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers.</b> She assigned the unmarried young women, boys, and girls as young as eight years old to such tasks as cutting and rolling gunpowder cartridges and molding rifleballs. The married women reloaded the weapons while the soldiers tried to maintain an increased rate of fire.|$|E

In a break with past policies of the kingdom, Ukraputhan refuses to pay tributes and taxes demanded by the British.
