5|$|The first New Year's Eve {{celebration in}} Times Square {{was held on}} December 31, 1904; The New York Times owner, Adolph Ochs, decided to {{celebrate}} {{the opening of the}} newspaper's new headquarters, One Times Square, with a New Year's fireworks show {{on the roof of the}} building to welcome 1905. Close to 200,000 people attended the event, displacing traditional celebrations that had normally been held at Trinity Church. However, following several years of fireworks shows, Ochs wanted a bigger spectacle at the building to draw more attention to the area. The newspaper's chief electrician, Walter F. Palmer, suggested using a <b>time</b> <b>ball,</b> after seeing one used on the nearby Western Union Building.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} Semaphore, with its jetty built in 1860, was the state's main entry point for {{passengers}} and mail. It had a signal station (built 1872) and a <b>time</b> <b>ball</b> tower (built 1875). Semaphore remained of great maritime {{significance for the}} state until the 1880s. When {{the decision was made}} to build the fort, in 1878, the state's population had reached approximately 250,000. Settlement extended beyond Port Augusta, though Adelaide remained the dominant feature in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network. At this point Adelaide had a population of over 30,000. Port Adelaide was the main port for South Australia, with over 1000 ships visiting each year, and a local population of over 2,500.|$|E
25|$|The ball, {{constructed}} {{of wood and}} covered in zinc, and weighing , is raised just before 1pm, and at precisely 1pm, is dropped from atop the mast. Later, in 1861, the One O'Clock Gun was established at Edinburgh Castle to provide an audible signal when fog obscured the <b>time</b> <b>ball.</b> The <b>time</b> <b>ball</b> was operated for over 150 years, until it was damaged by a storm in 2007. In 2009, {{as part of the}} restoration of the monument, the <b>time</b> <b>ball</b> was removed, and the mechanism repaired. The <b>time</b> <b>ball</b> was brought back into service on 24 September 2009. The mechanism is now operated manually, based on the firing of the One O'Clock Gun.|$|E

25|$|Clearly {{seen from}} the river and aligned on the {{meridian}} for observation purposes, Building 20, {{also known as the}} Ball House, is the former observatory and <b>time</b> <b>ball</b> tower. It is a compact, tall, two story stone structure of several architectural shapes. The rectangular section with a gabled roof was the former observatory and the square section formerly housed the <b>time</b> <b>ball</b> installation topped with an antenna. The building is entered from the ground floor of its small porch, which joins the two buildings.|$|E
25|$|The {{site of the}} {{building}} was chosen because it was clearly visible from the harbour. It was originally intended that it was to only provide a time service through {{the operation of the}} <b>Time</b> <b>Ball</b> which still functions today. The Ball was dropped at 1p.m. {{and at the same time}} a cannon was fired at Dawes Point and then in later years at Fort Denison. The purpose of the <b>Time</b> <b>Ball</b> was so that ships could readjust their chronometers after being at sea for extended periods.|$|E

50|$|Todd's work {{as head of}} the Galvanic Department at Greenwich was to be an {{extension}} of his work using the electric telegraph. In particular, it was to transmit electric time signals to slave clocks and <b>time</b> <b>balls,</b> and to co-ordinate simultaneous astronomical or meteorological observations at multiple distant locations.|$|R
25|$|A {{bluestone}} lighthouse {{was built}} in 1849–50 to replace the original wooden one. It only operated as a lighthouse until 1860, when a Pile Light was built and anchored off Shelly Beach, after which it served as a <b>time</b> <b>ball</b> tower.|$|E
25|$|Above {{the clock}} is a gilt copper sphere, a <b>time</b> <b>ball</b> that rises up a mast every hour and falls on the hour.

25|$|At the <b>time</b> <b>Ball</b> {{returned}} to combat on 6 April 1917, the prototype was still unfinished – Ball was thus thwarted in {{his desire to}} fly the A.F.B.1 into combat, instead of the new Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5 {{of which he had}} been initially disparaging. Construction of the prototype was in fact not completed until after Ball's death; its first flight took place on 27 July 1917.|$|E

25|$|Ball {{arrived on}} home leave on 5 October 1916, prior to taking up duty in England. By this <b>time,</b> <b>Ball</b> had scored 31 aerial victories, and {{was by far}} the most famous pilot in the RFC. In {{addition}} to his contacts with Austins, he used his celebrity to contact Sir David Henderson, Director-General of Military Aeronautics about the proposed fighter; Ball subsequently also lobbied General Sefton Brancker.|$|E
25|$|The gardens {{were meant}} to {{increase}} the greenery around the Maltese Islands. They were also used for agricultural experimentation, and this resulted in {{the introduction of the}} potato crop which yielded greater revenue than cotton, Malta's primary agricultural export at the <b>time.</b> <b>Ball</b> also meant the gardens be used to freely provide farmers with seeds and shrubs, but this was not done and the gardens were not always well-maintained since the Luogotenenti were inexperienced with agricultural improvement.|$|E
25|$|Ball {{proceeded}} {{to spend a}} lot of money on new players who subsequently failed to live up to the reputations they had earned in the past. He also introduced a large batch of youngsters who were unable to cope with League football. At the end of the 1980–81 season, Blackpool were in the Fourth Division, the League's basement, for the first <b>time.</b> <b>Ball</b> had departed three months earlier, replaced by Allan Brown for his second stint in the Bloomfield Road hotseat. On 21 March 1981, Blackpool played their 3,000th match in the Football League. It occurred against Chesterfield at Saltergate.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of his death, <b>time</b> <b>balls</b> were in use on every {{inhabited}} continent. Although rendered obsolete on the introduction of radio time signals, operational examples survive atop the Royal Observatories at Greenwich and Cape Town, at Sydney Observatory, at Lyttelton in New Zealand, on Nelson's Monument on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, and at Deal.|$|R
50|$|<b>Time</b> <b>balls</b> {{were usually}} dropped at 1 p.m. (although in the United States they were dropped at noon). They were raised half way about 5 minutes earlier {{to alert the}} ships, then with 2-3 minutes to go they were raised the whole way. The time was {{recorded}} when the ball began descending, not when it reached the bottom.|$|R
5000|$|The group's only {{release was}} a single that did not come out until September 1971, by which <b>time</b> <b>Balls</b> had ceased to exist. The song [...] "Fight For My Country" [...] was an anti-war anthem {{composed}} and sung by Burton, and included backing vocals from Steve Gibbons and Denny Laine, who played bass guitar on the track.|$|R
25|$|The {{first half}} {{was full of}} incident, a volleyed shot on target from Nolberto Solano, a booking for Dietmar Hamann, and Teddy Sheringham {{replacing}} an injured Roy Keane all in the first eight minutes. Just over 90 seconds after the substitution, Manchester United took the lead. An incisive move, crafted first by Andy Cole then by Paul Scholes with a well-weighted first <b>time</b> <b>ball</b> allowed Sheringham to drift into the box and rifle a low drive under the Newcastle goalkeeper Steve Harper. Further chances fell to Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Cole and Sheringham in the first half, but all were unable to convert their efforts. Newcastle's best chance of the half fell to Hamann, a powerfully hit long-range effort just being diverted away from goal by Peter Schmeichel.|$|E
25|$|MiQuale Lewis {{rushed for}} 154yards {{and two touchdowns}} and Nate Davis passed for 300yards and two more touchdowns to lead Ball State past Akron 41–24. Lewis carried 28times and scored on runs of three and two yards. Davis {{completed}} 24of 36passes with one interception, throwing touchdown passes of 21yards to Briggs Orsbon and 25yards to Darius Hill. Chris Jacquemain completed 21of 44passes for 269yards and a 13-yard touchdown pass to Andre Jones, but was also intercepted off four times, three of them by Sean Baker. With the score tied at 10early in the second quarter, the Cardinals scored 21points on Lewis’ two touchdown and Baker’s 33yard return of a fumble. The victory marked the first <b>time</b> <b>Ball</b> State started the season 3–0 since 1988.|$|E
25|$|Later, a {{large house}} was {{constructed}} for the Commodore and St Georges Church (see St. George's Chapel, Chatham) was constructed. Once complete HMS Pembroke, housed a gunnery school (that {{had been moved}} from Sheerness), a new training centre, cinema, canteen, infirmary, gymnasium, swimming baths and a large parade ground and drill shed. A <b>time</b> <b>ball</b> was installed upon the central tower of the wardroom, this was dropped daily at 10am and 1pm except for Sundays giving the exact time to the ships on the Medway. Sundays would see all naval personnel attend the church parade, this entered the arch at {{the eastern end of}} the parade ground and then they marched past the central steps holding the Petty Officers and Master at Arms and then into the drill shed where they would 'fall out'.|$|E

50|$|Once the {{electric}} telegraph was in place, the observatory {{was able to}} control clocks and <b>time</b> <b>balls</b> at any place there was telegraphic connection.

500|$|The Times Square Ball is a <b>time</b> <b>ball</b> {{located in}} New York City's Times Square. Located {{on the roof}} of One Times Square, the ball is a {{prominent}} part of a New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square commonly referred to as the ball drop, where the ball descends [...] in 60 seconds down a specially designed flagpole, beginning at 11:59:00p.m. ET, and resting at midnight to signal the start of the new year. In recent years, the festivities have been preceded by live entertainment, including performances by musicians.|$|E
500|$|Instead of {{returning}} to combat after his leave, Ball was posted to instructional duties with No.34 (Reserve) Squadron RFC, based at Orford Ness, Suffolk. It was while serving {{on the home front}} {{that he was able to}} lobby for the building and testing of the Austin-Ball A.F.B.1 fighter. He hoped to be able to take an example of the type to France with him, but the prototype was not completed until after his death in action. In November he was invited to test fly the prototype of the new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 single-seat scout, apparently the first service pilot to do so. He was unimpressed, finding the heavier, more stable fighter less responsive to the controls than the Nieuports he was used to. His negative assessment of other aspects of the S.E.'s performance, on the other hand, contrasted markedly with the reactions of fellow pilots who tested the prototype about this <b>time.</b> <b>Ball</b> was to maintain his opinion of the S.E. as a [...] "dud", at least until he had scored several victories on the type after his return to France.|$|E
500|$|Jinks and Cohen {{involved}} Ball {{throughout the}} film's development, including casting and director selection. The producers met with about 20 interested directors, several {{of whom were}} considered [...] "A-list" [...] at the <b>time.</b> <b>Ball</b> was not keen on the more well-known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become [...] "nervous about the content". Nevertheless, the studio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert Zemeckis; neither accepted. In the same year, Mendes (then a theater director) revived the musical Cabaret in New York with fellow director Rob Marshall. Beth Swofford of the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for Mendes with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility. Mendes came across American Beauty {{in a pile of}} eight scripts at Swofford's house, and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make; early in his career, he had been inspired by how the film Paris, Texas(1984) presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in American Beauty, as well as parallels with his own childhood. Mendes later met with Spielberg; impressed by Mendes' productions of Oliver! and Cabaret, Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty.|$|E
