5|$|The first {{incarnation}} of the Doctor was portrayed by William Hartnell. During Hartnell's tenure, the episodes were a mixture of stories set on earth of <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>with</b> extraterrestrial influence, on alien planets, and in historical events without extraterrestrial influence, such as Marco Polo, one of the lost serials. In his last story, The Tenth Planet, the Doctor gradually grew weaker {{to the point of}} collapsing {{at the end of the}} fourth episode, leading to his regeneration.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes toward race in America {{began to}} change after the war, which had caused social and {{political}} upheaval and prompted {{people to think about}} <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>with</b> more ambition and confidence. Although progress was slow and racially motivated hostility continued for many years, the color barrier was broken in all major sports by 1950. Many of Motley and Willis's teammates on the Browns were used to playing with black players in college, where teams were integrated across most of the country. The presence of Motley and Willis, meanwhile, contributed to strong attendance at many of the Browns' early games as large black audiences came to watch them. By one estimate, 10,000 black fans saw the Browns play their first game.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>with</b> Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E

5|$|Wesley trains under Fox's leadership, {{learning}} endurance, knife {{fighting and}} {{hand to hand}} combat.He also learns to control and use his abilities for firearm marksmanship, including curving bullets around targets. Frustrated by his lack of progress and the brutality of the training, Wesley insists he is ready, but Sloan disagrees. Wesley refocuses on his training and starts to excel. Sloan then shows him the Loom of Fate, which has served for 1,000 years in giving coded names of Fraternity targets through errors in the fabric. The Loom identifies those who will create evil and chaos in <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>with</b> Sloan responsible for interpreting the code.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{resumption}} of competitive cricket, Tallon's chances of selection had improved due to the fates of his pre-war wicket-keeping rivals. Oldfield had long retired. Barnett, a captain in the army, had been a prisoner of the Japanese at Changi in Singapore for four years. Emaciated, he slowly recovered his fitness and forced his {{way back into the}} Victorian team, but was almost 40 and intended to retire in the near future. Walker had joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a gunner and was killed in a duel with Nazi fighter pilots over Soltau in Germany. This left Tallon as the front-runner, but there was a possibility that the selectors would opt for generational change and install a more youthful keeper like Gil Langley or Ron Saggers with an eye to <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> <b>With</b> the pressure of selection on his head, Tallon made eight dismissals in the first match after {{the resumption}} of cricket, against New South Wales in Brisbane, including three stumpings and three catches from the leg spin of Colin McCool, a future Test team-mate. The performance was to herald the start of a prolific bowler-wicket-keeper partnership. Tallon then scored 74 to guide Queensland to the target of 270 with four wickets in hand. Queensland won two of their seven matches and Tallon scored 305 runs at 30.50 and completed 27 dismissals to finally gain national selection.|$|E

UNLV launched its first comprehensive campaign, Invent <b>the</b> <b>Future,</b> <b>with</b> the goal of raising $500 million by December 2008.

25|$|Janus {{frequently}} symbolized {{change and}} transitions {{such as the}} progress of past to future, from one condition to another, from one vision to another, and young people's growth to adulthood.

Hence, Janus was worshipped at {{the beginnings of the}} harvest and planting times, as well as at marriages, deaths and other beginnings. He represented the middle ground between barbarism and civilization, rural and urban space, youth and adulthood. Having jurisdiction over beginnings Janus had an intrinsic association with omens and auspices.|$|E
