40|$|Cassida rubiginosa Müller (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), one of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} defoliators of <b>thistle</b> <b>weeds,</b> is capable of severely damaging thistle leaves; however, populations rarely reach sufficient density for effective thistle control under natural conditions. To investigate the impact of natural mortality factors on C. rubiginosa populations, life table studies were conducted between 1996 and 1998 in Kanazawa, Japan. Egg mortality, mortality in early larvae, and lost fertility contributed strongly to total generational mortality in every year studied. Egg mortality was primarily attributable to parasitism by wasps of the genus Anaphes, and the impact of predation and egg inviability was small. Mortality factors that affected the larval and pupal stages were largely unknown. Under field conditions, females only realized approximately 8. 1 - 13. 7 % of their potential fecundity, varying from 36. 0 to 61. 4 eggs per individual. Since annual changes in lost fertility exhibited a similar pattern to those in generational mortality, fertility loss might be the key factor driving C. rubiginosa populations. These results suggest that reproduction is the most important process that determines the level and fluctuation of the C. rubiginosa population. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology...|$|R
25|$|Elements {{of concern}} to the area are fire, over- or under-grazing, native species reintroduction, human {{recreational}} (camping and hunting) and educational/scientific use, resource exploration, linear development, and invasive species. Invasive species, primarily weeds, are a significant threat that crowd out native plant species and reduce habitat and food sources for native animals, birds, fish, and insects. Weeds are quick colonizers that often move into an area disturbed by fire or human activity. Linear developments such as roads, pipelines, and powerlines often provide a vector for invasive species to enter new areas. Because of their rapid and opportunistic spread, weeds also often lack the deep root system of native plants and thus contribute to bank instability and soil erosion. The nodding <b>thistle</b> <b>weed</b> (Carduus nutans) was discovered {{in the area in}} 2006. Several other weed species have been found in the natural area, including the highly aggressive downy brome (Bromus tectorum), creeping meadow foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceus), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Several of these species have invaded from across the U.S. border into Canada. Formerly utilized as a reclamation species, crested wheatgrass has had detrimental effects on soil and grazing. Russian olive, imported as a soil stabilizer, windbreak, and ornamental, reduces biodiversity of riparian areas.|$|R

Weed Control in New CRP Seedings Successful perennial forage establishment depends on the presence of adequate soil water for seed germination and seedling emergence. Weeds can quickly deplete soil moisture and must be controlled to allow grass and legume seedlings to germinate and emerge. In addition, rapidly growing, uncontrolled weeds can form a canopy which shades slower growing desirable plants. Weeds must be controlled on CRP acres to reduce the risks of seeding failure and eliminate possible reseeding costs. Several herbicides have been labeled for use on CRP situations...|$|R

When assayed on different weedy plants, agropyrenol showed a strong phytotoxic activity, agropyrenale was less active, while agropyrenone was inactive. Six derivatives obtained by chemical modifications of agropyrenol were assayed for phytotoxic, antimicrobial and zootoxic activities, and the structure-activity relationships were examined. Both the double bond and the diol system of the 3, 4 -dihydroxypentenyl side chain, {{as well as the}} aldehyde group at C- 6 and C- 1 of the phenolic ring of agropyrenol proved to be important for the phytotoxicity. A new phytotoxic geranylcyclohexentriol, named phomentrioloxin, was isolated from the liquid culture of Phomopsis sp., a fungal pathogen proposed for the biological control of Carthamus lanatus, a widespread and troublesome <b>thistle</b> <b>weed</b> belonging to the Asteraceae family causing severe crop and pastures losses in Australia. Seven derivatives obtained by chemical modifications of the toxin were assayed for phytotoxic, antimicrobial and zootoxic activities, and the structure-activity relationships were examined.

40|$|Carthamus lanatus L. ssp. lanatus (common name: saffron thistle) is a {{widespread}} winter-growing annual <b>thistle</b> <b>weed</b> belonging to the Asteraceae family causing severe crop and pasture losses in Australia. Introduced from the Mediterranean region it is considered the most economically important thistle species in New South Wales (1). Among the numerous pathogens isolated from naturally infected saffron thistle plants, strains of Phomopsis sp. were considered suitable as potential mycoherbicides for its biological control (2). Recently the teleomorph of this pathogen was classified as Diaporthe gulyae by morphological, genetics and phytopathological studies (3). More recently, a {{study carried out on}} the bioactive metabolites of this fungus led to the isolation of the main phytotoxin produced in liquid culture, identified as a new geranylhydroquinone and named phomentrioloxin (1). The structure of 1 was determined by spectroscopic, X-ray, and chemical methods as (1 R, 2 R, 3 R, 4 R) - 3 -methoxy- 6 -(7 -methyl- 3 -methylene-oct- 6 -en- 1 -ynyl) -cyclohex- 5 -ene- 1, 2, 4 -triol (4). Considering the novelty of this compound, a study on the structure-activity relationships was then carried out by preparing seven derivatives obtained by chemical modifications of the main functional groups of the toxin. Moreover, recently two pathogenic species related to D. gulyae, identified as Diaporthe kochmanii sp. nov. and Diaporthe kongii sp. nov. and isolated from diseased sunflower in Australia were also considered for the production of bioactive metabolites. Strains of the three species were grown in both liquid and solid media and their metabolic profiles were compared. In this communication the results of structure-activity relationship study on phomentrioloxin will be discussed. Furthermore, the preliminary data on the chemical and biological characterization of the metabolites isolated from the three species of Diaporthe will be illustrated. (1) BRIESE, D. T. Plant.

No ordinary plough will travel over this frozen sea, let along that everywhere chunks of timber, horrible tangles of rusting wire, jagged fragments of big shells, and a great number of unexploded shells are entangled in the mess. Often this chaos is stained bright yellow by high explosives, and across it run the twisting trenches and communication trenches eight, ten, or twelve feet deep. These will become water pits and mud pits into which beasts will fall. It is incredible that there should be crops from any of this region of the push for many years to come.

We conducted an intensive mark-recapture study from 1996 to 1999 in Yuwaku, Kanazawa, Japan, to estimate adult population parameters such as population size, longevity, movement activity, reproductive rate, and winter survival. Overwintered adults began to emerge from hibernation in early April and actively moved among host plants until early May. Thereafter, adult dispersal activity decreased until late June, {{and the number of}} beetles gradually declined. New adults were active for only 2 to 3 wk after emergence and began aestivation at the end of August. Despite low reproductive rates per generation, the overwintering population was stable at a high density. Beetle longevity was substantial, and many individuals overwintered more than once. The age structure of adult beetles was responsible for the high stability of the population and low reproductive rate. © 2006 Entomological Society of America...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{described in}} this thesis were designed to assess changes in pasture dynamics (biomass and species composition of pasture) of grazing land on the Southern Tablelands of ACT and NSW, after 16 combinations of rabbit control treatments had been applied. The rabbit control performed by CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology consisted of all combinations of presence-absence of Poisoning (using sodium monofluoroacetate, 1080 : POIS), Ripping (ripping warrens using a tractor fitted with ripping tynes: RIP), Fumigation (pressure fumigation using chloropicrin: FUM) and repeated follow-up fumigation (using phostoxin pellets one, six and eighteen months after completion of the initial treatment: ANN). The pasture was assessed before treatments were applied, and every six months after rabbit control treatments. Treatment combinations were assigned randomly in a 24 factorial design on a total of 32 sites. There was a significant increase of pasture biomass at the RIP+ANN treatment at post-treatment sample 5. The analysis of covariance did not detect any other significant increase or decrease of pasture biomass for any rabbit control treatment, at any posttreatment sample. A significant increase of grass species occurred for the treatments of POIS+RIP+FUM, POIS and RIP+ANN for the post-treatment samples of 1, 3 and 5 respectively. There was a significant increase of thistles at the rabbit control treatments of POIS+RIP+FUM+ANN (post-treatment sample 1), RIP, ANN, RIP+FUM, RIP+FUM+ANN and POIS+RIP+FUM+ANN (post-treatment sample 3) and RIP and FUM+ANN (post-treatment sample 5). A significant increase of weeds occurred at FUM (post-treatment sample 3) and at FUM+ANN (post-treatment sample 5). No {{significant changes in the}} amount of herbs or legumes was apparent for any rabbit control treatment or post-treatment sample. There were no significant decreases for any species group. Except for the significant results for post-treatment sample 1, all significant increases of biomass for any species group occurred during spring (post-treatment sample 3 and 5) which suggests a growth phase during spring then subsequent dieback (particularly for <b>thistles</b> and <b>weeds),</b> as any change was not detected in the following autumn sample. No strong trend is evident for any particular rabbit control treatments, or any combination of treatments. Analysis of covariance revealed that the rabbit control treatment of RIP+ANN showed significant increases in both total biomass of pasture and grass biomass during post-treatment sample 5. This treatment reduced the number of active entrances the most. Significant positive correlations were found between pasture biomass (total) with grass, herb, legume, <b>thistle</b> and <b>weed</b> species groups. Significant negative correlations between grass biomass and the number of active entrances were found when the rabbit control had been highly effective in reducing the number of active entrances. When rabbit control had not been very successful, there was a significant positive but low correlation with the number of active entrances. There was no significant relationship between the number of active entrances with the weight of rabbit dung pellets. It is reasoned that they are different measures of rabbit abundance. More rabbit dung pellets were found closer to the warren than further away from the warren, but there was no correlation between rabbit dung and pasture biomass. Rainfall was above average for most of the experiment, biomass increased accordingly, and rabbit control was highly successful. The resulting changes in the pasture were difficult to detect, although some increases in species composition groups occurred. It is reasoned that the changes observed are partly attributable to seasonal conditions, and to high rainfall. Grazing by domestic animals, sheep and cattle, had been found to be consistent throughout the experiment...|$|R

40|$|Milk thistle (Silybum marianum L. Gaertn.) is {{the most}} {{researched}} plant {{for the treatment of}} liver disease. Its therapeutic properties are due to the presence of silymarin, a mixture of three flavonolignans (silybin, silydianin and silycristin). The seeds contain the highest amount of silymarin, but the whole plant is used medicinally. Milk thistle is grown successfully on a range of soil types, from sandy soils to much heavier clay soils. Milk thistle is directly seeded in soils. Sowing occurs in autumn and spring, and row spacing is usually 40 - 75 cm, with 20 - 30 cm between plants in the row. Nutrient requirements of this crop are low to moderate since it is adapted to poor quality soils and many different growing conditions. A limiting factor in milk <b>thistle</b> production is <b>weed</b> interference. Pendimethalin and metribuzin herbicides are safe for weed control in milk thistle, both alone and in combination. Milk thistle is considered drought resistant and normal rainfall will often suffice. In a Mediterranean environment, under severe drought conditions, the crops should be irrigated during seed growth and filling. Moreover, a few varieties of milk thistle have been developed. The silymarin content most often ranges from 1. 0 % to 3. 0 % of achene dry matter but can exceed 8 %. Efforts should be made to develop varieties with high silymarin content. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Effects of 3 different farm types (with lifestock raising, stockless farming with rotational set-aside, stockless farming only cash crops) combined with 4 tillage treatments (mouldboard plough, two-layer-plough, reduced tillage depth and tillage without plough) on plants, soil and environment have been investigated. This article presents results on the coverage rate of arable wild plants (weed coverage), the range of weed species, the abundance of C. arvense (L.) Scop.

In stockless organic farming without alfalfa-grass in the crop rotation Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.

The situation was agreeable, being an angle formed by the stream, bearing three or four large sycamore trees, which were in full leaf, and served to relieve the dark appearance of the mansion, which was built of a deep red stone. The house itself was a large one, but was now obviously too big for the inmates; several windows were built up, especially those which opened from the lower story; others were blockaded in a less substantial manner. The court before the door, which had once been defended with a species of low outer-wall, now ruinous, was paved, but the stones were completely covered with long gray nettles, <b>thistles,</b> and other <b>weeds,</b> which, shooting up betwixt the flags, had displaced many of them from their level.

I looked, and saw between us and the sun A building on an island; such a one As age to age might add, for uses vile, [...] 100 A windowless, deformed and dreary pile; And on the top an open tower, where hung A bell, which in the radiance swayed and swung; We could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue: The broad sun sunk behind it, and it tolled [...] 105 In strong and black relief.--'What we behold Shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower,' Said Maddalo, 'and ever at this hour Those who may cross the water, hear that bell Which calls the maniacs, each one from his cell, [...] 110 To vespers.'--'As much skill as need to pray In thanks or hope for their dark lot have they To their stern maker,' I replied. 'O ho! You talk as in years past,' said Maddalo. ''Tis strange men change not. You were ever still [...] 115 Among Christ's flock a perilous infidel, A wolf for the meek lambs--if you can't swim Beware of Providence.' I looked on him, But the gay smile had faded in his eye. 'And such,'--he cried, 'is our mortality, [...] 120 And this must be the emblem and the sign Of what should be eternal and divine!-- And like that black and dreary bell, the soul, Hung in a heaven-illumined tower, must toll Our thoughts and our desires to meet below [...] 125 Round the rent heart and pray--as madmen do For what? they know not,--till the night of death As sunset that strange vision, severeth Our memory from itself, and us from all We sought and yet were baffled.' I recall [...] 130 The sense of what he said, although I mar The force of his expressions. The broad star Of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill, And the black bell became invisible, And the red tower looked gray, and all between [...] 135 The churches, ships and palaces were seen Huddled in gloom;--into the purple sea The orange hues of heaven sunk silently. We hardly spoke, and soon the gondola Conveyed me to my lodging by the way. [...] 140 The following morn was rainy, cold, and dim: Ere Maddalo arose, I called on him, And whilst I waited with his child I played; A lovelier toy sweet Nature never made; A serious, subtle, wild, yet gentle being, [...] 145 Graceful without design and unforeseeing, With eyes--Oh speak not of her eyes!--which seem Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven, yet gleam With such deep meaning, as we never see But in the human countenance: with me [...] 150 She was a special favourite: I had nursed Her fine and feeble limbs when she came first To this bleak world; and she yet seemed to know On second sight her ancient playfellow, Less changed than she was by six months or so; [...] 155 For after her first shyness was worn out We sate there, rolling billiard balls about, When the Count entered. Salutations past-- 'The word you spoke last night might well have cast A darkness on my spirit--if man be [...] 160 The passive thing you say, I should not see Much harm in the religions and old saws (Tho' I may never own such leaden laws) Which break a teachless nature to the yoke: Mine is another faith.'--thus much I spoke [...] 165 And noting he replied not, added: 'See This lovely child, blithe, innocent and free; She spends a happy time with little care, While we to such sick thoughts subjected are As came on you last night. It is our will [...] 170 That thus enchains us to permitted ill-- We might be otherwise--we might be all We dream of happy, high, majestical. Where is the love, beauty, and truth we seek, But in our mind? and if we were not weak [...] 175 Should we be less in deed than in desire?' 'Ay, if we were not weak--and we aspire How vainly to be strong!' said Maddalo: 'You talk Utopia.' 'It remains to know,' I then rejoined, 'and those who try may find [...] 180 How strong the chains are which our spirit bind; Brittle perchance as straw...We are assured Much may be conquered, much may be endured, Of what degrades and crushes us. We know That we have power over ourselves to do [...] 185 And suffer--what, we know not till we try; But something nobler than to live and die-- So taught those kings of old philosophy Who reigned, before Religion made men blind; And those who suffer with their suffering kind [...] 190 Yet feel their faith, religion.' 'My dear friend,' Said Maddalo, 'my judgement will not bend To your opinion, though I think you might Make such a system refutation-tight As far as words go. I knew one like you [...] 195 Who to this city came some months ago, With whom I argued in this sort, and he Is now gone mad,--and so he answered me,-- Poor fellow! but if you would like to go, We'll visit him, and his wild talk will show [...] 200 How vain are such aspiring theories.' 'I hope to prove the induction otherwise, And that a want of that true theory, still, Which seeks a [...] "soul of goodness" [...] in things ill Or in himself or others, has thus bowed [...] 205 His being--there are some by nature proud, Who patient in all else demand but this-- To love and be beloved with gentleness; And being scorned, what wonder if they die Some living death? this is not destiny [...] 210 But man's own wilful ill.' As thus I spoke Servants announced the gondola, and we Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea Sailed to the island where the madhouse stands. We disembarked. The clap of tortured hands, [...] 215 Fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen, And laughter where complaint had merrier been, Moans, shrieks, and curses, and blaspheming prayers Accosted us. We climbed the oozy stairs Into an old courtyard. I heard on high, [...] 220 Then, fragments of most touching melody, But looking up saw not the singer there-- Through the black bars in the tempestuous air I saw, like weeds on a wrecked palace growing, Long tangled locks flung wildly forth, and flowing, [...] 225 Of those who on a sudden were beguiled Into strange silence, and looked forth and smiled Hearing sweet sounds. Then I: 'Methinks there were A cure of these with patience and kind care, If music can thus move...but what is he [...] 230 Whom we seek here?' 'Of his sad history I know but this,' said Maddalo: 'he came To Venice a dejected man, and fame Said he was wealthy, or he had been so; Some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe; [...] 235 But he was ever talking in such sort As you do--far more sadly--he seemed hurt, Even as a man with his peculiar wrong, To hear but of the oppression of the strong, Or those absurd deceits (I think with you [...] 240 In some respects, you know) which carry through The excellent impostors of this earth When they outface detection--he had worth, Poor fellow! but a humorist in his way'-- 'Alas, what drove him mad?' 'I cannot say: [...] 245 A lady came with him from France, and when She left him and returned, he wandered then About yon lonely isles of desert sand Till he grew wild--he had no cash or land Remaining,--the police had brought him here-- [...] 250 Some fancy took him and he would not bear Removal; so I fitted up for him Those rooms beside the sea, to please his whim, And sent him busts and books and urns for flowers, Which had adorned his life in happier hours, [...] 255 And instruments of music--you may guess A stranger could do little more or less For one so gentle and unfortunate: And those are his sweet strains which charm the weight From madmen's chains, and make this Hell appear [...] 260 A heaven of sacred silence, hushed to hear.'-- 'Nay, this was kind of you--he had no claim, As the world says'--'None--but the very same Which I on all mankind were I as he Fallen to such deep reverse;--his melody [...] 265 Is interrupted--now we hear the din Of madmen, shriek on shriek, again begin; Let us now visit him; after this strain He ever communes with himself again, And sees nor hears not any.' Having said [...] 270 These words, we called the keeper, and he led To an apartment opening on the sea-- There the poor wretch was sitting mournfully Near a piano, his pale fingers twined One with the other, and the ooze and wind [...] 275 Rushed through an open casement, and did sway His hair, and starred it with the brackish spray; His head was leaning on a music book, And he was muttering, and his lean limbs shook; His lips were pressed against a folded leaf [...] 280 In hue too beautiful for health, and grief Smiled in their motions as they lay apart-- As one who wrought from his own fervid heart The eloquence of passion, soon he raised His sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed [...] 285 And spoke--sometimes as one who wrote, and thought His words might move some heart that heeded not, If sent to distant lands: and then as one Reproaching deeds never to be undone With wondering self-compassion; then his speech [...] 290 Was lost in grief, and then his words came each Unmodulated, cold, expressionless,-- But that from one jarred accent you might guess It was despair made them so uniform: And all the while the loud and gusty storm [...] 295 Hissed through the window, and we stood behind Stealing his accents from the envious wind Unseen. I yet remember what he said Distinctly: such impression his words made.|$|R
