The transcripts of these recordings had been released in 1998 (within days of the crash), but the TSB had refused to release the audio on privacy grounds. The TSB argued that under Canada's Access to Information Act and Privacy Act, the audio recordings constituted personal information and were thus not disclosable. Canada's Federal Court of Appeal rejected this argument in 2006 in a legal proceeding concerned with air <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> recordings in four other air accidents. The Supreme Court of Canada did not grant leave to appeal that decision and consequently the TSB released {{a copy of the}} Swissair 111 air <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> audio recordings to the Canadian Press, which had requested the recordings under the Access to Information Act.

40|$|The {{regional}} {{travel demand}} models are generally macroscopic {{in nature and}} do not include <b>traffic</b> <b>controls</b> in the <b>traffic</b> assignment process. In travel demand models, the road capacities are kept fixed within the functional classification of roadways and free-flow-speeds are adjusted to accommodate the impacts of <b>traffic</b> <b>controls</b> and <b>traffic</b> operations. Part of the reason this approach is adopted in travel demand models is there macroscopic application, where the focus is extensively on the region wide results for transportation planning. While there are advantages in using this approach, the cost is usually paid in “lost capacity on projects” due {{to the absence of}} traffic operations in modeling; more precisely the absence of <b>traffic</b> <b>controls</b> tend to present partially skewed output from the travel models. Combined <b>Traffic</b> Assignment and <b>Control</b> models can address this issue by including the impacts of <b>traffic</b> <b>controls</b> in the modeling process. This paper evaluates the benefits of combined <b>traffic</b> assignment and <b>control</b> modeling framework implemented on a regional scale compared to a traditional four step regional travel demand model. The study quantifies the benefits in terms of providing network travel time information to drivers to make route choice in comparison to improving the <b>traffic</b> <b>controls</b> on a large regional network (on a mesoscopic level). Several experiments were performed on a study area using Static Traffic Assignment (STA) and Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) with fixed and vehicle-actuated controls. The study area network is a regional transportation network for the Wasatch Front Region in Utah. The results suggest that if implemented on regional travel models, the CTAC framework can help reduce the VMT and reduce regional delays by over 6 %. Further studies are needed to expand on this idea with multimodal modeling and testing on other regional networks...|$|R

5|$|The {{evidence}} {{collected during}} this investigation strongly supports {{the conclusion that}} this accident was caused by N600XL and GOL1907 following ATC clearances which directed them to operate in opposite directions on the same airway at the same altitude resulting in a midair collision.

5|$|The {{aircraft}} made a stop-over at Namsos, where sixteen of {{the passengers}} disembarked.

The aircraft departed Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim Air <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> Center (ATCC) at 20:13 to receive permission to ascend to flight level 90 (FL 90), which was received. During the flight, the passenger in the jump seat held a conversation with the captain and asked several questions regarding the operations.

40|$|Adaptive <b>traffic</b> signal <b>control,</b> which adjusts <b>traffic</b> {{signal timing}} {{according}} to real-time traffic, {{has been shown}} to be an effective method to reduce traffic congestion. Available works on adaptive <b>traffic</b> signal <b>control</b> make responsive <b>traffic</b> signal <b>control</b> decisions based on human-crafted features (e. g. vehicle queue length). However, human-crafted features are abstractions of raw traffic data (e. g., position and speed of vehicles), which ignore some useful traffic information and lead to suboptimal <b>traffic</b> signal <b>controls.</b> In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that automatically extracts all useful features (machine-crafted features) from raw real-time traffic data and learns the optimal policy for adaptive <b>traffic</b> signal <b>control.</b> To improve algorithm stability, we adopt experience replay and target network mechanisms. Simulation results show that our algorithm reduces vehicle delay by up to 47 % and 86 % when compared to another two popular <b>traffic</b> signal <b>control</b> algorithms, longest queue first algorithm and fixed time control algorithm, respectively.
