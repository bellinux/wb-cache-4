40|$|Collegiate {{and elite}} female athletes have been {{identified}} as a subpopulation at heightened risk for disordered eating and pathogenic weight management practices. It was hypothesized that this increases risk may be related to sport specific pressures (such as team conducted weigh-ins), or the use and frequency of self-weighing. It appears that mandatory, team conducted weigh-ins are not salient to female athletes in regards to experiencing internalization, body image concerns, dietary restraint, negative affect, and bulimic symptomatology. Results, however, indicate that frequency of engagement in self-weighing may be influential in the engagement of disordered eating symptoms. Specifically, athletes who weighed themselves <b>three</b> or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> per week reported significantly more internalization of general societal ideals and athletic body ideals. For body image concerns, athletes who weighed <b>three</b> or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> per week reported being more concerned with their body size/shape than all others. With respect to dietary behaviors, athletes who weighed themselves <b>three</b> or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> per week reported engaging in significantly more caloric restriction than did those who weighed less frequently. For negative affect, the athletes who weighed themselves <b>three</b> or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> per week reported significantly higher levels of both anger and guilt. Finally for bulimic symptomatology, athletes who weighed themselves <b>three</b> or <b>more</b> <b>times</b> a week had significantly higher levels than those who weighed once or twice or not at all...|$|R

In total he scored 44 goals in 57 appearances for England. He is in fourth place on the all-time list of England goalscorers, behind Wayne Rooney, Bobby Charlton and Gary Lineker.

5|$|A {{businessman}} and part-time Citizen Forces officer before the war, Leane was commissioned into the AIF and led {{a company of}} the 11th Infantry Battalion at the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April 1915. He rose to temporarily command his battalion, and was made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), awarded the Military Cross, twice mentioned in despatches and wounded three times during the Gallipoli Campaign. After returning to Egypt, the AIF was re-organised, and Leane was appointed as the commanding officer of the newly formed 48th Battalion, which soon after was transported to the Western Front in France and Belgium. Important battles that the 48th were involved in under his command included the Battle of Pozières in 1916, and the First Battle of Bullecourt and First Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. During the latter battle, he was severely wounded. During 1916–1917, he was mentioned in despatches <b>three</b> <b>more</b> <b>times,</b> was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and awarded a bar to his DSO.|$|E

5|$|Captain Benaud retired {{at the end}} of the South Africa serieshe {{had already}} relinquished the {{leadership}} after the First Testand Booth was elevated to the vice-captaincy under Bob Simpson for the 1964 tour of England. Along with Simpson and Lawry, Booth was one of three on-tour selectors. Some observers felt that the personable Booth would have been more popular among the playing group than Simpson, while others thought that he would not have been hard-nosed enough in pursuing his team's competitive interest. While Simpson was known for being relentlessly hard-nosed, he was also abrasive and sometimes irritated others by making derogatory comments towards teammates. Booth again ran daily fitness classes during the voyage, and on this occasion, Simpson made them compulsory for the players. Booth started the tour well, scoring 109 not out in his third match for the summer, against Surrey. He passed 50 <b>three</b> <b>more</b> <b>times</b> before the start of the Tests, when his form waned.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Operation Maslenica, RSK president Goran Hadžić ordered the ARSK to retrieve its tanks from UN storage in Sector West and attack Nova Gradiška and Novska. When local RSK authorities (led by Veljko Džakula in Sector West) demanded {{an explanation of}} the order from Hadžić, he said that the Croatian forces were about to attack Okučani. On 26 January Zabala met with Džakula in Okučani and reassured him that the UNPROFOR would protect Sector West from a Croatian attack, agreeing to provide the RSK with a written guarantee to that effect. Although Hadžić accepted the assurance and cancelled the attack, the orders were reinstated and cancelled <b>three</b> <b>more</b> <b>times</b> over the next two days. On 7 February, Canadian troops drilled the deck of the bridge spanning the Strug Channel (north of Stara Gradiška) to place demolition charges. The move was protested by RSK authorities, who saw the route (the only link between Okučani and Serb-controlled territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina) as crucial to an evacuation {{in the event of an}} anticipated Croatian attack. The situation calmed down by mid-February, and the HV did not attack Sector West.|$|E
5|$|Most of what {{is known}} about their {{marriage}} comes from an account Mao gave to the American reporter Edgar Snow in 1936, which Snow included in his book Red Star Over China. According to Mao, he and Luo Yixiu were the subject of an arranged marriage organised by their respective fathers, Mao Yichang and Luo Helou. Luo was eighteen and Mao just fourteen {{years old at the time}} of their betrothal. Although Mao took part in the wedding ceremony, he later stated that he was unhappy with the marriage, never consummating it and refusing to live with his wife. Socially disgraced, she lived with Mao's parents for two years until she died of dysentery, while he moved out of the village to continue his studies elsewhere, eventually becoming a founding member of the Communist Party of China. Various biographers have suggested that Mao's experience of this marriage affected his later views, leading him to become a critic of arranged marriage and a vocal feminist. He would marry <b>three</b> <b>more</b> <b>times</b> throughout his life, to Yang Kaihui, He Zizhen and Jiang Qing, the last of whom was better known as Madame Mao.|$|E

5|$|The Lipizzans endured several wartime relocations {{throughout}} their history, {{each of which}} saved the breed from extinction. The first was in March 1797 during the War of the First Coalition, when the horses were evacuated from Lipica. During the journey, 16 mares gave birth to foals. In November 1797, the horses returned to Lipica, but the stables were in ruins. They were rebuilt, but in 1805, the horses were evacuated again when Napoleon invaded Austria. They remained away from the stud for two years, returning April 1, 1807. But then, following the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809, the horses were evacuated <b>three</b> <b>more</b> <b>times</b> during the unsettled period that followed, resulting {{in the loss of}} many horses and the destruction of the written studbooks that documented bloodlines of horses prior to 1700.

5|$|While {{military}} {{efforts were}} directed to the East, the situation in Italy took {{a turn for the}} worse. Under their respective kings Ildibad and Eraric (both murdered in 541) and especially Totila, the Ostrogoths made quick gains. After a victory at Faenza in 542, they reconquered the major cities of Southern Italy and soon held almost the entire peninsula. Belisarius was sent back to Italy late in 544, but lacked sufficient troops. Making no headway, he was relieved of his command in 548. Belisarius succeeded in defeating a Gothic fleet with 200 ships. During this period the city of Rome changed hands <b>three</b> <b>more</b> <b>times,</b> first taken and depopulated by the Ostrogoths in December 546, then reconquered by the Byzantines in 547, and then again by the Goths in January 550.
