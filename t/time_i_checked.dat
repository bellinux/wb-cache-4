Any delays in executing the required actions were measured, but the main focus was the distribution of time checks over each of the periods. Two small groups, whose mean ages were 22 and 66 years, took part in the study. The overall time-monitoring strategy was found to conform to the following relation: c = 2 exp (t-i) /s, where c was the rank of a time check, and t the total time elapsed thus far. According to this function, after some initial waiting <b>time</b> (<b>i),</b> the <b>checks</b> occurred at gradually narrower time intervals, each check taking place after a constant proportion s/(d-i) of the time left. While most participants in both groups followed this rule, some of them exhibited stronger or weaker forms of the strategy, i. e., forms where the rate of time checking increased either faster or more slowly than the standard function predicts.

MacKenzie dismissed those accusations as [...] "crap" [...] and [...] "insulting" [...] to the Canadian military, while he viewed the denial by the Canadian military as credible. Amir Attaran, a law professor and lawyer for Malgarai disagreed with Mackenzie, arguing that instead of comparing credibility, the military must release the records of detainee interrogations to Parliament, so that Parliament may determine what occurred, based upon the available facts. According to Attaran, it is a legal requirement that the documents regarding detainee interrogations be produced, while they need not be made public.

Students spat on Sierra's mother's car at Sissonville High, and her friends' parents wouldn't give her rides home from school. Threats, taunting, jeering by her fellow students escalated into physical assaults, and Sierra's mother pulled her out of school; the threats would ultimately cause Sierra to move out of the town. Sierra voiced her belief that people at Sissonville High were permitted to talk about how they felt about certain things, so long as there were others who agreed with them.
