Other non-aromatic aminocarbenes with O, S and P atoms adjacent (i.e. alpha) to the carbene centre have been prepared, e.g. thio- and oxy-iminium based carbenes have been characterised by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
25|$|Thiazoles {{are members}} of the azoles, heterocycles that include imidazoles and oxazoles. <b>Thiazole</b> can also be {{considered}} a functional group. Oxazoles are related compounds, with sulfur replaced by oxygen. Thiazoles are structurally similar to imidazoles, with the <b>thiazole</b> sulfur replaced by nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{thiamine}} antagonists are heat-stable and {{occur as}} both the ortho- and para-hydroxyphenols. Some examples of these antagonists are caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and tannic acid. These compounds interact with the thiamine to oxidize the <b>thiazole</b> ring, thus rendering it unable to be absorbed. Two flavonoids, quercetin and rutin, have also been implicated as thiamine antagonists.|$|E

25|$|Complex {{thiamine}} biosynthesis {{occurs in}} bacteria, some protozoans, plants, and fungi. The <b>thiazole</b> and pyrimidine moieties are biosynthesized separately and then combined to form ThMP by {{the action of}} thiamine-phosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.3). The biosynthetic pathways may differ among organisms. In E. coli and other enterobacteriaceae, ThMP may be phosphorylated to the cofactor ThDP by a thiamine-phosphate kinase (ThMP + ATP → ThDP + ADP, EC 2.7.4.16). In most bacteria and in eukaryotes, ThMP is hydrolyzed to thiamine, which may then be pyrophosphorylated to ThDP by thiamine diphosphokinase (thiamine + ATP → ThDP + AMP, EC 2.7.6.2).|$|E
25|$|The first {{lipophilic}} thiamine derivative to {{be discovered}} was allithiamine, which was isolated from garlic (Allium sativum) in 1951. Allithiamine is an allyl disulfide derivative. After the discovery of allithiamine, several additional derivatives were synthesized {{with the hope that}} they would have better pharmacokinetic properties than thiamine. Thiamine is unable to diffuse across plasma membranes because it has a positively charged <b>thiazole</b> moiety. Instead, it must be transported across plasma membranes by high affinity carriers, and the rate of transport is low. Sulbutiamine overcomes the poor oral bioavailability of thiamine because it is highly lipophilic. The synthesis of sulbutiamine was reported by Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Among the cephalophines, {{members of}} the Philantomba and Sylvicapra genera are all solitary animals which display {{territorial}} behavior and have well developed preorbital glands. Maxwell's duiker (Philantomba maxwellii) is a solitary animal which utilizes preorbital gland secretions to mark its territory. This behavior is observed most in adult males, less frequently in females, and less still in subadults of this species. Secretions from the preorbital gland of the common duiker contain at least 33 different chemical compounds. Two <b>thiazole</b> compounds and an epoxy ketone are present in significantly higher concentrations in male than in female secretions, suggesting that they could serve as sex recognition cues.|$|E
