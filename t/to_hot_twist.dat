40|$|We solve a <b>hot</b> <b>twisted</b> Eguchi-Kawai {{model with}} only timelike {{plaquettes}} in the deconfined phase, by computing the quadratic quantum fluctuations around the classical vacuum. The {{solution of the}} model has some novel features: the eigenvalues of the time-like link variable are separated in L bunches, if L {{is the number of}} links of the original lattice in the time direction, and each bunch obeys a Wigner semicircular distribution of eigenvalues. This solution becomes unstable at a critical value of the coupling constant, where it is argued that a condensation of classical solutions takes place. This can be inferred by comparison with the heat-kernel model in the hamiltonian limit, and the related Douglas-Kazakov phase transition in QCD 2. As a byproduct of our solution, we can reproduce the dependence of the coupling constant from the parameter describing the asymmetry of the lattice, in agreement with previous results by Karsch. ...|$|R

Soil bacteria and fauna were affected negatively by increased temperature in both light and dark crusts, and with movement from cool <b>to</b> <b>hot</b> and <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> <b>hotter</b> desert climates. Crust microbial biomass and relative abundance of diazotrophs was reduced greatly after one year, even in pots that were not moved from their original location, although no change in diazotroph community structure was observed. Populations of soil fauna moved from cool <b>to</b> <b>hot</b> deserts were affected more negatively than those moved from <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> <b>hotter</b> deserts...|$|R

Because of that technological transvarestraint test was performed in the study. Test simulates strains that form in the material during welding. Transvarestraint test enables the assessment of susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>hot</b> cracking and resistance <b>to</b> <b>hot</b> cracking characterized by cracking threshold (εp) and critical strain speed (CSS). Performed investigations enabled to characterize the phenomena occurring in Inconel 617 during welds crystallization, which are important for engineers selecting the joining technology of Inconel 617...|$|R

40|$|Orientation imaging {{microscopy}} (OIM) {{was performed}} on <b>hot</b> <b>twisted</b> polycrystalline 304 stainless steel specimens in order to study the characteristics of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in low stacking fault energy FCC metals. Microtexture analyses were carried out and the misorientation statistics of the recrystallized areas were derived. The results revealed that multiple twinning controls the formation of new orientations. DRX macrotextures were also measured in torsion and compression. These textures are highly sensitive to the deformation (Zener-Hollomon) parameter Z. High Z values lead to overall textures controlled by nucleation, whereas, at low Z values, selective growth is more predominant. A deformation and recrystallization model based on the OIM measurements and the steady state properties is proposed. The observed strong brass-type deformation textures were simulated by introducing self hardening coefficients. The transition from single to multiple-peak flow during DRX was investigated, together with {{the evolution of the}} grain size distribution. In particular, the effect of twinning on the evolution of the latter was simulated. Finally, it is shown that the model simulates texture development during DRX very well...|$|R

40|$|ZRE 1 alloy with {{addition}} of Zn, Zr and {{rare earth elements}} is gravity casted to sand casting moulds, and is used mainly in aerospace and automotive industries. Magnesium alloy castings often have defects, such as misruns and micro-shrinkage. This defects are repaired with welding and overlay welding techniques.

The paper intends to evaluate susceptibility of magnesium alloys <b>to</b> <b>hot</b> cracking and examine influence of heat treatment on cracking of the ZRE 1 magnesium alloy with {{addition of}} zinc and rare earth elements during welding in conditions of constant stiffness. The results of tests of susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>hot</b> cracking of repair welding joints of ZRE 1 alloy castings have been described.
