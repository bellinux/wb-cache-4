25|$|<b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> “hour” and “minute” (óra and perc) are {{not usually}} {{abbreviated}} in fluent texts. If the time is given in digits, a full stop is placed between the hour and the minute without a space (e.g. 10.35). This latter form takes a hyphen before suffixes (e.g. 10.35-kor ‘at 10:35’).|$|E

25|$|In Germany the cittern survives {{under the}} names Waldzither and Lutherzither. The last {{name comes from}} the belief that Martin Luther played this instrument. Also, the names Thüringer Waldzither in Thüringer Wald, Harzzither in the Harz mountains, Halszither in German-speaking Switzerland are used. There is a {{tendency}} in modern German to interchange <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> cittern and zither. The term waldzither came into use around 1900, to distinguish citterns from zithers.|$|E
25|$|This {{model is}} similar to the revised {{hierarchical}} model and suggests the lexicon of a bilingual individual is integrated, containing <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> both languages. This accounts for the simultaneous parallel activation of both languages during language tasks, the late activation of language in semantic processing, and the lack of effects of code switching. This lack of cost for code switching is especially used because they argue that separate lexicons would cause a slower reaction time, which was not indicated in the findings.|$|E
25|$|These marks are nonalphabetic letters {{carrying}} a particular meaning. Several of them continue in modern usage, {{as in the}} case of monetary symbols. In Unicode, they are referred to as letter-like glyphs. Additionally, several authors are of the view that the Roman numerals themselves were, for example, nothing less than abbreviations of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> those numbers. Other examples of symbols still in some use are alchemical and zodiac symbols, which were, in any case, employed only in alchemy and astrology texts, which made their appearance beyond that special context rare.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} a period when the {{spelling}} of {{a small number of}} words was altered in what is now regarded as a misguided attempt to make them conform to what were perceived to be the etymological origins of <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> <b>For</b> example, the letter b was added to debt (originally dette) in an attempt to link it to the Latin debitum, and the letter s in island is a misplaced attempt to link it to Latin insula instead of the Old English word īġland, which is the true origin of the English word. The letter p in ptarmigan has no etymological justification whatsoever, only seeking to invoke Greek despite being a Gaelic word.|$|E
25|$|Easter {{is linked}} to the Jewish Passover by much of its symbolism, as well as by its {{position}} in the calendar. In most European languages the feast called Easter in English is termed by <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> passover in those languages and in the older English versions of the Bible the term Easter was the term used to translate passover. Easter customs vary across the Christian world, and include sunrise services, exclaiming the Paschal greeting, clipping the church, and decorating Easter eggs (symbols of the empty tomb). The Easter lily, a symbol of the resurrection, traditionally decorates the chancel area of churches on this day {{and for the rest of}} Eastertide. Additional customs that have become associated with Easter and are observed by both Christians and some non-Christians include egg hunting, the Easter Bunny, and Easter parades. There are also various traditional Easter foods that vary regionally.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile Valdobrev {{attended}} the High School for Foreign Languages in Stara Zagora. For a Communist country behind the Iron Curtain which Bulgaria {{was at that}} time, this school was like {{a breath of fresh}} air – with a discipline not so strict and teachers being lenient and having a personal approach to each of the students. They soon noticed Valdobrev's wandering mind and lack of concentration in class and created a system which tried to help him study the English language better. They gave him constant tasks to listen to and write down lyrics of new songs, perform them with his guitar in the lessons and translate <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> his classmates. These everyday concerts were the real productive education for him and later, when he was traveling over the Black Sea resorts and Germany as a street musician, he already had a set-list of 300 prepared and well-rehearsed world hit songs of any genre.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{representations}} of speech sounds are now largely identical in the Indonesian and Malay standards, {{a number of}} minor spelling differences remain, usually for historical reasons. <b>For</b> instance, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> 'money' is written as wang in Malaysia, but uang in Indonesia, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> 'try' is written as cuba in Malaysia, but coba in Indonesia, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> 'because' is written as kerana in Malaysia, but karena in Indonesia, while <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> 'cake' is written as kuih in Malaysia, but kue in Indonesia.|$|R

25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E
25|$|Other Italian words used {{throughout}} Romansh include <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> 'nail', which {{are derived from}} Italian acuto 'sharp', which has yielded Sur. guota, Sut. guta, Surm. gotta, and Ladin guotta/aguotta, whereas the Romansh word for 'sharp' itself (Rhenish: git, Ladin agüz) {{is derived from the}} same Latin source ACUTUM. Words from various Italian dialects related to crafts include Ladin marangun 'carpenter' (← Venetian marangon), as opposed to lennari in other Romansh dialects, chazzoula 'trowel' (← Lombard cazzola), or filadè 'spinning wheel' (← Lombard filadel). Other words include culinary items such as macaruns 'macaroni' (← maccheroni); tschiculatta/tschugalata 'chocolate' (← cioccolata or Lombard ciculata/cicolata), Ladin and Surmiran limun/limung 'lemon' as opposed to Sursilvan citrona (← limone), giabus/baguos 'cabbage' (← Lombard gabüs), chanella/canella 'cinnamon' (← cannella). In Sursilvan, the word ogna 'flat cake' can be found, which is derived from Italian lasagna, with the initial las- having been mistaken for the plural article, and the vowel having been adapted to Sursilvan sound patterns through analogy with words such as muntogna 'mountain'. Others are words for animals such as lodola 'lark' (← lodola) or randulina 'swallow' (← Lombard randulina), as well as Ladin scarafagi/scarvatg 'beetle' (← scarafaggio). Other Italian words include impostas 'taxes' (← imposte; as opposed to Rhenish taglia), radunanza/radunonza 'assembly' (← radunanza), Ladin ravarenda '(Protestant) priest' (← reverendo), 'bambin 'Christmas child (giftbringer)' (← Gesù Bambino), marchadant/marcadont 'merchant' (← mercatante) or butia/buteia 'shop' (← bottega).|$|E

500|$|Cross-cultural {{study of}} comics is {{complicated}} by the great difference in meaning and scope of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> [...] "comics" [...] in different languages.

500|$|The {{historical}} {{importance of}} the Polish cochineal is still reflected in most modern Slavic languages where <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> the color red and {{for the month of}} June both derive from the Proto-Slavic [...] (probably pronounced [...] ), meaning [...] "a worm" [...] or [...] "larva". (See examples in the table below.) In the Czech language, as well as old Bulgarian, this is true for both June and July, the two months when harvest of the insect's larvae was possible.

500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Rodgers and Hammerstein both became {{well known}} for {{creating}} Broadway hits with other partners. [...] Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two dozen musicals, including such popular successes as Babes in Arms (1937), The Boys from Syracuse (1938) and Pal Joey (1940). [...] Some of Rodgers' work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre: [...] On Your Toes was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot (in the [...] "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue" [...] scene), while Pal Joey flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero. [...] Hammerstein had written or co-written <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> such hits as Rose-Marie (1924), The Desert Song (1926), The New Moon (1927) and Show Boat (1927). [...] Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for musicals and films, sharing an Academy Award for his song with Jerome Kern, [...] "The Last Time I Saw Paris", which {{was included in the}} 1941 film Lady Be Good.|$|E
500|$|Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter {{describe}} [...] "Ding Dong" [...] as the [...] "quickest song" [...] that Harrison ever wrote, {{in terms}} of time spent on the composition. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>for</b> the song's middle eight – [...] "Yesterday, today was tomorrow / And tomorrow, today will be yesterday" [...] – came from another pair of inscriptions from Crisp's time at Friar Park. Harrison found these lines in what he called [...] "the garden building", carved in stone around two matching windows. The only other lyrics in [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] are the song title, repeated four times to serve as its chorus. Sung in imitation of a clock chiming, the chorus lyrics, combined with the message of those of the verse, lend the composition an obvious New Year's theme. Harrison later described the song as [...] "very optimistic", and suggested: [...] "Instead of getting stuck in a rut, everybody should try ringing out the old and ringing in the new… [...] sing about it, but they never apply it to their lives." ...|$|E
