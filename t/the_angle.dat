5|$|Following Turning Point, A.J. Styles {{tried to}} unite Christian's Coalition and <b>The</b> <b>Angle</b> Alliance. On the December 6, 2007 episode of Impact, Christian Cage became {{leader of a}} joint alliance, until Kurt Angle and Robert Roode {{attacked}} him {{at the end of}} the episode. This led to Angle defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Cage at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 6, 2008. There, Angle defeated Cage after Styles attacked Cage, effectively siding with <b>The</b> <b>Angle</b> Alliance. The two fought again for the title at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008, where Tomko cost Cage the title, siding with <b>The</b> <b>Angle</b> Alliance as well.|$|E

5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the slip face point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of repose of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of repose, the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|E

On the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!, Tomko left both Christian's Coalition and <b>The</b> <b>Angle</b> Alliance. Cage failed to win the title at Final Resolution, as a result of Styles' betraying and attacking him during the bout, thus ending Christian's Coalition. Cage got a rematch against Angle on February 10, 2008 at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event with Samoa Joe as the special outside enforcer.
