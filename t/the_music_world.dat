5|$|Sorabji's isolation, and {{sometimes}} the resulting lack of interaction with <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>world,</b> have {{been the target of}} criticism even by his admirers. His writings have also been highly divisive, being described by some as profoundly perceptive and enlightening, and by others as misguided.|$|E
5|$|Charles Conn {{returned}} to Elkhart after the Civil War and established C.G. Conn Ltd., {{a manufacturer of}} musical instruments. The company's innovation in band instruments made Elkhart an important center of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>world,</b> {{and it became a}} base of Elkhart's economy for decades. Nearby South Bend experienced continued growth following the Civil War, and became a large manufacturing city centered around the Oliver Farm Equipment Company, the nation's leading plow producer. Gary was founded in 1906 by the United States Steel Corporation as the home for its new plant.|$|E

5|$|Sorabji first {{expressed}} interest in becoming a music critic in 1914, and he started contributing criticism to The New Age in 1924, after it had published some of his letters to the editor. By 1930, Sorabji had become disillusioned with concert life and developed a growing interest in gramophone recordings, believing that he would eventually lose all reason to attend concerts. In 1945 he stopped providing regular reviews and only occasionally submitted his writings to correspondence columns in various journals. While his earlier writings reflect a contempt for <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>world</b> in general—from its businessmen to its performers—his later reviews {{tend to be more}} detailed and less caustic.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s the Duke Ellington Orchestra and the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra were exposing <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>world</b> to harmonically {{sophisticated}} musical arrangements by Billy Strayhorn and Sy Oliver, respectively, which implied chords {{as much as}} they spelled them out. That understatement of harmonically sophisticated chords would soon be used by young musicians exploring the new musical language of bebop..|$|E

This is reflected from public statements that Duchâble had made in previous years.|$|R

25|$|Evans' {{career began}} {{just before the}} rock {{explosion}} in the 1960s. During this decade, jazz was swept in a corner, and most new talents had few opportunities to gain recognition, especially in America.

25|$|The Landt Trio {{was one of}} {{the busiest}} singing groups in early radio. In 1928, the three brothers, Karl (1908-1997), Jack (1911-1959), and Dan (1996-1961) Landt, with their accompanist Howard White, were signed onto the NBC Blue Network as {{sustaining}} artists and began a career of more than 20 years. They performed primarily on radio but also performed in vaudeville, including some headline runs at the Palace and Carnegie Hall, and made many personal appearances. They were unusual in <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>world</b> in that they did not read music, so they sang and played by ear. They continued to perform on radio and in advertising until the early 1950s, when the rising popularity of television ended their performance career.|$|E
25|$|Until his sixties Tal {{appeared}} as a pianist and conductor with various orchestras, but his major contribution to <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>world</b> lies in his challenging compositions and his novel use of sonority. In the 1990s Tal conducted, together with Dr Shlomo Markel, a research project (Talmark) aimed at {{the development of a}} novel musical notation system in cooperation with the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, and VolkswagenStiftung. During these years his eyesight deteriorated due to macular degeneration and it became increasingly difficult for him to continue composing. Using a computer screen to enlarge the music score, he managed to compose short musical works for few instruments, write his third autobiography, and complete his visionary analysis of future music. The complete cycle of his symphonies conducted by Israel Yinon was released on the German label CPO.|$|E

500|$|As {{his stature}} in <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>world</b> increased, Grainger became acquainted {{with many of}} its leading figures, {{including}} Vaughan Williams, Elgar, Richard Strauss and Debussy. In 1907 he met Frederick Delius, with whom he achieved an immediate rapport – the two musicians had similar ideas about composition and harmony, and shared a dislike for the classical German masters. Both were inspired by folk music; Grainger gave Delius his setting of the folk song Brigg Fair, which [...] the older composer developed [...] into his famous orchestral rhapsody, dedicated to Grainger. The two remained close friends until Delius's death in 1934.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. #1's was awarded {{four and a}} half out of five stars from Heather Phares of AllMusic.

Additionally, Phares wrote [...] "Her career has been an extraordinary succession of number ones and record-breaking firsts in <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>world,</b> her entire album catalog has achieved RIAA multi-platinum status." [...] Phares also commented on the accompanying DVD, writing, [...] "Interviews and interactive menus make #1s a better-than-average DVD video collection and one that will doubtlessly please Carey's legions of fans." ...|$|E
