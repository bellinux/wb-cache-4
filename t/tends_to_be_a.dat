5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as primary ingredients. Various spices are typically used, and it <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> moist cake. Applesauce cake prepared with chunky-style apple sauce {{may be less}} moist. Several additional ingredients may also be used in its preparation, and it is sometimes prepared {{and served as a}} coffee cake. The cake dates back to early colonial times in the United States. National Applesauce Cake Day occurs annually on June 6 in the U.S.|$|E

P.adiposa is also similar, but prefers to grow on dead hardwoods; unlike P.flammans, it has gelatinous scales on the stem as well as the cap.|$|E

25|$|P. praelongus {{requires}} clear, {{deep water}} {{with at least}} some basic influence, and rarely grows in water less than 1 m deep. In Britain is usually found in lakes with limestone, marl or basalt geology, and it is absent from acidic lakes such as are common in Wales. It also occurs in slow-flowing rivers and disused canals. Long-stalked pondweed <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rather rare plant within its range; for example, {{in a study of}} more than 3,500 British lakes, it occurred in only 88, most of which had low-moderate alkalinity and were dominated by isoetids. The seeds require a cold period to encourage germination.|$|E
25|$|The {{race has}} {{finished}} since 1975 with laps of the Champs-Élysées. This stage rarely challenges the leader {{because it is}} flat and the leader usually has {{too much time in}} hand to be denied. But in 1987, Pedro Delgado broke away on the Champs to challenge the 40-second lead held by Stephen Roche. He and Roche finished in the peloton and Roche won the Tour. In modern times, there <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gentlemen's agreement: while the points classification is still contended if possible, the overall classification is not fought over; because of this, {{it is not uncommon for}} the de facto winner of the overall classification to ride into Paris holding a glass of champagne.|$|E
25|$|Carvel {{construction}} {{dates back}} even earlier. The {{design of the}} luzzu is believed to date {{back at least to}} Phoenician times. A luzzu is a double-ended carvel-built fishing boat from the Maltese islands. Traditionally, they are brightly painted in shades of yellow, red, green and blue, and the bow is normally pointed with a pair of eyes. These eyes may be the modern survival of an ancient Phoenician custom (also practiced by the ancient Greeks); they are sometimes (and probably inaccurately) referred to as the Eye of Horus or of Osiris. The luzzu has survived because it <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sturdy and stable boat even in bad weather. Originally, the luzzu was equipped with sails although nowadays almost all are motorised, with onboard diesel engines being the most common.|$|E

25|$|Cods of {{the genus}} Gadus have three rounded dorsal and two anal fins. The pelvic fins are small, with the first ray extended, and are set under the gill cover (i.e. the throat region), {{in front of the}} {{pectoral}} fins. The upper jaw extends over the lower jaw, which has a well-developed chin barbel. The eyes are medium-sized, approximately the same as the length of the chin barbel. Cod have a distinct white lateral line running from the gill slit above the pectoral fin, {{to the base of the}} caudal or tail fin. The back <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> greenish to sandy brown, and shows extensive mottling, especially towards the lighter sides and white belly. Dark brown colouration of the back and sides is not uncommon, especially for individuals that have resided in rocky inshore regions.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{conversion}} of NH3 and CO2 to urea is exothermic, the reaction {{heat from the}} first reaction driving the second. Like all chemical equilibria, these reactions behave according to Le Chatelier's principle, and the conditions that most favour carbamate formation have an unfavourable effect on the urea conversion equilibrium. The process conditions are, therefore, a compromise: the ill-effect on the first reaction of the high temperature (around 190°C) needed for the second is compensated for by conducting the process under high pressure (140–175 bar), which favours the first reaction. Although {{it is necessary to}} compress gaseous carbon dioxide to this pressure, the ammonia is available from the ammonia plant in liquid form, which can be pumped into the system much more economically. To allow the slow urea formation reaction time to reach equilibrium a large reaction space is needed, so the synthesis reactor in a large urea plant <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> massive pressure vessel.|$|E
