25|$|Muscle {{action that}} moves the axial {{skeleton}} work over a joint with an origin and insertion {{of the muscle}} on respective side. The insertion is on the bone deemed to move towards the origin during muscle contraction. Muscles are often present that engage in several actions of the joint; able to perform for example both flexion and extension of the forearm as in the biceps and triceps respectively. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{to be able to}} revert actions of muscles, but also brings on stability of the actions though muscle coactivation.|$|E
25|$|Donnelly has {{supported}} {{increases in the}} minimum wage and protection of collective bargaining. In Donnelly's first term he co-sponsored H.R. 2: The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. The act allows Congress to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to raise the federal minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25, and cuts taxes on small businesses by $12 Billion. After The Fair Minimum Wage Act was signed, Donnelly said in a statement that, “A decent wage is essential for a working family to get by in America. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> good social and economic policy, it's just plain fair.” Donnelly voted in favor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.|$|E

25|$|A notable {{amount of}} medieval {{literature}} is anonymous. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{due to the}} lack of documents from a period, but also due to an interpretation of the author's role that differs considerably from the romantic interpretation of the term in use today. Medieval authors often deeply respected the classical writers and the Church Fathers and tended to re-tell and embellish stories they had heard or read rather than invent new stories. And even when they did, they often claimed to be handing down something from an auctor instead. From this point of view, the names of the individual authors seemed much less important, and therefore many important works were never attributed to any specific person.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{the flag}} in Taiwan {{reflects}} the controversy behind its symbolism. Although supporters of Taiwan independence, such as former President Chen Shui-bian, will display and salute the flag on formal official state occasions, it is never seen at political rallies of the Democratic Progressive Party. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> because of its association with mainland China {{but also because the}} flag contains design elements of the KMT party flag. By contrast, the ROC flag is always extremely prominent at political rallies of the pan-Blue coalition. This difference extends to the colors seen at the rallies. Rallies of the pan-Blue coalition give prominence to the colors of the ROC flag, with very large amounts of blue and smaller amounts of red. Rallies of independence-leaning parties are filled with green, with no blue or red at all.|$|E
25|$|Bartlett's studies {{relating}} to the nosology of mental illness and his critique of the assumption that psychological normality should be equated with good mental health led him to examine the psychology of creative individuals. The psychology of artists and other highly creative people has been studied from the diagnostic perspective of DSM's psychiatric classification of mental disorders, {{with the result that}} some outstanding creative individuals may be considered to have various degrees of psychopathology. Bartlett has argued that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> short-sighted, but it questionably presumes that the psychology of normality should serve as arbiter for mentally healthy emotional, aesthetic, and cognitive characteristics and abilities. In a group of further publications, Bartlett has described in detail how it is possible to enrich and deepen our understanding of both the psychology of creativity and the psychology of normality.|$|E

With 18 points, 17 rebounds, and 20 assists against the Knicks on March 4, he joined Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, and Jason Kidd {{as the only}} players {{to have at least}} 15 points, rebounds, and assists in the same game. In a win against the Heat on April 1, Rondo registered another triple-double (16 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds). Rondo closed out the regular season with 24 consecutive games of 10 or more assists. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a Celtics franchise record, but is also the longest streak the NBA has seen since John Stockton logged a streak of 29 such games in 1992.

25|$|It was {{recently}} thought that self-recognition {{was restricted to}} mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition, but absent from animals without a neocortex. However, in 2008, an investigation of self-recognition in corvids was conducted revealing the ability of self-recognition in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common ancestor nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror test showed that although magpies {{do not have a}} neocortex, they are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror test {{in a manner similar to}} apes, dolphins, killer whales, pigs and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence, it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/ lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.|$|E
25|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was thought}} that self-recognition was absent from animals without a neocortex, and was restricted to mammals with large brains and well developed social cognition. However, in 2008 a study of self-recognition in corvids reported significant results for magpies. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common ancestor nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and mark tests showed that neocortex-less magpies are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test {{in a manner similar to}} apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness. However even in the chimpanzee, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested. Occurrence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and old individuals. For monkeys, non-primate mammals, and in a number of bird species, exploration of the mirror and social displays were observed. However, hints at mirror-induced self-directed behavior have been obtained.|$|E

500|$|Ponies and {{miniature}} {{horses are}} usually easy keepers and need less feed than full-sized horses.

[...] Ponies easily become obese from overfeeding and {{are at high risk}} for colic and, especially, laminitis. Fresh grass is a particular danger to ponies; they can develop laminitis in as little as one hour of grazing on lush pasture.|$|E
500|$|The visitor {{economy of}} Shrewsbury and Atcham was worth about £115million in 2001, with about 2,500 people {{employed}} {{directly in the}} visitor industry and 3,400 indirectly. There were about 3.1million visitors – both day visitors and staying visitors – to the borough in 2001, with 88% being day visitors and 12% being staying visitors; staying visitors accounted for 42% of spending. Shrewsbury's position of being the only sizable town for a large area, especially to the west in Mid-Wales, allows it to attract a large retail base beyond that of its resident population. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> evident in the retail sector, {{but also in the}} healthcare sector, where the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital has the only A department westwards until Aberystwyth, about [...] away.|$|E
