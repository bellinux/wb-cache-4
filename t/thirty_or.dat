Anyone who tried to escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an open area, where {{they were forced to}} strip, and then were herded down into the ravine. People were forced to lie down in rows on top of the bodies of other victims, and they were shot {{in the back of the}} head or the neck by members of the execution squads.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} to New York {{to perform the}} first seven episodes, the four men decided to broadcast from Los Angeles instead. NBC {{did not have a}} studio on the West Coast, so for the next thirteen weeks, between January 16 and April 24, 1933, the show was transmitted from a borrowed empty soundstage at RKO Radio Pictures. Folding chairs were brought in for the audience of around <b>thirty</b> <b>or</b> forty people – coming from vaudeville, Groucho and Chico preferred to perform to a crowd – and were quickly cleared {{out at the end of}} each performance so that the stage would be ready for any filming the following day. The last four episodes of the show were performed back at WJZ in New York.|$|E

5|$|It is {{the largest}} of the Small Isles, and the 15th largest Scottish island, but is {{inhabited}} by only about <b>thirty</b> <b>or</b> so people, all of whom live in the village of Kinloch on the east coast. The island has been inhabited since the 8th millennium BC and provides some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland. The early Celtic and Norse settlers left only a few written accounts and artefacts. From the 12th to 13th centuries on, the island was held by various clans including the MacLeans of Coll. The population grew to over 400 by the late 18th century but was cleared of its indigenous population between 1826 and 1828. The island then became a sporting estate, the exotic Kinloch Castle being constructed by the Bulloughs in 1900. Rùm was purchased by the Nature Conservancy Council in 1957.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot is {{a predominantly}} ground-based seed eater, foraging in clearings in open woodland, forest margins, and near trees in more open {{areas such as}} pastures. It occasionally feeds along road verges and rarely ventures onto lawns. Birds forage in pairs or small troops of up to <b>thirty</b> <b>or</b> even fifty individuals. Observations at Chiltern in Victoria indicated seasonal variation in flock size, with turquoise parrots foraging in groups of 5–30 in winter and 6–8 in spring and summer. Foraging takes place from {{early in the morning}} till late afternoon, with a break between midday and mid-afternoon. Birds prefer to feed in shaded areas, where they are better camouflaged in the grass.|$|E
5|$|Henry of Grosmont, the Duke of Lancaster, {{inherited}} the castle {{from his father}} in 1345 and remodelled the great hall with a grander interior and roof. On his death Blanche of Lancaster {{inherited the}} castle. Blanche married John of Gaunt, the third son of Edward III; their union, and combined resources, made John the second richest man in England next to the king himself. After Blanche's death, John married Constance, who had a claim to the kingdom of Castile, and John styled himself the king of Castile and León. Kenilworth {{was one of the}} most important of his <b>thirty</b> <b>or</b> more castles in England. John began building at Kenilworth between 1373 and 1380 in a style designed to reinforce his royal claims in Iberia. John constructed a grander great hall, the Strong Tower, Saintlowe Tower, the state apartments and the new kitchen complex. When not campaigning abroad, John spent much of his time at Kenilworth and Leicester, and used Kenilworth even more after 1395 when his health began to decline. In his final years, John made extensive repairs to the whole of the castle complex.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} protect his retreat, Archduke Charles of Austria reunited his entire cavalry reserve, 44 squadrons in all, {{on either side of}} the Ratisbon road, next to the village of Eggolsheim. Between 19:00 20:00 in the evening, Napoleon ordered his cavalry to {{disperse}} the enemy horse from this position. In preparation of the charge, Nansouty formed five of his regiments in two lines: three regiments in the first line and two in the second line, leaving his remaining regiment with Saint-Sulpice. Saint-Sulpice's division was on Nansouty's right and it remained formed in regiment column formations, while the light cavalry was protecting the flanks of the whole. In all, the French had 48 squadrons, and, as they advanced, they were met by intense artillery fire from the Austrian batteries and then vigorously charged by the Gottesheim cuirassier regiment. Seeing the enemy charging, Nansouty ordered his squadrons forward towards the enemy, but at a gentle trot. Then, as soon as the Austrians were at about one hundred paces, the frontline regiment of Carabiniers-à-Cheval halted, loaded their carbines and fired a salvo from <b>thirty</b> <b>or</b> forty paces, then drew their swords and joined their fellow cuirassiers in an energetic charge. As Nansouty led, Saint-Sulpice followed and, despite the vigour and determination of the Austrian cavalry, they were repulsed after a brief hand-to-hand combat. Coming in support of the Gottesheim Cuirassiers, the Kaiser Cuirassier regiment shared the same fate, with the Stipsicz Hussars and Vincent Chevau-légers also repulsed. A generalised and bloody mêlée then occurred under the moonlight, with the sabre hits on the steel cuirasses producing sparkles in the night. Austrian General Andreas von Schneller was wounded during this action and General Karl Wilhelm von Stutterheim, commanding the entire Austrian cavalry, only just escaped capture. The Austrian cavalry was repulsed and pushed into the marshes beyond, subsequently retreating towards Köfering, with the bulk of Archduke Charles's forces retreating towards Ratisbon.|$|E
5|$|Maslama then disappears {{from the}} sources and re-emerges in 725, shortly after Yazid's {{death and the}} {{accession}} of Hisham, who sent Maslama to replace al-Djarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami in the Caucasus front against the Khazars. Initially, however, Maslama was mostly active in the Byzantine front, and {{the war against the}} Khazars was delegated to al-Harith ibn Amr al-Ta'i. In winter 725, Maslama led an expedition against Asia Minor from Melitene, which culminated in the sack of Caesarea on 13 January 726. Along with the capture of Gangra by Abdallah al-Battal in 727, {{this was one of the}} major successes of Arab arms against the Byzantines in the 720s. A few months later, he also led the otherwise unremarkable northern summer expedition into Byzantine territory. In 727–728, his attention was diverted by Khazar attacks which reached deep into Azerbaijan. Although Maslama was able to drive them back and recover control of the Darial Pass, his 728 campaign across the Caucasus was difficult, bloody and indecisive. Maslama's troops were reportedly engaged in up to <b>thirty</b> <b>or</b> forty days of constant fighting in miserable weather, and although he claimed victory in a battle over the Khazar khagan himself, the expedition did not achieve any results, and came close to being defeated. Certainly it did little to stop Khazar attacks south of the Caucasus, which resumed in 729. Maslama was removed from office in the same year, and replaced by al-Djarrah. He is then recorded by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor as having been responsible for the sack of the fortress of Charsianon in late 730, but Arab sources credit Mu'awiya ibn Hisham for this act.|$|E

25|$|Goalkeepers {{often have}} longer playing careers than outfield players, many not {{retiring}} until their late <b>thirties</b> <b>or</b> early forties. This {{can be explained}} by noting that goalkeepers play a less physically demanding position that requires significantly less running. For example, Peter Shilton played for 31 years between 1966 and 1997 before retiring at the age of 47. Another explanation of this is that {{due to the nature of}} this position, goalkeepers use their experience more often than field players.|$|R

25|$|Settlements by the Polynesians were of two categories: {{the hamlet}} and the village. The {{size of the}} island {{inhabited}} determined {{whether or not a}} hamlet would be built. The larger volcanic islands usually had hamlets because of the many zones that could be divided across the island. Food and resources were more plentiful. These settlements of four to five houses (usually with gardens) were established so {{that there would be no}} overlap between the zones. Villages, on the other hand, were built on the coasts of smaller islands and consisted of <b>thirty</b> <b>or</b> more houses—in the case of atolls, on only one of the group so that food cultivation was on the others. Usually these villages were fortified with walls and palisades made of stone and wood.|$|E
