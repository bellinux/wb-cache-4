25|$|Many working mathematicians {{have been}} {{mathematical}} realists; <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> discoverers of naturally occurring objects. Examples include Paul Erdős and Kurt Gödel. Gödel believed in an objective mathematical reality {{that could be}} perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (e.g., for any two objects, there {{is a collection of}} objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but the continuum hypothesis conjecture might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. Gödel suggested that quasi-empirical methodology could be used to provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture.|$|E
500|$|A {{focal point}} of Hazlitt's account of Troilus and Cressida is a {{comparison}} of the characterisation in this play and that in Chaucer's poem Troilus and Criseyde (one of Shakespeare's sources). Chaucer's characters are full and well developed; but Chaucer unfolded each character in itself, one at a time. Shakespeare displayed characters as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> well as how others see them, and showed the effects each has on the others. Shakespeare's characters were so distinctive that it is as if each were expressed by a distinct [...] "faculty" [...] of his mind; and, in effect, these faculties could be considered as showing [...] "excessive sociability", notable for [...] "how they gossiped and compared notes together." [...] Twentieth-century critic Arthur Eastman thought that, although these remarks did insufficient justice to Chaucer, they were particularly original in revealing [...] "the sophisticated genius of Shakespeare." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{expanded to}} include renewed harassment of prominent feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian, who had previously been a target of online harassment {{due in part to}} her YouTube video series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games, which analyzes sexist stereotypes in video games. Sarkeesian's attackers took her critical commentary as unfair and unwarranted, and considered her an interloper. After a new episode of Tropes vs. Women was released on August 24, 2014, Sarkeesian received rape and death threats, and private information including her home address was leaked; she was compelled to flee her home. At the XOXO arts and technology conference in Portland, Oregon, she said, in regard to the accusations that high-profile women were making up the threats against them, that [...] "one of the most radical things you can do is to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences". [...] "The perpetrators", Sarkeesian went on to say, [...] "do not see themselves as perpetrators at all... <b>They</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> noble warriors".|$|E

2500|$|While Tyler herself {{does not}} {{like to think of}} her novels in terms of themes, {{numerous}} reviewers and scholars have noted the importance of family and marriage relationships to her characters and stories. Liesl Schillinger summarized: “Taken together, the distinct but overlapping worlds of her novels have formed a Sensurround literary record of the 20th century American family—or, at least, of the proud but troubled archetypal families that…interested her most." [...] Michiko Kakutani, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for The New York Times, has been reviewing Tyler novels for over 25 years. [...] She has frequently noted Tyler’s themes with regard to family and marriage. [...] Reviewing Noah's Compass, Kakutani states that “the central concern of most of this author’s characters has always been their need to define themselves in terms of family — the degree to which <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> creatures shaped by genetics, childhood memories and parental and spousal expectations, {{and the degree to which}} they are driven to embrace independent identities of their own.”. This is an example of where Anne Tyler got some of her characteristics from, being able to be independent and get to know herself through her writing.|$|E

40|$|Virtual libraries" and "digital libraries" {{have become}} stock phrases of our times. But {{what do they}} really mean? While digital refers to {{a new form of}} {{document}} encoding and must be approached from that perspective, virtual resonates with aspects that modern philosophy treats with benign neglect at best. The word virtual harbors the notion of potential, and therein lies its hidden strength. Although strong commercial interests try to use the shift to a digital environment to redefine the political economy of knowledge, and thus virtualize libraries into a state of almost complete impotence, all hope is not lost. Librarians of virtualized libraries may well discover that they have re-empowered institutions if they place human interaction at the heart of their operations. In other words, rather than envisioning <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> knowledge bankers sitting on treasure vaults of knowledge, <b>they</b> should <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> "hearts" dynamizing human communities. <b>They</b> should also <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> an essential part of these communities, and not as external repositories of knowledge. In this fashion, they will avoid the fate of becoming an oxymoron...|$|R

30|$|The {{adoption}} of self-management strategies to control an illness requires that individuals not only perceive <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> {{responsible for their}} health, but that <b>they</b> also <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> self-efficient to achieve the necessary change of lifestyle (Leventhal, Phillips, & Burns, 2016 b; Tanenbaum et al., 2015). Self-efficacy {{has been linked to}} the perceived behavior control, as both concepts refer to the individual’s perceived ability to perform a behavior. Thus, perceived behavior denotes subjective degree of control over performance of the behavior itself, which should be viewed as an overarching construct that is comprised of two components: self-efficacy and controllability (Elie-Dit-Cosaque, Pallud, & Kalika, 2011; Manstead & Eekelen, 1998).|$|R
