5|$|From Lemberg to Bordeaux ('Von Lemberg bis Bordeaux'), {{written by}} Leo Leixner, a {{journalist}} and war correspondent, is an eye-witness account of the battles that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Poland and France. In August 1939, Leixner joined the Wehrmacht as a war reporter, was promoted to sergeant, and in 1941 published his recollections. The book was originally issued by Franz Eher Nachfolger, the central publishing house of the Nazi Party.|$|E
5|$|His reign was {{inextricably}} connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Bulgaria under Ottoman domination. Although {{there exist}} no historical sources which {{prove that he}} took {{active role in the}} defence of the country, in Bulgarian folklore Ivan Shishman is portrayed as a legendary and heroic ruler who desperately fought against the overwhelming Ottoman forces. There are numerous sites, geographical features and fortresses named after him throughout Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|Since Gaddafi {{had kept}} mostly aloof {{in the months}} prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of N'Djamena, Habré hoped to reach an {{understanding}} with Libya, possibly through an accord with Acyl, who appeared receptive to dialogue. But Acyl died on 19 July, replaced by Acheikh ibn Oumar, and the CDR was antagonized by Habré's eagerness to unify the country, which led him to overrun the CDR's domains.|$|E
5|$|The Java War (also {{called the}} China War or Chinese War) of 1741 to 1743 was an armed {{struggle}} by a joint Chinese and Javanese army against the Dutch colonial government {{that took place}} in central and eastern Java.

5|$|The {{source of}} many of these stories of Elagabalus's depravity is the Augustan History (Historia Augusta), which {{includes}} controversial claims. The Historia Augusta was most likely written {{toward the end of the}} 4th century during the reign of emperor Theodosius I. The life of Elagabalus as described in the Augustan History is of uncertain historical merit. Sections 13 to 17, relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Elagabalus, are less controversial among historians.|$|E
5|$|This {{version of}} the story appears in Virgil's Aeneid, in a passage {{describing}} a series of paintings decorating the walls of a temple of Juno. The painting immediately next to the one depicting Troilus shows the death of Rhesus, another character killed because of prophecies linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Troy. Other pictures are similarly calamitous.|$|E
5|$|Villa {{remained}} {{loyal to}} Madero (and even fought for him against Orozco) and contributed greatly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Huerta. However, he broke with Carranza and lost {{the struggle for}} {{the control of the}} revolution to Carranza's Gen. Álvaro Obregón.|$|E

50|$|A 4.8 mi {{round trip}} hike {{provides}} access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> Prior <b>to</b> 2014, <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> were {{very difficult to}} reach due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> private Vulcan Materials quarry {{in the mouth of}} Fish Canyon, which required a long and exposed bypass hike over the neighboring ridge. In the summer of 2014 a new trail opened through the quarry allowing hikers a much easier path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b>|$|R

5|$|Alexander {{controversially}} {{married the}} commoner Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced {{the couple to}} leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic Barbary macaque and died of sepsis. The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy's survival and contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the Venizelist regime. After a general election and a referendum, Constantine I was restored to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Bosaso in {{relatively}} stable autonomous Puntland {{emerged as a}} regional hub and major port. A small fishing village prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the state, Bosaso developed a lucrative import/export trade of U.S. $15 million per year out of its port during the 1990s. The population grew in eight years from 5,000 to 150,000, sustained by public services provided on a competitive basis by private enterprise, and court systems, schools and a university founded by the local community.|$|E
5|$|FIU {{also holds}} many Golden Panther spirit events {{throughout}} the year. Some of these include, Panther Camp {{held in the}} Summer prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fall</b> term for incoming freshmen, where students spend a weekend in a retreat center learning all the traditional Golden Panther cheers, chants, traditions meeting other incoming students. Started in 2006, Panther Camp has grown quickly in popularity from only 25 participants in 2006 to over 120 participants in 2007. In 2008, Panther Camp expanded to two camps with a combined total of 240 freshman participants. Panther Camp {{is expected to grow}} in size for Summer 2010, as the waiting list has continued to double from year to year. Freshmen who participate are more likely to get involved in Student Life than other students.|$|E
50|$|Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> is from <b>the</b> forest's Fawn Lake {{parking area}} by hiking or bicycle by going past Fawn Lake, the airstrip, {{and the horse}} barn, or from the Buck Forest parking area by {{crossing}} the covered bridge, turning right, and following this road past Lake Julia <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> by vehicle may also be allowed for handicapped persons.

5|$|Former {{mines in}} Italy, the United States and Mexico, which once {{produced}} {{a large proportion}} of the world supply, have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almadén), shut down due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the price of mercury. Nevada's McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46kg) flask.|$|E
5|$|Former {{students}} from Prague, including Constantine Menges, and Czech {{refugees from the}} crisis, {{who were able to}} escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for human rights, religious liberty, freedom of speech and political asylum for Czech political prisoners and dissidents. Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and Red Army's continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the Berlin Wall and collapse of Communism in Moscow and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|From January 11, 1785, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of 1788, New York City was {{the fifth}} of five capitals of the United States under the Articles of Confederation, with the Continental Congress meeting at New York City Hall (then at Fraunces Tavern). New York was the first capital under the newly enacted Constitution of the United States, from March 4, 1789, to August 12, 1790, at Federal Hall.

5|$|Hastings first rose to {{prominence}} {{as a result}} of the Case of the Hooded Man in 1912, and became noted for his skill at cross-examinations. After his success in Gruban v Booth in 1917, his practice steadily grew, and in 1919 he became a King's Counsel (KC). Following various successes as a KC in cases such as Sievier v Wootton and Russell v Russell, his practice was put on hold in 1922 when he was returned as the Labour Member of Parliament for Wallsend. Hastings was appointed Attorney General for England and Wales in 1924, by the first Labour government, and knighted. His authorisation of the prosecution of J. R. Campbell in what became known as the Campbell Case, however, led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the government after less than a year in power.|$|E
5|$|Lord Caldecote {{was forced}} to leave his {{position}} after only 8 months due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Neville Chamberlain's government, of which he was a part. He was replaced by Lord Simon, who took up his position on 12 May 1940. Simon frequently delegated to Schuster and accepted his advice on judicial appointments, such as that of Arthur Thompson Denning to the High Court in 1944. Schuster also had influence in committee appointments; when Simon was asked to select a chairman for the Committee on Reconstruction Priorities he delegated to Schuster, who chose Sir Walter Monckton.|$|E
5|$|Many {{theories}} have been advanced {{in way of}} explanation for decline of the Roman Empire, and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the 3rd century <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Constantinople in 1453. Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being overrun by various non-Roman peoples and then having its heart in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians do not consider that the Empire fell at this point.|$|E
