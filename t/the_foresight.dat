5|$|Overseen by Cyril Lovesey, {{flight testing}} {{commenced}} on 4 August 1929 {{in the new}} Supermarine S.6 at RAF Calshot, a seaplane and flying boat station on Southampton Water in Hampshire. During pre-race scrutineering tests, metal particles were found {{on two of the}} engine's 24 spark plugs indicating a piston failure which would require an engine re-build or replacement. The competition rules did not allow an engine change, but due to <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> of Ernest Hives, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials, and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed, the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished. This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to continue in the competition.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Negus was President of the Section of Laryngology at the Royal Society of Medicine. When Negus {{had been}} {{training}} as a surgeon, laryngology, rhinology and otology {{had been part of}} general surgery, but this was changing with the advent of ENT (ear, nose and throat) medicine as a combined and specialised discipline. Negus and colleagues attempted to set up the necessary structure within the Royal Society of Medicine to represent their profession as an emerging speciality, but the regulations in place would not allow the type of organisation they had planned. This led them, in 1943, to found the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists which would be able to represent ENT surgeons through the Royal College of Surgeons. Following the war, Negus was co-opted to the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1947, and was the first to represent otolaryngology at that level. He was {{also a member of the}} college's Court of Examiners, and worked to set up the first examination in otorhinolaryngology that could be taken for the FRCS diploma. This reorganisation was taking place against a background of immense change in how medicine was practised in the UK, due to the advent of the National Health Service (NHS). Negus's colleague, Geoffrey Bateman, writing in 1974, credits him with having <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> to represent the interests of otolaryngology and see it established as a major speciality in its own right within the NHS.|$|E

5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> role of <b>foresight</b> for {{supporting}} strategic planning is subject of debate at international level: {{on the one}} hand the classic functions of foresight do not go further than simply informing the policy makers, {{and on the other hand}} a growing number of foresight exercises with explicit planning objectives are carried around the world. Based on empirical evidence regarding the recent national exercises in the field of science and technology (S&T), as described by the resumes of <b>the</b> European <b>Foresight</b> Monitoring Network, and on in-depth analysis of <b>the</b> Romanian S&T <b>foresight</b> exercise, <b>the</b> paper explores the relevance of <b>the</b> adaptive <b>foresight</b> framework for <b>the</b> extension of <b>foresight</b> functions towards supporting strategic planning. The demand for policy relevant foresight in S&T seems to be stronger in countries with developing knowledge based economies (e. g. new EU member states, Turkey); while in countries with larger <b>foresight</b> tradition <b>the</b> push comes from the improving abilities of foresight practitioners in involving decision-makers. Strongly integrated into strategic planning, <b>the</b> Romanian S&T <b>foresight</b> shows <b>the</b> adaptability characteristics in a restructuring R&D system and further suggests the relevance of multi-level negotiations for transforming consensus into commitment...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper studies {{relationships}} between the local determinacy of a stationary equilibrium in <b>the</b> perfect <b>foresight</b> dynamics, and its local stability in dynamics arising from econometric learning procedures.

In such a framework, {{it is well known}} that there are no clear links between the determinacy of the stationary state in <b>the</b> perfect <b>foresight</b> dynamics on <b>the</b> levels of the state variable, and its stability under learning. The paper emphasizes, however, that this is not <b>the</b> right perfect <b>foresight</b> dynamics to look at whenever agents try to learn the coefficients of <b>the</b> perfect <b>foresight</b> dynamics restricted to an eigenspace of lower dimension. Indeed the paper introduces a growth rate perfect foresight dynamics on these coefficients and proves equivalence between determinacy in that dynamics and stability under learning provided that a simple sign condition is satisfied...|$|R

Nonetheless, as a practical matter, no civil law legislature can ever address the full spectrum of factual possibilities in the breadth, depth and detail of the case law of the common law courts of even a smaller jurisdiction, and that deeper, more complete body of law provides additional predictability that promotes commerce.|$|E
