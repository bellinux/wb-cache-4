40|$|AIM: The {{study was}} carried out as {{descriptive}} to determine the knowledge and practices about the subject emergency contraception of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists</b> and their helpers in the pharmacies in central Manisa. METHOD: The universe of the research was formed by the 113 pharmacies registered to Manisa chamber of <b>pharmacists</b> in <b>the</b> year 2008 and all the pharmacies were included in <b>the</b> study. 47 <b>pharmacists</b> and 88 helpers agreed to join the study. The research which was planned to be descriptive March-to-June 2008. A questionnaire was produced by researchers and filled in during face-to face interviews with <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists</b> and their helpers. RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>pharmacists</b> and their helpers stated that combined pills (46. 8 % and 44. 5 %) and condoms (41. 5 % and 42. 7 %) the most requested family planning methods their pharmacy. It was determined that 48. 9 % of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> 33 % of the pharmacist&# 146;s helpers gave information to customers about their use of family planning methods, 38. 3 % of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> 23. 9 % of the pharmacist&# 146;s helpers gave information {{what to do in}} case of failure to use/ where to apply to. 91. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> 95. 5 % of the pharmacist&# 146;s helpers stated that they had emergency contraception (EC) purpose pills in their pharmacies. It was determined that 61. 7 % of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> 28. 4 % of the pharmacist&# 146;s helpers had the knowledge about EC, 61. 7 % of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> 52. 3 % of the pharmacist&# 146;s helpers could consider the EC methods true, 68. 1 % of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> 70. 5 % of the pharmacist&# 146;s helpers gave the correct answers to the question of when the EC &# 150; purpose pills would be used. 68. 1 % of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> 45. 5 % of the pharmacist&# 146;s helpers stated that EC methods might have adverse effects, 14. 9 % of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> 25 % of the pharmacist&# 146;s helpers stated that EC methods were protect agains to STD or not information about it, 12. 8 % of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> 9. 1 % of the pharmacist&# 146;s helpers stated that these pills might be effective after the pregnancy occurred. It was determined that 53. 2 % of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> 48. 9 % of the pharmacist&# 146;s helpers got information about EC before. CONCLUSION: It was found out that <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists</b> and their helpers did not make enough counseling about the use of family planning methods, the knowledge level of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists</b> and their helpers about emergency contraception was quite low, and they had some misinformation. It was also concluded that the pre-graduation education given to <b>the</b> <b>pharmacists</b> shout be upgraded with respect to adulth education principles so that they can act as EC consultants and wide-scale in-service aducation programmes which would also pharmacist&# 146;s helpers, should be organized and participationin these programmes should be further ancouraged.

25|$|Script Pro {{manufactures}} a robot {{designed to}} help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form. <b>The</b> <b>pharmacist</b> or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system. The system, upon determining {{whether or not the}} drug is in the robot, will send the information to the robot for filling. The robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined {{by the size of the}} pill. The robot technician, user, or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked. Once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label. Afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient's medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient's name on an LED read out. <b>The</b> <b>pharmacist</b> or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it's the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up. The robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} pharmacist's role involves {{creating a}} comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves {{an evaluation of}} the appropriateness of the drug therapy (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy. <b>The</b> <b>pharmacist</b> must also monitor for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and assess patient drug allergies while designing and initiating a drug therapy plan.|$|E
25|$|In most countries, the dispensary {{is subject}} to {{pharmacy}} legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in legislation.

25|$|As a {{prescription}} {{is nothing more}} than information among a prescriber, pharmacist and patient, information technology can be applied to it. Existing information technology is adequate to print out prescriptions. Medical information systems in some hospitals do away with prescriptions within the hospital. There are proposals to securely transmit the prescription from the prescriber to <b>the</b> <b>pharmacist</b> using smartcard or the internet. In the United Kingdom a project called the Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (ETP) within the National Programme for IT (NPfIT) is currently piloting such a scheme between prescribers and pharmacies.|$|E

25|$|Another legal {{difficulty}} connected with modern pharmacopoeias is the inclusion {{in some of}} them of synthetic chemical remedies, the processes for preparing which have been patented, whilst the substances are sold under trade-mark names. The scientific chemical name is often long and unwieldy, and the physician prefers when writing a prescription to use the shorter name under which it is sold by the patentees. In this case <b>the</b> <b>pharmacist</b> is compelled to use the more expensive patented article, which may lead to complaints from the patient. If the physician were {{to use the same}} article under its pharmacopoeial name when the patented article is prescribed, they would become open to prosecution by the patentee for infringement of patent rights. Hence the only solution is for the physician to use the chemical name (which cannot be patented) as given in the Pharmacopoeia, or, for those synthetic remedies not included in the Pharmacopoeia, the scientific and chemical name given in the British Pharmaceutical Codex.|$|E
25|$|Adoption of telepharmacy in Canada {{began as}} a {{response}} to a nationwide shortage of pharmacists. Canada's first telepharmacy service was started by a hospital in Cranbrook, British Columbia, in June 2003 in order to assist a hospital in a nearby town that was unable to hire a pharmacist. To meet the need for service, a hospital pharmacist in Cranbrook began using telepharmacy technology to oversee pharmacy technicians at the other hospital. A similar service was subsequently extended to other small hospitals in the province; it is also used to provide coverage when a hospital's sole pharmacist is absent due to illness or vacation. Remote dispensing machines for medication began operation in Ontario, Canada, in 2007. After a patient inserts a prescription into the dispensing machine, the prescription is scanned and the patient is connected by telephone videoconference to a pharmacist at a remote site. <b>The</b> <b>pharmacist</b> reviews the prescription, discusses the patient's medication history, and authorizes the machine to dispense medication to the patient. The machines proved successful, with one assessment revealing that 96% of patients using them had their prescription filled in under five minutes. As of 2009, a hospital in Ontario, Canada, was using telepharmacy services in addition to retaining a pharmacist at the hospital; the telepharmacist reviews medication orders, while the on-site pharmacist works with patients and oversees medication safety in the facility. Thus telepharmacy support allows the on-site pharmacist to focus on the more sensitive and nuanced tasks for which physical presence is most helpful.|$|E

25|$|The {{advances}} {{made in the}} Middle East in botany {{and chemistry}} led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote {{one of the most}} valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of <b>the</b> <b>pharmacist.</b> Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.|$|E

He drove Hicks-Beach home for about 8:00pm, not in his Mercedes-Benz, but in [...] "an old, dark and scruffy Ford", possibly the Ford Corsair he borrowed from Michael Stoop several weeks earlier. At 8:30pm he called the Clermont to check on a reservation for dinner with Greville Howard and friends.
