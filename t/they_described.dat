5|$|Paleontologists Jose Bonaparte and Fernando Novas {{coined the}} name Abelisauridae in 1985 when <b>they</b> <b>described</b> the eponymous Abelisaurus.

The very common suffix -idae is usually applied to zoological family names and is derived from the Greek suffix -ιδαι/-idai, which indicates a plural noun.|$|E

5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with {{plants in the}} Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features <b>they</b> <b>described</b> as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, rather than 34cm), a wider range in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, rather than generally 56, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards rather than downwards, and leaflets having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins.|$|E

5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed {{the high rate of}} thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; <b>they</b> <b>described</b> the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as a}} diagnostic test.|$|E
5|$|Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes {{largely from the}} choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies <b>they</b> <b>described.</b> Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. For example, in 15 BC the philosopher and writer Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing. The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital. Around 180 AD, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings. Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known zoetrope lamp.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} paper in which <b>they</b> <b>described</b> Lundomys, Voss and Carleton also, {{for the first}} time, {{diagnosed}} the tribe Oryzomyini in a phylogenetically valid way. Previously, Oryzomyini had been a somewhat loosely defined group defined among others by a long palate {{and the presence of}} a crest known as the mesoloph on the upper molars and mesolophid on the lower molars; this crest is absent or reduced in Holochilus and Lundomys. Voss and Carleton recognized five synapomorphies for the group, all of which are shared by Lundomys; the placement in Oryzomyini of Lundomys and of three other genera—Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys, and Zygodontomys—which also lack complete mesoloph(id)s has been universally supported since.|$|E

5|$|On September17, a {{hurricane}} {{was observed in}} the mid-Atlantic by the bark Phantom. Later that day, the Phantom sank, though all of the crew survived. <b>They</b> <b>described</b> {{the system as a}} 'perfect hurricane' with a lull around midnight on September17 before the wind changed direction and blew with even greater force than before. The hurricane continued travelling on a northwest track and between September22 and the night of September23 it was encountered by the Hudson, the City of Washington and the bark Lanark. The system weakened to a tropical storm early on September24 and dissipated later that day about 610mi (980km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Until reanalysis, this storm was considered two separate systems, including in the 1995 study by Partagas and Diaz. However, they stated that further information could indicate a single storm.|$|E
5|$|On the Israeli side, several {{leaders of}} the Jewish city sent {{emergency}} telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where <b>they</b> <b>described</b> the situation as desperate {{and that they could}} not hold out more than two weeks. Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the Arab State according to the terms of the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with King Abdullah This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered that there were other military priorities at that moment, in particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben-Gurion set Israeli military policy. This difference in strategy influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few people}} visited the cave during the next decade. Among them was Thomas Condon, {{professor}} of geology at the University of Oregon. Guided by Davidson's brother, in 1884 he {{and a group of}} students hiked from Williams to the cavern, which they inspected by candlelight. Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, an acquaintance of the Davidson family, tried to develop the cave as a business. Burch and his partners opened what they called Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water <b>they</b> <b>described</b> as medicinal. Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to the cave from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888.|$|E

5|$|Parish and Shaw did {{not mention}} what time of year the {{tradition}} took place on or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse. Doel thought it likely that neither Parish or Shaw had ever seen a hooden horse, and that instead their information was based on older written sources. He also thought it noteworthy that <b>they</b> <b>described</b> the tradition using the past tense, indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying {{at the time of}} writing. However, Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|The Luna Defense Line {{was planned}} {{to create a}} series of delaying battles from Caloocan to Angeles, Pampanga, as the Republic was {{constructing}} a guerrilla base in the Mountain Province. The base was planned {{to be the last}} stand headquarters of the Republic in the case the Americans broke through the Defense Line. American military observers were astonished by the Defense Line, which <b>they</b> <b>described</b> as consisting of numerous bamboo trenches stretching from town to town. The series of trenches allowed the Filipinos to withdraw gradually, firing from cover at the advancing Americans. As the American troops occupied each new position, they were subjected to a series of traps that had been set in the trenches, which included bamboo spikes and poisonous reptiles.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca {{period is}} {{commonly}} set commencing from 800 AD and lasting until the Spanish {{conquest of the}} Muisca in 1537, although regional variations of the start dates are noted. The Early Muisca Period, roughly defined from 800 to 1000 AD, showed an increase in long-distance trade with the Caribbean coastal indigenous populations, mummification {{and the introduction of}} goldworking. The transition between Early Muisca and Late Muisca is defined by a more complex society, interregional trade of pottery, population growth and settlements of larger sizes closer to the agricultural lands. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived on the Altiplano, <b>they</b> <b>described</b> a concentration of settlements on the flatlands of the Bogotá savanna.|$|E
