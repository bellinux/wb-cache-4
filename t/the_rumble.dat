5|$|On the 3 January 2014 on SmackDown, the Rhodes Brothers {{defeated}} Luke Harper and Erick Rowan, {{members of}} the Wyatt Family to retain the title and marked their first win of the year. They once again defended the gold on the special Old School Raw episode when they won against the Real Americans. However, on the 17 January episode of SmackDown, the half-brothers were defeated in a non-title match by the New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) after a distraction from the General Manager of SmackDown Vickie Guerrero. As a result, the Outlaws were named the number one contenders of the title. At the Royal Rumble pre-show, on 26 January the Outlaws defeated the Brotherhood to end their championship reign. Later that day on the Royal Rumble main show, the Rhodes Brothers participated in <b>the</b> <b>Rumble</b> match; Goldust eliminated Cody, but was then quickly eliminated. The following day on Raw, their rematch for the tag team belts was inconclusive when the Brotherhood were attacked by Brock Lesnar. Thus, the Brotherhood received another rematch but in a steel cage; they ended up losing to the Outlaws.|$|E
5|$|With The Legacy finally formed, Manu and Snuka {{still wanted}} revenge on Orton. Fearing {{they would try}} to {{convince}} Raw general manager Stephanie McMahon to fire him, Orton went to speak to her himself but their conversation ended in an argument. When Vince McMahon, Stephanie's father, made his return that night Orton maintained he was owed an apology. His brashness angered McMahon who responded by trying to fire Orton, but before he could finish his sentence Orton slapped McMahon and gave him a running punt which left him hospitalized in the storyline. During the 30-man Royal Rumble match that Sunday the group worked as a team, making them three of the last four contestants in the ring with Triple H as the other. Ultimately, in throwing out Rhodes and DiBiase, Triple H was distracted enough to allow Orton to throw him over the top rope and win the match. The next evening on Raw, The Legacy came to the ring accompanied by lawyers and doctors, with Orton explaining his outburst against McMahon was a result of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) and threatened to sue the company and cancel WrestleMania XXV if he was fired, as winning <b>the</b> <b>Rumble</b> guaranteed him a championship match at WrestleMania. Instead he was booked for a no holds barred match with Vince's son, Shane, at No Way Out in February, which Orton won. The night after the event, they fought again until Orton punted Shane unconscious. Stephanie McMahon came to the ring to oversee her brother being carried away by the paramedics and shouted at Orton until he performed an RKO, his finishing move, to her.Triple H ran to the ring and chased away the group, standing over the body of Stephanie McMahon.The next week,Orton and The Legacy attacked Triple H.When Stephanie came out to stop The Legacy,Orton attacked and made out with her before hitting Triple H with a sledgehammer.|$|E

In the storyline, Flair taunted Savage by claiming that he had a prior relationship with Savage's wife, Miss Elizabeth. Savage defeated Flair for the title at WrestleMania. In July 1992, as Savage prepared to defend the title against The Ultimate Warrior at SummerSlam, Flair and Mr. Perfect sowed distrust between the two by suggesting that they would back one or the other during their match. They actually attacked both Savage and Warrior and injured Savage's knee, an injury that Flair exploited to regain the title in a match with Savage on September 1. His second reign was short-lived, however, as he lost the title to Bret Hart on October 12, 1992.|$|E
