40|$|I {{would like}} to start by thanking Rich Bowman for the {{invitation}} to speak today and by <b>thanking</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> for coming to hear some thoughts on ethics and biology. In thinking about a specific topic for today, {{it occurred to me}} that there are several ethical issues in biology that carry a lot of emotion. As the study of living things, biology is involved in the definition of life and the treatment of the aged and the unborn. As biologists, we are rightfully charged with consideration and protection of our study subjects, which are living things or parts of living things, and the ethical issues can get be very emotional and sometimes polarizing. As a microbiologist, I can kill billions of bacteria without guilt or judgment by animal rights activists; but there are layers of protection whenever human or other animal subjects are involved. Even rodents that are generally considered undesirable carriers of disease are afforded protection when they are part of a biologist’s experiment. I had quite a choice in picking a message on ethics in biology that can be informative and delivered in 12 - 15 minutes. One of my friends said, “There is the obvious issue, the big one, evolution. ” At first that came as a bit of a surprise to m...|$|R

Sort of [a] celebration. This happens to be a county of dry weather, and that isn’t the only thing that’s dry. Beer and “spirits fermenti” are taboo. Cokes and smokes afford the only relief. Work is increasingly difficult, but that is only the build-up for the days that lie ahead. The sooner they come, the better; it gets pretty tough to be straining at the leash.
