40|$|Seasonal {{experimental}} trawl {{surveys were}} {{carried out in the}} Northern Aegean and <b>Thracian</b> <b>seas</b> (NE Mediterranean, Greece), from summer 1990 to autumn 1993, during which a total of 172 fish species were caught. In these areas, fishing pressure is very high, since approximately 50 % of the Greek otter trawl fleet operates there, producing more than 57 % of the total demersal landings. Different statistics were used to assess spatial structure, seasonal changes and diversity of the demersal fish assemblages on the continental shelf and upper slope. The following measures were applied to the species abundance matrix: species diversity, species richness, evenness and dominance. The analysis of 501 bottom trawls revealed that, in general, species diversity, richness and evenness decreased with water depth, with the highest values at depths 200 m. The effect of depth on the diversity patterns observed was always significant, while seasonal trends were similar with those described for the overall diversity characteristics in each area. Classification and ordination methods showed the existence of 4 groups associated with the continental shelf and upper slope in each area. Classification of the top ranking species at each group and area revealed that commercially important species were dominant in the shallowest zone...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{numerical model}} {{was applied to}} simulate the Black Sea Water (BSW) outflux and spreading over the North Aegean Sea, {{and its impact on}} circulation and stratification–mixing dynamics. Model results were validated against satellite-derived sea surface temperature and in-situ temperature and salinity profiles. Further, the model results were post-processed in terms of the potential energy anomaly, ϕ, analyzing the factors contributing to its change. It occurs that BSW contributes significantly on the <b>Thracian</b> <b>Sea</b> water column stratification, but its signal reduces {{in the rest of the}} North Aegean Sea. The BSW buoyancy flux contributed to the change of ϕ in the <b>Thracian</b> <b>Sea</b> by 1. 23  ×  10 − 3  W m− 3 in the winter and 7. 9  ×  10 − 4  W m− 3 in the summer, significantly higher than the corresponding solar heat flux contribution (1. 41  ×  10 − 5  W m− 3 and 7. 4  ×  10 − 5  W m− 3, respectively). Quantification of the ϕ-advective term crossing the north-western BSW branch (to the north of Lemnos Island), depicted a strong non-linear relation to the relative vorticity of Samothraki Anticyclone. Similar analysis for the south-western branch illustrated a relationship between the ϕ-advective term sign and the relative vorticity in the Sporades system. The ϕ-mixing term increases its significance under strong winds (> 15  m s− 1), tending to destroy surface meso-scale eddies...|$|E

The species Alosa fallax (Lacépède, 1803), Alosa macedonica (Vinciguerra, 1921) and Alosa vistonica (Economidis and Sinis, 1986), are the three kinds of shad thriving in Greek waters. The Alosa fallax regularly occurs across coastal zones, mainly near estuaries, and enters the rivers such as Evros, Nestos, Strymon (Thrace and Macedonia), Pinios (Thessaly), Acheloos and Thyamis (western Greece), during the spawning period. Its presence is also confirmed in lake Vistonis, which is connected with the <b>Thracian</b> <b>Sea</b> {{and there is also}} strong evidence that it enters some other rivers such as Loudias (Macedonia), Louros and Arachthos (western Greece).

40|$|AbstractHydrographic {{data from}} the North Aegean Sea were {{used to examine the}} summer {{variability}} of surface water masses during the period 1998 – 2001. Attention was placed on the surface hydrographic features of the area, such as the Black Sea Water (BSW) plume expansion, the frontal characteristics of the BSW with the Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) and the variability of submesoscale hydrographic features (such as the Samothraki Anticyclone). Strong southerly wind stresses were found responsible for relaxing the horizontal density gradients across the BSW-LIW frontal zone and displacing this front to the north of Lemnos Island, thus suppressing the Samothraki Anticyclone towards the <b>Thracian</b> <b>Sea</b> continental shelf. Under northerly winds, the BSW-LIW front returns to its regular position (south of Lemnos Island), thus allowing the horizontal expansion of the Samothraki gyre up to the Athos Peninsula.

40|$|Exploitation {{patterns}} of the common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, in two Mediterranean areas were studied in three ports, two in the <b>Thracian</b> <b>Sea</b> (Greece, Eastern Mediterranean) {{and one in the}} Catalan Sea (Spain, Western Mediterranean). The study period of one year (July 1998 -June 1999) included a monthly collection of data on commercial landings, fishing effort and length distribution of O. vulgaris. Many gears exploit this species in both areas. Specialised and highly productive artisanal gears (fyke nets, pots and traps) have been developed. Herein it is shown that: (1) trawls are responsible for most octopus landings; (2) trawls exploit mostly the small and immature individuals while the artisanal fleets exploit the large and mature ones; (3) there is a marked seasonality of catches; (4) {{there is little or no}} interaction between the gears fishing octopus, indicating that each gear affects a certain size range; (5) and the octopus specimens from the Greek area are clearly smaller than the ones from the Spanish area.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Seasonal {{experimental}} trawl surveys (fall 1991 -winter 1993) {{carried out}} in the <b>Thracian</b> <b>Sea</b> and Thermaikos Gulf (N. E. Mediterranean, Greece). In this area, fishing pressure is very high, since approximately 50 % of the Greek otter trawl fleet operates here, producing more than 57 % of the total demersal landings. From a total of 285 bottom trawls sampled at depths between 16 - 420 m, 157 fish species were caught. Indices of diversity, richness, evenness, dominance and ABC plots were used to assess spatial structure, seasonal changes and diversity of the demersal fish assemblages. In general, species diversity, richness and evenness decreased with water depth, with the highest values at depths 200 m. The effect of depth on the diversity patterns observed was always significant, while no seasonal trends were detected. Commercially important species were dominant in the shallowest zone, while non-commercial species predominated at depths below 200 m. At intermediate depths (30 - 200 m) almost 50 % of the total catches comprised of non-commercially important fish species. The abundance/biomass comparison method proved a useful tool for assessing the impact of stresses on fish populations since it revealed moderate disturbance on fish communities at those depths where fishing pressure is the highest...|$|E
40|$|Age, growth, mortality, {{reproduction}} and feeding habits were analysed for Lithognathus mormyrus {{collected in the}} coastal waters of the <b>Thracian</b> <b>Sea</b> from November 1997 to September 1999. Specimens ranged from 42 to 341 mm in total length. Weight increased with size allometrically (b = 3. 242) for immature individuals and isometrically (b = 2. 960) for males, females and intersexuals. Growth was described by the standard form of the von Bertalanffy growth equation and the estimated parameters were k = 0. 21, t 0 = – 0. 996 and L? = 309. 4. Total and natural instantaneous rate of mortality {{was found to be}} Z = 0. 79 year- 1 and M = 0. 61 year- 1. Sex inversion occurred mainly between 210 and 300 mm (4 - 9 age classes). Males reached sexual maturity at 162. 1 mm (2. 5 years) and females at 190. 40 mm (3. 6 years). The spawning period occurred from May to September, while the gamete emission peaked in June-August. Stomach content analysis revealed that L. mormyrus is a carnivorous species feeding on benthic invertebrates, mainly polychaeta and bivalve molluscs. Ontogenetic variation in the diet composition showed that while growing, the fish become more generalist feeders. We also found that in the summer season the fish become more selective feeders...|$|E
40|$|The transboundary River Nestos in the Balkan Peninsula is {{a surface}} water {{resource}} shared by Hellas and Bulgaria. The Public Power Corporation of Hellas (DEH) proceeded to the dams' construction of Thesaurus in 1997 and Platanovrissi in 2000, {{to satisfy the}} increased needs for power production and irrigation in the Regions of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace in the Hellenic Territory. DEH following the Ministerial Agreement of the Hellenic Parliament "KYA 18492 / 19 - 09 - 1996 '' funded a series of Research Projects concerned on the monitoring of the water quantity and quality data of Nestos from the Hellenic-Bulgarian borders to its estuaries in the <b>Thracian</b> <b>sea.</b> "PERSEAS'' Research Group from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, carried out the research, design, construction, installation, operation and maintenance of the "R.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in the <b>Thracian</b> <b>Sea,</b> seasonally, from autumn 1996 until May 1998, using professional fishing bottom trawlers, and focuses mainly on the discarded catches and, to a lesser extent, on marketable ones, with emphasis on fishes. Sampling was conducted following normal commercial fishing practises. The duration of the fishing trips ranged from one to three days, whereas haul duration ranged from 35 to 385 min. Overall, 114 hauls were performed at depths ranging from 18. 7 to 355. 6 m. The total catch was 24376 kg (13137 kg fishes, 4410 kg crustaceans, 2141 kg cephalopods and 4688 kg of other invertebrates) in 262. 6 hours of fishing. From those, 44. 9 % were marketable, whereas 55. 1 % were discarded. In all cases fishes dominated the catch, with 52. 8 % of the mean catch being composed of fishes, 14. 7 % of crustaceans, 9. 7 % of cephalopods and 22. 8 % of other invertebrates. The discard rates did not vary significantly between the two years of study. Seasonally, the greatest discard rate was observed in autumn, while, concerning the depth zones, the lowest discard rate was recorded at depths > 300 m (36. 3 %), where only one haul was performed, whereas in the zones 0 – 150 and 150 – 300 m the mean discard rates were 56. 7 and 53. 5 %, respectively. In total, 141 fish species, belonging to 53 families, were caught. Of those, 17 were exclusively marketable, 58 discarded, and 66 species had individuals in both, the marketable and discarded fraction. The number of fish species caught did not differ with year, whereas it was much lower during spring (86 species) when compared to winter and autumn (120 and 117 species, respectively), despite the fact that haul duration was approximately the same for all seasons. The species number was negatively related to hauling depth. The most abundant fish species caught were Serranus hepatus, followed by Arnoglossus laterna, Trachurus mediterraneus, Lepidopus caudatus, Merluccius merluccius and Citharus linguatula. At greater depths, the dominant species was Gadiculus argenteus argenteus. There was a small variation of the dominant marketable and discarded species, with respect to the year of study. Length frequency distributions were constructed for the most, numerically, abundant species, both discarded and marketable, per season and depth zone. The estimation of the discarding length, i. e. the length at which 50 % of the individuals of a marketable species is being marketed, revealed {{that a large number of}} small individuals of highly marketable species, such as Merluccius merluccius, are being caught and marketed. The relationship between mean and maximum total body length and depth of capture was examined for 27 fish species and the prevailing trend was “bigger – deeper”. The number of species and families and the (number of species) / (number of families) ratio were both negatively related to depth. From the abundance – depth relationship of 55 species it was revealed that, for the majority of fish species,...|$|E
