5|$|Michael {{tries to}} {{introduce}} another murder and other twists {{to the story}} to pull his staff back into the party. This infuriates Jim to his breaking point, and they hold a private talk in Michael's office. Michael snaps at Jim and points out that he is doing this to keep the office calm. CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) finally returns <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> to Jim, and reveals that while nothing has been officially decided yet, Dunder Mifflin {{is expected to be}} insolvent by year-end. Jim hides the news from the staff and nudges them back into the party. Jim finally realizes that Michael was doing this to help his co-workers cope. At the end of the episode, Michael, Dwight, Andy, and Pam find themselves in a fake Mexican standoff lasting until 6:00 at night. Jim pulls Pam out so they can go home, and the others pretend to shoot each other to death.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Tim {{investigate}} Hank’s alibi further, and it checks out, {{leading to}} his release. Veronica and Tim find secret phone recordings kept by Hank. Veronica brings Keith the CD, but he informs her that Hank has disappeared as well. We see Hank {{showing up on}} Mindy’s boat. While listening to <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls,</b> Veronica notices Mindy and Hank talking about a place named “Papa’s cabin”. They investigate the most recent phone calls made by Hank, and find that his alibi was faked—he was helping the witness’s son escape foster care. Keith comes {{up with the idea}} that Papa’s cabin {{has something to do with}} Ernest Hemingway. Keith visits the cabin, a retreat in Central America, before boarding the motorboat. He finds Hank, who says that he was working with her to kill the Dean. He says that he and Mindy had a fight, and Mindy fell overboard. We see Mindy’s body washed up on a beach.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{brought forward}} bank statements {{that showed that}} Cisneros withdrew US$5,000 from a US$100,000 family safety deposit box on July 7, 1992 and March 3, 1993, the morning Fischer was killed. The defense stated {{that there was nothing}} illegal about visiting the safety deposit box or making the withdrawal. They stated that the US$5,000 was for a family trip to Mexico. The prosecution suggested that the money was to pay off the murderers, but they were unable to provide evidence linking the two actions. On May 11, the defense introduced two witnesses to rest their case after six days of prosecution arguments. Most of the testimonies from the prosecution that day were done by Garza, who stated that Martínez never mentioned Cisneros's name as the person of who she was working with to have Fischer killed. Garza stated that he consulted Martínez on his marriage, but that she would interrupt to ask him if he had found anyone who was willing to carry out her client's request and hurt Fischer. Garza claimed that he had at least four calls from phone booths in San Fernando and Matamoros, two Mexican cities. The defense stated that Garza told the FBI that he made collect calls, but Garza said they were mistaken. He said that making collect calls from Mexico was difficult, though he did not discard the possibility of having made one to Martínez. The prosecution did not enter evidence showing that Garza made calls from Mexico to the U.S., and one of the defense witness showed that Martínez's phone bill did not have any collect calls from Matamoros. The defense stated that Garza made the claim of <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> from Mexico to get a reduced sentence, while Garza responded that he was testifying to make sure everyone involved in the murder gets punished. The defense responded by showing the jury letters from Garza's jail stating {{that he was willing to}} cooperate with the FBI in the trial for a reduced sentence. Garza responded by saying that those letters were written by one of his English-literate inmates on his behalf. The other defense witness was a restaurateur who saw Cisneros a few hours after the murder and recalled seeing her behaving normally.|$|E

40|$|We studied whether pharmacists {{involved}} in dis-charge planning can improve patient satisfaction and outcomes by providing telephone follow-up after hospital discharge. We conducted a randomized trial at the General Medical Service {{of an academic}} teaching hospital. We enrolled General Medical Ser-vice patients who received pharmacy-facilitated dis-charge from the hospital to home. The intervention consisted of a follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> by a pharmacist 2 days after discharge. During <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call,</b> phar-macists asked patients about their medications, in-cluding whether they obtained and understood how to take them. Two weeks after discharge, we mailed all patients a questionnaire to assess satisfaction with hospitalization and reviewed hospital records. Of the 1, 958 patients discharged from the General Medical Service from August 1, 1998 to March 31, 1999, 221 patients consented to participate. We ran-domized 110 to <b>the</b> intervention group (<b>phone</b> <b>call)</b> and 111 to the control group (no <b>phone</b> <b>call).</b> Patients returned 145 (66 %) surveys. More patients in <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> than <b>the</b> no <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> group were satis-fied with discharge medication instructions (86 % vs. 61 %, P 0. 007). <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> allowed pharmacists to identify and resolve medication-related problems for 15 patients (19 %). Twelve patients (15 %) con-tacted by telephone reported new medical problems requiring referral to their inpatient team. Fewer pa-tients from <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> group returned to the emergency department within 30 days (10 % <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> vs. 24 % no <b>phone</b> <b>call,</b> P 0. 005).

O'Malley threatened to leave the coalition if Haughey did not sack Lenihan, which he did. Lenihan's dismissal damaged Haughey's standing in the Fianna Fáil organisation.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Little {{is known}} about the {{long-term}} effects of interventions aimed at increasing turnout among voluntary blood donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We use a retrospective natural experiment with all 40, 653 donors who were repeatedly invited to blood drives in Zurich, Switzerland, between 2010 and 2013. The intervention is a quasi-randomized <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> informing donors of a current shortage of their blood type. The panel structure of the data allows identification of different types of donors reacting to <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call.</b> RESULTS Our analysis reveals two types. Type 1 donors make up 27. 1 % of the population. They are highly motivated and exhibit a baseline donation rate of 59. 4 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> raises their probability to donate by 9. 9 % at the upcoming blood drive (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). However, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> reduces their donation rate by 2. 3 % (p[*]=[*] 0. 003) at each future blood drive. In contrast, the 72. 9 % of Type 2 donors exhibit a low baseline donation rate of 5. 8 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> raises their probability to donate by 5. 8 % at the upcoming blood drive (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> leads to habit formation in Type 2 donors and increases their donation rate by 2. 1 % at the next blood drive (p[*]=[*] 0. 03). CONCLUSION Behavioral interventions are effective at increasing donation rates in the short run. However, they can crowd out the intrinsic motivation of the most motivated donors. Thus, blood donation services should avoid interventions for highly motivated donors and target them at irregular donors. Our results also sound a warning on using other interventions...|$|R
