500|$|Beyond this, Jack Warner {{was shaken}} by the 1936 murder of studio {{salesman}} Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in Berlin. Warner later described the incident in the following terms: [...] "Like many an outnumbered Jew he was trapped in an alley. They [...] hit him with fists and clubs and then kicked <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>out</b> of him with their boots and left him dying there." [...] Hence, while other Hollywood studios sidestepped the issue, fearing domestic criticism {{and the loss of}} European markets, Warner Brothers produced films that were openly critical of Nazi Germany.|$|E
500|$|Although Marge is {{her most}} famous character, Kavner's {{favorite}} characters to voice are her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier because [...] "they're really funny and sad {{at the same}} time". Series creator Matt Groening instructed Kavner to voice the duo as characters who [...] "suck <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>out</b> of everything". Both have similar raspy voices, but Patty's voice is more masculine and has a lower register, while Selma's voice is a little sweeter. Kavner also provides the voices of every other female member of the Bouvier family, including Marge's mother Jacqueline, Great-Aunt Gladys (a dead relative who was introduced on season four's [...] "Selma's Choice"), and an unnamed grandmother seen on the season six episode [...] "Fear of Flying".|$|E

Tensions were escalating, as arguments broke out at the studio, and Hawkins said he [...] "didn't feel we were much of a band" [...] as there was much animosity among the bandmembers.

500|$|After Harrison turned 18 and the {{immigration}} problems had been solved, the Beatles {{went back to}} Hamburg for another residency at the Top Ten Club, playing from 27 March to 2 July 1961. To secure their return, Eckhorn paid DM 158 to the German authorities, which was the cost of deporting McCartney and Best back to Liverpool the previous winter. Fellow musician, Tony Sheridan, later remembered the living conditions at the club: “John, George, Paul, Stuart and Pete and I were booked to open the smart Top Ten in the Reeperbahn. We moved into a dormitory over the club and slept in bunks. It was terrible really, now I look back. We all washed our own shirts and socks so the place smelt like a Chinese laundry.

[...] He also opined that Kirshner's portrayal of Jenny's [...] "vanity and chameleon-like qualities" [...] was perhaps too convincing. He perceived scriptwriters as eventually understanding the [...] "profundity of Jenny's annoying effect", and decided to escalate it. Gilbert concluded that in early seasons, when writers wanted the audience's sympathy with Jenny's journey of self-realization, he [...] "wanted her to leave The Planet for good." [...] Regarding Jenny's mental state, Lydia Martin from The Miami Herald quipped [...] "(Marina) sauntered into The Planet just to fuck with Jenny's head. As if Jenny's head needed the encouragement".|$|E

Letters praising the production {{were sent to}} the BBC's listings magazine, the Radio Times, while the writer and producer were also applauded by readers of TV News magazine, which nominated them for one of the publication's [...] "TV Bouquet" [...] awards. Looking back at The Quatermass Experiment in a 1981 article for The Times, journalist Geoffrey Wansell highlighted the finale:"Westminster Abbey undoubtedly dominated television during the summer of 1953 but it was not just the Coronation of the Queen that sticks in my mind now. It is also the memory of Professor Bernard Quatermass grappling with the pulsating giant plant that threatened to destroy the world from its rooting place in the Abbey's nave… The Quatermass Experiment frightened <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>out</b> of a vast new generation of television viewers whose sets had been acquired in order to watch the Coronation… Quatermass {{was one of the first}} series on British television to make life seem potentially terrifying." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} using entirely analogue equipment until post-mastering.

[...] According to Grohl, the analog strategy would make the record [...] "sound rawer and somewhat imperfect", something which guitarist Chris Shiflett agreed was beneficial, declaring that [...] "rock n'roll is about flaws and imperfections". Bassist Nate Mendel added that [...] "we grew up making records on tape, which has a certain sound, certain limitations", and drummer Taylor Hawkins said that the digital recording in contemporary rock n' roll lead to an artificial sound : [...] "they kinda played it and then how someone else manipulated it in a computer, to make them sound a certain way." [...] Hawkins believed an analog project would help the band reclaim its artistic freedom.|$|E
500|$|Patty and Selma Bouvier, both {{voiced by}} Julie Kavner, are Marge's older twin sisters. They are {{apparently}} in their mid-to-late 40s, since Selma {{has gone through}} menopause and they were shown as teenagers in flashbacks while Marge was still a small child. They work at the Springfield Department of Motor Vehicles, and possess a strong dislike for their brother-in-law, Homer. Selma is the elder by two minutes, possesses a strong desire for family, and has been married and divorced five times, and also sought {{to have a child}} on numerous occasions despite her age. Her sister, Patty, is one of the show's few openly gay (or bisexual, as she once commented [...] "there go the last remaining threads of my heterosexuality") recurring characters although for the most part she has avoided relationships. Kavner voices them as characters [...] "who suck <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>out</b> of everything". Kavner makes Patty's voice more masculine and a lower register, while Selma's voice is a little sweeter. The origins of their names are unknown – Matt Groening has a sister named Patty, but unlike the other Simpson relatives, this has not been explicitly revealed.|$|E

500|$|Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George, Laura Elena Harring) {{is little}} more than a face in a photo and a name that has {{inspired}} many representatives of some vaguely threatening power to place her in a film against the wishes of Adam. Referred to as a [...] "vapid moll" [...] by one reviewer, she barely makes an impression in the first portion of the film, but after the blue box is opened and she is portrayed by Laura Elena Harring, she becomes a full person who symbolizes [...] "betrayal, humiliation and abandonment", and is the object of Diane's frustration. Diane is a sharp contrast to Camilla, who is more voluptuous than ever, and who appears to have [...] "sucked <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>out</b> of Diane". Immediately after telling Diane that she drives her wild, Camilla tells her they must end their affair. On a film set where Adam is directing Camilla, he orders the set cleared, except for Diane—at Camilla's request—where Adam shows another actor just how to kiss Camilla correctly. Instead of punishing Camilla for such public humiliation, as is suggested by Diane's conversation with the bungling hit man, one critic views Rita as the vulnerable representation of Diane's desire for Camilla.|$|E
500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>out</b> of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E
