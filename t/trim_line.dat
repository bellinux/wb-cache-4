25|$|Geologists {{searching for}} oil in Alaska in 1953 {{observed}} that in Lituya Bay, mature tree growth did not extend to the shoreline {{as it did in}} many other bays in the region. Rather, there was a band of younger trees closer to the shore. Forestry workers, glaciologists, and geographers call the boundary between these bands a <b>trim</b> <b>line.</b> Trees just above the <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> showed severe scarring on their seaward side, whilst those from below the <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> did not. The scientists hypothesized that there had been an unusually large wave or waves in the deep inlet. Because this is a recently deglaciated fjord with steep slopes and crossed by a major fault, one possibility was a landslide-generated tsunami.|$|E
25|$|There are no tiles, <b>trim</b> <b>line,</b> or mosaics on {{the track}} walls. East of this station (railroad north), the line goes under the East River to Long Island City, Queens.|$|E
25|$|Few {{changes were}} seen for 1983. The Series 50 Eagle Kammback and Series 30 Eagle 2-door sedans were both {{dropped from the}} line, due to slow sales. The Series 30 Eagle sedan lost its Limited <b>trim</b> <b>line,</b> leaving only the base model in the Eagle sedan line. The Series 50 SX/4 and Series 30 wagon {{continued}} basically unchanged. All were measures to save production costs by pruning the slow-selling models from the line, thereby streamlining their processes by reducing production variations, and therefore, complexity.|$|E
5000|$|The Airwave {{was sold}} in two <b>trim</b> <b>lines,</b> the basic [...] "G" [...] model, and the well-equipped [...] "L" [...] model. Each of the <b>trim</b> <b>lines</b> had an {{optional}} panoramic glass sunroof that covered {{a large part of}} the roof. Each version of the car was available in either front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Trimmer</b> <b>lines</b> {{of various}} {{thickness}} {{can be used}} as filament for 3D printers.|$|R
5000|$|Round shaped 0.65mm <b>trimmer</b> <b>lines</b> can be use as {{replacement}} nibs for Wacom drawing tablet pens.|$|R
25|$|The 1969 {{model year}} brought few modifications. Exterior changes {{included}} a new grille with a center divider and new longitudinal taillights, both designed by Harvey J. Winn. A new <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> called the Special Edition (SE) was added. This could be available by itself or {{together with the}} R/T, thus making an R/T-SE. The SE added leather inserts to the front seats only, chrome rocker moldings, a wood grain steering wheel, and wood grain inserts on the instrument panel. A sunroof {{was added to the}} option list, but was ordered on only 260 Chargers. The bumble bee stripes returned as well, but were changed slightly. Instead of four stripes, it now consisted of a wide stripe framed by two smaller stripes. In the middle of the stripe, an R/T cutout was placed. If the stripe was deleted, a metal R/T emblem was placed where the R/T cutout was. Total production was around 89,199 units.|$|E
25|$|The Prevé {{made its}} debut in Australia on 18 October 2012 at the 2012 Australian International Motor Show. Only the CamPro IAFM+ {{variants}} were made available at the Australian launch, but the turbocharged CamPro CFE model was delayed to a November 2013 launch instead. The Prevé {{was introduced in the}} Thai market during the Thailand International Motor Expo on 28 November 2012. It has been tuned to run on E20 fuel and an improved Blaupunkt 2-DIN touchscreen head unit is offered in the Thai-spec Premium trim variant. In addition, a new budget-oriented Standard <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> was introduced in that market, priced significantly lower than the Executive and Premium trim variants. Brunei became the third export market to receive the Prevé on 7 February 2013, where it is made available in three variants. The Prevé was also met with a less publicized launch in Singapore during the first quarter of 2013, where it is offered in two trim lines. On 13 June 2013, Indonesia became the fourth official export market for the Prevé, where it is currently available in just one high-end variant. Proton unveiled the Prevé LE on 18 October 2013 in its domestic market, offering the 5-star ANCAP safety rated specifications of 6 airbags, ABS, BA, EBD, TCS and ESC in addition to leather seats and a special R3 bodykit, complemented by 17-inch R3 alloy rims. Only 100 units will be produced, with each retailing at RM79,688, or around RM7,000 more than the Prevé Premium trim. The Prevé also joined the Royal Malaysia Police patrol fleet in 2013, making it {{the latest in a long}} line of Proton saloon cars which include the widely used Saga, Wira and Waja respectively.|$|E
500|$|Both {{platforms}} on {{the upper}} level have a dark green <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> on a lime green border and name tablets reading [...] "BERGEN ST." [...] in white sans serif lettering on a dark green background and green border, much of which was installed during the 1990s renovations. New tiles replaced the original small [...] "BERGEN" [...] tiles, and covered existing advertisement panels. Dark green i-beam columns run along {{the entire length of}} both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate in white lettering.|$|E
5000|$|Power {{windows were}} new. Wheelbase was 120 inches. They were 212.1 inches long. A number of <b>trim</b> <b>lines</b> were available: ...|$|R

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was painted in overall cream with <b>trim</b> <b>lines</b> and number in red. The outstanding appearance was of its smooth skin and excellent finish, a virtual trademark of William Hawley Bowlus.|$|R
500|$|The platforms' {{color scheme}} {{consists}} of a light sage green <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> on a black border with [...] "75TH AVE" [...] tiled in white lettering on a black border beneath them. The name tablets have [...] "75TH AVE." [...] in white IND-custom font on a black background with a lighter green border as above. Beneath them are directional signs in white lettering on a black border. The platform columns are painted in light Nile Green and the track columns have white [...] "75TH AVE" [...] signs on them in black lettering. The former name of Puritan Avenue was still reflected on platform signage into the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|The {{station has}} two tracks and two narrow side platforms. They are column-less, except at staircases, {{and have a}} blue <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> with [...] "GRAND ST" [...] in white {{sans-serif}} font on it at regular intervals. In the original plan for the station, {{this would have been}} a four-track, two-island platform station; the Second Avenue Subway would have served the outer tracks while the Sixth Avenue Line served the inner tracks, providing a cross-platform interchange between these two lines. Although the connection only served Sixth Avenue Line trains, it was essentially {{the first part of the}} Second Avenue line that had been constructed. There is a sole mezzanine at the center of the station which has two staircases to each platform, a turnstile bank, token booth, and access to the street exits.|$|E
500|$|This {{underground}} station has two tracks and one island platform. Both track walls have a lime green <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> with a medium Kelly green border. Small [...] "205" [...] signs are placed below them at regular intervals. The platform has {{a row of}} concrete-clad I-beam columns on both sides; these are painted medium Hunter green. There is clear evidence of water damage and mold due to poor drainage in numerous areas along the platform ceiling, the wall tiles, and {{to a number of}} the support columns. The station is also notorious for having piles of trash bags on the platform and at entrances, as well as for large amounts of litter on the tracks due to an absence of trash cans. 205th Street station was declared one of the five worst in the system in terms of maintenance and appearance by the New York City Transit Riders Council in 2005, problems which have persisted into the 2010s.|$|E
30|$|Following this idea, {{the paper}} {{addresses}} in detail how multiple patches {{as well as}} <b>trimming</b> <b>lines</b> and coupling information can be conveniently treated {{in the framework of}} the proposed approach. This is levering the idea that the support (read as “cloud” or relevant control points) of integration points located at the domain interfaces (<b>trimming</b> <b>lines</b> or patch boundaries) can naturally span multiple domains. This approach thus allows decoupling the calculations between a geometrical kernel, in charge of generating suitable integration points, identifying the relevant clouds of control points and computing the shape functions, and a computational kernel completely agnostic to such geometric operations.|$|R
5000|$|The Yamaha XS400 was {{produced}} by Yamaha from 1976 to 1982. The XS250 & XS360 are nearly identical variations of the same XS400 platform. Special, Special II, and Heritage badges denoted [...] "factory custom" [...] <b>trim</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the United States, {{the lineup}} {{started out as}} Base, Highline, and Sport, with {{different}} styles and options in each line, but the lineup titles changed frequently (other <b>trim</b> <b>lines</b> included Expresso, SE, ES, SXT, ACR, and R/T).|$|R
2500|$|Each {{platform}} has {{a scarlet}} lake <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> {{with a black}} border and name tablets reading [...] "23RD ST. – ELY AVE." [...] in white sans serif letting on a black and brown background and matching scarlet lake border. Below the <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> and name tablets are small directional signs and station signs alternating between [...] "23RD" [...] and [...] "ELY" [...] in white lettering on a black border. Red I-beam columns run along both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate in white lettering.|$|E
2500|$|This {{underground}} station, {{opened on}} August 19, 1933, has one island platform between two tracks. Each track wall has a green <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> {{with a black}} border and small [...] "COURT SQ" [...] signs below it in white lettering on black background. Green I-beam columns run along {{both sides of the}} platform at regular intervals.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{offered in}} {{top-line}} Beaumont and base Invader trim, the top <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> was renamed Canso {{in anticipation of}} the Chevelle-based Acadian Beaumont which would arrive for 1964. [...] A sporty model, the Sport Deluxe (or [...] "SD"), was equivalent to the US-market Nova SS, and it also featured bucket seats, deluxe exterior trim, and special badging.|$|E
50|$|The Newport {{class has}} higher speeds and <b>trimmer</b> <b>lines</b> than the LSTs of World War II. The vessels have two huge {{derricks}} used to extend and retract a bow ramp. The 110 ft ramp has a 75-ton capacity.|$|R
50|$|The Saga FL was {{launched}} in Malaysia two weeks after its Thai unveil. It was available in two <b>trim</b> <b>lines</b> for the Malaysian market, the Standard and Executive variants respectively. Both <b>trim</b> <b>lines</b> were available in 4-speed automatic and 5-speed manual transmissions. Every Proton Saga FL came standard with 4 power windows, a feature which was warmly welcomed. Later in May 2011, a more powerful model called the Proton Saga FL 1.6 Executive {{was launched}}. As its name implies, it was powered by the 110 bhp CamPro IAFM 1.6 engine which could only be mated to the 4-speed automatic transmission. The Saga FL 1.6 came with unique alloy rims and body stickers to help distinguish it from the crowd.|$|R
50|$|As {{the glaciers}} expanded, {{due to their}} accumulating weight of snow and ice, they crush and abrade scoured surface rocks and bedrock. The {{resulting}} erosional landforms include striations, cirques, glacial horns, arêtes, <b>trim</b> <b>lines,</b> U-shaped valleys, roches moutonnées, overdeepenings and hanging valleys.|$|R
2500|$|Monza (900) [...] The {{top of the}} <b>trim</b> <b>line,</b> {{just for}} 1960–63. In 1964, it was below the Monza Spyder, which was now its own model. For the 1965–66 model year, the Monza ranked below the Corsa in trim level. After the Corsa model was dropped, the Monza was once again {{the top of the}} Corvair line for 1967–69. Monzas usually came with bucket seats (although special bench seats were {{available}} in some years). Monzas always had carpets and special trim packages.|$|E
2500|$|The Delta name in 1965 was {{an upscale}} <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> of the Dynamic 88, the Dynamic 88 Delta, {{replacing}} the previous top-series B-body Olds, the Super 88. Early '65s {{were referred to}} as Dynamic 88 Deltas, but {{within a few weeks}} after the start of the model year, Olds began marketing the line as a separate series known as the Delta 88. Other full-sized Oldsmobile model lines included the low-priced Jetstar 88, the volume-selling Dynamic 88, sporty Jetstar I and the sporty and luxurious Starfire, all riding on a [...] wheelbase.|$|E
2500|$|For 1968, {{the line}} was further {{simplified}} from nine to five models, with the 2-door coupe and 4-door sedan comprising the base line (with the 220 designation no longer used), 4-door sedan and station wagon being offered in uplevel 440 guise, and a lone hardtop coupe making up the top-line Rogue <b>trim</b> <b>line.</b> The American, along with [...] "A-body" [...] Chryslers, were the only domestics that came as a hardtop coupe model, the Ford Falcon and Chevy Nova being only available as pillared sedans (and a wagon in the Ford Falcon line).|$|E
50|$|These models varied {{significantly}} in drivetrains and available options, and included some variance in appearance, as higher <b>trim</b> <b>lines</b> added different {{front and rear}} fascia panels and surrounding trim, with the GSX model getting a notably different styling package from the others.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trim</b> <b>lines</b> {{were the}} {{stripped}} XE, volume-selling GXE, sporty SE, and luxury-trimmed GLE. The SE {{can be distinguished}} by its body-color grille, fog lights, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, and white-faced gauges. In this generation of Altima, all GLEs had leather seats standard.|$|R
50|$|In some markets, such as Australia and the US, {{only the}} Mini Cooper and Cooper S are offered. Other <b>trim</b> <b>lines</b> of note, sold in varying markets around the world, are the Mini Seven, Mini Park Lane, Mini Check Mate, and Mini Monte Carlo.|$|R
2500|$|The Regal was {{initially}} offered in base Custom and upscale Limited trim lines. In 1989, the Gran Sport <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> was introduced, featuring aluminum wheels, body side cladding and a console mounted shifter {{attached to a}} 4-speed automatic. For 1990, the Regal gained the option of the Buick 3.8 V6. The 3800 V6 was unique to the Regal, differentiating it from the mechanically similar Chevrolet Lumina, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Pontiac Grand Prix. Anti-lock brakes were made standard on all but the base Custom cars in 1992, and the grille was redesigned again for 1993. [...] Along with the new look came an electronically controlled automatic transmission and LeSabre-like rear lights and bumper.|$|E
2500|$|Changes {{were greater}} for 1976. Oval {{headlight}} bezels replaced the previous circular items. The grille shape became a stretched hexagon and included in its insert two opposing loops stacked atop {{each other and}} housing new rounded parking/turn signal lights. Front fenders were taller, with a slight finned effect. A new [...] "Custom" [...] <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> debuted, featuring a striped interior trim called [...] "Potomac", {{as well as a}} spare tire cover and other minor details. The A models were given another new striping scheme: the hockey stick-style stripe of the previous year adding a secondary extension that ran from the door-handle straight back. The X package was now available only on Custom models. Due to flagging sales, the [...] V8 engine option (now downgraded to [...] ) was cancelled at midyear, after only 826 installations. (A total of 40,994 Gremlins were equipped with the V8 engine from 1972 to 1976.) A 4-speed manual transmission was made available at midyear. Sales tapered slightly to 52,941 - a decline of 5.5%.|$|E
60|$|Next to your paling, comes your low stone dyke, your {{mountain}} fence, indicative at {{a glance}} either of wild hill country, or of beds of stone beneath the soil; the hedge of the mountains--delightful in all its associations, and yet more in the varied and craggy forms of the loose stones it is built of; and next to the low stone wall, your lowland hedge, either in <b>trim</b> <b>line</b> of massive green, suggested of the pleasances of old Elizabethan houses, and smooth alleys for aged feet, and quaint labyrinths for young ones, or else in fair entanglement of eglantine and virgin's bower, tossing its scented luxuriance along our country waysides;--how many such you have here among your pretty hills, fruitful with black clusters of the bramble for boys in autumn, and crimson hawthorn berries for birds in winter. And then last, and most difficult to class among fences, comes your handrail, expressive {{of all sorts of}} things; sometimes having a knowing and vicious look, which it learns at race-courses; sometimes an innocent and tender look, which it learns at rustic bridges over cressy brooks; and sometimes a prudent and protective look, which it learns on passes of the Alps, where it has posts of granite and bars of pine, and guards the brows of cliffs and the banks of torrents. So that in all these kinds of defence there is some good, pleasant, or noble meaning. But what meaning has the iron railing? Either, observe, that you are living in the midst of such bad characters that you must keep them out by main force of bar, or that you are yourself of a character requiring to be kept inside in the same manner. Your iron railing always means thieves outside, or Bedlam inside; it can mean nothing else than that. If the people outside were good for anything, a hint in the way of fence would be enough for them; but because they are violent and at enmity with you, you are forced to put the close bars and the spikes at the top.|$|E
5000|$|Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) and {{decreased}} towing capacity. Maximum towing capacity {{was reduced to}} 1500 lb across all <b>trim</b> <b>lines</b> (in the United States, overseas the towing capacity is double that). XT (turbo) variants use a high-torque CVT with steering wheel paddle shifter controls.|$|R
50|$|The Willowbrook Viscount (new for 1960) had puzzling <b>trim</b> <b>lines</b> {{stopping}} and {{starting in the}} middle of nowhere and an overly-bulky outline whilst the optional reverse-rake rear glass was a feature that was already dated at the time of its launch and today simply looks odd.|$|R
50|$|The {{redesigned}} C-Max features flat folding {{third row}} seats, a hands free power lift gate, rear view camera, park assist, and panoramic sunroof. HD Radio, Sirius XM, Sync, dual-zone climate control system, and navigation system come as standard or as available options {{on the different}} <b>trim</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
