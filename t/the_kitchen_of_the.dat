5|$|Until World War II, dining at Vassar was {{an elegant}} affair with table linens and serving maids, {{but after the}} war was over, these {{features}} were never brought back to student life. In 1973, the All Campus Dining Center, also called the ACDC or the Deece, opened within the building, serving as a replacement to individual dining rooms {{in each of the}} college's dormitories. The old system had proved too costly and overcrowded, necessitating the ACDC's creation. The $3.5 million renovation was conducted by Walker O. Cain and Associates, with over $1 million of the funds coming from friends and family of Babbott Ladd. An $11 million renovation in 2003 was designed by Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc. Another project, to renovate <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dining Center and adjust the locations of the building's bathrooms, is underway as of 2016. The changes, undertaken by LTL Architects, total $8–9 million.|$|E

25|$|The wreck {{triggered}} {{interest as}} carrying the lone surviving {{example of a}} Peyre et Rocher desalination system, invented in 1840 by chemist Peyre and industrialist Rocher and used on long-haul ships. The system used waste heat from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship to desalinate water in a 1.2-ton copper cubic cistern. The device was located 20 metres from the wreck.|$|E
25|$|Missing {{from view}} are the kitchen area and latrines. It {{is thought that}} the Chapel of San José, now opening into the church, was {{originally}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monastery. This chapel {{is known to have}} existed in this form at least since the 19th century. The monastery has an archive which dates back to the year 1600, which mostly records baptisms, confirmations, marriages and deaths of the local population. During the Mexican Revolution, this archive was sealed behind a wall in order to avoid its destruction.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, {{there had been}} a small inner court in this corner of the Enderûn Courtyard. This court led through the Kuşhane Gate into the harem. Today this is the gate from which the {{visitors}} exit from the Harem. Birds were raised for the sultan's table in the buildings around the gate. On the inscription over the Kuşhane door one reads that Mahmud I had <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kuşhane repaired. The balcony of the aviary facing the Harem Gate was constructed during repair work in 1916. The building's facade resembles traditional aviaries.|$|E

In 1735 an accidental fire started in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace, this fire then spread onto the thatched roof where it then spread onto the roof of the keep. The Castle was a complete ruin after this and had almost two centuries of neglect, although some of the buildings always remained in use.

Fanned by gusty winds, the fire spread through the terminal and control tower. Controllers in the tower were able to escape on an aerial ladder and air traffic was diverted to nearby Van Nuys Airport and Los Angeles International Airport for several hours. A controller communicated with aircraft using the radio in a light airplane belonging to Sky Roamers Air Travel, a flying club whose hangar was {{just east of the}} control tower. The fire, contained by about 6:30p.m., caused an estimated $2 million in damages to the terminal, tower and equipment in the tower. No injuries were reported.|$|E

5|$|Those {{with the}} skills and {{inclination}} to write Welsh recipes, the upper classes, conformed to English styles and therefore would not have run their houses with traditional Welsh cuisine. Upper-class households would take on any English fashions, even adopting English names. <b>The</b> traditional cookery <b>of</b> Wales originates from <b>the</b> daily meals <b>of</b> peasant folk, unlike other cultures where meals often started in <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gentry and would be adapted.|$|R
500|$|Conlon was {{described}} as a woman of [...] "immense Catholic faith" [...] who was protective of her son Gerry, and who held the family together with her hard work, wanting their life to be respectable, holy, and quiet.

500|$|The Elliot Lake Standard {{reported}} in 2008 on [...] "greater than normal" [...] leaks causing damages to multiple units. Starlight Cafe closed permanently, despite being profitable soon after opening, as customers would occasionally need umbrellas {{to stand at}} the take-out counter. Drip-tarps installed by the mall in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restaurant were ineffective. The cafe owner was not made aware of the leaks before starting her lease in 2007, and was successful in a lawsuit against the owner. Scotiabank had closed for a few weeks in 2008 as a precaution. (Scotiabank began construction on a new location in July 2011, to replace their mall location.) Some businesses suggested that additional leaks started after the new owner started repairs to the roof. Tenants noticed a reduced amount of traffic after leaks started, and buckets were scattered throughout the mall.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a man {{performing}} tricks with a yo-yo in a white room, accompanied by shots showing Roberts in a [...] "fashionable looking house" [...] wearing a black silk dress. Then rapid shots show her in various other outfits, including a purple velvet dress, all the time showing the man performing tricks with the yo-yo. As the chorus begins, Roberts is shown in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, along with several women dancing with her. Another shot shows {{a man and a}} woman walking through a street embracing each other. This is later interspersed with shots of a fully clothed Roberts standing in a shower cubiclem getting increasingly wet. Roberts is shown leaving the house and seeing the man with whom she had danced with another woman. She returns to the house, and the man and Roberts are seen in the kitchen area with Roberts throwing a series of objects at him.|$|E
500|$|As the {{shooting}} took place, ABC News was signing off from its electoral broadcast, while the CBS broadcast was already over. It {{was not until}} 21 minutes after the shots that CBS's coverage of {{the shooting}} would begin. [...] ABC's Howard K. Smith had signed off {{the air and the}} closing credits and advertisements were playing over a wide studio shot of the anchors and staff when a voice over alerted the audience several times to stay tuned for a special report. [...] More than four minutes passed before Smith came back on the air announcing [...] "a disturbing report that Senator Robert Kennedy had been shot". [...] During that four minutes of extended coverage, the studio camera broadcast the live panic and bewilderment in the ABC newsroom. The reporters who had been present to report on Kennedy's win in the primary ended up crowding into the kitchen where he had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability. ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported but unlike CBS and NBC, all of ABC's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white. CBS and NBC shot footage in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shooting's aftermath on color film, which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident.|$|E

50|$|Biryani is {{considered}} to be a dish of Indian origin, more prominently considered to be dish of Nizam (Ruler <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Deccan). South India has more varieties of biryani than any other part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subcontinent. Also, rice is more a staple food in South India than in <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> India. Hyderabadi biryani originated as a blend of Mughlai and Iranian cuisine in <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nizam, rulers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historic Hyderabad State. Hyderabadi Biryani is also a staple part of Pakistani Cuisine due to its exotic flavor and aromatic taste.|$|R

[...] The first of these rooms, which measured , was accessed through a trapdoor in the floor. [...] A meat hook hanging from the ceiling of a passageway near the main kitchen had to be pulled in a certain direction to unlock the trapdoor. [...] The room under the floor was reached in a similarly awkward way: if a carving above the mantelpiece was twisted in a certain way, the fireplace would move outwards to reveal a set of steps leading down to the hiding place. [...] All of the hidden rooms have now been removed or filled in.|$|E

Despite its success, the restaurant closed in December 2010.|$|E
