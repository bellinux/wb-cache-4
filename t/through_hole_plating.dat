40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} if copper nanoparticles could be utilized for two types of <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> <b>plating</b> in printed circuit boards, namely: as a catalytic material to initiate the electroless copper deposition process; and as a “conductive” layer which is coherent and conductive enough to allow “direct” electroplating of the through hole. The employment of nanoparticles means that an effective method of dispersion is required and this paper studies the use of mechanical agitation and ultrasound for this purpose. Design/methodology/approach – The paper utilized drilled, copper clad FR 4 laminate. The through holes were functionalized using a commercially available “conditioner” before being immersed in a solution of copper nanoparticles which were dispersed using either a magnetic stirrer or ultrasound (40 kHz). When the copper nanoparticles were utilized as a catalytic material for electroless copper plating, the efficacy of the technique was assessed using a standard “backlight” test which allowed the plating coverage of the through holes to be determined. As a control, a standard palladium catalysed electroless copper process was employed. The morphology of the electroless copper deposits was also analysed using scanning electron microscopy. In the “direct plate” approach, after immersion in the copper nanoparticle dispersion, the through holes were electroplated at 3 [*]Adm− 2 for 15 [*]min, sectioned and examined using an optical microscope. The distance that the copper electroplate had penetrated down the through hole was then determined. Findings – The paper has shown that copper nanoparticles can be used as a catalytic material for electroless copper plating. The coverage of the electroless copper in the through hole improves as the copper nanoparticle concentration increases and, at the highest copper nanoparticle concentrations employed, good, but not complete, electroless copper coverage is obtained. Dispersion of the copper nanoparticles using ultrasound is critical to the process. Ultrasonically dispersed copper nanoparticles achieve some limited success as a conductive layer for “direct” electroplating with some penetration of the electroplated deposit into the through hole. However, if mechanical agitation is employed to mix the nanoparticles, no <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> <b>plating</b> obtaines. Originality/value – The paper has demonstrated the “proof of concept” that copper nanoparticles can be utilized to catalyse the electroless copper process, as well as their potential to replace costly palladium‐based activators. The paper also illustrates the potential for copper nanoparticles to be used as a “direct plate process” and the necessity for using ultrasound for their dispersion in either process...|$|E
5000|$|PCB pins are {{soldered}} {{directly to}} {{a printed circuit board}} and not to a wire. Traditionally <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> <b>plated</b> (THP) board style pins were used (print) but increasingly gull wing surface mount (SMD) connections are used, although the latter frequently exhibit solder pad contact problems when exposed to mechanical stress. These connectors are frequently mounted at a right angle to the PCB, allowing a cable to be plugged into the edge of the PCB assembly. While angled connectors traditionally occupied significant room on the PCB, flat SMD connector variants are produced by various manufacturers. Electrical/mechanical anchor points (often soldered) for the connector shell and locking screws are also provided, but significantly differ in their position between US and EU connector variants, so that the correct type must be used unless the PCB was designed to accept them both. The PCB connectors are available in variants with either inch or metric pitch of the soldered contacts. Tolerances are typically large enough to allow the mounting of the smaller connectors regardless of the pitch variant used, but this does not hold true for the larger connectors.|$|R

40|$|A {{proposed}} {{method of}} design and fabrication of vacuum-packaged microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and of individual microelectromechanical devices {{involves the use of}} multiple internal seal rings (MISRs) in conjunction with vias (<b>through</b> <b>holes</b> <b>plated</b> with metal for electrical contacts). The proposed method is compatible with mass production in a wafer-level fabrication process, in which the dozens of MEMS or individual microelectromechanical devices on a typical wafer are simultaneously vacuum packaged by bonding a capping wafer before the devices are singulated (cut apart by use of a dicing saw). In addition to being compatible with mass production, the proposed method would eliminate the need for some complex and expensive production steps and would yield more reliable vacuum seals. Conventionally, each MEMS or individual microelectromechanical device is fabricated as one of many identical units on a device wafer. Vacuum packaging is accomplished by bonding the device wafer to a capping wafer with metal seal rings (one ring surrounding each unit) that have been formed on the capping wafer. The electrical leads of each unit are laid out on what would otherwise be a flat surface of the device wafer, against which the seal ring is to be pressed for sealing. The resulting pattern of metal lines and their insulating oxide coverings presents a very rough and uneven surface, upon which it is difficult to pattern the sealing metal. Consequently, the seal is prone to leakage unless additional costly and complex planarization steps are performed before patterning the seal ring and bonding the wafers...|$|R
40|$|A {{new class}} of {{polymers}} that present intrinsically electric conductivity (intrinsically conductive polymers - ICP) has been prepared and studied in the recent two decades. These conductive polymers have attracted {{the interest of the}} International Scientific Community due to the particular characteristics that they present, combining the advantages of polymer (e. g. low density, flexibility) with the electric conductivity of a metal. In the present work the research was focused in the optimization of polypyrrole’s (PPY) synthesis in laboratorial scale, the synthesis of conductive polymers with new doping ions such as and, the structure study, the temperature impact and the study of the thermal ageing phenomenon in polypyrrole’s structure and properties. The polypyrrole synthesis was made by using various methods and conditions and finally the optimal concentrations for the production of polypyrrole powder doped with PTS,, and were found. By using the optimized synthesis conductivities in the order of magnitude 102 S/cm were achieved. The use of PTS as doping ion gives to the polymer higher conductivity, while renders it more constant in the temperature impact. As it was proved the polymer’s conductivity is intensely influenced by the temperature increase which increases the rate of conductivity decreasing, {{as well as from the}} presence of atmospheric oxygen which accelerates the ageing effect. The polypyrrole’s structure was studied by using spectroscopic analytical methods such as FTIR and XPS. The structure of chemically prepared PPY follows the two dimensional model without differentiating by the doping ions which influence only the polymer’s conductivity. The oxidant (ammonium persulfate) doesn’t have a critical role in the configuration of final structure, but it can influence the conductivity, as it acts also as doping ion. The presence hydrogen bonding N-H…N, which is formed between the lone pair of electrons of the nitrogen and the hydrogen on a second -NH, was detected. The hydrogen bonding is in between the carbon layers. Deuteration of pyrrole’s monomer was achieved, while the effort for deuteration of polypyrrole was not successful. Deuterated pyrrole’s polymer was prepared only by using D 2 O instead of Η 2 Ο during the polymer’s synthesis in a dry box by using 99. 99 % N 2. The conductivity decrease that was observed after the deuteration, as well as the deuteration failure of the prepared polymer can be attributed to polypyrrole’s two dimensional structure and to lower mobility of the D atom regarding to the H atom. The polypyrrole was used for the metallization of industrial polymers/plastics such as ABS. A polypyrrole thin layer was deposited onto the ABS surface. For the polypyrrole synthesis PTS was used as doping ion and (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8 as oxidant. As it was proved, the role of oxidant is double because at the same time etches the ABS surface increasing the PPY adhesion on it. This gives us the opportunity to replace the chemical etching of ABS with chrome-sulfuric acid that is used in the classic industrial methods, giving rise to environmental problems. In the next step it was achieved the copper plating of our specimens in an electrolytic cell by applying the properly current intensity. Thus, it was proved that the deposited PPY layer onto the ABS surface has sufficient conductivity in order to be copper plated. The laboratory method that was developed is environmentally friendly, decreases considerably the steps of the conventional productive process and the water consumption, while there is no need to use precious metals (Pd). The main disadvantage is the longer time that is required for the metallization. Another application that was developed was the metallization of the Printed Circuit Board holes (<b>through</b> <b>hole</b> <b>plating)</b> which is manufactured from epoxy resins reinforced with glass fibres. Polypyrrole presented remarkable selectivity during it’s deposition onto the surface of PCB specimens, coating only the epoxy resin surface of walls of holes, leaving the copper surface untouched. The polypyrrole layer that was deposited by in situ immersion has sufficient conductivity for this application, since then the copper plating of the specimens is possible. An important advantage of this laboratory method is the less process steps concerning the graphite method that is used in our country. Besides, the proposed method is environment friendly, without the use of dangerous reagents and the wastes are limited. Polypyrrole was used for the anticorrosion protection of aluminium alloys either as conversion coating or as primer pigment. Novel polypyrrole conversion coatings were developed by in situ polymerization onto aluminium alloys specimens. ...|$|E

Depending on design requirements, double-sided flex circuits can be fabricated with protective coverlayers on one, both or neither side of the completed circuit but are most commonly produced with the protective layer on both sides. One major advantage of this type of substrate is that it allows crossover connections to be made very easy. Many single sided circuits are built on a double sided substrate just because they have one of two crossover connections. An example of this use is the circuit connecting a mousepad to the motherboard of a laptop. All connections on that circuit are located on only one side of the substrate, except a very small crossover connection which uses the second side of the substrate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract − The {{accuracy}} of coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) strongly depends on geometrical errors that effect the measurements. Several methods for mapping these errors {{have been developed}} and some have been implemented. Examples are the direct measurement analysis by means of interferometers, straight edges, squareness standards or the analysis by application of artefacts like ball or <b>hole</b> <b>plates</b> or by using the multilateration approach using high accurate tracking laser interferometers. In this paper a comparison between the well established ball or <b>hole</b> <b>plate</b> method against the new multilateration approach will be presented and discussed. The measurements were carried out on a high accurate and commercial CMM at the Physikalisch – Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) {{in cooperation with the}} National Institute for Standards in Egypt (NIS). For error mapping a ceramic <b>hole</b> <b>plate</b> 960 mm x 960 mm with a grid spacing of 60 mm and a commercial Laser Tracer (LT) were used. Both were originally developed at PTB. The result of the comparison shows that the differences between all estimated rotational axis errors are within 1 arc second. The differences of most of the translatorical errors are less than 1 micrometer. Consequently, both error mapping methods can be used alternatively. Moreover, the paper will show that the multilateration approach can cover a long range of the working volume of machines, is easy for handling, and reduces the time of measurements...|$|R

In the current work, optimization of film cooling parameters on a flat plate is investigated numerically.
