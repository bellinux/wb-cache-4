5|$|Among scientists, he {{is perhaps}} best known for his work on the {{ligament}} which bears his name.

5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> p, it is at least <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
5|$|For {{substances}} in solution the isoelectric point (pI) {{is defined as}} the pH at which the sum, weighted by charge value, of concentrations of positively charged species is equal to the weighted sum of concentrations of negatively charged species. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> there is one species of each type, the isoelectric point can be obtained directly from the pK values. Take the example of glycine, defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> {{numerical}} <b>case</b> {{study shows}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> presented new algorithm and improved Procrustes algorithm are both stable and reliable for <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> control points are distributed in 3 D, and 2 D including approximate 2 D space, and can recover at most two angles {{as well as}} all translation and scale parameters for <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> control points are distributed in 1 D space. The classic Procrustes algorithm also can compute all translation and scale parameters for all <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> control points are distributed in 3 D, 2 D, and 1 D spaces; however, it may yield a reflection rather than a rotation in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> common points are distributed in 2 D space. <b>The</b> numerical <b>case</b> study also shows the presented algorithm in this paper, and improved Procrustes algorithm is both stable and reliable when the rotation angles are big. And the presented algorithm in this paper is comparable with the classic Procrustes algorithm when the point-wise weight matrix is involved.|$|R

5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of the pipelines, and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby.|$|E
5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> severe or hazardous weather is expected.

Some {{of the most commonly}} known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E

Brayton of ScienceBlogs pointed out that Beck and his lawyers never replied to Randazza's request for all parties to stipulate to the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment in the case. Brayton observed that this was irrelevant as Beck's case was weak even when examined under the standards of the UN agency. Of Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain over to Beck after {{the conclusion}} of the case he commented that this was a wise strategic move.

5|$|During Operation Market Garden, the Allied {{parachute}} landings in the Netherlands, JG 11 {{was credited}} with 22 aircraft downed on 22 September, with two credited to Specht. Four days later, Specht claimed two RAF Hawker Typhoons near Deventer. According to RAF records only three Typhoons were shot down on 26 September; two to flak and one in aerial combat against Jagdgeschwader 53 Bf 109s near Apeldoorn. No fighters were recorded lost near Deventer. However, it may be <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> loss records were lost or not well kept, meaning Specht's claims cannot be traced and may well be accurate.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are {{not always}} seen as pests, and there are species action plans aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for hares. Opponents of coursing say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It is also <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E

5|$|Fusō and Yamashiro {{were the}} only two Japanese battleships at the Battle of Surigao Strait, the southernmost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and both were lost {{in the early hours of}} 25 October 1944 to torpedoes and naval gunfire.

One of the most notable of these in modern times is Matt Crossley, who ended his career with the Lions after playing more than 100 matches for Wycombe Wanderers. After leaving Andover in 2001, Crossley later became assistant manager at Woking where he gained notoriety in December 2006 after he headbutted an opposing player who had tried to break up a fight. Maurice Evans is another former professional who, after briefly taking over as Andover's player-manager in 1967, went on to lead Reading to the Fourth Division championship, and Oxford United to Milk Cup victory.|$|E
