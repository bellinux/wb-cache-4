40|$|Twenty {{years after}} it was proposed, STED nanoscopy has evolved into a {{powerful}} tool in far-field fluorescence imaging which achieves resolutions below 20 nm. Nevertheless, the application of STED nanoscopy in life sciences on a large scale is hindered by the high effort which the method requires. This effort is in great part due to the STED laser. So far, lasers which can be utilized for STED, e. g. <b>titanium-sapphire</b> <b>lasers,</b> show both, technical and practical shortcomings, resulting in complex nanoscopy systems. Semiconductor lasers which are compact, reliable and controllable without effort, are predestinated to improve this situation if they are adapted to meet the pulse requirements for STED. Therefore, this thesis examines the potential of different types of semiconductor lasers for STED. Fabry-Pérot laser diodes in overdriven gain switched operation are demonstrated to be suitable STED lasers. Even more suitable STED pulses, with pulse energies of up to 5 nJ in 1 ns, are obtained from a second semiconductor laser system. Based on a tapered amplifier, this system is constructed to be operated flexibly in various modes of ns pulse generation. With this semiconductor STED laser subdiffraction imaging of fluorescent nuclear track detectors is successfully performed for the first time. Thereby the size of tracks of carbon ions and protons in this material can be determined. Furthermore, a method for all-semiconductor picosecond-pulse generation at wavelengths of 532 nm, 561 nm and 593 nm is presented. This was so far not possible and provides a convenient source of excitation light for red emitting organic dyes, not only for STED nanoscopy.

40|$|The idea of terahertz-time-domain {{spectroscopy}} (THz-TDS) is {{to exploit}} a single cycle, spectrally broad THz radiation pulse to {{gain insight into}} the response of matter. Photoconductive devices and nonlinear crystals are utilized in both the generation {{as well as the}} coherent detection of THz radiation. The relatively high cost and the complexity of commonly used <b>titanium-sapphire</b> <b>lasers</b> hinder a more widespread use of pulsed THz systems for commercial applications. Er-doped femtosecond fiber lasers operating at 1. 55 μm could offer a viable alternative. In this thesis nonlinear crystals and photoconductive emitters are discussed for excitation in the near infrared (NIR) window of between 800 nm to 1550 nm. The main focus of this thesis is a detailed study of substrate materials for an interdigitated photoconductive antenna. Photoconductive antennas with microstructured electrodes provide high electric acceleration fields at moderate voltages because of small electrode separations. The scalability of these devices allows for large active areas in the mm^ 2 range, which are sufficient for excitation at large optical powers. In comparison with conventional emitter structures, these antennas have more favourable characteristics regarding THz power, spectral properties, and ease of handling. Depending on the utilized substrate material, photoconductive antennas can then be operated using different excitation wavelengths. By employing substrates with short carrier trapping times these antennas can be operated as THz-detectors. Moreover the design of electrode structures for generating radially and azimuthally polarized THz waves are presented. A second topic deals with the signal analysis and signal interpretation of THz pulses transmitted through several material systems. These experiments show the potential for tomographic and spectroscopic applications. The third part deals with THz emission by frequency mixing in nonlinear organic and inorganic crystals. Hereby the focus is on polaritonic phase matching in GaAs. Furthermore, indications of THz tunability by the excitation wavelength were found by utilizing waveguide structures. However, the observed tuning range is much lower then theoretically predicted. Specific reasons for this are discussed...|$|E

Batch and column experiment were performed with Np(V), Gorleben sand and Gorleben humic acid. A solid-state laser system with three <b>titanium-sapphire</b> <b>lasers</b> and a Nd:YAG pump laser was installed for ultratrace analysis of Pu by laser mass spectrometry (Uni Mainz). The characterization of humic acid with Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) gave a size distribution. With Capillary Zone Electrophoresis a mass/charge distribution was obtained. Using a borate buffer containing hydroxycarboxylic acids an electrophoretic separation of humic acid in several components was achieved. Preparative Free Flow Electrophoresis and Ultrafiltration (UF) in combination with SEC allowed investigations of the dynamics of the humic acid system. Complexation constants for Pb, Cd and Zn with humic acid were determined using Field Step Electrophoresis, Anodic Stripping Voltammetry and UF. In batch and column experiments the interaction of heavy metal complexation and sorption at a solid phase was investigated (Uni Saarbruecken). The measured complexation constants are important for predicting the migration behaviour of the actinides and the heavy metals in aquatic systems by means of transportation models. (orig.)
