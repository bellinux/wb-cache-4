5|$|In north-west Nelson, {{there are}} three {{ecotypes}} defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on limestone bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves. On the river flats, the <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> tall with narrow, lax, dark green leaves, and an uneven canopy. They resemble the cabbage trees of the North Island's East Cape. Along the coast to the far west, the <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> robust with broad, bluish leaves. The latter two forms extend down the West Coast, with the lax-leaved forms growing in moist, fertile, sheltered river valleys while the bluish-leaved forms prefer rocky slopes exposed to {{the full force of}} the salt-laden coastal winds.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the park}} {{initially}} {{had been planned}} as a pet-friendly zone, {{the decision was made}} to forbid dogs and other pets. During constructions 900 mature <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> removed, and 1000 young <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> planted. Only 38 pre-existing <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> planned to survive the construction, while 160 of the removed <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> marked for recycling.|$|R

5|$|October 4, 1866 – Force 11 {{winds are}} {{reported}} on the outer fringes of a distant hurricane. Buildings sustain roof and wall damage, <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> toppled, and several boats are damaged or wrecked.|$|E
5|$|Old Village Farm (on Fishermans Lane) {{is now the}} {{location}} of a wood yard, used since the 1930s to prepare local willow for the production of cricket bats. The <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> grown at Harbour Hill Copse, where 70 <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> felled annually for this purpose. There are approximately 1000 trees growing at any given time. The workers at the yard cut the wood into approximate bat shapes, then cure the wood in a kiln. The clefts of wood are then shipped to India where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} serious disease {{problems}} are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{grown on}} the grove of Frank Adams in Pine Island, Florida. For decades the parentage of the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> unknown but a pedigree {{analysis indicated that}} Haden was the likely parent. Scions {{were sent to the}} Sub-Tropical Research Station near Miami, Florida, and a grafted <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> planted there in 1942. A distinctive characteristic of the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> its early fruiting season, which began in May.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trees</b> <b>were</b> used in {{the gardens}} to produce fruit and for shade. 19 {{different}} species of <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> found in the gardens of Ineni, the architect to the Pharaoh Thutmose I(1504-1492 B.C.). The Pink flowered tamarisk, acacia and willow <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> common in gardens. The sycamore (Ficus sycomorus) and tamarisk <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> sometimes planted in front of temples, as {{they were at the}} temple of Nebhepetra, from the 11th century.|$|R
50|$|The age {{structure}} of British hedgerow <b>trees</b> <b>is</b> old {{because the number}} of new <b>trees</b> <b>is</b> not sufficient to replace the number of <b>trees</b> that <b>are</b> lost through age or disease.|$|R
5|$|As a drought-deciduous {{succulent}} tree, B. rupestris adapts {{readily to}} cultivation and is tolerant {{of a range}} of soils and temperatures. It is a key component and emergent tree in the endangered central semi-evergreen vine thickets—also known as bottletree scrub—of the Queensland Brigalow Belt. Remnant <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> often left by farmers on cleared land for their value as shade and fodder trees.|$|E
5|$|Because of its mild climate, many species, {{including}} sub-tropical {{species such}} as palm <b>trees,</b> <b>are</b> grown in Ireland. Phytogeographically, Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island itself can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.|$|E
5|$|Bottle <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} found planted in streets and parks, on farms, and as features in gardens. An avenue in Roma, Queensland, was planted between 1918 and 1920, each tree representing one of 93 local men killed in World War I. The species has been cultivated as an indoor plant and a bonsai subject.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large flocks, {{particularly}} when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows. Some cockatoo {{species have been}} adversely affected by habitat loss, particularly from a shortage of suitable nesting hollows after large mature <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> cleared; conversely, some species have adapted well to human changes and are considered agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|He finds Banda delightful, with {{a smoking}} volcano {{and a fine}} view from the top. The nutmeg <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> {{beautiful}} but he regrets {{the ending of the}} Dutch monopoly in the nutmeg trade, which avoided the need to levy direct taxes. The only indigenous animals, he thinks, are bats, except possibly for its opossum species.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to causing damage to buildings, termites can also damage food crops. Termites may attack trees whose resistance to damage is low but generally ignore fast-growing plants. Most attacks occur at harvest time; crops and <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> attacked {{during the dry}} season.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{listed in}} the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion A, with NRIS number 76001576.

5000|$|The Boole Tree: Prior to 1931, this <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{thought by}} some to <b>be</b> the largest <b>tree</b> in the world (although the nearby General Grant <b>Tree</b> <b>was</b> more popularly {{recognized}} as the largest at the time), but after measuring many other specimens The Boole <b>Tree</b> <b>was</b> rated at number 6, with a volume of [...] This tree has an enormous base, with a girth of over 113 ft. The <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> 267 ft tall.|$|R
5|$|Individual F. aurea <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> {{common on}} dairy farms in La Cruz, Cañitas and Santa Elena in Costa Rica, {{since they are}} often spared when forest is {{converted}} to pasture. In interviews, farmers identified the species as useful for fence posts, live fencing and firewood, and as a food species for wild birds and mammals.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that some <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> interconnected through their root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking for its presence in neighbouring trees.|$|E
5|$|Northern {{hardwood}} <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> {{common in}} the Fishing Creek watershed. Ruffed grouse are common along Little Fishing Creek and its tributaries north of Iola.
