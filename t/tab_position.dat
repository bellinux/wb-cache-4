50|$|After solidifying the <b>Tab</b> <b>position</b> in Boston and the near-west suburbs, {{the company}} joined a 1985 rush {{to capture the}} MetroWest market. Wellesley, {{formerly}} monopolized by the Townsman, a 79-year-old weekly, saw the advent of NewsWest, a regional weekly, and a new local news page at the Middlesex News daily, which also bought the Townsman that year.|$|E
50|$|In the vi {{family of}} text editors, escape {{is used to}} switch modes. This usage is due to escape being {{conveniently}} placed {{in what is now}} the <b>tab</b> <b>position</b> on the ADM-3A terminal keyboard used to develop vi, though it is now inconveniently placed. This is similar to how the extensive modifier keys in Emacs were easily used on the original keyboard (the space-cadet keyboard), being placed together, but these keys have now been spread around the keyboard, becoming more difficult to use.|$|E

40|$|The {{difference}} in dynamic {{pressure in the}} propeller slipstreams as measured by sensors is divided by the freestream dynamic pressure generating a quantity proportional to the differential thrust coefficient. This quantity is used to command an electric trim motor to change the position of trim tab thereby retrimming the airplane to the new asymmetric power condition. The change in position of the trim tab produced by the electric trim motor is summed with the pilot's input to produce the actual trim <b>tab</b> <b>position...</b>|$|E
40|$|Flow about a {{wind turbine}} airfoil with a {{deploying}} microtab device has been numerically simulated by solving unsteady turbulent compressible two-dimensional, Navier-Stokes equations with the OVERFLOW 2 solver. Using a Chimera/overset grid topology, microtabs were placed at 95 % of chord of a S 809 airfoil. Microtab heights {{on the order}} of 1 % of chord, deployed {{on the order of}} one (1) characteristic time unit were utilized. The effects of freestream angle of attack on the aerodynamic response was also investigated. Validation studies with experimental results for static deployed microtabs and a dynamically deployed spoiler were also performed to ensure accurate temporal and spatial resolution of the numerical simulations.

40|$|Very {{important}} {{requirement for}} the helicopter rotor airfoils is zero, or nearly zero moment coefficient about the aerodynamic center. Unlike the old technologies used for metal blades, modern production involving application of plastic composites has imposed the necessity of adding a flat tab extension to the blade trailing edge, thus changing the original airfoil shape. Using computer program TRANPRO, the author has developed and verified an algorithm for numerical analysis in this design stage, applied it on asymmetrical reflex camber airfoils, determined the influence of angular <b>tab</b> <b>positioning</b> on the moment coefficient value and redesigned some existing airfoils to include properly <b>positioned</b> <b>tabs</b> that satisfy very low moment coefficient requirement. ...|$|R
50|$|Vivaldi has a minimalistic user {{interface}} with basic icons and fonts, and a color scheme that changes {{based on the}} background and design of the web page being visited. The browser also allows users to customize the appearance of UI elements such as background color, overall theme, address bar and <b>tab</b> <b>positioning,</b> and start pages. According to CEO Jon von Tetzchner, Vivaldi's vast, unique customizability is {{a huge part of}} how the browser caters to power users.|$|R
50|$|Because tabs {{can be cut}} in {{different}} positions, the <b>position</b> of the <b>tab</b> {{can be referred to}} as well. For instance, for the 1/3 cut style, folders with tabs in the farthest right position are considered to have a <b>tab</b> in <b>position</b> number three.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{limitations}} of degradation mechanisms of Lead-Acid batteries, which significantly contributes unequal distribution of current (and therefore internal resistance, charge passed and power loss) {{on the surface of}} the electrodes of Lead-Acid battery. The unevenness of distribution of these parameters significantly influences the distribution of current tabs on the electrodes. In this work it was developed realistic model of Lead-Acid battery cell with plate electrodes with different variants of the distribution of current tabs. Measured results obtained in this model were compared with the results found out from the mathematical simulations. Through these simulations, it was possible to take a look deeply into the processes and changes in the electrodes of Lead-Acid batteries during discharge. Goal of this work was for predefined variants of positioning of the current tabs to simulate distribution of current, internal resistance, charge passed and power loss during discharge. Another goal was to compare the different variants and to find the optimal variant of current <b>tabs</b> <b>positioning</b> based on minimizing of unevenness of examined variables distribution...|$|R

The internal connection <b>tab</b> is <b>positioned</b> between the inner surfaces {{of the first and}} second film. Then, a conductive adhesive is applied to either the tab or to the inner film surfaces such that the inner surfaces of the film and the tab are electrically connected.

40|$|A {{saddle clamp}} {{assembly}} is presented. The assembly {{is comprised of}} a hollow cylindrical body centered about a longitudinal axis and being diametrically split into semicircular top and bottom sections. Each section has a pair of connection flanges, at opposite ends, that project radially outward. A pair of bolts are retained on the top section flanges and are threadable into nuts retained on the bottom section flanges. A base member is anchored to a central underside portion of the bottom clamp body section and has a pair of connection <b>tabs</b> <b>positioned</b> beneath the bottom clamp body section connection flanges {{on opposite sides of}} the clamp axis. A pair of bolts are retained on the base member connection tabs and are threadable into a pair of nuts retainable on a support structure. The connection tab and connection flanges on each side of the clamp body are axially offset in a manner permitting downward installation/removable tool access to the lower bolts past the connection flanges. An elongated retention tether is used to connect the top clamp body section to the balance of the clamp assembly. This prevents loss of the top clamp body section when it is removed from the bottom clamp body section...|$|R
50|$|The {{knife blade}} (dark grey) {{is locked in}} {{position}} by a spring-loaded restraining pin (yellow and red) fitting into a notch in the blade at position 1. The two spring carriers (green) fit into the spaces on the slide (blue) and this assembly rests {{to the side of}} the blade. The right spring carrier is restrained by a <b>tab</b> at <b>position</b> 2 that fits over the end of the blade. Tension on the main spring (red zig-zag) holds the other spring carrier, slide and thumb stud (light grey) to the right.|$|R

50|$|The forward wing {{was divided}} into two half spans so that their angles of {{incidence}} could be altered together to control pitch or independently for roll. The semi-spans were built around main box spars with spruce spar caps and plywood webs. Forward of the spar the wings were ply skinned, forming a D-shaped torsion box. Ribs were built from spruce trellis work. There was a secondary spar behind the main one and an over-all fabric covering. A trim <b>tab</b> was <b>positioned</b> inboard on {{the trailing edge of}} each half-span. The rear wing was similarly constructed but fixed in place. A long trailing edge flap could be raised, but not lowered, to steepen descents. The tips carried triangular endplate fins fitted with horn balanced rudders, spring centred and only opening outwards. These vertical tails were wooden structures with fabric covering.|$|R
40|$|An {{interconnect}} tab on {{each cell}} {{of a first}} set of circular solar cells connects that cell in series with an adjacent cell in the set. This set of cells is arranged in alternate columns and rows of an array and {{a second set of}} similar cells is arranged in the remaining alternate columns and rows of the array. Three interconnect tabs on each solar cell of the said second set are employed to connect the cells of the second set to one another, in series and to connect the cells of the second set to those of the first set in parallel. Some tabs (making parallel connections) connect the same surface regions of adjacent cells to one another and others (making series connections) connect a surface region of one cell to the opposite surface region of an adjacent cell; however, the <b>tabs</b> are so <b>positioned</b> that the array may be easily assembled by depositing the cells in a certain sequence and in proper orientation...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} keep <b>tabs</b> on the <b>position</b> and motion of our body in space, nature {{has given us a}} {{fascinating}} and very ingenious organ, the inner ear. Each inner ear includes five biological sensors - three angular and two linear accelerometers - which provide the body with the ability to sense angular and linear motion of the head with respect to inertial space. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a mechanical model of the semicircular canals - which behave as angular accelerometers – in a specific kinematic environment. This model, implemented in Matlab/Simulink, simulates the rotary chair testing, which is one of the usual tests carried out during a diagnosis of the vestibular system. This model also allows to simulate several head rotations, and at the same time to show the state – excited or inhibited – of each angular sensors. Therefore, the developed model can be used as a learning and demonstrating tool either in the medicine field to understand the behavior of the sensors during any kind of motion or in the aeronautical field to relate the inner ear functioning to some sensory illusions. In addition, the first results also show the influence of the non-orthogonality of the canals on the sensors stimulation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the per-formance of recognised by Italian law (tattoos) and other (ear tags and injectable transpon-ders) identification systems and to investigate if they caused different levels of short-term discomfort in piglets. Ninety-six ten-day-old piglets – equally assigned to four experimental groups – were identified with electronic ear tags (EET), transponders injected in the auri-cle base (<b>TAB),</b> in intraperitoneal <b>position</b> (TIP), or ear tattoo (T). Losses, breakages and readability of the identification devices were recorded to evaluate their efficiency. Forty-eight piglets were observed continuously for 5 min after identification. Behavioural indica-tors of pain, discomfort or ease were recorded in terms of duration of occurrence or frequen-cy. Non-parametric analyses of variance were used to compare time required for the applica-tion of the devices and behavioural reactions of piglets. No healing problems or breakages of the electronic devices were observed during the trial. The readability after nine months was 93. 8 % for EET and TIP, 86. 7 % for TAB and 0 % for T. The time required for the application dif-fered significantly (P< 0. 001) among the four identification devices. EET and TIP showed better results than T considering losses, break-ages, readability and time required for applica-tion. Behaviours most frequently recorded were head shaking and ear scratching, observed more frequently in piglets after the application of EET (P< 0. 001). The application of these identification devices caused a mild discomfort in piglets; further studies should investigate in detail the intensity and duration of reactions to the identification procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} report documents a California Polytechnic State University, Mechanical Engineering Senior Project {{sponsored by}} the gas turbine manufacturer, Solar Turbines. The senior project team consisted of four senior mechanical engineering students at Cal Poly, all with general concentrations; Ryan Bruce, Carolyn Honeycutt, Steve Oltrogge, and Emmett Ross. Kenneth Thomas sponsored the group and serves as the point of contact between the senior project team and Solar Turbines. He {{is a member of}} the Solar Turbines Mechanical Design Engineering Team and a Cal Poly graduate. Christoph Maurer served as the project team’s on-campus advisor. A gas turbine uses internal combustion to produce output shaft work and can be broken down into a “cold” section and a “hot” section. The cold section is composed of the air inlet and the air compressor, while the hot section is composed of the burner, turbine, and diffuser. This project was focused on the compressor, specifically compressor blade installation. Solar Turbines’ T 130, Mars, and T 250 turbines all contain multi-stage compressors, meaning that many sets of compressor blades spin around a single shaft to continually compress the air as it nears the burner. Many of the compressor stages are installed using a ring method, where the compressor blades are slid into large slots around the compressor rotor, radially, and held into place, axially, by a large ring. These stages require additional hardware to restrain the blades radially. However, the first several stages of the compressor use axially installed fan blades, where each blade slides into an individual slot on the rotor disk and is held in place, radially by the geometry of the compressor. These stages therefore require additional hardware to restrain the axial movement of the blades. This is accomplished via small steel retainer tabs. This project focuses on the installation of these metal retainer tabs. The current process for installing the early stage compressor blades, those requiring retainer tabs, involves several, individual, time-consuming steps. Additionally, there are numerous tools required for each of these steps and every individual installation technician can have an additional, personal set of installation tools. As a result compressor blade installation is a lengthy and imprecise process that leads to inconsistencies and risks damaging the compressor rotor. The task for the Cal Poly senior project group was to design a tool(s) and a corresponding standardized process to bend these retainer <b>tabs</b> into <b>position.</b> The sponsor, Solar Turbines, owns all Intellectual Property for the tools designed during the course of the project. In return, they provided funding for the project, access to necessary company proprietary information, manufacturing support (as needed), and general project guidance. The overall aim of this project was to design a tool or set of tools that removed as much of the variation from compressor blade retainer tab installation as possible. As well as reduced the time spent installing blades, therefore reducing the risk of damage to the turbine blades and rotors from non-standardized processes and tooling. Additionally the team focused on minimizes the number of tools used in the overall process. The final tool design consisted of two tools, a “backing” and a “bending” tool. Each should decrease the installation time, increase consistency, are more ergonomic, and are safer than the current methods...|$|R
