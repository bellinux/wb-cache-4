5|$|Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet {{was largely}} {{obsolete}} at {{the outbreak of}} World War I, and over <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the war the Austro-Hungarian Navy focused its efforts on building a U-boat fleet for local defense within the Adriatic. Beginning in 1916, the Navy began building larger, ocean-going vessels for operation in the wider Mediterranean, outside the Adriatic. With six of the larger submarines under construction, the Navy considered either building German Type UB III submarines under license or implementing the Type 1916 S 1 design submitted by Ungarische Unterseebotsbau AG (UBAG) of Fiume.|$|E

5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some {{children with autism}} reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress.

Triple Cities College offered local students <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> their education, while the following two were spent at Syracuse University. In 1946, students could earn their degrees entirely at the Binghamton campus. In 1950, it was absorbed by the State University of New York and renamed Harpur College.|$|E

Like in Seattle, he often clashed with his coach, John MacLeod, and finally was traded by general manager, Jerry Colangelo, to the Boston Celtics for Rick Robey and draft picks. Like Seattle after Johnson's departure, the Suns finished 12 games worse in the next season despite the addition of Robey.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{eventually}} {{decided to}} return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at Daventry, a Dissenting academy. Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> coursework. He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a Rational Dissenter. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the rational analysis of the natural world and the Bible.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the 1940s saw {{a growth}} in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies, with over forty {{domestic}} productions released. Following the Japanese occupation in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the ethnic Chinese-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film– Rd Ariffien's Berdjoang (Struggle; 1943)– six short films, and several newsreels. All were pro-Japanese propaganda.|$|E

5|$|After commissioning, Schlesien was {{assigned}} to the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. She served with the fleet throughout <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> World War I; by this time she had been transferred to the II Battle Squadron alongside her four sister ships. Schlesien was present at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, where she was actively engaged only briefly. After Jutland, she was relegated to guard duties before being withdrawn altogether in 1917, when she became a training ship. The Treaty of Versailles permitted the German navy to retain eight obsolete battleships, which included Schlesien, to defend the German coast. She saw extensive service with the reorganized Reichsmarine; in the 1920s and 1930s the ship was rebuilt and eventually converted back into a training ship.|$|E
