The verse [...] "Today I am dirty and I want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty,</b> tomorrow I'll know that I'm just dirt" [...] has an Iggy Pop-style vocal delivery, building to the adrenaline-fueled chorus. CMJ noted that the song {{could be interpreted as}} a tribute to the Columbine shooters, but its point was not to glorify violence; rather, it was to depict a society drenched in its children's blood.

James Griffiths of The Guardian commented: [...] "Here comes the Queen of Pop {{in a box}} so shiny you can see your face in it. Spears is described on the cover as 'the ultimate video performer', and watching the 20 promos contained within, it's difficult to argue. [...] Relentlessly thrusting herself at the camera, compulsively preening amid special FX galas, Britney is the MTV video age in human form." [...] He also complimented the innovations of the menu, but added that [...] "it's not particularly impressive" [...] and [...] "you need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> nifty with your handset to find them." [...] Music Week said: [...] "The DVD version of Spears' high-flying 'best of' set adds bells and whistles to the audio version at only a slight premium pricewise. Twenty promo videos are included, all with top-notch sound and vision". AllMusic gave the video {{four and a half}} stars out of five. Rolling Stone graded it with three out of five stars.|$|E

[...] Of the three stories, Jacobsson liked [...] "Do the Bard, Man" [...] the most, although he overall found the episode to be [...] "mediocre". Adam Rayner of Obsessed with Film wrote that, even though the episode [...] "has a few laughs", it [...] "just feels half-hearted", and, writing for 411Mania, Ron Martin described the episode as being [...] "just a lazy way out for the writers". Giving the episode a negative review, Nate Boss of Project:Blu wrote that the episode is [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "kinda annoying", and that it [...] "has been done so many times, it's hardly all that funny". On the other hand, Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com wrote that he is [...] "particularly fond of [...] " [...] and Rosie Fletcher of Total Film considered {{it to be a}} [...] "stand-out" [...] episode in the season. The Vulture column of New York magazine named it one of the ten best episodes of the show's later era.|$|E

Giving the episode a negative review, Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk wrote that it was [...] "borderline painful" [...] {{and one of the}} season's [...] "duds". Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com wrote that the episode [...] "moves at a geriatric pace", and R. L. Shaffer of IGN stated that it [...] "represent some of the worst of The Simpsons." [...] On the other hand, giving the episode a positive review, Ron Martin of 411Mania enjoyed the [...] "poke towards Branson, Missouri, a mecca for old people everywhere," [...] and Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B rating. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that, even though Grampa is [...] "essentially a one-joke personality," [...] "those gags tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> fun."

This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We always seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> fast here on the superspeedway track, so that just goes to show you how much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E

500|$|John A.

Music's Hattie Collins wrote, [...] "Despite the low-points, this is a Destiny's Child must have collection of classics from one of R's most significant talents". A more mixed review came from Fiona Mckinlay from the website musicOMH who felt the album included many [...] "skippable" [...] songs and noted that the material from The Writing's on the Wall and Survivor were the collection's best. She {{felt that the}} progress in the sound of the band was evident on #1's, but offered the opinion, [...] "As far as greatest hits albums go, Destiny's Child show themselves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> ace, but still not quite the incredible force in R". San Francisco Chronicle Aidin Vaziri criticized the songs from Destiny Fulfilled and [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] and concluded [...] "surveying Destiny's Child's entire career on this set... it's obvious their hearts slipped away around the same time Beyonce's solo album sold its first million".|$|E
500|$|David Renwick {{made the}} {{decision}} to revive Jonathan Creek for a Christmas special as a means of [...] "deferring retirement". He considered the alternative of developing an entirely new series to be too lengthy a process, and regarded reviving Jonathan Creek as the [...] "safe decision". He described the process of formulating a plot for the episode as an [...] "agony" [...] and a [...] "torment", revealing that he had stopped writing the show in 2004 partly {{due to a lack of}} ideas. Renwick explained: [...] "Inevitably, you set up a series which is all about impossibilities that then have to have a rational explanation, by definition it’s going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> challenging stuff for a writer. So God knows why I ever embarked on it in the first place." [...] As well as writing, Renwick also directed the episode, which was produced by Nerys Evans; Jonathan Creeks former Producer Verity Lambert died of cancer in November 2007. Davies noted that he and Renwick met quite regularly following Lambert's death, and when Renwick suggested to the BBC that they revive Jonathan Creek, the broadcaster [...] "bit his hand off for it". [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was commissioned by Jane Tranter, Controller of BBC Fiction, with Lucy Lumsden, Controller of Comedy Commissioning, stating that the station was [...] "delighted to have Jonathan Creek back on BBC One". Renwick was prepared for a negative reaction to the show's revival, describing how: [...] "People say, Oh Jonathan Creeks coming back. Fantastic.' And then they watch it and go: 'God, what a mistake.' Which is what happened with One Foot in the Grave. So I tend to expect the worst." ...|$|E

GameSpot awarded it an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] label, praising its storyline, the combat system and its presentation, and also stating that [...] "Crisis Core is an exciting and poignant journey that every fan of role-playing games should take." [...] IGN's Ryan Clements praised its differences from other RPGs, due to its focus on Zack's growth and {{his relationship with the}} SOLDIERs. He stated [...] "Crisis Core is a great game and, barring a few minor issues here and there, will not disappoint." [...] It also received a place amongst the [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] gallery of recommended games for the PSP platform. GameSpy also gave it a good review, stating it [...] "is equal parts tribute and original, marrying classic design choices with refreshingly new techniques, harmoniously bringing together something old with something new." [...] Gamespy also commented that although some players may dislike Zack, [...] "you'll have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> jaded for the character not to grow on you as you progress through the adventure." [...] VideoGamer.com gave an overall score of 9, finding its fighting system [...] "addictive", and arguing that its CGI scenes had a similar quality to the ones from Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Similarly, GamePro gave it a positive review, calling it the [...] "best looking PSP title," [...] and praising how it incorporated elements from the Compilation, {{and at the same time}} created new aspects. GamesRadar's AJ Glasser stated that with the DMW system, the gameplay could be easy, causing the [...] "rare gamer" [...] to try to play it in Hard Mode. Glasser also found the game likeable enough so that even gamers who dislike the Final Fantasy VII series may enjoy it. Plays Samuel Roberts called it the best game of 2008.|$|E

500|$|The user {{interface}} design (UI) for The Last of Us underwent various different iterations throughout development. User interface designer Alexandria Neonakis {{originally intended to}} integrate the weapon upgrade system into the weapon slotting system, in order to constantly remind players to upgrade their weapons. Upon further iterations, Neonakis discovered that this integration resulted in a cluttered interface. Ultimately, {{it was decided that}} the upgrade system would be integrated in the form of upgrade benches, occasionally found throughout the game's world; this also solved another problem that Neonakis witnessed, in which players would upgrade to the lowest possible option, as opposed to saving parts for the higher options. Once it was decided to split the upgrade and slotting systems, the initial design was to select the weapons from a circle. This design, eventually considered [...] "clunky and slow", was replaced in preference of a list system. Neonakis has identified that the main problem with the list design was that it forced players to focus on navigating through menus during intense combat. This led to the final design, which allows players to swap and slot weapons in the same menu. To integrate the UI into the game, Neonakis separated the individual elements and changed their format. User interface programmer Paul Burg provided Neonakis with tools to move elements using their coordinates. All animated transitions were hard coded, which led to difficulty in creating smooth transitions. [...] "This was tedious and at times incredibly frustrating, but it also meant that we all had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> creative in how things were designed," [...] Neonakis said. The game's crafting system was implemented into immediate gameplay, in order for players to feel involved. [...] "We needed to make it streamlined and fast enough that you felt like you could take just that moment and be able to craft that thing that's going to mean your survival in the next thirty seconds, or your failure to survive," [...] lead game designer Jacob Minkoff said.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E
