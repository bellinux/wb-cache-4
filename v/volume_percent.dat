40|$|The {{potential}} of 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrate ([bmim]Fe(III) Cl 4) for replacing an iron(III) chelate catalytic solution {{in the catalytic}} oxidation of H 2 S is attributed to its no side reaction and no degradation of the chelating agent. The catalytic oxidation product of water in non-aqueous [bmim]Fe(III) Cl 4 possibly {{has an influence on}} the oxidative absorption of H 2 S. Water and hydrophobic [bmim]Fe(III) Cl 4 mixtures at water <b>volume</b> <b>percents</b> from 40 % to 70 % formed separate phases after srirring, without affecting the oxidative absorption of hydrogen sulfide. Then, studies on the properties of homogeneous [bmim]Fe(III) Cl 4 –H 2 O mixtures at water <b>volume</b> <b>percents</b> in the range of 5. 88 – 30 % and above 80 % reveal that these mixtures are both Brønsted and Lewis acids at vol % (H 2 O) ≤ 30 %, and only Lewis acids at vol % (H 2 O) ≥ 80 %. Raman spectra showed that [bmim]Fe(III) Cl 4 was the dominating species at vol % (H 2 O) ≤ 30 %, in contrast, [bmim]Fe(III) Cl 4 decomposed into FeCl 3 · 2 H 2 O and [bmim]Cl at vol % (H 2 O) ≥ 80 %. Further research on oxidative absorption of H 2 S by homogeneous [bmim]Fe(III) Cl 4 –H 2 O mixtures demonstrated that [bmim]Fe(III) Cl 4 was reduced by H 2 S to [bmim]Fe(II) Cl 4 H and FeCl 3 · 2 H 2 O was reduced to FeCl 2, at the same time, H 2 S was oxidized to S 8. In addition, the decrease in acidity caused by increasing the water content increased the weight percent of absorbed H 2 S, and decreased volatile HCl emissions. However, it is difficult to prevent the suspended S 8 generated at vol % (H 2 O) ≥ 80 % from the formation of sulfur blockage. Therefore, oxidative absorption of H 2 S by [bmim]Fe(III) Cl 4 –H 2 O mixtures is feasible at vol % (H 2 O) < 80 % without sulfur blockage...|$|R

Ternary phase diagrams have been constructed at 298 K and 333 K.

The strengths of 0 degrees/ 90 degrees dual-directional composites increased with fiber content, while those of 45 degrees/ 135 degrees composites remained relatively low. The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of the composites decreased as the fiber content increased, close {{to the values of}} Mo fibers. With increasing temperature, the CTEs of unidirectional composites increased, while those of dual-directional composites decreased due to large accumulated thermal stresses. The CTEs of 45 degrees/ 135 degrees composites were lower than those of 0 degrees/ 90 degrees composites because of contraction effect. At temperatures above 250 degrees C, the CTEs of the dual-directional composites gradually increased due to matrix yielding and interfacial decohesion. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, repeated MR scanning {{of the same}} subject, even if using the same scanner and acquisition parameters, does not result in identical images due to small changes in image orientation, changes in prescan parameters, and magnetic field instability. These differences may lead to appreciable changes in estimates of volume for different structures. This study examined scan-rescan reliability of automated segmentation algorithms for measuring several subcortical regions, using both within-day and across-day comparison sessions {{in a group of}} 23 normal participants. We found that the reliability of <b>volume</b> measures including <b>percent</b> <b>volume</b> difference, <b>percent</b> <b>volume</b> overlap (Dice's coefficient), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), varied substantially across brain regions.

Patterns of reliability across regions were similar for automated segmentation with FSL/FIRST and FreeSurfer (longitudinal stream). Reliability was associated with the volume of the structure, the ratio of volume to surface area for the structure, the magnitude of the interscan interval, and the method of segmentation. Sample size estimates for detecting changes in brain volume for a range of likely effect sizes also differed by region. Thus, longitudinal research requires a careful analysis of sample size and choice of segmentation method combined with a consideration of the brain structure(s) of interest and the magnitude of the anticipated effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of nanoporous materials during their application in heterogeneous catalysis and mass separation is often controlled by their transport properties. This {{is especially true}} concerning microporous host systems such as zeolites. Today, the purposeful synthesis of “hierarchical ” nanoporous materials, i. e. materials containing both micro- and mesoporous regions, offers the opportunity of promoting the rate of molecular transport {{by the presence of}} mesopores. At the same time, the functionality of the material is preserved owing to the contents of micropores. The incorporation of mesopores into microporous materials, however, does not automatically lead to transportpromoted nanoporous materials. Understanding of this phenomenon is, therefore, of immediate importance, but is still precluded by the lack of systematic experimental studies of transport properties in such hierarchical pore systems.
