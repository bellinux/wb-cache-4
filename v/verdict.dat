5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired <b>verdict,</b> its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a <b>verdict.</b> The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual <b>verdict,</b> prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Coroners' death {{certificates}} {{form the}} basis of suicide statistics in England and Wales. Recent increases in coroners' use of narrative <b>verdicts</b> may affect the reliability of local and national suicide rates. METHOD: We used Ministry of Justice data on inquests held between 2008 and 2009 and Local Authority suicide data (2001 - 02 and 2008 - 09) to investigate variations between coroners in their use of narrative <b>verdicts</b> and the impact of these on suicide rates, using 'other' <b>verdicts</b> (79 % of which are narratives) as a proxy for narrative <b>verdicts.</b> RESULTS: There was wide geographic variation in Coroners' use of 'other' (mainly narrative) <b>verdicts</b> [...] they comprised between 0 and 50 % (median = 9 %) of <b>verdicts</b> given by individual coroners in 2008 - 09. Coroners who gave more 'other' <b>verdicts</b> gave fewer suicide <b>verdicts</b> (r = - 0. 41; P < 0. 001). In the 10 English Coroners' jurisdictions where the highest proportion of 'other' <b>verdicts</b> were given, the incidence of suicide decreased by 16 % between 2001 - 02 and 2008 - 09, whereas it did not change in areas served by the 10 coroners who used narratives the least. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in Coroners' use of narrative <b>verdicts</b> influences the validity of reported regional suicide rates. Small-area suicide rates, and changes in these rates over time in the last decade, should be interpreted with caution...|$|R

50|$|According to a February 2016 {{report by}} FOL, an {{accountability}} NGO in Kosovo, {{during the first}} 7 years of operation up until August 2015, EULEX judges delivered 47 <b>verdicts</b> on corruption cases and 23 <b>verdicts</b> on organised crime. This makes a total of 70 <b>verdicts</b> in these respective crimes since 2008. Numbers of convictions resulting from these <b>verdicts</b> was not provided to the researchers. In this period, EULEX prosecutors gained 24 indictments which amount to approximately a 6% indictment rate.|$|R
5|$|After a 17-month trial, {{the often}} tumultuous {{proceedings}} {{ended with a}} guilty <b>verdict</b> on July 8, 1912. The defendants, including 27 leading Camorra bosses, were sentenced {{to a total of}} 354 years' imprisonment. The main defendants Enrico Alfano and Giovanni Rapi were sentenced to 30 years. The priest Vitozzi received seven years and government witness Abbatemaggio five years. The jury had been held in isolation since March 1911. The reports of the proceedings were about 40,000 pages in 63 volumes. In his last statement before the <b>verdict,</b> a furious Alfano accused the authorities to have killed his brother Ciro, who had died in prison. Another defendant, Gennaro De Marinas, who was sentenced to 30 years as well, slashed his throat with a piece of glass in the Court when the <b>verdict</b> was delivered.|$|E
5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty <b>verdict.</b> The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the <b>verdict,</b> ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people {{inside and outside the}} courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the <b>verdict</b> was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty <b>verdict</b> convicting Frank of murder.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} discourse structure aspects, discourse-making components, and discourse context of judicial minutes and <b>verdicts</b> by Mahkamah Konstitusi Republik Indonesia. The {{focus was on}} the discourse of judicial minutes and <b>verdicts</b> by Mahkamah Konstitusi Republik Indonesia regarding the test of the substance by DPD on Keppres No. 185 /M/ 2004. The study was conducted by employing the discourse analysis approach, {{in terms of the}} micro-structural and macro-structural aspects. The conclusions are as follows. First, the structure of the minutes consists of the cover, information, and content, while that of the <b>verdicts</b> consists of the title and number, heading, inquirer and responder data, problems, responses, problem focuses, judge <b>verdicts,</b> different opinions, and signatures. Second, the discourse-making components in the judicial minutes and <b>verdicts</b> by MKRI comprise long sentences, legal language registers, parallelisms, honorifics, repetitions, and conjunctions. Third, the discourse context consists {{of the history of the}} existing conflicts among DPD, the government, and DPR, and the context of the minutes and <b>verdicts</b> based on the social context...|$|R
5|$|In 2009, a {{jury found}} for Heffernan and awarded him damages {{from the police}} {{officials}} and the city. Despite the <b>verdict,</b> Heffernan sought a retrial because Judge Peter G.

While considering these motions, Judge Sheridan became aware of a conflict of interest through a former law firm and set aside the <b>verdict,</b> setting a new date for trial before Judge Dennis M.

5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide.

5|$|On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for {{the murder}} of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team {{comprised}} solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their <b>verdict.</b> After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a <b>verdict</b> of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their <b>verdict</b> until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40p.m., they returned with a unanimous <b>verdict</b> of guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by hanging.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine children's {{participation}} in court proceedings on supervised visitation and to analyse the descriptions of children in court <b>verdicts.</b> Eleven <b>verdicts</b> concerning supervised visitation resolved in 2014 were collected from two district courts in Stockholm County and studied with a qualitative textual analysis. The material was analysed with participation levels influenced by the ladder of participation for children developed by Roger Hart and with the theory of sociology of childhood. Our findings showed that children's opinions were mentioned in eight of the <b>verdicts.</b> In four <b>verdicts</b> the children's will influenced the courts decisions. The children’s will was in none of the <b>verdicts</b> determinant for the outcome. The children's level of participation had no correlation with their age. The children were often described as having universal needs rather than individual needs. The will of the children was in some <b>verdicts</b> invalidated by the court because of their age and their perceived lack of ability to understand what's best for them in the future. Our conclusions are that the court rarely described the children as independent actors or took the children's wishes into account. ...|$|R
