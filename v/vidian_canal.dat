40|$|Resection of midline {{skull base}} lesions involve {{approaches}} needing extensive neurovascular manipulation. Transnasal endoscopic approach (TEA) is minimally invasive and ideal for certain selected lesions of the anterior skull base. A thorough knowledge of endonasal endoscopic anatomy {{is essential to}} be well versed with its surgical applications and this is possible only by dedicated cadaveric dissections. The goal {{in this study was}} to understand endoscopic anatomy of the orbital apex, petrous apex and the pterygopalatine fossa. Six cadaveric heads (3 injected and 3 non injected) and 12 sides, were dissected using a TEA outlining systematically, the steps of surgical dissection and the landmarks encountered. Dissection done by the " 2 nostril, 4 hands" technique, allows better transnasal instrumentation with two surgeons working in unison with each other. The main surgical landmarks for the orbital apex are the carotid artery protuberance in the lateral sphenoid wall, optic nerve canal, lateral optico-carotid recess, optic strut and the V 2 nerve. Orbital apex includes structures passing through the superior and inferior orbital fissure and the optic nerve <b>canal.</b> <b>Vidian</b> nerve <b>canal</b> and the V 2 are important landmarks for the petrous apex. Identification of the sphenopalatine artery, V 2 and foramen rotundum are important during dissection of the pterygopalatine fossa. In conclusion, the major potential advantage of TEA to the skull base is that it provides a direct anatomical route to the lesion without traversing any major neurovascular structures, as against the open transcranial approaches which involve more neurovascular manipulation and brain retraction. Obviously, these approaches require close cooperation and collaboration between otorhinolaryngologists and neurosurgeons...|$|R

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Demonstrate the {{endoscopic}} {{anatomy of}} the palatovaginal (PV) canal and artery for identification and dissection of the vidian nerve during endoscopic transpterygoid approaches. Evaluate {{the length of the}} PV canal and its relation with the vidian nerve. Show that the traditionally known PV canal is a misnomer and should be renamed. Study Design: Experimental study: anatomical and radiological. Methods: Dissection of eight cadaveric heads was performed to demonstrate the endoscopic {{anatomy of the}} PV canal. Computed tomography scan analysis of 20 patients was used to evaluate the length of the PV canal, the angle formed between this canal and the vidian nerve, and the distance between the <b>vidian</b> <b>canal</b> and the PV canal. Study of 10 dry skull bases was performed to verify the structures involved {{in the formation of the}} PV canal. Results: Anatomic steps and foundations for dissection of the vidian nerve using the PV canal as a landmark were described. The mean length of the PV canal was 7. 15 mm. The mean proximal distance between the vidian and the PV canal was 1. 95 mm, and the mean distal distance was 4. 14 mm. The mean angle between those canals was 48 degrees. The osteology study showed the vaginal process of the sphenoid bone did not contribute to the formation of the PV canal. Conclusions: Our anatomic investigations, radiologic studies, and surgical experience demonstrate the important anatomic relationship of the PV canal with the <b>vidian</b> <b>canal</b> and the relevance of the PV canal as a surgical landmark in endoscopic endonasal transpterygoid approaches.

50|$|The {{sympathetic}} postganglionic fibers {{originate from}} the superior cervical ganglion. They traverse as a periarteriolar plexus {{with the internal}} carotid artery, before they merge and form the deep petrosal nerve, which joins the greater petrosal nerve in the pterygoid canal. Together, greater petrosal and deep petrosal nerves form the nerve of the pterygoid <b>canal</b> (<b>vidian</b> nerve) and they reach the pterygopalatine ganglion in the pterygopalatine fossa. In contrast to their parasympathetic counterparts, sympathetic fibers do not synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, having done so already in the sympathetic trunk.

50|$|The {{parasympathetic}} nerve supply originates {{from the}} lacrimatory {{nucleus of the}} facial nerve in the pons. From the pons nucleus preganglionic parasympathetic fibres run in the nervus intermedius (small sensory root of facial nerve) to the geniculate ganglion but they do not synapse there. Then, from the geniculate ganglion, the preganglionic fibres run in the greater petrosal nerve (a branch {{of the facial nerve}}) which carries the parasympathetic secretomotor fibers through the foramen lacerum, where it joins the deep petrosal nerve (which contains postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion) to form the nerve of the pterygoid <b>canal</b> (<b>vidian</b> nerve) which then traverses through the pterygoid canal to the pterygopalatine ganglion. Here, the fibers synapse and postganglionic fibers join the fibers of the maxillary nerve. In the pterygopalatine fossa itself, the parasympathetic secretomotor fibers branch off with the zygomatic nerve and then branch off again, joining with the lacrimal branch of the ophthalmic division of CN V, which supplies sensory innervation to the lacrimal gland along with the eyelid and conjunctiva.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: To {{describe}} a transnasal endoscopic {{route to the}} jugular foramen and the endoscopic anatomy of the infratemporal fossa. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Endoscopic transnasal dissection of the infratemporal fossa was performed in 3 injected fresh heads (1 head only in arteries and 2 heads in arteries and veins). Two other double-injected specimens were dissected externally (2 of them side laterally and 1 anteriorly) to compare the different views and better understand the 3 -dimensionality of the region. Detailed endoscopic anatomy of the infratemporal fossa was clearly observed. The realization of a septal and posterior maxillary window allows surgeons to gain space to the jugular foramen. The ability to manage the vessels, especially the veins, and identify the muscles is mandatory. The fundamental role of the <b>vidian</b> <b>canal</b> in targeting the anterior genu of the internal carotid artery is confirmed. The role of the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve and the eustachian tube {{in this kind of}} approach is critical.

40|$|AbstractIn Malpolon monspessulana, the nervus oculomotorius {{arises from}} the ventral side of the pars peduncularis mesencephali of the {{midbrain}} by a single root. It runs closely applied to both the nervus abducens and the ramus nasalis of the nervus trigeminus. These nerves together with the nervus trochlearis leave the cranial cavity through the foramen orbitale magnum. Within this foramen the nervus oculomotorius divides into two rami: superior and inferior. The two rami innervate the rectus superior, rectus inferior, rectus medialis and the obliquus inferior muscles. The nervus trochlearis {{arises from the}} lateral side of the mesencephalon by a single root and passes to innervate the obliquus superior muscle. The nervus abducens arises from the ventral side of the medulla oblongata by a single root and passes for a distance through the <b>vidian</b> <b>canal</b> excavated in the parachordal cartilage. It innervates the rectus lateralis muscle. The eye muscle nerves carry special somatic motor fibres. The ciliary ganglion receives the preganglionic parasympathetic fibres from the ramus inferior of the nervus oculomotorius via the radix ciliaris brevis. Both the radix ciliaris longa and sympathetic root are absent. The ciliary ganglion is a well defined mass located in the postorbital region, irregular in shape formed of one type of neuron and gives off only one ciliary nerve...|$|E

30|$|The {{radiologist}} with 15  years of post-training {{experience of}} {{head and neck}} imaging also reviewed all of the CT images {{for the presence of}} remaining sinus wall within the tumor, intratumoral necrosis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and tumor extension. Permeative-type tumors were always accompanied by considerable amount of remaining sinus walls within the tumor. Among destructive and expansile-type tumors, if a little bit of sinus wall were found within the tumor, we assessed the presence of remaining sinus wall within the tumor. Among the cases with remaining sinus wall within the tumor, predominant bony erosive patterns were classified into resorption or remodeling, and the presence of accompanying sclerosis was also assessed. We regarded focal hypodense areas on unenhanced CT images or focal unenhanced areas on contrast-enhanced CT images as areas thought to be intratumoral necrosis. Enlarged cervical lymph nodes were considered as metastatic nodes when the minimum diameter exceeded 1.0  cm (van den Brekel et al. 1990). Cervical lymph nodes accompanied by focal hypodense areas on unenhanded CT image or focal unenhanced areas on contrast-enhanced CT images were also considered as metastatic nodes. Perineural spread was defined as an invasion of the pterygopalatine fossa, followed by extension to the greater or lesser palatine foramen, <b>Vidian</b> <b>canal,</b> foramen rotundum, or cavernous sinus. We used the following diagnostic criteria for perineural spread: asymmetric enlargement or destruction of the neural foramen on CT images.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Numerical {{classification}} {{systems for}} the internal carotid artery (ICA) are available, but modifications have added confusion to the numerical systems. Furthermore, previous classifications may not be applicable uniformly to microsurgical and endoscopic procedures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a clinically useful classification system. Materials and Methods: We performed cadaver dissections of the ICA in 5 heads (10 sides) and evaluated 648 internal carotid arteries with computed tomography angiography. We identified specific anatomic landmarks to define the beginning and end of each ICA segment. Results: The ICA was classified into eight segments based on the cadaver and imaging findings: (1) Cervical segment; (2) cochlear segment (ascending segment of the ICA in the temporal bone) (relation of the start of this segment to the base of the styloid process: Above, 425 sides [80 %]; below, 2 sides [0. 4 %]; at same level, 107 sides [20 %];P< 0. 0001) (relation of cochlea to ICA: Posterior, 501 sides [85 %]; posteromedial, 84 sides [14 %];P< 0. 0001); (3) petrous segment (horizontal segment of ICA in the temporal bone) starting at the crossing of the eustachian tube superolateral to the ICA turn in all 10 samples; (4) Gasserian-Clival segment (ascending segment of ICA in the cavernous sinus) starting at the petrolingual ligament (PLL) (relation to <b>vidian</b> <b>canal</b> on imaging: At same level, 360 sides [63 %]; below, 154 sides [27 %]; above, 53 sides [9 %];P< 0. 0001); in this segment, the ICA projected medially toward the clivus in 275 sides (52 %) or parallel to the clivus with no deviation in 256 sides (48 %;P< 0. 0001); (5) sellar segment (medial loop of ICA in the cavernous sinus) starting at the takeoff of the meningeal hypophyseal trunk (ICA was medial into the sella in 271 cases [46 %], lateral without touching the sella in 127 cases [23 %], and abutting the sella in 182 cases [31 %];P< 0. 0001); (6) sphenoid segment (lateral loop of ICA within the cavernous sinus) starting at the crossing of the fourth cranial nerve on the lateral aspect of the cavernous ICA and located directly lateral to the sphenoid sinus; (7) ring segment (ICA between the 2 dural rings) starting at the crossing of the third cranial nerve on the lateral aspect of the ICA; (8) cisternal segment starting at the distal dural ring. Conclusions: The classification may be applied uniformly to all skull base surgical approaches including lateral microsurgical and ventral endoscopic approaches, obviating the need for 2 separate classification systems. The classification allows extrapolation of relevant clinical information because each named segment may indicate potential surgical risk to specific structures...|$|E
