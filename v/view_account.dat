5000|$|... "Beggin & Pleadin" [...] is song by American {{recording}} artist Brandy. It {{was written by}} Ronald Colson, Warren Felder, Kirby Lauryen, Steve Mostyn, Andrew Wansel, and Brandy, while production was helmed by Pop & Oak, Mostyn, and Colson. [...] "Beggin & Pleadin'" [...] is influenced by 1950s blues, particularly the music of Ray Charles. While the song is an R&B and soul song, it is unconventionally built on a modern trap beat, and samples John Lee Hooker's song [...] "Boom Boom". Autobiographical in nature, the lyrics are a point of <b>view</b> <b>account</b> of a female protagonist, who sings cathartically about her mercurial temperament, following an inflammatory argument with her fiance.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2014, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} at UC Berkeley and Intel led by Brad Miller demonstrated a generalized approach to HTTPS traffic analysis based on machine learning. [...] The researchers demonstrated that the attack applied to a range of websites, including Mayo Clinic, Planned Parenthood and YouTube. The attack assumes that the attacker is able to visit the same webpages as the victim to gather Network traffic which serves as training data. The attacker is then able to identify similarities in the packet sizes and orderings between the victim traffic and the training data traffic which frequently allow the attacker to infer the exact page the victim is visiting. For example, this attack could be used to determine whether a user browsing the Planned Parenthood website is looking for information about preventative health screening or an abortion. Note that the attack {{can not be used to}} discover user specific values embedded in a webpage. For example, many banks offer web interfaces which allow users to <b>view</b> <b>account</b> balances. While the attacker would be able to discover that the user was viewing an account balance page, they would be unable to learn the user's exact account balance or account number.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop an {{innovative}} conceptual view on the management of strategic or important customers in business markets, so-called (key) account management. Central to this new perspective is customer value creation through external customer alignment. The paper additionally proposes two propositions, based on quantitative empirical analysis and rooted in congruency, transaction cost economy and economic rent generation theory. Design/methodology/approach – The study is quantitative research based on questionnaire survey. Findings – The paper’s proposition is that account management can create important competitive advantages for companies which can acquire and develop the necessary organisational competences to implement an integrative process through alignment with strategic or important, well selected, customers. Originality/value – Traditionally, most companies <b>view</b> <b>account</b> management as a sales activity. Views that are more recent consider it as a marketing activity with emphasis on relationship marketing. The paper’s approach, however, is to look at account management from an integrated business process perspective, encompassing marketing and sales as development activities as well. Two elements are central in the proposal: customer selection and alignment...|$|E

40|$|Philosophia, 37 (2009) In {{an article}} {{previously}} published in this journal, Phillip Montague critically surveys and rejects {{a handful of}} contemporary attempts to explain why state punishment is morally justified. Among those targeted {{is one of my}} defences of the censure theory of punishment, according to which state punishment is justified because the political community has a duty to express disapproval of those guilty of injustice. My defence of censure theory supposes, per argumentum, that there is always some defeasible moral reason for the state to proportionately punish the guilty, and then demonstrates that censure theory best entails and explains this intuition. Montague does not question the intuition, but instead argues that three rival theories of punishment, including his societal-defence <b>view,</b> <b>account</b> for it to no worse a degree than my censure theory. In this article I defend my initial argument, noting resources for its defence that Montague does not appreciate and that, I maintain, provide those who believe that there is always pro tanto injustice in the state failing to proportionately punish the guilty reason to adopt censure theory over all competitors, including Montague’s societal-defence theory...|$|E

Although formally accepted, the disconnection of taxation from accounting continues to experience difficulties. But a certain progress can be detected. The regime of the expenditure with tax depreciation of the fixed assets is an example of separating accounting from taxation...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} papers (Gaffikin 2005 a, 2005 b, 2005 c, 2006) {{the discussion}} has examined accounting as a science, with attempts {{to employ a}} scientific methodology; as a purely technical expression of economic theory, heavily dominated by research in finance; {{and as part of}} “law”, albeit law (regulation) heavily influenced by dominant economic and political ideology. That discussion revealed that all these perspectives have suffered from severe shortcomings.

5000|$|Positive {{accounting}} can {{be associated}} with the contractual view of the firm. The firm is viewed as “a nexus of contracts” and accounting one tool to facilitate the formation and performance of contracts. Under this <b>view,</b> <b>accounting</b> practices evolve to mitigate contracting costs by establishing ex ante agreement among varying parties. For example, positive accounting postulates that conservatism in accounting -in this sense defined conditionally as requiring lower (higher) standards of verifiability to recognize losses (gains)- has origins in contract markets, including managerial compensation contracts and lender debt contracts. As an example, absent conservatism, managerial compensation agreements may reward managers based on current reports that later evidence indicates were unwarranted.|$|R
