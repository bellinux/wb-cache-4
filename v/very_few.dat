5|$|At the time, <b>very</b> <b>few</b> {{managers}} of pop groups {{knew about the}} income music merchandising could generate, as <b>very</b> <b>few</b> artists survived long enough in the pop domain {{to be a viable}} investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was merely good public relations, and any revenue that arose from the sale of Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely extra money that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} brief nature of the Spanish {{occupation}} of the city, <b>very</b> <b>few</b> European artefacts were found. Those few pieces that were found consisted of forged iron crossbow bolts.|$|E

30|$|To {{solve this}} problem, {{nonlinear}} reconstruction techniques, particularly sparse reconstruction or compressive sensing, {{have been proposed}} in recent years [10, 11]. Sparse reconstruction can accurately reconstruct a sparse scene with <b>very</b> <b>fewer</b> Fourier samples, provided that the restricted isometry property (RIP) is satisfied [12, 13]. Improved SAR imaging is achieved by using the sparse Bayesian learning algorithms {{that are based on}} relevance vector machine [14, 15]. Such techniques, however, may become difficult to implement for processing a large scene because of the very high dimension of the associated dictionary matrix.|$|R

5|$|According to the Council of Trent, every Catholic {{church is}} {{required}} to have a residing pastor. Before {{the building of the}} rectory began in 1944, the three priests and their housekeeper had lived in the Leslie Mansion (the mansion on the property). The mansion was over a hundred years old, was a frame building, had <b>very</b> <b>few</b> rooms, provided poor living conditions, and had a water pump at the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it is a surprise that a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time <b>very</b> <b>few</b> clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against <b>very</b> <b>few</b> antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E

The event was reportedly a wild ride with Pharrell Williams as the headliner.|$|E
