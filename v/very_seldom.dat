5|$|A female P. labiata {{more often}} pursues small jumping spiders and web spiders than larger prey. While it more often catches small jumping spiders than larger ones, {{it is about}} equally {{effective}} with all sizes of web spiders up to twice P. labiata′s size. A female P. labiata is effective against insects up to twice P. labiata′s size when the insect is stuck in a non-salticid's web, and against insects not in webs and up to P. labiata′s size, while P. labiata seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in the open. A female P. labiata <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> pursues or catches a larger insect in her own web, and is slightly less effective against smaller insects in P. labiata′s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E

25|$|The term, from Latin, for {{the main}} upper arm flexor in the {{singular}} is the biceps muscle (from biceps brachii); however, many English speakers take {{it to be a}} plural and refer to the muscle of only one arm, by back-formation, as a bicep. The correct —although <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> used— Latin plural is bicipites.|$|E
25|$|On 10 August 1918, in a {{swirling}} confused dogfight, Billik {{was shot down}} and taken prisoner. He had been recommended for a Pour le Merite when his score sheet reached 20 victories. This award was Germany's highest decoration for valor, and one <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> awarded to men from humble origin or from the non-commissioned ranks. His capture prevented the honor.|$|E
25|$|Leg {{bars are}} {{prominent}} on Grevy's zebras and mountain zebras, and African wild asses also have well-defined black leg bars below the forearm and gaskin {{on a white}} or pale background. However, as in horses, expression of leg bars seems to vary widely among donkeys, plains zebras, and Przewalski's horses, while they appear <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> {{or not at all}} in onagers and kiangs.|$|E

25|$|Harmony {{singing is}} a deep rooted {{tradition}} in Slovenia, and is at least three-part singing (four voices), while in some regions even up to eight-part singing (nine voices). Slovenian folk songs, thus, usually resounds soft and harmonious, and are <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> in minor. Traditional Slovenian folk music is performed on Styrian harmonica (the oldest type of accordion), fiddle, clarinet, zithers, flute, and by brass bands of alpine type. In eastern Slovenia, fiddle and cimbalon bands are called velike goslarije.|$|E
25|$|Cleckley draws {{important}} {{distinctions between}} the psychopath and non-psychopathic criminal. He states that the psychopath <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> takes much advantage of any gain, has an obscure or inconsistent purpose, usually puts himself unnecessarily in a shameful position as much as causing trouble for others; and usually does not commit the most serious or violent crimes, but usually does end up harming himself. However, despite the general picture of weak-willed and inconsistent antisocial behavior, he also states, at least in later editions, that some may develop drives towards the most serious or sadistic crimes. He suggests this is a somewhat separate additional pathology but does not explain why or how.|$|E

25|$|The {{size and}} {{composition}} of a marching band can vary greatly. Some bands have fewer than twenty members, and some have over 500. American marching bands vary considerably in their instrumentation. Some bands omit some or all woodwinds, {{but it is not}} uncommon to see piccolos, flutes, soprano clarinets, alto saxophones, and tenor saxophones. E♭ clarinets, alto clarinets, bass clarinets, and baritone saxophones are less common, but can be found in some bands. Bassoons and oboes are <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> found on a field due to the risk of incidental damage, the impracticality of marching with an exposed double reed, and high sensitivity to weather.|$|E
25|$|Though {{normally}} {{loved by}} most of his countrymen, Storm P. has also been criticised for being too toothless, cosy and petit bourgeois. In spite of his social background and interest of poor milieus, he <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> shows deeper social criticism or revolutionary opinions; the dramatic age in which he lived left rather small stamps on his work. On the other hand he was no staunch giggler; many of his paintings deal with death, sorrow and macabre themes. Though not a revolutionary, he has indeed painted the victims of social injustice and misery, often with a strong touch of compassion. Melancholy and fear are not unknown to him, but his official appearance was an optimistic one.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem with}} elderspeak is that {{licensed}} practical nurses, registered nurses, and other healthcare team professionals <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> have training and expertise {{when it comes}} to communication with elders, and that elderspeak is often used incorrectly. Shorter sentences appear to have a beneficial effect on older adults’ communication, factors of elderspeak such as slow speech and exaggerated pitch tend to make older persons feel worse about their own competency, as well as the competency of the speaker; However, younger adults continue to use elderspeak with these characteristics. Not only does elderspeak fail to improve communication effectiveness for older adults, the messages inherent in elderspeak may unknowingly reinforce dependency and engender isolation and depression, contributing to the spiral of decline in physical, cognitive, and functional status common for elderly individuals.|$|E
50|$|Eurasian lynx are secretive, {{and because}} the sounds they make are <b>very</b> quiet and <b>seldom</b> heard, their {{presence}} in an area may go unnoticed for years. Remnants of prey or tracks on snow are usually observed long before the animal is seen.|$|R

25|$|Strait enjoys fishing, skiing, {{and playing}} golf. Along with his son, he {{is a member}} of the PRCA and {{partners}} in team roping competitions. George and his elder brother John Jr., known as Buddy, hosted the annual George Strait Team Roping Classic, in which they competed against some of the best team ropers in the world. Strait has also said that he <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> picks up a guitar when not in the studio or touring. He and his wife live in northwest San Antonio in a master-planned community known as The Dominion. He also owns a ranch near Cotulla in La Salle County between San Antonio and Laredo. Strait is a fan of the NBA's San Antonio Spurs and can be seen court-side at many of the Spurs' home basketball games.|$|E
25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings {{there is something}} that is <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> found in the art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had seen them in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut I talked with a man who might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E
25|$|Consistent with Catherine's stance, {{the next}} several decades marked a shift of public {{perception}} against the death penalty. In 1824, {{the very existence of}} such a punishment was among the reasons for legislature's refusal to approve {{a new version of the}} Penal Code. Just one year later, the Decembrist revolt failed, and a court sentenced 36 of the rebels to death. Nicholas I's decision to commute all but five of the sentences was highly unusual for the time, especially taking into account that revolts against the monarchy had almost universally resulted in an automatic death sentence, and was perhaps due to society's changing views of the death penalty. By the late 1890s, capital punishment for murder was virtually never carried out, but substituted with 10 to 15 years imprisonment with hard labor, although it still was carried out for treason (for example, Alexander Ulyanov was hanged in 1887). However, in 1910, capital punishment was reintroduced and expanded, although still <b>very</b> <b>seldom</b> used.|$|E

5000|$|The {{yellow rail}} are <b>very</b> elusive and <b>seldom</b> seen. They {{generally}} {{call at night}} resembling the sound of two stones being clicked together [...] "tik-tik tik-tik-tik" [...] in repetition.

50|$|The Chinese cobra is a <b>very</b> alert, <b>seldom</b> cornered, but if confronted {{will raise}} its {{forebody}} and spread its hood and strike readily if necessary. Adults {{can be very}} aggressive, but the younger {{tend to be more}} aggressive as they are more nervous to the things surrounding them. The Chinese cobra usually escapes to avoid confrontation with humans. The snake is terrestrial, diurnal and crepuscular. This species has been observed hunting during all daylight periods and as late as 2-3 hours after sunset from March to October, with ambient temperatures of 20-32 °C (68-90 °F).|$|R
