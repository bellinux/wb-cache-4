5000|$|Downstairs is an EP by 311, {{which was}} {{recorded}} in Nick Hexum's basement in 1989, and is considered the band's first recording. It is an independent release without cover art. Almost nothing is known about this collectors item, and an original version of the EP {{is almost impossible to}} find. However, a copy of the EP can easily be found circulating in bootleg circles and tape trading communities. The Downstairs EP suffers from guitar so scratchy that the instrument produced an unintended grinding [...] "ringing" [...] sound so high-pitched that it distorted the sound of the tape upon recording. On this EP, [...] "Right Now" [...] is one of the songs most afflicted with the grinding, ringing guitar noise.

40|$|This {{is a short}} <b>version</b> <b>report</b> {{based on}} the {{complete}} report "Is what we hear about migration really true? : questioning eight stereotypes" edited by Philippe Fargues, [URL] has polarised European politics for decades. There have been defenders and opponents of migration into Europe, and {{it has often been}} the matter of acrimonious debate. In recent years, however, the dispute between the two groups often seems to have largely vanished. If the opinion that migration is a threat rather than an asset prevails, there is a risk that European States will forego the benefits of immigration. In doing so, it will undermine Europe’s recovery from the crisis and, ultimately, its position of importance in the world. However, if the consensus shifts and European societies come to see migration as a dynamic and positive force, then migration and migrants can and will help these societies better prepare for future challenges. In order to ground the debate in current evidence, and to counteract populist stereotypes, the MPC’s experts re-think eight migration stereotypes in the light of MPC’s research and broader academic scholarship...|$|E
40|$|Frequently, in International meetings, report {{writing and}} expert {{communication}} confusion arises as to correct meaning and choice of terms due to improper translation {{from the original}} language into English {{which is the most}} used idiom internationally. This misunderstanding pertaining to ‘Animal Housing ’ has been pointed out in the framework of Working Group ‘Animal Housing in Hot Climate ’ established under CIGR Technical Section II. Therefore, a seven member sub-group was appointed to coordinate an overall effort aiming at developing a ‘Glossary of Terms on Animal Housing ’ so as to: (1) Establish uniformity in terms associated with Animal Housing (2) Serve as a focal point for the development of useful new terms and definitions (3) Become a useful tool for all those involved in the subject The idea behind its development was not to re-define terms, but rather find, adjust if needed and include as many as possible useful ones from various disciplines (e. g. Engineering, Thermal Biology, Environmental Physiology) directly or indirectly related to ‘Animal Housing’.

40|$|We study an information-theoretic {{measure of}} {{uncertainty}} for quantum systems. It is the Shannon information I of the phase space probability distribution z | ρ | z, where |z are coherent states, and ρ is the density matrix. The uncertainty principle {{is expressed in}} this measure as I > 1. For a harmonic oscillator in a thermal state, I coincides with von Neumann entropy, - (ρρ), in the high-temperature regime, but unlike entropy, it is non-zero at zero temperature. It therefore supplies a non-trivial measure of uncertainty due to both quantum and thermal fluctuations. We study I {{as a function of}} time for a class of non-equilibrium quantum systems consisting of a distinguished system coupled to a heat bath. We derive an evolution equation for I. For the harmonic oscillator, in the Fokker-Planck regime, we show that I increases monotonically. For more general Hamiltonians, I settles down to monotonic increase in the long run, but may suffer an initial decrease for certain initial states that undergo "reassembly" (the opposite of quantum spreading). Our main result is to prove, for linear systems, that I at each moment of time has a lower bound I_t^min, over all possible initial states. This bound is a generalization of the uncertainty principle to include thermal fluctuations in non-equilibrium systems, and represents the least amount of uncertainty the system must suffer after evolution in the presence of an environment for time t.

40|$|MSc in Operational ResearchThis {{research}} {{is done to}} investigate the practical applications of Computer simulation to analyze and solve frequently met problem areas in a tire manufacturing factory. Automated solid tire production line of Loadstar (Pvt.) Ltd. at Midgame factory was one such selected production line for this Research. The identified problem areas were, e formation for unloading cured tires in oven lines and resulted production output delays due to same reason and also due to other various reasons such as poor production planning and delay in producing raw tires etc. After an initial system study {{with the help of}} the production staff, I analyzed the above mentioned problem and discussed how to avoid those. Introduction of the 'Pommel' (Production Simulation Package) to build a computer simulation model for this problem area was experienced in this research as a smart proactive problem solving tool. And also, I introduced a better production - scheduling method for this process, using Heuristic method to replace the then used poor production planning method. With these changes, the result was; a provision of an easy proactive problem solving tool to try and find out the best allocation of ovens to get the least queue formation at the computer screen to select the best possible array with an easy monitoring facility, before it is performed in real world at the production floor. So, Simulation was experienced as a smart replacement for a tedious; or rather irreversible, rigid, outdated, hit-or -miss procedure which left out at the end with no choice other than bearing up the very expensive loss of rejects and low outputs. A comparatively convenient way to allocate the available resources for an optimum increase of the productivity was the result of this exercise. 'Promote' is one of the available simulation packages in the market today and for the study we used a student version of it. Expensive commercial versions may consist with more facilities for modeling to customize more closure to the practical needs of the organization.
