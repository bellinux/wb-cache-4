50|$|The {{popularity}} of the Internet in the mid-1990s, along with the better awareness of voice mail by business and cell phone owners, made the practice of stealing <b>voice</b> <b>mailboxes</b> less popular.

However, some networks' GMSCs connect unanswered calls directly, keeping the voice signal entirely within the home country and thus avoiding the double charge.|$|E
5000|$|Voicemail {{marketing}} {{emerged from}} the market prevalence of personal <b>voice</b> <b>mailboxes,</b> and business voicemail systems. Voicemail marketing presented a cost effective means by which to reach people directly, by voice. Abuse of consumer marketing applications of voicemail marketing resulted in an abundance of [...] "voice-spam", and prompted many jurisdictions to pass laws regulating consumer voicemail marketing. More recently, businesses have utilized guided voicemail (an application where pre-recorded voicemails are guided by live callers) to accomplish personalized business-to-business marketing formerly reserved for telemarketing. Because guided voicemail is used to contact only businesses, it is exempt from Do Not Call regulations in place for other forms of voicemail marketing.|$|R

It has applications in many fields, for example in systems that make use of prerecorded speech, such as <b>voice</b> <b>mailboxes</b> or text-to-speech synthesizers based on acoustic unit concatenation. In such cases, voice modifi-cation would be a simple and efficient way to create a de-sired variety of voices while avoiding recording of dif-ferent speakers [1]. Another field of application is old films restoration, where {{the aim is to}} reconstruct cor-rupted voices of old actors. One of the critical tasks in voice conversion frame-work is speaker parameter estimation.

50|$|In 1989 the Boston Phoenix, a large {{alternative}} {{newspaper in}} Boston, introduced {{a variation of}} this system to the alternative press at the group's annual trade convention. It was an instant hit. Personal ads were a mainstay of almost all the papers. Now, readers could respond to print ads by calling a 900 number, punching in the appropriate <b>voice</b> <b>mailbox</b> number included in the print ad, and leaving a message for the advertiser. The advertiser could then listen to the responses and answer those that interested him or her. In this way, electronic matchmaking was born years before most people {{had heard of the}} Internet.|$|E
50|$|With virtual telephony, {{each person}} {{could be given}} a phone number (just the number, not the phone) and a <b>voice</b> <b>mailbox.</b> The citizen would also be given a pager. If someone called the phone number, it never rang on an actual phone, but would be routed {{immediately}} to a central voice-mail system. The voice-mail system answered the call and the caller could leave a long, detailed message. As soon as the message was received, the voice-mail system would trigger the citizen's pager. When the page was received, the citizen would find a pay phone and call in {{to pick up the}} message. This concept was used successfully in South America and South Africa.|$|E

The number of messages that accumulate in our <b>voice</b> <b>mailboxes</b> necessitate new ways of prioritizing them. Currently, we are forced to actively listen to all messages in order to find out which ones are important and which ones can be attended to later on. In this paper, we describe Emotive Alert, a system that can detect some of the significant emotions in a new message and notify the account owner along various affective axes, including urgency, formality, valence (happy vs. sad) and arousal (calm vs. excited).

5000|$|Before the BBS {{era of the}} 1980s phone {{phreaking}} {{was more}} of a solitary venture as it was difficult for phreaks to connect with one another. In addition to communicating over BBSs phone phreaks discovered voice mail boxes and party lines as ways to network and keep in touch over the telephone. It was rare for a phone phreak to legally purchase access to voice mail. Instead, they would usually appropriate unused boxes that were part of business or cellular phone systems. Once a vulnerable mailbox system was discovered, word would spread around the phreak community, and scores of them would take residence on the system. They would use the system as a [...] "home base" [...] for communication with one another until the rightful owners would discover the intrusion and wipe them off. <b>Voice</b> <b>mailboxes</b> also provided a safe phone number for phreaks to give out to one another as home phone numbers would allow the phreak's identity (and home address) to be discovered. This was especially important given that phone phreaks were breaking the law.|$|R
50|$|Pay-per-call {{applications}} dated back to {{as early}} as 1971. Typically a caller would dial an advertised phone number with a 900 or 976 prefix. The caller would be billed a fixed amount per minute by the phone company. The phone company kept {{a portion of the}} revenue with the balance going to the sponsor of the call. There were many pay-per-call services: sports scores, weather forecasts, even dating lines. A new twist was added to this mix {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s. It was known as Audiotext, a relatively simple concept that combined a pay-per-call application with sophisticated answering machine technology ("IVR"). A person would call a 900 number and enter the <b>voice</b> <b>mailbox</b> number of the service or person for whom they wished to leave a message. Much like a voice-mail system in typical office environments, the person who owned the mailbox could listen to the recorded message at a later time and respond appropriately.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of VoIP and its large customer base, the incentives of telemarketers for voice spam has been increasing in the recent years. If the threat of voice spam remains unchecked, it could become a problem as serious as email spam today. Compared to email spam, voice spam will be much more obnoxious and time consuming nuisance for telephone subscribers to filter out. In this paper, we propose a contentbased approach to protect telephone subscribers voice mailboxes from voice spam. In particular, based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), we develop a speaker independent speech recognition system to make content comparison of speech messages. Using our system, the voice messages left on the media server by callers are matched against a set of spam filtering rules involving the study of call behavioral pattern and the analysis of message content. The uniqueness of our spam filtering approach lies in its independence on the generation of voice spam, regardless whether spammers play same spam content recorded in many different ways, such as human or machine generated voice, male or female voice, and different accents. We validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme through real experiments, and our experimental results show that it can effectively filter out spam from the subscribers â€™ <b>voice</b> <b>mailbox</b> with 0. 67 % false positive rate and 8. 33 % false negative rate...|$|E
