500|$|Following his {{retirement}} from professional Scouting, Goodman served the National Council of Churches (NCC) during 1951–1954 as the NCC's first general {{director of the}} United Church Men, a laymen's program he formed to strengthen men's ties to local churches and their communities. Goodman publicly inaugurated the laymen's group on October 7, 1951 in Cincinnati, Ohio. By the end of 1952, United Church Men departments were formed in more than 24states, providing financial support to NCC-affiliated colleges and missionary work. His new post entailed working closely with Eugene Carson Blake, NCC president (1954–1957), and meeting frequently with officials of the participating denominations in the NCC. Speaking with various men's church groups in the U.S. and abroad was, he believed, a means of promoting brotherhood. Reflecting on his NCC service with these notable church leaders, Goodman said {{more than a decade}} later, [...] "Great faith and devoted service, I am <b>very</b> <b>sure,</b> are for ordinary folk {{as well as for the}} clergy. ... I have been privileged to know some great clergymen in my day ... but I have also known and loved some truly great laymen, men whose lives and works matched their faith". Goodman retired from his NCC post on September 1, 1954 because of tuberculosis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect is}} {{consistently}} found when the assessment statements are vague. People {{are able to}} read their own meaning into the statements they receive, and thus the statement becomes [...] "personal" [...] to them. The most effective statements include the phrase [...] "at times", such as [...] "At times you feel <b>very</b> <b>sure</b> of yourself, while at other times you are not as confident." [...] This phrase can apply to almost anyone, and thus each person can read a [...] "personal" [...] meaning into it. Keeping statements vague in this manner ensures observing the Forer effect in replication studies.|$|E

She stated [...] "The shoot was incredible. It was my first album with Parlophone and we were <b>very</b> <b>sure</b> of the message {{we wanted to get}} across: sunshine, beach, fun, glamour. I've always loved Ibiza and it's true that the island has a magical quality. The lightness of the chiffon matched my mood and desire." [...] Baker, who helped through the album process, {{said that the}} images have a [...] "mystical quality to them." [...] He then said [...] "With 'Light Years', we wanted a cover that was a visual statement about Kylie reclaiming the throne of the Princess of Pop. Ibiza was perfect [...] And so, surrounded by the infinity of blue sky and ocean, Kylie returned to her rightful place!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1908, Carlsen {{published}} an article on still life painting for the now obscure art journal Palette and Bench where he wrote of the low status of still lifes:…still life painting is considered of small importance in the Art schools, both here and abroad, the usual course being drawn from the antique, the nude, and painting the draped figure and from the nude. …Then why should the earnest student overlook the simplest and most thorough way of acquiring all {{the knowledge of the}} craft of painting and drawing, the study of inanimate objects, still life painting, the <b>very</b> <b>surest</b> road to absolute mastery over all technical difficulties.” ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1843, Lindley {{published}} {{a revision of}} a group of orchids classified as tribus Maxillaridae, then subordinated to Vandeae, a subfamily of Orchidaceae at the time. In this revision, he indicates that much work is needed till the limits between each genus within this tribus can be established and states his doubts regarding some of the new genera he was proposing, despite being <b>very</b> <b>sure</b> of other ones. Lindley suggested the division of Maxillaridae in twenty five genera, being Scuticaria one of the genera he considered well established. When describing this new genus, Lindley based on morphologic characteristics of Maxillaria steelei Hook., selected as the Type species of Scuticaria with the name Scuticaria steelei.: Scuticaria in Edward's Botanical Register Vol.29 (miscelanea), pp.14. James Ridgway & Sons Ed. London, 1843. [...] This name comes from Latin scutica, flagellum, in reference to the long cylindrical leaves that the species of this genus show, similar to the leather whips used to punish.|$|E
2500|$|These {{findings}} {{meant that}} as of January 2013, scientists were <b>very</b> <b>sure</b> they had found an unknown particle of mass ~ 125GeV/c2, and had not been misled by experimental error or a chance result. They were also sure, from initial observations, that the new particle {{was some kind of}} boson. The behaviours and properties of the particle, so far as examined since July 2012, also seemed quite close to the behaviours expected of a Higgs boson. Even so, it could still have been a Higgs boson or some other unknown boson, since future tests could show behaviours that do not match a Higgs boson, so as of December 2012 CERN still only stated that the new particle was [...] "consistent with" [...] the Higgs boson, and scientists did not yet positively say it was the Higgs boson. Despite this, in late 2012, widespread media reports announced (incorrectly) that a Higgs boson had been confirmed during the year.|$|E
2500|$|When Li Jing {{returned}} to the capital, however, the imperial censor Xiao Yu accused him of allowing his soldiers to plunder the Eastern Tujue treasury. [...] Emperor Taizong rebuked Li Jing, but still increased {{the size of his}} fief and awarded him with silk. [...] Later, regretting rebuking Li Jing, he stated to Li Jing, [...] "People have accused you to hurt you. [...] I realize this now. [...] Please do not mind it." [...] He awarded Li Jing with even more silk. [...] Later in 630, he made Li Jing Shangshu Pushe (尚書僕射), the head of the important executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng), also a chancellor post. [...] It was said that Li Jing spoke very little when conferencing with other chancellors—then considered a virtue. [...] A more plausible explanation is that Taizong didn't trust his high officials, especially the generals, and Li Jing was <b>very</b> <b>sure</b> about it. [...] He deliberately tried to keep a low profile in order not to raise Taizong's suspicion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{project of}} co-writing was {{expedited}} by the {{collaboration between the}} four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in Birdman came from Skype sessions {{at two in the}} morning where he and Giacobone were [...] "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said [...] "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be [...] "very, <b>very</b> <b>sure</b> about what was on the page." [...] As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: [...] "You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. Birdman looks like a good idea now, but [...] we did not know how we would land." ...|$|E

[...] "But I am not <b>very</b> <b>sure</b> of Josie's ability, {{because she is}} not <b>very</b> <b>sure</b> of it herself. She dare not, even yet, advance a positive opinion. Unless she learned something last night she is still groping in the dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not <b>very</b> <b>sure</b> you do," [...] May Bartram after {{a moment}} said; [...] "and I'm not <b>very</b> <b>sure</b> I ought to want you to.

It wasn't <b>very</b> impressive, I'm <b>sure.</b> And Jeff had an upright and Davíd {{was trying to make}} cracks about Paul Simon. He thought Simon was on CBS, but actually he had just scored big with Rhythm of the Saints on Warner Bros., so those jokes were not funny. Everything Davíd said just fell to the floor and his voice got really tight and he couldn't sing <b>very</b> well; I'm <b>sure</b> they just thought we were ridiculous ultimately.|$|R
