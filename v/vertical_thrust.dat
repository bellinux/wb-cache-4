5|$|All three text-based games {{require the}} player {{to control a}} rocket {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to the ground. In the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of <b>vertical</b> <b>thrust</b> to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.|$|E
5|$|Sergey Zagraevsky, {{a modern}} art historian, {{surveyed}} hundreds of Russian icons and miniatures, from {{the eleventh century}} onward. He concluded that most icons painted after the Mongol invasion of Rus display only onion domes. First onion domes displayed on some pictures of twelfth century (two miniatures from Dobrylov Evangelie). He found only one icon from the late fifteenth century displaying a dome resembling the helmet instead of an onion. His findings led him to dismiss fragments of helmet domes discovered by restorators beneath modern onion domes as post-Petrine stylisations intended to reproduce the familiar forms of Byzantine cupolas. Zagraevsky also indicated that the oldest depictions of the two Vladimir cathedrals represent them as having onion domes, prior to their replacement by classicizing helmet domes. He explains the ubiquitous appearance of onion domes in the late thirteenth century by the general emphasis on verticality characteristic of Russian architecture from the late twelfth to early fifteenth centuries. At that period, porches, pilasters, vaults and drums were arranged to create a <b>vertical</b> <b>thrust,</b> to make the church seem taller than it was. It seems logical that elongated, or onion, domes {{were part of the}} same proto-Gothic trend aimed at achieving pyramidal, vertical emphasis.|$|E

Unlike their Slavic counterparts, the Paleologan architects never accented the <b>vertical</b> <b>thrust</b> of structures. As a result, there is little grandeur in the late medieval architecture of Byzantium (barring the Hagia Sophia of Trebizond).|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, Forecast International {{reported}} that some design features {{were intended to}} support fixed wing aircraft such as the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey and Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, although neither the MOD nor the JMSDF have mentioned the possibility of introducing carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft. The ship has neither a [...] "ski-jump" [...] nor a catapult, typical features for launching fixed-wing aircraft. If the Izumo class were to operate fixed-wing aircraft, they {{would be limited to}} those capable of STOVL (short take-off, vertical landing) operations; Japan has acquired the F-35A for use by the JASDF, but has not indicated whether it would purchase the STOVL F-35B version. Even if they did, the ship's lack of a ski jump limiting the plane's range and payload, lack of specialised landing pads to withstand the F-35B's immense heat generated upon <b>vertical</b> <b>thrusts,</b> and small space to accommodate very many planes would make it a poor [...] "offensive" [...] aircraft carrier.|$|R
25|$|The Harrier {{is usually}} flown in STOVL mode, which enables it {{to carry a}} higher fuel or weapon load over a given distance. In V/STOL the VTOL {{aircraft}} moves horizontally along the runway before taking off using <b>vertical</b> <b>thrust.</b> This gives aerodynamic lift as well as thrust lift and permits taking off with heavier loads and is more efficient. When landing the aircraft is much lighter due {{to the loss of}} propellant weight and a controlled vertical landing is possible.|$|E

But {{at the foot of}} the pyramid, an old woman raises her head to gaze into the sky, and to her right a baby seeks maternal comfort from a clenched-fisted corpse. Body parts including a hand and forearm, and an indistinct, congealed bloody mass hover grimly above the infant.|$|E
25|$|Opponents to {{operating}} F-35s {{from the}} Canberra-class state that embarking enough aircraft {{to be an}} effective force would require abandoning their capability as amphibious warfare vessels, operating as an aircraft carrier would make the ships higher profile targets and need greater escorting forces, existing fuel and ordnance storage {{would not be able to}} sustain fixed-wing operations, structural modifications were needed to reinforce and heat-treat the flight deck to withstand F-35B <b>vertical</b> <b>thrust,</b> and the F-35B project itself has been the most expensive and most problematic of the three Joint Strike Fighter variants. Supporters counter that providing fixed-wing air support close to amphibious operations maximises aircraft capability, other nations are already working on solutions to structural and thrust problems for other Harrier-era ships, and the presence of a ski-jump makes the vessels already more suitable for STOVL operations than equivalent amphibious ships with flat flight decks.|$|E

40|$|We {{characterized}} E-W shortening crustal deformation using GPS {{measurements and}} an earthquake focal mechanism solution to estimate conditions before the Ms 6. 5 Ludian earthquake of 3 August 2014 (16 : 30, UTC+ 8). A series of NW-SE striking transpressive faults are distributed outside the Chuan-Dian Block. They accommodated the E-W shortening and N-S stretching {{in this region}} resulting from Chuan-Dian Block outward expansion. The displacement velocity field about the eastward, fault-normal slip rate and the vertical component are also examined. The results show that they share a similar rate change at the Anninghe, Zemuhe, Puxionghe, Jiaojihe, and Baogunao-Xiaohe faults. Among these faults, the maximum thrusting slip rate of the Baogunao-Xiaohe fault is less than 4 mm yr- 1. The slip rate change may represent a transition from lateral translation into a <b>vertical</b> <b>thrusting</b> movement. Furthermore, counterclockwise rotation also {{plays an important role}} in absorbing the E-W shortening. Relative to the inner zone, the outer Chuan-Dian Block together with the Daliang Shan fault zone represent the development of a new deformation area. A prediction could be made that the Daliang Shan fault zone will eventually replace the east boundary fault role of the Anninghe-Zemuhe-North Xiaojiang fault due to Chuan-Dian Block continuous outward expansion...|$|R

50|$|The orbiter, which flew tail-first during mapping operations, {{was moved}} to a nose-first {{attitude}} with the mast extending upward. A brief reaction control system pulse began the maneuver.

5000|$|The Fw 260 {{design was}} {{displayed}} at the Luftfahrtschau Hanover trade show in 1962. The aircraft's design included a high-mounted, slightly-swept wing, carrying two two-engined pods for jet engines providing primary thrust, intended {{to be in the}} [...] class each; these were fitted with vectored thrust to assist in <b>vertical</b> takeoff, primary <b>thrust</b> for which was provided by two underwing pods each carrying six Bristol Siddeley BS.59 liftjets, each producing [...] thrust. Up to 85 passengers could be carried; this was later revised to 96.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other variants, the F-35B has no landing hook. The [...] "STOVL/HOOK" [...] control instead engages {{conversion}} between {{normal and}} <b>vertical</b> flight. Jet <b>thrust</b> is sent directly downwards during vertical flight; the nozzle is being redesigned {{to spread the}} output across an oval rather than circular shape in order to limit damage to asphalt and ship decks. The variant's three-bearing swivel nozzle that directs the full thrust of the engine is moved by a [...] "fueldraulic" [...] actuator using pressurized fuel as the working fluid.|$|R
50|$|As orbital speeds are approached, <b>vertical</b> <b>thrust</b> can {{be reduced}} as {{centrifugal}} force (in the rotating frame of reference around {{the center of the}} Earth) counteracts {{a large proportion of the}} gravitation force on the rocket, and more of the thrust can be used to accelerate.|$|E

2500|$|The RASCAL was {{powered by}} a XLR67-BA-1 rocket engine also {{developed}} by Bell. The XLR-67 provided [...] of <b>thrust</b> using three <b>vertical</b> in-line <b>thrust</b> chambers. All three thrust chambers of the XLR67 were operated during the missile's boost phase which could last up to two minutes. At {{the conclusion of the}} boost phase the upper and lower chambers of the XLR-67 were shut down and thrust was sustained by the center chamber alone. Fuel for the XLR-67 included [...] of white fuming nitric acid oxidizer and [...] of JP-4 jet fuel. The oxidizer was stored in a series of tube bundles instead of a spherical storage tank. It is believed this configuration was chosen because it weighed less than a spherical tank of the same volume. Propellant was provided to the thrust chambers by a turbine driven propellant pump. A gas generator powered the propellant pump. The propellants were glow plug ignited. Bell contracted with Purdue University for the glow plug ignition system. Aerojet provided the pump drive assemblies.|$|R

50|$|The most {{widespread}} {{application of}} cyclorotors is for ship propulsion and control.

In 1922, Kurt Kirstin fitted a pair of cyclorotors to a 32 ft boat in Washington, which eliminated {{the need for a}} rudder and provided extreme maneuverability. While the idea floundered in the United States after the Kirsten-Boeing Propeller Company lost a US Navy research grant, the Voith-Schneider propeller company successfully commercially employed the propeller. This Voith-Schneider propeller was fitted to more than 100 ships prior to the outbreak of the second world war. Today, the same company sells the same propeller for highly maneuverable watercraft. It is applied on offshore drilling ships, tugboats, and ferries.|$|R

40|$|In the thesis, a {{lifting body}} has been {{designed}} aiming to generate lift force for the pentacopter, called TILT LR (Long Range), at higher velocities during flights to improve the aerodynamic performances. The configuration, which is used as the skeleton of the long range drone for up to 75 kilometers flights, is based upon a tilting system allowing the rotors to rotate around their own axis in both pitch and roll angles. This offers the possibility to the TILT LR flying withoutany <b>vertical</b> excess <b>thrust</b> at a proper angle of attack and velocity. This new drone can be directly applied to missions require long flight time or cover long distance, such as Search & Rescue(SAR), power lines and off-shore structures inspection, fire monitoring or surveillance. Several main CAD models have been created {{during the process of}} design and presented in the report together with the final design. For each model in the process, CFD simulations have been applied to observe the behaviors of the flows around the surfaces of the body during steady flights, followed by a brief analysis for further modification.

40|$|A multiaxis thrust {{vectoring}} nozzle {{designed to}} have equal flow turning capability in {{pitch and yaw}} was conceived and experimentally tested for internal, static performance. The cruciform-shaped convergent-divergent nozzle turned the flow for thrust vectoring by deflecting the divergent surfaces of the nozzle, called flaps. Methods for eliminating physical interference between pitch and yaw flaps at the larger multiaxis deflection angles was studied. These methods included restricting the pitch flaps from {{the path of the}} yaw flaps and shifting the flow path at the throat off the nozzle centerline to permit larger pitch-flap deflections without interfering with the operation of the yaw flaps. Two flap widths were tested at both dry and afterburning settings. <b>Vertical</b> and reverse <b>thrust</b> configurations at dry power were also tested. Comparison with two dimensional convergent-divergent nozzles showed lower but still competitive thrust performance and thrust vectoring capability...|$|R
30|$|The {{calculated}} {{stress tensor}} (Figure  3 inlay) shows well-defined orientations for σ 1, σ 2, and σ 3. The axis of maximum stress (s 1) {{lies in the}} horizontal plane and the axis of minimum stress (s 3) in the <b>vertical</b> plane indicating <b>thrust</b> faulting. The stress ratio of R = 0.19 implies a transpressional tectonic regime (Michael 1984, 1987), which {{is in line with}} the already described tectonic context (Cobbold et al. 1996). The evaluation of the derived stress tensor reveals predominately thrust faulting where the principal compressive stress axis has a direction of 340 ° (NNW-SSE) combined with strike-slip components. A large proportion of the hypocenters are co-located with the faults mapped at the surface, although the earthquakes hardly delineate them clearly. This is most likely due to the short operation period of the FERGANA network limited to 1 year, implying that not enough earthquakes were captured.|$|R
