The chemical composition, specific surface area and grading of SSA were determined. By means of XRD analysis, the occurrence of crystalline materials was detected and by means of SEM the morphology of ashes was investigated. By means of <b>Vicat's</b> <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> the initial and final times of setting were defined. The replacement of cement with 10 or 20 % SSA resulted in setting times extension. The chemical composition may suggest that setting times extension was caused by the occurrence of phosphorus in SSA. The standard compressive strength of 10 % and 20 % SSA mortars were lower. The partial replacement of cements with SSA ash makes the kinetics of strength development slow down. However, the long-term increase in compressive strength of mortar was higher compared to OPC mortar. It means that it was partially similar to the influence of the fly ash...|$|R

Morphology observation shows {{that both the}} medium MW and the lower MW SEBS are {{more effective than the}} higher MW SEBS in compatibilizing the blends. Tensile tests revels both the medium and low MW compatibilizer lead to a significant improvement in tensile strength, while the higher MW compatibilizer is efficient in increasing the elongation at break of the blends. The localization of compatibilizers in the blends is observed by mean of SEM and the correlation between the distribution of the compatibilizers and mechanical properties of the blends is evaluated. The mechanical properties of the iPP/sPS blends depend on not only the interfacial activity of the compatibilizers but also the distribution of the compatibilizer in the blend. Addition of the compatibilizers to the blend causes a remarkable decrease in the magnitude of the crystallization peak of sPS at its usual T c. <b>Vicat</b> <b>softening</b> <b>points</b> demonstrate that the heat resistance of iPP/sPS blend is much higher than that of the pure iPP...|$|R

40|$|Thermally exfoliated {{graphene}} oxide (TEGO) reinforced {{polyethylene terephthalate}} (PET) nanocomposites with controlled crystallinity, chain conformations and thermo-mechanical properties were produced with very low TEGO weight fractions by a twin-screw compounding extruder. Tensile modulus {{was found to}} increase by 52 % {{by the addition of}} 1 wt% TEGO. This significant increase in mechanical properties of PET nanocomposites was explained by well intercalation of PET chains through multi-layer graphene sheets and complete coverage of graphene surface by electrostatic interactions. An increase in the ratio of gauche and trans conformations in PET chains indicated that PET nanocomposites became more crystalline by increasing TEGO amount. Transmission electron microscopy observations showed the favorable interaction between TEGO sheets and PET matrix facilitating the dispersion and flattening of graphene sheets into polymeric matrix during elongation. The integration of 1 wt% TEGO sheets into PET matrix enhanced heat distortion temperature from 71 °C for neat specimen upto 91. 6 °C at the constant stress of 0. 45 MPa, and increased <b>Vicat</b> <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> from 76 °C upto 95 °C.

40|$|A {{series of}} blends of Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) and Polycarbonate (PC) were {{prepared}} {{and some of}} their thermal and mechanical properties were determined. The Young’s modulus changed gradually and monotonically with the polycarbonate content. This effect was tentatively explained as the antiplasticization of the PC which is ascribed to the chain mobility, which permits the PC chains to pack more tightly, to the secondary cross-linking between the PC chains, or to the secondary attachment of bulky side-chains to the PC, thus producing steric hindrance to the rotation of the PC main chains. The experimental values found for the impact strength were intermediate between those of the neat polymers, depending upon the dispersed rubber particles of butadiene in the matrix of SAN (Styrene-Acrylonitrile), and the dispersed PC particles which generally make the ABS more brittle. A maximum value of about 88 KJ/m 2 for the impact strength was observed for the blend with 90 % PC. This may be attributed to the strong polymer-polymer interactions for this particular composition. The variations in the heat deflection temperature HDT and the <b>Vicat</b> <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> with the blend composition were very similar, and allowed us to assume that the phase inversion between the matrices of the two polymers takes place at 50 % PC.

The FA content was varied from 0 to 40 wt%. The effect of polymeric compatibilizing agents with dif-ferent MFI and very high maleic anhydride (MAH) content on interfacial adhesion between filler and matrix and filler dispersion were studied. The mechanical and thermal properties of the composite material were evaluated, and the microstructure was investigated through scanning electron microscopy. The values of yield stress and breaking strength of compatibilized PP/PP-g-MAH/FA-based composites showed higher values compared to that of untreated FA-filled PP composites at corresponding filler content. Incorporation of FA into PP led to stiffer materials, as tensile modulus increased significantly. Tensile and impact properties varied with varying molecular weight of PP in PP-g-MAH and are essentially decided by wettability of the filler. It is also found that heat-deflection temperature and <b>vicat</b> <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> improved with the addition of FA filler.

The investigation of crystallinity degree using DSC method as well as the investigation of the structure using optical microscopy have been made. Hardness by ball indentation method, Shore hardness, <b>Vicat</b> <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> and water absorptivity were tested. Design/methodology/approach: Investigation using DMTA method was carried out for samples subjected to one-axial bending. The change {{in the value of the}} storage modulus E’ and the mechanical loss factor (tangent δ) in function of the temperature and oscillation frequency in DMTA tests were determined. In order to verify the change of thermal properties of PP with 2 % of dye addition, before and after electrochemical ageing, the investigation using DSC method was made. Findings: Higher values of the storage modulus occurred for the samples with dye addition. The crystallinity degree values were lower for the samples after electrochemical ageing. It was found that electrochemical ageing results in decrease in hardness values and Vicat softening temperature while increase in water absorptivity was noticed.

According to ISO  15270 : 2008, the recommended percentage of recyclability is maintained upto 25 % by weight depending upon requirements. To qualify the products made up of polypropylene, besides rudimentary {{tensile strength at break}} and percentage elongation at break [ASTM: D 638 - 03]; density [ASTM: D- 792] and VSP (<b>Vicat</b> <b>Softening</b> <b>Point)</b> [ASTM: D- 1525] were also considered, which are also very much needed to qualify products made up of PP. Virgin to recycled material ratio (V:R), injection pressure (IP), injection temperature (IT) and injection speed (IS) were the parameters dictating the product's quality and they all were taken at three levels. A Box-Behnken model of design of experiment was adopted to reduce the numbers of experiments instead of adopting full factorial layout. The raw material used for the experiments was Injection Grade Polypropylene Homomer (Grade: M- 110) manufactured by M/s Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd. The specimens for the optimization were made as per ASTM-D 638 - 03 -TYPE-I. To ascertain tensile strength and elongation at break, Universal Testing Machine (H 100 KS- 0081) made by Hounsfield Test Equipment was used. VSP was determined by using microprocessor controlled HDT/VSP apparatus (model-MP 3 Eod 100 / 002, 20008305), made by Atsfaar, Italy. Density of PP sample is measured by using Dhona (200 D, 29048).

In order to understand this behavior, the structure and thermal properties of the PSA were investigated in detail, along with another PSA crosslinked by a covalent crosslinking agent (Az). From thermal mechanical analysis, the PSA with ionic crosslinks (AlACA) showed three <b>softening</b> <b>points</b> at 20, 60, and 160 °C. In comparison, the PSA covalently crosslinked by Az only exhibited two <b>softening</b> <b>points</b> (at 20 and 60 °C).

DSC measurements indicated that the <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> at 20 °C resulted from melting of the ordered octadecyl group, and the <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> at 60 °C was due to an increase in the mobility of the main chain. The temperature dependence of viscoelastic measurements revealed that the viscosity of the PSA crosslinked by AlACA increased at around 160 °C.

The morphologies and distributions {{of the chemical}} components of the blends were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and synchrotron Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy. The effects of R-PA 6 content on the <b>Vicat</b> <b>softening</b> temperature (VST), heat distortion temperature (HDT), and impact strength of the blends were studied. Remarkably, in comparison with those of UHMWPE, the VST and HDT of UHMWPE/R-PA 6 blends with 44 [*]wt% R-PA 6 were increased to 165. 1 and 98. 4 °C, respectively, and the Charpy impact strength and Izod impact strength of the blends were enhanced to 33. 9 and 16. 2 [*]kJ/m 2, respectively. In addition, {{it was found that}} the blending system containing 44 [*]wt% R-PA 6 and 48 [*]wt% UHMWPE exhibited the best compatibility when it was prepared using 8 [*]wt% HDPE-g-MAH. The distribution of the phases of UHMWPE and R-PA 6 was uniform, and no obvious phase separation was observed in the blends...|$|R
