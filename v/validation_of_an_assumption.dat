40|$|Supporting high {{availability}} by checkpointing and {{switching to a}} backup upon failure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> primary has a cost. Trade-off studies help system architects to decide whether higher availability {{at the cost of}} higher response time is to strive for. The decision will lead to configuring a faulttolerant server for best performance. This paper provides a mathematical model employing queuing theory that helps to compute the optimal checkpointing interval for a primarybackup replicated server. The optimization criterion is system availability. The model guides towards the checkpointing interval that is short enough to give low failover time, but long enough to utilize most of the system resources for servicing client requests. The novelty of the work is the detailed modelling of service times, wait times for earlier calls in the queue, and priority of checkpointing calls over client calls within the queues. Studies on the model in Mathematica and <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> modelling <b>assumption</b> through simulations are included. ...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{is often}} the most {{important}} non-functional property for database systems and associated replication solutions. This is true at least in in-dustrial contexts. Evaluating performance using real systems, however, is com-putationally demanding and costly. In many cases, choosing between several competing replication protocols poses a difficulty in ranking these protocols meaningfully: the ranking is determined {{not so much by}} the quality of the com-peting protocols but, instead, by the quality of the available implementations. Addressing this difficulty requires <b>a</b> level <b>of</b> abstraction in which the impact on the comparison of the implementations is reduced, or entirely eliminated. We propose a stochastic model for performance evaluation of database replication protocols, paying particular attention to: i) empirical <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> used in the stochastic model, and ii) empirical <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> model accuracy for a chosen replication protocol. For the empirical validations we used the TPC-C benchmark. Our implementation of the model is based on Stochastic Activity Networks (SAN), extended by bespoke code. The model may reduce the cost of performance evaluation in comparison with empirical measurements, while keeping the accuracy of the assessment to an acceptable level...|$|R

Results: For the process <b>of</b> criterion <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diagnostic test or a measurement scale, we always take four steps: select an appropriate gold standard, determine the sample size, set the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Finally, determine the agreement between two diagnostic tests or scales. Conclusions: The criterion <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diagnostic test or a measurement scale is a systematic process that requires proper development.

We are interested in the <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specific model <b>of</b> knowledge representation: the conceptual graph model. We present <b>a</b> semantic <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> conceptual graphs based on constraints given by an expert. The semantic <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knowledge base composed of conceptual graphs consists in checking its quality according to two kinds of constraints. The existential constraints allow one to express knowledge which must be deduced or which must absolutely not be deduced from the knowledge base. The descriptive constraints characterize the properties a conceptual graph must verify in the knowledge base. Descriptive constraints can be minimal or maximal to express the notions of “at least” and “at most”. We introduce the notion of specification which is <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> constraints linked by logical operators. The <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knowledge base is made according to these specifications, by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conceptual graph operation: the projection...|$|R
