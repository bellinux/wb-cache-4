PCB Piezo accelerometers were used to measure vibration in three orthogonal directions. No vibration measurements were conducted on the self-propelled drill. RESULTS: All four drills emitted noise exceeding 85 dB(A).

40|$|A Coriolis Mass-Flow Meter (CMFM) is {{an active}} device based on the Coriolis force {{principle}} for direct mass-flow measurements, with high accuracy, range-ability and repeatability. The working principle of a CMFM is as follows: a fluid conveying tube is actuated to oscillate at a low amplitude. A fluid-flow in the vibrating tube induces Coriolis forces, which are proportional to the mass-flow, and affect the tube motion. Measuring the tube displacement {{in such a way}} that the change of its mode shape is determined, allows calculating the mass-flow. For low flows (< 1 kg/h), the Coriolis force induced motion is relatively small compared to motions induced by external vibrations, thus CMFMs designed to be sensitive to low flows are rather sensitive to external vibrations. Mainly external <b>vibrations</b> around the <b>meter’s</b> drive and Coriolis frequencies result in a measurement error. A model-based, quantitative estimation of the expected mass-flow error in response to external vibrations is obtained. The sensitivity to external vibrations is reduced, using passive and active vibration isolation solutions. Passive vibration isolation consists of a mass-spring-damper system between the floor and the measurement device. The performance is insufficient, because the suspension frequency is limited by the maximum stress in the connection tubes and a maximum allowable sag due to gravity. Therefore the passively suspended stage is extended with voice-coil actuators and absolute motion sensors to apply active vibration isolation control. Increased narrow-band vibration attenuation is achieved using loop shaping feedback control. Alternatively, an innovative feed-forward strategy is used, where by the parameters, which are tuned using an adaptive FxLMS technique, are based on the damping and stiffness properties of the stage. Based on the theoretic models, a proof of principle mechanism is realised for validation, whereby attenuation of more than 40 dB is achieved. The performance is limited by sensor noise and for the feedback solution also by the destabilising effect of higher order dynamics. The thesis presents a comprehensive analysis on how vibration isolation can be achieved. Narrow-band active vibration isolation control is successfully implemented in a design of a CMFM, for the first time...|$|R
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} about {{modeling}} {{and control of}} crane placed on an offshore vessel. An active heave compensating crane, designed by MacGregor, {{has been used as}} a basis for developing the crane model. Cranes of this type are placed on a wide variety of vessels and operate all over the world. Besides MacGregor, several other well reputated crane suppliers design similar cranes. In addition, two inverse kinematics control algorithms and three input shapers have been described, implemented and tested in Simulink. The model of the MacGregor crane was developed mathematically using robot modeling theory. The resulting model was implemented in Simulink and verified both mathematically and against a SimMechanics model. In addition, a cable model and vessel crane interaction were added to the Simulink model. The total Simulink model responded according to expectations during simulations. Two inverse kinematics algorithms were implemented and tested. Both had vessel kinematics incorporated. As a result, these two algorithms enabled the crane to counteract the vessel motion. This control method is also of interest to operators. It enables the them to control the crane in the workspace, instead of in the joint space. Simulations show that the two inverse kinematics algorithms were able to keep the crane tip at a fixed point in an earth fixed reference frame. However, in sea state 6 the vessel motion was fluctuating to fast, making the crane unable to keep the crane tip at a fixed point. The input shaping control algorithm shapes the control input given from the operator in a manner that makes the crane stop at any point with reduced payload swing. The effect of increasing the robustness of the shaper was checked using three different shapers. Simulations showed that the input shapers were able to reduce the residual vibration.

40|$|Classical {{fabrication}} methods alone do not enable manufacturing {{of large}} flat mirrors {{that are much}} larger than 1 meter. This dissertation presents the development of enabling technologies for manufacturing large high performance flat mirrors and lays the foundation for manufacturing very large flat mirrors. The enabling fabrication and testing methods were developed during the manufacture of a 1. 6 meter flat. The key advantage over classical methods is that our method is scalable to larger flat mirrors up to 8 m in diameter. Large tools were used during surface grinding and coarse polishing of the 1. 6 m flat. During this stage, electronic levels provided efficient measurements on global surface changes in the mirror. The electronic levels measure surface inclination or slope very accurately. They measured slope changes across the mirror surface. From the slope information, we can obtain surface information. Over 2 m, the electronic levels can measure to 50 nm rms of low order aberrations that include power and astigmatism. The use of electronic levels for flatness measurements is analyzed in detail. Surface figuring was performed with smaller tools (size ranging from 15 cm to 40 cm in diameter). A radial stroker was developed and used to drive the smaller tools; the radial stroker provided variable tool stroke and rotation (up to 8 revolutions per minute). Polishing software, initially developed for stressed laps, enabled computer controlled polishing and was used to generate simulated removal profiles by optimizing tool stroke and dwell to reduce the high zones on the mirror surface. The resulting simulations from the polishing software were then applied to the real mirror. The scanning pentaprism and the 1 <b>meter</b> <b>vibration</b> insensitive Fizeau interferometer provided accurate and efficient surface testing to guide the remaining fabrication. The scanning pentaprism, another slope test, measured power to 9 nm rms over 2 meters. The Fizeau interferometer measured 1 meter subapertures and measured the 1. 6 meter flat to 3 nm rms; the 1 meter reference flat was also calibrated to 3 nm rms. Both test systems are analyzed in detail. During surface figuring, the fabrication and testing were operated in a closed loop. The closed loop operation resulted in a rapid convergence of the mirror surface (11 nm rms power, and 6 nm rms surface irregularity). At present, the surface figure for the finished 1. 6 m flat is {{state of the art}} for 2 meter class flat mirrors...|$|R
40|$|Connections between {{building}} {{damage and}} vibration intensity has been examined by few researcher. Indeedtackling of effort about bigger {{damage has been}} examined too. But connections between traffic character andbig vibration in the street edge isn 2 ̆ 7 t much inspect. Some of literature almost study about connections betweenvibration and traffic micro and too specify, such as to look vibration character and it 2 ̆ 7 s relation with vehiclecharacteristic. Generally details like it is less applicative, Theoretically it 2 ̆ 7 s better do by perform a formula. To aim {{this study is to}} examine of connections between vibration in the street edge and traffic characteristic athighway. Traffic characteristic which examined covering are traffic volume and average of traffic speed. To support the aim, survey and analysis is needed. Survey material needs are vibration survey, traffic speed,traffic volume and few road characteristic. Survey did at the street edge with three location where everylocation have few different road characteristic, in this case wide of drainage as of attentuation wide. Everylocations inspected by variable inspection distance are 5 m. 15 m and 25 m. Speed and traffic volume datarecorded in every location by using manual record, While vibration data recorded at every point of everylocation by using <b>vibration</b> record Vibecheck <b>meter.</b> Result of recording processed and analyzed to obtain average value and it data distribution. To viewconnections between vibration and traffic characteristic, distance and attentuation, to perform correlation andregretion examine. Regretion examine used for mode calibration connections between vibration and trafficcharacteristic, distance and attentuation based on Watt style. Exams result show that 1) There is strong relation between vibration with distance of examine and attentuationwide, where that connections is negative identifying, 2) There is strong relation between vibration and trafficspeed but not with traffic volume and heave vehicle on the traffic, where that connections is positive identifying, 3) Watt style calibration examine result gave good enough result if we look R² value of correlation examineresult which reach 0, 96. From analysis result we can concluded some cases, 1) cause vibration is effected by traffic speed then decreaseof vibration effect can performed by limitation speed especially at residence area and 2) cause vibration iseffected by distance and attentuation, then decrease of vibration effect can performed by widest distancebetween building and street edge and widest attentuation in this case is drainag...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Buses {{are one of}} the {{important}} public transportation in Malaysia and commonly important for the student in any university. Thus, the study about Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) exposure induces to Low Back Pain (LBP) among the Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) was done. The objective was determine whether the bus drivers in UTHM would exceed the exposure action and limit values from the ISO 2631 - 1 (1997) during the working hours. Data collected according to different type of buses and evaluated the vibration significant different between buses based on the subjective correlation due to WBV questionnaire analysis. Analyze the prevalence of LBP based on the measurement and the questionnaire analysis. The study based on the international standard ISO 2631 - 1 (1997) which is related to the root-men-square (r. m. s) and Vibration Dose Value (VDV) parameter. The study covered among the bus drivers in UTHM. The measurement tools involved in the study is Larson Davis <b>Vibration</b> <b>Meter</b> (HVM 100) with Tri-axial Seat Pad Accelerometer to record data collection. The BLAZE software analyze the vibration exposure exceed the total vibration exposure according to 8 hours day A(8) value of 1. 15 m/s 2 and VDV value of 21. 0 m/s 1. 75. The IBM Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) was used to do statistical analysis and testing involved was correlation, regression and ANOVA. Result obtaine...|$|E
