40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} sound and {{complete}} tableau proof system for establishing whether {{a set of}} elements of an arbitrary transition system model has a property expressed in (a slight extension of) the modal mu-calculus. The proof system, we believe, offers a very general <b>verification</b> <b>method</b> <b>applicable</b> {{to a wide range}} of computational systems. 1. Introduction In the last twenty years many approaches to program verification have been developed. Hoare's partial correctness logic for simple while programs gave an early sound and relatively complete proof system. This approach was subsequently extended to total correctness and to richer classes of programs. Dynamic logics offered a more abstract view of Hoare logics, especially in their propositional versions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the field of {{developing}} and deploying highly automated manufacturing systems. Especially {{the stage of the}} control programming suffers from few <b>applicable</b> <b>verification</b> <b>methods,</b> as existing approaches still include drawbacks. The virtual commissioning, as one example, requires additional effort in creating simulation models to being usable. This work presents a method, which reduces the effort of generating simulation models through an automated reuse and transformation of existing development documents. In a detailed case study, a software prototype implementing the method was executed to derive a simulation model of an existing set of information. The used sources, their transformation and the results are described to give a qualified impression of the method's possibilities...|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} for multi-method dispatch, called Single-Receiver Projections and abbreviated SRP, is presented. It operates by performing projections onto single-receiver dispatch tables, and thus benefits from existing research into single-receiver dispatch techniques. It provides method dispatch in O(k), where k is the arity of the method. Unlike existing multi-method dispatch techniques, it also maintains {{the set of}} all <b>applicable</b> <b>methods.</b> This extra information allows SRP to support languages like CLOS that use next-method. SRP is also highly incremental in nature, so it is well-suited for languages that require separate compilation and languages that allow methods and classes to be added at run-time. SRP uses less data-structure memory than all existing multi-method techniques and has the second fastest dispatch time. Furthermore, if the other techniques are extended to support all <b>applicable</b> <b>methods,</b> SRP becomes the fastest dispatch techniques. RESEARCH PAPER Subject [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Runtime {{verification}} is {{an alternative}} to static <b>verification,</b> <b>applicable</b> when the latter is impossible (e. g., for lack of the specification of the system to be verified) or computationally too costly. Runtime verification usually requires observability of the system to be verified, that is, complete knowledge of the execution trace being discussed. However, such a requirement might not be met. Even when it is, observation or sampling can be costly, {{so as to make}} it worth reasoning about incomplete execution traces. In this paper, we consider the problem of reasoning on incomplete execution traces to verify properties expressed in linear temporal logic. We show how, with suitable hypotheses on the properties to be checked and on the structure of the partial trace, it is possible to reason about the complete trace by observing only the partial trace. ...|$|R
