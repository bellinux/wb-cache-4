5|$|Max Payne 2 {{allows the}} player to enable bullet time, a mode that slows time, while still {{allowing}} the player to aim in real-time, {{to give the}} player more time to determine {{what they want to}} do. In this mode, the screen's color changes to a sepia tone to act as a <b>visual</b> <b>cue.</b> When in use, the bullet time meter will decrease until it is either empty or the player disables bullet time mode. The meter will eventually increase when not in use, but can be replenished quickly by killing enemies. To simulate the bullet time effect, Max can also execute a shoot-dodge maneuver. When the maneuver is performed, Max jumps in a direction specified by the player, and although Bullet Time is activated while Max is in mid-air, this will not deplete the bullet time meter. The combat system has been improved for Max Payne 2; the player can now arm Max with a secondary weapon such as a grenade or Molotov cocktail, and when near an enemy, Max can pistol whip them. AI companions can occasionally come to Max's aid, although their deaths do not affect the gameplay or story.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} out-of-the-window cues on {{learning}} a straight-in landing approach and a level 360 deg turn by novice pilots {{on a flight}} simulator have been investigated.

40|$|The present {{research}} focuses on the relation between tone and gesture across varieties of the same language, European Portuguese (EP). Three questions are addressed: (i) whether EP varieties use different <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> while producing different sentence types/pragmatic meanings, (ii) {{if there is a}} relation between intonational variation and variability (if any) of <b>visual</b> <b>cues,</b> and (iii) if each linguistic factor involved can predict the type of <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> used. Two sentence types (statements/yes-no questions) and pragmatic meanings (broad/narrow focus) were examined in four varieties of EP. Results show that <b>visual</b> <b>cues,</b> like intonation, may vary across varieties and sentence types/pragmatic meanings. Furthermore, sentence type and pragmatic meaning are good predictors of how <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> are time-aligned with intonation, in contrast with language variety.

The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for clues to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and clues to inform the player that the object may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off a glow as a <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> to the player, and health drinks.

5|$|While no new locales were {{introduced}} in Episode One, large alterations {{were made to the}} appearance of both City 17 where the game takes place and the Citadel from the end of Half-Life 2 to reflect the changing shape of the world and remind the player that their actions have major effects on the story line. The Citadel has degenerated from the cold, alien, and imposing fortress of the previous game into an extremely unstable state. This provides a <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> to the player of the catastrophic damage they inflicted, and it allows for the introduction of new gameplay elements that accentuate the dangers which come with the Citadel's imminent collapse. In addition, it serves a thematic purpose by highlighting the weakening of the Combine's dominance in City 17. Likewise, City 17 has been altered to reflect the aftermath of the resistance's open rebellion, with vast swathes of destroyed buildings, and the introduction of foes previously kept outside its confines in Half-Life 2 to emphasize the scale of the uprising.|$|E
25|$|Ventriloquism {{has been}} used as the {{evidence}} for the modality appropriateness hypothesis. Ventriloquism describes the situation in which auditory location perception is shifted toward a <b>visual</b> <b>cue.</b> The original study describing this phenomenon was conducted by Howard and Templeton, (1966) after which several studies have replicated and built upon the conclusions they reached. In conditions in which the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> is unambiguous, visual capture reliably occurs. Thus to test the influence of sound on perceived location, the visual stimulus must be progressively degraded. Furthermore, given that auditory stimuli are more attuned to temporal changes, recent studies have tested the ability of temporal characteristics to influence the spatial location of visual stimuli. Some types of EVP – electronic voice phenomenon, mainly the ones using sound bubles are considered a kind of modern ventriloquism technique and is played by the use of sophisticated software, computers and sound equipment.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} visual {{obstruction}} and <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> on human locomotion, when performing a targeting foot placement task while walking was examined.

There were four <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> conditions (no <b>visual</b> <b>cues,</b> target-nonspecific-cues, target-specific-close cues, and target-specific-far cues). Accuracy was decreased by visual obstruction; this decrease was not mediated by <b>visual</b> <b>cues.</b> However, <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> modified the swing kinematics and foot placement variability. Therefore, <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> modified how the task was accomplished, but did not affect the outcome achieved. Increased head pitch range and head pitch minimum were observed, consistent with visual sampling prior to the target stride. Greater adjustments were observed in the penultimate stride, leading to a smooth targeting stride. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{freshwater}} environments, chemosensory cues play {{an important}} role in predatorprey interactions. Prey use a variety of chemosensory cues to detect and avoid predators. However, whether predators use the chemical cues released by disturbed or stressed prey has received less attention. Here we tested the hypothesis that the disturbance cue cortisol, in conjunction with <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> of prey, elevates predatory behavior. We presented predators (perch, Perca fluviatilis) with three chemosensory choice tests and recorded their location, orientation, and aggressive behavior. We compared the responses of predators when provided with (i) <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> of prey only (two adjacent tanks containing sticklebacks); (ii) visual and natural chemical cues of prey vs. <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> only; and (iii) <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> of prey with cortisol vs. <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> only. Perch spent a significantly higher proportion of time in proximity to prey, and orientated toward prey more, when presented with a cortisol stimulus plus <b>visual</b> <b>cues,</b> relative to presentations of visual and natural chemical cues of prey, or <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> of prey only. There was a trend that perch directed a higher proportion of predatory behaviors (number of lunges) toward sticklebacks when presented with a cortisol stimulus plus <b>visual</b> <b>cues,</b> relative to the other chemosensory conditions. But they did not show a significant increase in total predatory behavior in response to cortisol. Therefore, it is not clear whether water-borne cortisol, in conjunction with <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> of prey, affects predatory behavior. Our results provide evidence that cortisol could be a source of public information about prey state and/or disturbance, but further work is required to confirm this...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNeurologically normal {{subjects}} misperceive the midpoints {{of lines}} (PSE) as reliably leftward of veridical center, a {{phenomenon known as}} pseudoneglect. This leftward bias reflects {{the dominance of the}} right cerebral hemisphere in deploying spatial attention. Transient <b>visual</b> <b>cues,</b> delivered to either the left or right endpoints of lines, modulate PSE such that leftward biases are increased by leftward cues, and are decreased by rightward cues, relative to a no-cue control condition. We ask whether lateralized auditory cues can similarly influence PSE in a tachistoscopic visual line bisection task, and describe how <b>visual</b> and auditory <b>cues,</b> in spatially synergistic or antagonistic combinations, jointly influence PSE. Our results demonstrate that whereas auditory and <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> both modulate PSE, <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> are overall more potent than auditory <b>cues.</b> <b>Visual</b> and auditory <b>cues</b> are weighted such that <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> are significantly more potent than auditory <b>cues</b> when <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> are delivered to left hemispace. <b>Visual</b> and auditory <b>cues</b> are equipotent when <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> are delivered to right hemispace. These results are consistent with the existence of independent lateralized networks governing the deployment of visuospatial and audiospatial attention. An analysis of the weighting of unisensory <b>visual</b> and auditory <b>cues</b> which optimally predicts PSE in multisensory cue conditions shows that cues combine additively.

40|$|Myrmica ruginodis NYLANDER, 1846 foragers were {{differentially}} {{conditioned to}} two olfactory and two <b>visual</b> <b>cues.</b> The ants were then placed in mazes provided with either olfactory <b>cues,</b> or <b>visual</b> <b>cues,</b> or with successively or alternatively set <b>visual</b> and olfactory <b>cues.</b> In the latter case, the ants scored consistently higher {{in front of}} <b>visual</b> <b>cues.</b> The condi-tioned ants perfectly negotiated mazes provided with correct <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> and wrong olfactory ones, but moved incor-rectly through mazes provided with wrong <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> and correct olfactory ones. M. ruginodis foragers thus primarily used <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> to orient themselves when traveling, neglected olfactory cues and continued to respond to <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> even if they became obsolete. However, when responding to olfactory cues, the ants responded to the actual odor {{and not to the}} visual perception of the odorous object, and were able to discriminate amongst the odors. M. ruginodis wor-kers also distinguished differently colored cues. Unexpectedly, they failed to respond to the lower vertical part of the learned <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> and responded entirely to the upper part of these cues. This means that when foraging or traveling, their main field of visual perception is above them and not in front of them. Under conditions of low light intensity (< 5 lux), M. ruginodis workers could no longer respond to <b>visual</b> <b>cues.</b> In such instances, they relied on odorous elements to find their way and did so better than under high light intensity. They responded to olfactory cues under low light intensity, even if wrong <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> were added and even if the olfactory cues were incorrectly set in the mazes. In the latter case, the ants progressively stopped responding to the obsolete olfactory cues.

Hence {{the role played by}} peripheral <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> in the planning and/or online control of movement remains unclear. The aim of this thesis was to provide a systematic understanding of the importance of peripheral <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> in several types of movement, namely overground locomotion, adaptive gait, postural stability and reaching and grasping. 3 D motion capture techniques were used to collect limb and whole body kinematics during such movements. <b>Visual</b> peripheral <b>cues</b> were manipulated by visual field occlusion conditions or by the employment of point-lights in a dark room.

The absence of peripheral <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> while moving disrupted the spatio-temporal dynamic relationship between subject and target and resulted in increased margins of safety between body and target and increased time and variability of several dependent measures.

25|$|During the {{absconding}} process, the workers, {{rather than}} the queen, choose the new nesting site, behaviour characteristic of independent founding species. It has been hypothesized that the process is mediated by pheromones. During their {{search for a new}} nesting site, R. romandi workers have been observed to exhibit a behavior called ‘metasomal dragging’. This means that the wasp drags its metasome or gaster, the second abdominal segment and sections posterior to it, along objects on which it lands. These objects are usually leaves, rocks, or man made structures. There are glands {{on the underside of the}} gaster that leave a scent behind for the other workers and the queens to follow. Wasps that didn't exhibit metasomal dragging can often be seen inspecting objects with their antennae, presumably following the scent trail. This pheromone path helps recruit all other members of the colony to the new nesting site. Visual information may also be very important during the R. romandi absconding process, and may even be the ultimate signal identifying the new nesting site. As wasps continue to make their way to the new nesting site, they can be seen orienting themselves to aerial swarms that had formed around the new site. This orientation to aerial swarms has been observed in the absence of continued metasomal dragging as well, leading to the hypothesis that the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> of the aerial swarm is the indication of the final nesting site.|$|E

40|$|Mainstream theory {{suggests}} that the approximate number system supports our non-symbolic number abilities (e. g. estimating or comparing different sets of items). It is argued that this system can extract number independently of the <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> present in the stimulus (diameter, aggregate surface, etc.). However, {{in a recent report}} we argue that this might not be the case. We showed that participants combined information from different <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> to derive their answers. While numerosity comparison requires a rough comparison of two sets of items (smaller versus larger), numerosity estimation requires a more precise mechanism. It could therefore be that numerosity estimation, in contrast to numerosity comparison, might rely on the approximate number system. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a numerosity estimation experiment. We controlled for the <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> according to current standards: each single visual property was not informative about numerosity. Nevertheless, the results reveal that participants were influenced by the visual properties of the dot arrays. They gave a larger estimate when the dot arrays consisted of dots with, on average, a smaller diameter, aggregate surface or density but a larger convex hull. The reliance on <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> to estimate numerosity suggests that the existence of an approximate number system that can extract numerosity independently of the <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> is unlikely. Instead, we propose that humans estimate numerosity by weighing the different <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> present in the stimuli...|$|R
