5000|$|At this point, {{the tower}} {{asked for the}} pilot's position. After {{a few minutes of}} silence (at 16:59) came the reply: [...] "Quota 2,000 meters. QDM on Pino, then we will cut at Superga". At Pino Torinese, which is located between Chieri and Baldissero Torinese, {{southeast}} of Turin, there was a <b>VDF</b> radio station (<b>VHF</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder),</b> to provide a QDM (magnetic course to be taken on a head on approach as a radio aid) on request.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{direction}} finding effort {{within the}} UK now (2009) is directed towards locating unauthorised [...] "pirate" [...] FM broadcast radio transmissions. A network of remotely operated <b>VHF</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> are used mainly located around the major cities. The transmissions from mobile telephone handsets are also located by {{a form of}} direction finding using the comparative signal strength at the surrounding local [...] "cell" [...] receivers. This technique is often offered as evidence in UK criminal prosecutions and, almost certainly, for SIGINT purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{airport was}} founded in 1926 by Aeronautica Militare, Italy's {{military}} air force. A flight training facility was established between 1933 and 1943. The first hangar was designed by the famous architect Pier Luigi Nervi. In 1946, a meteorological service was established, and in 1952, the Salerno Air Club was founded. The airport has hosted the Carabinieri helipad since 1975, and the Firefighter helipad and a parachuting school since 1984. A new control tower was built in 1987. The airport was exclusively used by the Carabinieri, Firefighters, flight and parachuting school and small private jets until 2007.The airport was then developed to accommodate civil traffic on a large scale, with four check-in desks, two boarding areas, luggage belts and waiting rooms. The runway has a VOR system, a radio <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> <b>VDF</b> and a lighting system. The runway was extended for a total length of 1 654 m, with an extensions to 2 020 m planned. In 2011 was presented the project for {{the extension of the}} runway up to 2020 m (more than 60 m of anti blast) and for the creation of new buildings and other technical adjustments.|$|R

Provision for survivors includes comprehensive first aid equipment including stretchers, oxygen and Entonox. They carry a portable salvage pump in a water-tight container, {{and can also}} carry out pumping and fire-fighting tasks using the engine-driven general service pump.|$|R
50|$|Kaimimoana has 950 sq ft of {{laboratory}} space. On deck, {{she has a}} brailing winch, a CTD winch, three cranes, an A-frame, and a J-frame. She carries two boats, a 22 ft rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) as a rescue boat and a 17 ft inflatable utility boat. She is equipped with echosounders, a hull-mounted acoustic release transducer, a navigation fathometer, X-band and S-band radar, Global Positioning System receivers, a <b>VHF</b> radio <b>direction</b> <b>finder,</b> and a Sperry gyrocompass.|$|R
50|$|Eric and Susan Hiscock (Wanderer) has a {{top speed}} of 25 kn and a range of 250 nmi km.

The lifeboat has a displacement of 41 t and carries a daughter Y-class which is launched and recovered by crane. Having the Y-class enables the crew to make rescues close to shore.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of microwave <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> which operate under a variety of conditions and signal environments, but they can be divided into two major classes: (a) scanning, and (b) non-scanning. This paper discusses non-scanning multichannel amplitude-comparison systems, and in particular, systems using wide band antennas with crystal-video receivers to indicate the bearing of pulsed signals instantaneously. The accuracy of this type of <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> can be improved by increasing the number of channels. The characteristics of <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> in which there are more channels in the radio-frequency portion of the system than in the video portion were studied with an analogue of a <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The results of the analogue studies were applied in the development of an improved microwave antenna system for a tactical <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The construction and performance of this antenna system are discussed.

Subsystems of the locating system, {{which include the}} <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> and the position analyzer, are discussed. The <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> senses the electromagnetic fields radiated by lightning on two orthogonal magnetic loop antennas and on a flat plate electric antenna. The position analyzer is a preprogrammed microcomputer system which automatically computes, maps, and records lightning locations in real time using data inputs from the <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The use of the locating systems for wildfire management and fire weather forecasting is discussed...|$|R

25|$|A Bellini–Tosi <b>{{direction}}</b> <b>finder</b> (B–T or BTDF) {{is a type}} {{of radio}} <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (RDF), which determines the direction to, or bearing of, a radio transmitter. Earlier RDF systems used very large rotating loop antennae, which the B–T system replaced with two fixed antennae and a small rotating loop, known as a radiogoniometer. This made RDF much more practical, especially on large vehicles like ships or when using very long wavelengths that demand large antennae.|$|R
