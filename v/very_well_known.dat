5|$|The {{skull of}} Patagosaurus is not <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>known,</b> with a 2003 {{revision}} by Oliver Rahut determining {{only a few}} jaws are certainly referrable to it, as opposed to nearly the entire skull. MPEF-PV 1670 shows what the morphology of the adult or subadult skull was like, while MACN CH 933 represents a juvenile individual. Based upon how broad, high and short the adult articulated mandibles of Patagosaurus are, its snout would have been short, high and broad as well, a typical feature of most sauropods.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{compound}} of chlorine, sodium chloride, {{has been known}} since ancient times; archaeologists have found evidence that rock salt was used as early as 3000 BC and brine as early as 6000 BC. Its importance in food was <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> in classical antiquity and was sometimes used as payment for services for Roman generals and military tribunes. Elemental chlorine was probably first isolated around 1200 {{with the discovery of}} aqua regia and its ability to dissolve gold, since chlorine gas is one of the products of this reaction: it was however not recognised as a new substance. Around 1630, chlorine was recognized as a gas by the Flemish chemist and physician Jan Baptist van Helmont.|$|E
5|$|Böcker later {{explained}} {{that the decision to}} focus on Square Enix was made due to the large library of games to choose from, all of which he felt had a distinct sound, and many of which were <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> in Germany. An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that the music would appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II from the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross from the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites. The composers were Yoko Shimomura for the music of Kingdom Hearts, Hiroki Kikuta for the music of Secret of Mana, Yasunori Mitsuda for the music of Chrono Trigger and Cross, and Nobuo Uematsu for the music of the Final Fantasy series.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{youngest}} Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power. In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations. Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened. The work for restoring F-BTSD to operating condition as of September 2015 is currently not <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>known,</b> and it is still being housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit. In 2015, the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120million for a static display and to buy the Concorde at Le Bourget, restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by 2019, to coincide with the 50thanniversary of Concorde's first flight.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the city is not <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> before the Roman period: it is simply known that the plateau was {{occupied}} by an oppidum, traces of which were found during excavations in the Saint-Martial cemetery under the name Iculisma.

25|$|However the <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> {{and popular}} text, the Bhagavad Gita {{supports}} {{the doctrine of}} karma yoga (selfless action) or action without desire for personal gain which {{can be said to}} encompass altruism.

25|$|During {{the first}} couple of years after the war, the square was {{completely}} rebuilt from scratch.
