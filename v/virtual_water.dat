40|$|ABSTRACT: Patients with {{acquired}} chronic bilateral vestibular loss {{were recently}} {{found to have}} a significant impairment in spatial mem-ory and navigation when tested with a <b>virtual</b> Morris <b>water</b> task. These deficits were associated with selective and bilateral atrophy of the hippocampus, which suggests that spatial memory and navigation also rely on vestibular input. In the present study 16 patients with unilateral vestibular deafferentation due to acoustic neurinoma were examined 5 - to 13 -yrs post-surgery. Volumetry of the hippocampus was performed in patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls by manually tracing the structure and by an evaluator-independent voxel-based morphometry. Spatial memory and navigation were assessed with a <b>virtual</b> Morris <b>water</b> task. No significant deficits in spatial memory and navigation could be demonstrated in the patients with left vestibular failure, whereas patients with right vestibular loss showed a tendency to perform worse on the respective tests. Impairment was significant only for one computed measure (heading error). The subtle deficiencies with right vestibular loss are com-patible with the recently described dominance of the right labyrinth and the vestibular cortex in the right hemisphere. Volumetry did not reveal any atrophy of the hippocampus in either patient group...|$|R

50|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>water</b> trade {{refers to}} the idea that when goods and {{services}} are exchanged, so is <b>virtual</b> <b>water.</b> When a country imports one tonne of wheat instead of producing it domestically, it is saving about 1,300 cubic meters of real indigenous water.

The test was based on the sandbags issued by the government in flood conditions, and was performed using two rows of sand bags. Leakage rates through three grain sizes were measure. It was found that performances of sandbags were dependent on grain sizing, the larger the grain size the worse the performance. It was found that fine sediment performed better in flood conditions than mixed and coarse sediment. Fine sediment was a better performer because the sediment had tighter packing reducing the porosity and permeability. Discharge rates were calculated using the formula for discharge of water through an orifice or weir. <b>Virtual</b> inside <b>water</b> levels were predicted for a domestic property with an area of 100 ml The <b>virtual</b> inside <b>water</b> levels showed that finer sediment reduced inundation more than the corresponding sediment sizes and therefore was the best sediment size to use.

40|$|Both {{striatum}} and hippocampus {{are important}} brain areas involved in specific visuo-spatial learning. There is {{a shift in}} activation between these areas at different learning stages. Comparing brain activation in similar spatial learning tasks between mice and humans will give us more insight about the differential and time dependent contributions of striatum and hippocampus and the possible overlap in their function during different phases of learning. Here we {{will focus on the}} activation and plasticity of subregions of hippocampus. Mice were trained in the Morris water maze task for either 3 days (early learning phase) or 30 days (late learning phase) and neuronal activity due to spatial learning was determined by comparing expression levels of the immediate early genes homer 1 a and zif 268 in hippocampus 45 minutes after finishing the task (trained animals, swimming controls and controls). Behavioural analysis revealed a significant decrease in the average search distance to the platform in the late phase of training when compared to the early phase. An improvement in the directional error of the initial trajectory towards the platform was observed in the late learning phase. We compared the mouse search strategy results with acquisition curves and search strategies of hippocampal and striatal lesioned animals (at different time points). We found an overall higher activity of the hippocampus during the early learning phase compared to the late phase. Within the hippocampus, expression differences between the different areas (CA 1, CA 2 / 3 and dentate gyrus) were also observed. After finishing early and late phases of training, we also determined plasticity changes in the CA 1 hippocampal region between trained animals, swimming controls and control animals. A <b>virtual</b> Morris <b>water</b> maze to measure human brain activation during different phases of learning was developed which mimics the task used for mice to ensure that specific learning processes observed in both species can be compared.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the striatum and hippocampus are critically involved in visuo-spatial learning processes. There is evidence that these structures contribute at different phases of learning. Comparing brain activation in a similar spatial learning task between mice and humans will provide more insight into the specific differential and time dependent contributions of striatum and hippocampus. Additionally, we will further assess if there is also overlap in the function of these brain areas. Mice were trained in the Morris water maze task for either 3 days (early learning phase group) or 4 weeks (late learning phase group). Neuronal activity at different phases of spatial learning was determined by a comparison of expression levels of the immediate early genes Arc, Homer 1 a and Zif 268 in hippocampus and striatum between different mouse groups. Data show higher activity of the hippocampus during the early learning phase compared to the late phase, as expected. Upregulation of the ventrolateral striatum was observed during the early learning phase, while activity was higher in dorsal striatum during the late learning phase. We developed a <b>virtual</b> Morris <b>water</b> maze to measure human brain activation during different phases of learning. The task was designed to ensure that specific learning processes observed in both species are comparable.

50|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>water</b> use for {{livestock}} production includes water used in producing feed. However, <b>virtual</b> <b>water</b> use data, {{such as those}} shown in the table, are often unrelated to environmental impacts of water use. For example, in a high-rainfall area, if similar soil infiltration capacity is maintained across different land uses, mm of groundwater recharge and hence sustainability of water use tends {{to be about the}} same for food crop production, meat-yielding {{livestock production}}, and saddle horse production, although <b>virtual</b> <b>water</b> use per kg of food produced may be several hundred L, several thousand L, and an infinite number of L, respectively. In contrast, in some low-rainfall areas, some livestock production is more sustainable than food crop production, from a water use standpoint, despite higher <b>virtual</b> <b>water</b> use per kg of food produced. This is because unirrigated land in many water-short areas may support grassland ecosystems in perpetuity, and thus may be able to support well-managed, extensive production of grazing cattle or sheep with a sustainable level of water use, even where large-scale production of more water-demanding food crops would be unsustainable in the long run due to inadequate surface water supplies and inadequate groundwater recharge to sustain a high level of withdrawn water use for irrigation. Such considerations are important on much rangeland in western North America and elsewhere that can support cow-calf operations, backgrounding of stocker cattle, and sheep flocks. In the US, withdrawn surface water and groundwater use for crop irrigation exceeds that for livestock by about a ratio of 60:1.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDistal reward {{refers to}} a class of {{problems}} where reward is temporally distal from actions that lead to reward. The difficulty for any biological neural system is that the neural activations that caused an agent to achieve reward {{may no longer be}} present when the reward is experienced. Therefore in addition to the usual reward assignment problem, there is the additional complexity of rewarding through time based on neural activations that may no longer be present. Although this problem has been thoroughly studied over the years using methods such as reinforcement learning, we are interested in a more biologically motivated neural architectural approach. This paper introduces one such architecture that exhibits rudimentary distal reward learning based on associations of bottom-up visual sensory sequences with bottom-up proprioceptive motor sequences while an agent explores an environment. After sufficient learning, the agent is able to locate the reward through chaining together of top-down motor command sequences.

The FAS group traveled further than controls to navigate to the hidden platform during training. During the probe trial, controls navigated more directly to the platform region and persisted in searching where the platform had been more than the FAS group. Cued-navigation was comparable in both groups, suggesting that group differences in place learning were not attributable to visual-motor or motivational deficits in the FAS subjects.
