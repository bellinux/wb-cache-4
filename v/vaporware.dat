5|$|Since its {{original}} announcement, {{release of information}} became sporadic, leading to video game journalists labeling it as <b>vaporware</b> and eventually to rumors of its cancellation. After its public rebranding in 2013, the silence continued until its appearance at the 2014 Tokyo Game Show, at which point development and progress information was released on a regular basis. A demo for the game, Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae, was released in March 2015 with first print copies of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD. Promotion for the title was effectively restarted at the 2015 Gamescom. Its release was delayed due to polishing work and the wish for a simultaneous worldwide release, something no other mainline Final Fantasy title had managed to accomplish. Cosmetic, gameplay and story-based downloadable content were developed following the game's release to fix issues raised by players and expand upon the base game.|$|E
5|$|The {{video game}} Duke Nukem Forever spent fifteen years in development, from 1996 to 2011. It is a first-person shooter for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, {{developed}} by 3D Realms, Triptych Games, Gearbox Software and Piranha Games. It is {{a sequel to}} the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D, {{as part of the}} long-running Duke Nukem video game series. Intended to be groundbreaking, Duke Nukem Forever has become infamous in the video games industry and was considered <b>vaporware</b> due to its severely protracted development schedule; the game had been in development under 3D Realms since 1996. Director George Broussard, one of the creators of the original Duke Nukem game, first announced the title's development in April 1997, and promotional information for the game was released {{in one form or another}} from 1997 until its release in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Wired News gave Spore {{the second}} place in its annual list of <b>vaporware</b> awards—that is, an award to {{projects}} that have been prolonged too much already.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vaporware</b> first implied {{intentional}} fraud when it {{was applied}} to the Ovation office suite in 1983; the suite's demonstration was well received by the press, but the product was never released.|$|E
25|$|Ever {{since the}} 1998 {{release of the}} Cyberpunk 2020 sourcebook Firestorm: Shockwave, fans of the game {{had been waiting for}} a third edition of the Cyberpunk game, known as Cyberpunk 203X. Over the years, the entire project had at times been {{discounted}} as <b>vaporware,</b> its delays due to other projects and Pondsmith's involvement in the development of The Matrix Online.|$|E
25|$|The game stars the titular {{action hero}} who must {{come out of}} {{retirement}} and save the world from aliens when they begin kidnapping the women of Earth. Intended to be groundbreaking, Duke Nukem Forever became a notable example of <b>vaporware</b> due to its severely protracted development schedule; the game was released in 2011 after fifteen years of development. Reception to Duke Nukem Forever was generally negative, with many critics singling out the game's second-rate graphics, dated humor, simplistic mechanics, and unpolished performance.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Earthworm Jim 2, its {{original}} developer, Shiny Entertainment was bought by Interplay Entertainment, and then put onto other projects. With them busy, the franchise was given to VIS Entertainment, and it was decided that, much like many platform game series at the time, like Super Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog, that gameplay would transition from 2D to 3D. Development started shortly after Earthworm Jim 2 in 1996, and had a drawn-out three year development cycle, so much so that it was at times believed it would become <b>vaporware.</b>|$|E
500|$|Blizzard {{announced}} in March 2006 {{that the game}} was put on [...] "indefinite hold" [...] while the company investigated seventh generation video game console possibilities. Subsequent public statements from company personnel had been contradictory about whether production was to be renewed or planned story elements worked into other products. The continued delay of Ghost had caused it to be labeled as <b>vaporware,</b> and it was ranked fifth in Wired News annual <b>Vaporware</b> Awards in 2005. In 2014, Blizzard president Mike Morhaime confirmed that Ghost was officially cancelled.|$|E
500|$|Wired News has awarded Duke Nukem Forever its <b>Vaporware</b> Award several times. It placed {{second in}} June 2000 and topped {{the list in}} 2001 and 2002. Wired {{magazine}} created the <b>Vaporware</b> Lifetime Achievement Award exclusively for DNF and awarded it in 2003. George Broussard accepted the award, simply stating, [...] "We're undeniably late and we know it." [...] In 2004, the game {{did not make the}} top 10; Wired editors said that they had given DNF the Lifetime Achievement Award to get it off of the list. However, upon readers' demands, Wired changed its mind, and DNF won first place in 2005, 2006, and 2007. In 2008, Wired staff officially considered removing DNF from their annual list, citing that [...] "even the best jokes get old eventually", only to reconsider upon viewing the handheld camera footage of the game in The Jace Hall Show, awarding the game with first place once again. In 2009, Wired published Wired News' <b>Vaporware</b> Awards 2009: Duke Nukem Forever was excluded from consideration {{on the grounds that the}} project was finally dead. Duke made a comeback with an unprecedented 11th place award on Wireds 2010 <b>Vaporware</b> list. When the GameSpy editors compiled a list of the [...] "Top 25 Dumbest Moments in Gaming History" [...] in June 2003, Duke Nukem Forever placed #18. Duke Nukem Forever has drawn a number of jokes related to its development timeline. The video gaming media and public in general have routinely suggested several names in place of Forever, calling it [...] "Never", [...] "(Taking) Forever", [...] "Whenever", [...] "ForNever", [...] "Neverever", and [...] "If Ever". The game has also been ridiculed as Duke Nukem: Forever In Development, [...] "Either this is the longest game ever in production or an elaborate in-joke at the expense of the industry".|$|E
500|$|Mike Morhaime, {{president}} of Blizzard, announced {{during the opening}} ceremony of Blizzcon 2009 that StarCraft II and the new Battle.net platform would both be released in 2010, with an approximately one-month gap between releases. As of March 2010, Blizzard had stated that the new platform was being tested outside the beta and was planned for release in early July 2010, for both StarCraft II and , with a later upgrade for Diablo III. On May 5, 2010, {{it was revealed that}} StarCraft II and Battle.net 2.0 would be integrated with social networking site Facebook, [...] "linking the world's premier online gaming platform with the world's most popular social platform"—a move that allowed gamers to search among their Facebook friends for StarCraft II opponents. Wired magazine, in its annual <b>Vaporware</b> Award, ranked StarCraft II first among the delayed technology products of 2009. StarCraft II was finally released on July 27, 2010, with launch parties in selected cities of countries around the world. Customers and reviewers who received the installation DVD before the July 27 release were greeted with an error screen, telling them to wait until the release date. There was no known workaround and some reviewers had praised the action for limiting journalists to playing and reviewing the game with actual players.|$|E
500|$|Slashdotters {{often use}} the {{abbreviation}} TFA {{which stands for}} The fucking article or [...] ("Read the fucking article"), which itself {{is derived from the}} abbreviation RTFM. Usage of this abbreviation often exposes comments from posters who have not read the article linked to in the main story. Slashdotters typically like to mock then United States Senator Ted Stevens' 2006 description of the Internet as a [...] "series of tubes" [...] or former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's chair-throwing incident from 2005. Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a popular target of jokes by Slashdotters, and all stories about Microsoft were once identified with a graphic of Gates looking like a Borg from [...] Many Slashdotters have long talked about the supposed release of Duke Nukem Forever, which was promised in 1997 but was delayed indefinitely (the game was eventually released in 2011). References to the game are commonly brought up in other articles about software packages that are not yet in production even though the announced delivery date has long passed (see <b>vaporware).</b> Having a low Slashdot user identifier (user ID) is highly valued since they are assigned sequentially; having one is a sign that someone has an older account and has contributed to the site longer. For Slashdot's 10-year anniversary in 2007, one of the items auctioned off in the charity auction for the Electronic Frontier Foundation was a 3-digit Slashdot user ID.|$|E
500|$|Since Ghosts {{production}} halted, Blizzard Entertainment has sporadically released {{information about}} the title. The game's protagonist, Nova, shows up in one campaign mission of , in which players are given the option to side with her or fight against her forces. She also features in [...] Metzen further stated that he believed Ghost had an excellent storyline that may be told in future novels following from DeCandido's Nova. In June 2007, Rob Pardo, one of the lead developers at Blizzard Entertainment, indicated that there still was interest in finishing Ghost. Later in an interview, Pardo stated that Blizzard had been [...] "stubborn" [...] in persevering with Ghost, but they [...] "were not able to execute [...] at the level we wanted to". Blizzard's president Mike Morhaime and Pardo gave a presentation on the company's history at the D.I.C.E. Summit in February 2008. During the presentation, they listed games canceled by Blizzard, which did not include Ghost. When questioned about this, Blizzard's co-founder Frank Pearce explained that the title was never [...] "technically canceled" [...] {{and that it was}} not in the company's focus at the time due to a finite amount of development resources. Morhaime later elaborated that it was the sudden success of World of Warcraft and the concurrent development of StarCraft II that consumed Blizzard's resources, leading to Ghost being put on hold. Despite Blizzard's announcements, many of the video games industry's journalists now list Ghost as canceled and consider it vaporware; the game was ranked fifth in the 2005 edition of Wired News annual <b>Vaporware</b> Awards.|$|E
500|$|Versus XIII was {{originally}} {{announced at the}} 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) through a CGI trailer. The trailer, which showed Noctis advancing {{on a group of}} enemy soldiers, was created by Visual Works as a representation of what the development team were aiming for. The trailer also featured a quote from William Shakespeare's Hamlet: [...] is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so." [...] This quote was intended to evoke the atmosphere Nomura was aiming for. After its initial announcement, the title was absent from multiple gaming events for several successive years, although a video showing an extended version of the reveal trailer was released in 2007 at a fan event. Two trailers were released in 2008, including in-game footage at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show (TGS). Footage of navigation was shown at TGS the following year in a closed theater. Its appearance at E3 2010 was apparently prevented due to multiple technical issues. Its final appearance as Versus XIII was at a Square Enix Press Conference in January 2011, appearing alongside other video games then in production. Because of its sporadic appearances in the public eye and its absence after the 2011 event, industry commentators labeled Final Fantasy XV as <b>vaporware</b> while it was still known as Versus XIII. In June 2012, it was rumored that the game had been cancelled, which was swiftly refuted by Square Enix's then-CEO Yoichi Wada. After that, further rumors emerged claiming that it had either been quietly cancelled, or renamed and shifted to another platform during development.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Vaporware</b> {{is often}} {{announced}} {{months or years}} before its purported release, with few details about its development being released.

Network World magazine called <b>vaporware</b> an [...] "epidemic" [...] in 1989, and blamed the press for not investigating whether developers' claims were true. Seven major companies issued a report in 1990 saying they felt <b>vaporware</b> had hurt the industry's credibility. The United States accused several companies of announcing <b>vaporware</b> early enough to violate antitrust laws, but few have been found guilty.

Car manufacturer General Motors' plans to develop and sell an electric car were called <b>vaporware</b> by an advocacy group in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Apple rapidly {{developed}} {{several new}} releases of Mac OS X. Siracusa's review of version 10.3, Panther, noted [...] "It's strange {{to have gone}} from years of uncertainty and <b>vaporware</b> to a steady annual supply of major new operating system releases." [...] Version 10.4, Tiger, reportedly shocked executives at Microsoft by offering a number of features, such as fast file searching and improved graphics processing, that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with acceptable performance.|$|E
2500|$|... "Vaporware" [...] {{was coined}} by a Microsoft {{engineer}} in 1982 {{to describe the}} company's Xenix operating system, and first appeared in print in a newsletter by entrepreneur Esther Dyson in 1983. It became popular among writers in the industry {{as a way to}} describe products they felt took too long to be released. InfoWorld magazine editor Stewart Alsop helped popularize it by lampooning Bill Gates with a Golden <b>Vaporware</b> award for the late release of his company's first version of Windows in 1985.|$|E
2500|$|A product missing its {{announced}} release date, and the {{labeling of}} it as <b>vaporware</b> by the press, {{can be caused by}} its development taking longer than planned. Most software products are not released on time, according to researchers in 2001 who studied the causes and effects of vaporware; [...] "I hate to say yes, but yes", a Microsoft product manager stated in 1984, adding that [...] "the problem isn't just at Microsoft".

[...] In 1985, Stewart Alsop began publishing his influential monthly Vaporlist, a list of companies he felt announced their products too early, hoping to dissuade them from the practice. Wired Magazine began publishing a similar list in 1997.

2500|$|<b>Vaporware</b> also {{includes}} announced {{products that are}} never released because of financial problems, or because the industry changes during its development. When 3D Realms first announced Duke Nukem Forever in 1997, the video game was early in its development. The company's previous game released in 1996, Duke Nukem 3D, was a critical and financial success, and customer anticipation for its sequel was high. As personal computer hardware speeds improved at a rapid pace in the late 1990s, it created an [...] "arms race" [...] between companies in the video game industry, according to Wired News. 3D Realms repeatedly moved the release date back over the next 12 years to add new, more advanced features. By the time 3D Realms {{went out of business}} in 2009 with the game still unreleased, Duke Nukem Forever had become synonymous with the word [...] "vaporware" [...] among industry writers. The game was revived and released in 2011. However, due to a 13-year period of anticipations and poor storyline, the game had primarily extremely negative reviews, except for PC Gamer, who gave it 80/100.|$|E

[...] Creative Computing in March 1984 wrote of Coleco's delay in releasing the Adam that the company [...] "did not invent the common practice of debuting products before they actually exist. In microcomputers, to do so otherwise would be to break with a veritable tradition." [...] After Dyson's article, however, the word became popular among writers in the personal computer software industry as a way to describe products they believed took too long to be released after their first announcement. InfoWorld magazine editor Stewart Alsop helped popularize its use by lampooning Bill Gates, then CEO of Microsoft, with a Golden <b>Vaporware</b> award for the 18-month late release of Microsoft's first version of Windows in 1985.
