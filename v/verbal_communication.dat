5|$|Between the December {{meeting and}} second {{gathering}} in March 2011, {{prior to the}} ARG's launch, there was no direct <b>verbal</b> <b>communication</b> between Valve or the developers. Instead, the independent developers spent time, using a shared wiki provided by Valve, to plan out and coordinate the game. They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others {{had to go back}} to older programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort. The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm the plans for the launch of the ARG.|$|E
5|$|Visitation, {{for those}} {{able to make}} the journey, was {{strictly}} controlled by school officials {{in a manner similar to}} the procedures enforced in the prison system. In some cases visitors were altogether denied access to their children, while in others families were required to meet in the presence of school officials and forced to communicate in English. For parents unable to speak the language, <b>verbal</b> <b>communication</b> with their children was impossible. The obstacles families faced to visit their children were further exacerbated by the pass system. Introduced by Reed without legislative authority to do so, the system restricted and closely monitored the movement of Indigenous peoples off reserves. Launched in 1885 as a response to the North-West Rebellion, and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{connection}} {{to another person}} in a professional setting usually starts off with a touch, specifically a handshake. A person's handshake can speak volumes about them and their personality. Chiarella (2006) wrote an article for Esquire magazine explaining to the predominantly male readership how handshakes differ {{from person to person}} and how they send nonverbal messages. He mentioned that holding the grip longer than two seconds will result in a stop in the verbal conversation, thus the nonverbal will override the <b>verbal</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E
25|$|Articulation is {{the process}} by which the joint product of the {{vibrator}} and the resonators is shaped into recognizable speech sounds through the muscular adjustments and movements of the speech organs. These adjustments and movements of the articulators result in <b>verbal</b> <b>communication</b> and thus form the essential difference between the human voice and other musical instruments. Singing without understandable words limits the voice to nonverbal communication. In relation to the physical process of singing, vocal instructors tend to focus more on active articulation as opposed to passive articulation. There are five basic active articulators: the lip ("labial consonants"), the flexible front of the tongue ("coronal consonants"), the middle/back of the tongue ("dorsal consonants"), the root of the tongue together with the epiglottis ("pharyngeal consonants"), and the glottis ("glottal consonants"). These articulators can act independently of each other, and two or more may work together in what is called coarticulation.|$|E

40|$|Title: <b>Verbal</b> and Nonverbal <b>Communication</b> of a Swimming Teacher Objectives: The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} the extent of didactic competences of people with pedagogical experience and of people without pedagogical experience needed to convey instructions on physical exercise in water. Methods: Research focuses on analysing <b>verbal</b> and nonverbal <b>communication</b> of a swimming teacher. In this thesis we employed methods of participant observation as well as non-participant observation and analysis of video records. Using the transcription of the records, occurrence of predefined aspects of <b>verbal</b> and nonverbal <b>communication</b> was assessed. Frequency of the occurrence of individual characteristics and their proportional representation were presented in graphs. Results: From the findings we can conclude that the pedagogical experience does influence {{the performance of the}} observed sample in tested situations, indirectly we can deduce a higher level of professional skills too. Through transcriptions and analysis of the predefined criteria it is possible to evaluate formal characteristics of <b>verbal</b> and nonverbal <b>communication</b> of the sample, which however appears to be considerably affected by the simplified research situation in comparison to a real practical situation. Key words: swimming lessons, [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Process indices {{examine how}} {{individuals}} process information in their environment, such as by analyzing communication patterns between team members or using eye tracking devices. Team communication (particularly <b>verbal</b> <b>communication)</b> supports the knowledge building and information processing {{that leads to}} SA construction (Endsley & Jones, 1997). Thus, since SA may be distributed via communication, computational linguistics and machine learning techniques can be combined with natural language analytical techniques (e.g., Latent Semantic Analysis) to create models that draw on the verbal expressions of the team to predict SA and task performance (Bolstad, Cuevas, Gonzalez, & Schneider, 2005; Bolstad, Foltz, Franzke, Cuevas, Rosenstein, & Costello, 2007). Although evidence exists to support the utility of communication analysis for predicting team SA (Foltz, Bolstad, Cuevas, Franzke, Rosenstein, & Costello, in press), time constraints and technological limitations (e.g., cost and availability of speech recording systems and speech-to-text translation software) may make this approach less practical and viable in time-pressured, fast-paced operations.|$|E
25|$|Intensive therapy can be {{alternatively}} {{characterized by}} {{the magnitude of the}} demands placed on a client within a session. Under this definition, intensive therapy includes a few specific techniques such as Constraint Induced Aphasia Therapy (CIAT) and Speech Intensive Rehabilitation Intervention (SP-I-R-IT). CIAT places high demands on the patient by restricting use of the strongest areas of the patient’s brain and requiring the weakest areas to work harder. Typical CIAT therapy sessions are intense and last for about 3 hours. One study found that when given intensive CIAT therapy, participant performance in <b>verbal</b> <b>communication</b> in everyday life significantly improved. Each participant in the study also showed improvement on at least one subtest within the Aachen Aphasia Test; which assesses language performance and comprehension in aphasia patients. These results suggest that intensive CIAT therapy is effective in patients with moderate, fluent aphasias in the chronic stage of recovery. SP-I-R-IT focuses heavily on speech production strategies and intervention. SPIRIT therapy {{has been found to be}} effective; patients participating in intensive SPIRIT therapy improved performance on standardized measures by 15% after 50 weeks of therapy.|$|E
500|$|By December 1915, New Delhi felt it {{necessary}} to put more pressure on the Afghans. Communications between the British Empire and Kabul had been hitherto through the Viceroy at Delhi. Acutely aware of the pressure on Habibullah from his pro-German relatives and the strong anti-British feeling among the tribes, Viceroy Hardinge suggested that a letter from King George might help Habibullah maintain his neutrality. Accordingly, George V personally sent a handwritten letter on Buckingham Palace stationery to Habibullah, praising the Emir for his steadfast neutrality and promising an increase to his subsidy. The letter, which addressed Habibullah as [...] "Your Majesty", was intended to encourage Habibullah and make him feel an equal partner in the Empire. It had the intended effect: Habibullah sent <b>verbal</b> <b>communication</b> through British agents in Kabul that he could not formally acknowledge the letter because of political pressure, but he nonetheless sent reassurances he would remain neutral.|$|E

500|$|Sesame Street's creators {{recognized}} that television lent itself {{well to the}} use of modelling as a teaching tool. They understood that children tended to imitate what they saw on the screen, so many writing and production methods were used to directly model effective <b>verbal</b> <b>communication.</b> Indirect modeling, without explicit labeling, was used to demonstrate positive behaviors as well. [...] One of the positive behaviors they modeled was inquisitiveness and the enjoyment of learning. [...] If humor, for example, interfered with the intended instructional message or exhibited inappropriate behavior, it was removed. As Muppet performer Fran Brill explained, the show's puppeteers demonstrated emotions by banging their puppets' heads against the wall or by having them fall backwards, but when research found that these behaviors did not demonstrate good models of appropriate behavior, these behaviors were changed. The Muppet Roosevelt Franklin, for example, was removed from the show because many leaders in the African American community felt that he displayed negative cultural stereotypes.|$|E

Following the airing of [...] "Home", Harington issued a public apology to fans of the show, stating that he would [...] "like to say sorry for lying to everyone. I'm glad that people were upset that he died. I think my biggest fear was that people were not going to care. Or it would just be, 'Fine, Jon Snow's dead.' But it seems like people had a, similar to the Red Wedding episode, kind of grief about it. Which means something I'm doing — or the show is doing — is right." [...] Harington was simply referred to as [...] "LC", for Lord Commander, in all scripts, call sheets, props or wardrobe materials, in order to maintain the secrecy involved with his eventual resurrection in the episode. It was also revealed that during production of the season, even <b>verbal</b> <b>communication</b> of the name 'Jon Snow' was disallowed, except in on-camera dialogue during actual taping of the series.|$|E
500|$|One of Blow's {{goals for}} The Witness {{was to explore}} the types of non-verbal {{communication}} {{that can be achieved}} by the medium of video games, an exploration he felt to be important to understanding them as an art form. The name The Witness is derived from core gameplay aspect of making the player perceptive of the surroundings to discover meaning and solutions to the puzzles without <b>verbal</b> <b>communication,</b> a similar approach taken by Myst (1993). Blow attributes much of The Witnesss design to Myst, a game that got him into video game development. One aspect of Myst that Blow desired to correct was the nature of [...] "pixel hunting" [...] in some of its puzzles; the player would have to click on various parts of the virtual machinery without knowing what the end result was until sometime later in the puzzle. Within The Witness, Blow created a unifying mechanic for all the puzzles to avoid this confusion, using the maze panels as this mechanic. While the interaction mechanics are the same for all these mazes, the rules and behavior described by the game's symbolic language that limit or result from the interactions form the core of the puzzles in the game. The island was divided into sections so that all the information the player needed to understand the specific behavior of puzzles in that section would be in one general location, a means to [...] " [...] down a lot of ambiguity that used to exist in adventure games". Puzzles within the game were designed to be meaningful {{within the context of the}} game, rather than to be simply a puzzle to be solved, and further aimed to be different from any other puzzle within the game.|$|E

Therefore, communication constitutes {{an important part of}} the quality of care and predominantly influences client and resident satisfaction; it is a core element of care and is a fundamentally required skill. Still, language can be expressed in different aspects although the most common process is the <b>verbal</b> and nonverbal <b>communication.</b> Hence, body language does a key factor in the process to communicate and interact which other.

2500|$|To make {{it easier}} for animals, young children, and {{individuals}} with classical (Kanner-type) autism to understand and perform theory of mind tasks, researchers have developed tests in which <b>verbal</b> <b>communication</b> is de-emphasized: [...] some whose administration does not involve <b>verbal</b> <b>communication</b> {{on the part of the}} examiner, some whose successful completion does not require <b>verbal</b> <b>communication</b> on the part of the subject, and some that meet both of the foregoing standards. [...] One category of tasks uses a preferential looking paradigm, with looking time as the dependent variable. For instance, 9-month-old infants prefer looking at behaviors performed by a human hand over those made by an inanimate hand-like object. Other paradigms look at rates of imitative behavior, the ability to replicate and complete unfinished goal-directed acts, and rates of pretend play.|$|E
50|$|In simple terms, {{interpersonal}} {{communication is}} the communication between {{one person and}} another (or others).
