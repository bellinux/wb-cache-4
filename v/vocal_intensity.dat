50|$|Four {{components}} {{to a full}} diagnosis are: medical and voice history, head and neck exam, then perceptual assessment of voice and imaging of vocal folds. The primary perceptual sign of vocal fold cysts is hoarseness of the voice. However, diagnosis is difficult; in most cases, when a diagnosis cannot first be reached via behavioural assessment and intervention, the patient undergoes an imaging procedure. Imaging is most commonly done with laryngeal videostroboscopy. This procedure provides information about vocal fold vibrations during speech, <b>vocal</b> <b>intensity</b> and vocal frequency. Imaging shows the reduced movement of the vocal folds (mucosal wave) when a vocal fold cyst is present.|$|E

40|$|The {{vocal folds}} act as {{gatekeeper}} to {{the flow of}} air {{into and out of}} the lower airway. Another function of the vocal folds is that of oscillating sound source. To date, research has shown that under high respiratory drive (HRD) conditions voice is breathy, suggesting respiratory function will be favored over voice as physiologic needs increase. The problem is for physically active voice users, acoustic goals are relatively fixed. This study used a “physiology of activity” paradigm within action theory to investigate the extent to which phonatory and respiratory functions may be affected by systemically varying vocal and metabolic goals. Thirty-two English-speaking females, ages 18 - 35 years, who were vocally untrained and recreationally active, participated in the study. Participants produced sets of seven consonant-vowel syllables, at rest, using a pre-determined pitch at a comfortable loudness and in a loud voice. Following, participants walked on a treadmill to achieve low and high workloads at established speed and grade adjustments. The same speech task was repeated, using the same <b>vocal</b> <b>intensities.</b> Order of <b>vocal</b> and exercise <b>intensities</b> were counterbalanced. In terms of phonatory function, Rlaw increased significantly more from a baseline of spontaneous voice at rest during loud voice compared to spontaneous voice, mediated by an increase in Ps. Moreover, Rlaw decreased significantly more from baseline with an increase in workload, resulting in increases in metabolic variables. The decrease in Rlaw coincided with numerical increases in airflow. Voice production, as compared to breathing, reduced Ve, interfering with gas exchange. No differences existed for metabolic variables between voice conditions. This study reflected an attempt to understand the impact of goal-oriented behavior on phonatory and respiratory functions during HRD by manipulating acoustic and metabolic goals. Consistent with prior research, voice, as opposed to breathing, resulted in airflow limitation during HRD, reducing ventilation and CO 2 clearance. Extreme respiratory perturbations lead to decreases in phonatory function to support metabolic needs. As predicted by action theory, loud voice appeared to favor phonatory function when acoustic goal was specified, at least in the short term. Conversely, spontaneous voice demonstrated deference to respiratory function when acoustic goals remained unspecified...|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{the charges}} of {{individual}} differences making very little progress in prediction compliance gaining strategies, some researchers in the 2000s have focused their efforts to rectify this weakness in the research to link individual differences with compliance gaining effectiveness. King (2001), acknowledging the paucity of robust situational and trait studies linked to compliance gaining, attempted to isolate one situation as a predictor for compliance gaining message selection. King's research suggested that when target of compliance gaining were perceived to be less resistant to influence attempts, the actors used more compliance gaining tactics. When targets were perceived as strongly resistant, the actors used less tactics. Elias and Loomis (2004) found that gender and race affect an instructor's ability to gain compliance in a college classroom. Punyanunt (2000) found that using humor may enhance the effectiveness of pro-social compliance gaining techniques in the classroom. Remland and Jones (1994) found that <b>vocal</b> <b>intensity</b> and touch also affect compliance gaining. Goei et al. (2003) posited that [...] "feelings of liking" [...] between target and actor as well as doing favors for the target lead to liking and obligation, which leads to increased compliance. Pre-giving (giving a target a small gift or favor such as a free sample of food) is positively associated with increased compliance in strangers. One of the major criticisms of examining compliance gaining literature is that very little research studies actual compliance. Filling out a survey and reporting intent {{to comply with a}} request is certainly different than actually completing the request. For example, many people might report that they will comply with a doctor's order, but away from the doctor's office, they may ignore medical advice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Reduced <b>vocal</b> <b>intensity</b> is a core {{impairment}} of hypokinetic dysarthria in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Speech treatments {{have been developed}} to rehabilitate the vocal subsystems underlying this impairment. Intensive treatment programs requiring high-intensity voice and speech exercises with clinician-guided prompting and feedback have been established as effective for improving vocal function. Less is known, however, regarding long-term outcomes of clinical benefit in speakers with PD who receive these treatments. Methods A retrospective cohort design was utilized. Data from 78 patient files across a three year period were analyzed. All patients received a structured, intensive program of voice therapy focusing on speaking intent and loudness. The dependent variable for all analyses was <b>vocal</b> <b>intensity</b> in decibels (dBSPL). <b>Vocal</b> <b>intensity</b> during sustained vowel production, reading, and novel conversational speech was compared at pre-treatment, post-treatment, six month follow-up, and twelve month follow-up periods. Results Statistically significant increases in <b>vocal</b> <b>intensity</b> were found at post-treatment, 6 months, and 12  month follow-up periods with intensity gains ranging from 5 to 17  dB depending on speaking condition and measurement period. Significant treatment effects were found in all three speaking conditions. Effect sizes for all outcome measures were large, suggesting a strong degree of practical significance. Conclusions Significant increases in <b>vocal</b> <b>intensity</b> measured at 6 and 12 moth follow-up periods suggested that the sample of patients maintained treatment benefit for up to a year. These findings are supported by outcome studies reporting treatment outcomes within a few months post-treatment, in addition to prior studies that have reported long-term outcome results. The positive treatment outcomes experienced by the PD cohort in this study are consistent with treatment responses subsequent to other treatment approaches which focus on high-intensity, clinician guided motor learning for voice and speech production in PD. Theories regarding the underlying neurophysiological response to treatment will be discussed...|$|E

This article {{presents the results of}} the author’s own study of <b>vocal</b> <b>intensity</b> level and A-weighted sound pressure level of background noise during normal lectures. The aim {{of the study was to}} define whether above-mentioned parameters depend on acoustic properties of rooms (classrooms or lecture rooms) and to define how many lectors speak with raised voice. Material and Methods: The study was performed in a group of 50 teachers and lecturers in 10 classrooms with cubature of 160 – 430 m 3 and reverberation time of 0. 37 – 1. 3 s (group A consisted of 3 rooms which fulfilled, group B consisted of 3 rooms which almost fulfilled and group C consisted of 4 rooms which did not fulfill criteria based on reverberation time (maximum permissible value is 0. 6 – 0. 8 s according to PN-B- 02151 - 4 : 2015). Criteria of raising voice were based on <b>vocal</b> <b>intensity</b> level (maximum value: 65 dB according to EN ISO 9921 : 2003). The values of above-mentioned parameters were determined from modes of A-weighted sound pressure level distributions during lectures. Results: Great differentiation of <b>vocal</b> <b>intensity</b> level between lectors was found. In classrooms of group A lectors were not using raised voice, in group B – 21 %, and in group C – 60 % of lectors were using raised voice. Conclusions: It was observed that acoustic properties of classrooms (defined by reverberation time) exert their effect on lecturer’s <b>vocal</b> <b>intensity</b> level (i. e., raising voice), which may contribute to the increased risk of vocal tract illnesses.

40|$|Working singers {{rely on a}} vocal {{mechanism}} that can meet performance demands and be so-called ‘‘performance-fit. ’’ Professional singers must be vocal athletes to meet the rigors of performance requirements. Typically, performances require extreme vocal loads in terms of measures of <b>vocal</b> function (<b>intensity,</b> frequency, and duration) and may be repeated four to eight times per week often under less than ideal conditions. Although the singer population has not been well studied, anecdotal reports {{suggest that it is}} a normal occurrence for performance-fit singers to experience positive and negative variabilities in vocal function across time and performances and significant fatigue effects after heavy vocal load. Whether these experiences are transient or whether, if sustained or cumulative, they can become symptomatic of vocal impairment and thereby threaten short- or long-term vocal health is not known. There is an obvious need to measure these vocal status shifts to determine vocal load thresholds and to establish normative data for working singers. Furthermore, prediction and management of vocal injury among singers is predicated on assumptions as to what constitutes normal. Vocal function among working professional singers had not hitherto been systematically measured using reliable and valid tools. This thesis (including three published papers) introduces EASE, a self-report tool designed to measure singers’ perceptions of the physical state of the singing voice. The psychometric properties of EASE are evaluated and differences in EASE performance according to demographic and voice-use characteristics among professional music theatre singers are explored.

40|$|Within {{the field}} of ageing studies, ageism is being {{challenged}} by querying the ‘progress-versus-decline’ binary (Gullette, 2004) so common in film and television texts and by interrogating the predominant discourse of age, which ‘pivots on the blunt binary of young and old, {{as if there were}} only two states of age’ (Woodward, 1999, p. xvii). One of the more productive perspectives suggests that we are young and old or old and young at the same time (Moglen, 2008; Segal, 2013). Whilst contemporary screen media now presents images of ageing which are more diverse and complex than earlier stereotypes and images, the oppositional binary between old and young still remains the most prevalent mode of representing generations. In this article, we focus on the contribution of Vanessa Redgrave’s distinctive vocal presence in relation to the narration of age. As the ‘grande dame who won't conform’, the distinctiveness of Redgrave’s voice incorporates elements of her controversial celebrity persona such as her profound belief in social justice and her personal experience of loss and mourning. Her own physiological ageing is also manifest in the sonic cadences of her post-menopausal voice but her status as one of Britain’s greatest and most enduring actresses works against typical notions of the disempowered older voice to command attention through her skilled delivery of <b>vocal</b> frequency, <b>intensity</b> range and quality (Prakup, 2012). As the voice-over narrator in Call the Midwife (BBC, 2012 –) Redgrave’s voice facilitates a rare example of female subjectivity emerging as young and old at the same time. Redgrave’s serene, measured voice suggests both a process of reliable narration and also identity integration along the life course. Her voice-over serves to link the past and present of one of the central characters (Jenny Lee). The younger Jenny is thus mediated by an older woman’s experiences and, at the same time, the late life narrative of the older Jenny is re-energized...|$|R
40|$|Although {{its role}} is {{frequently}} stressed in acoustic profile for <b>vocal</b> emotion, sound <b>intensity</b> is frequently {{regarded as a}} control parameter in neurocognitive studies of vocal emotion, leaving its role and neural underpinnings unclear. To investigate these issues, we asked participants to rate the angry level of neutral and angry prosodies before and after sound intensity modification in Experiment 1, and recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) for mismatching emotional prosodies with and without sound intensity modification and for matching emotional prosodies while participants performed emotional feature or sound intensity congruity judgment in Experiment 2. It was found that sound intensity modification had {{significant effect on the}} rating of angry level for angry prosodies, but not for neutral ones. Moreover, mismatching emotional prosodies, relative to matching ones, induced enhanced N 2 /P 3 complex and theta band synchronization irrespective of sound intensity modification and task demands. However, mismatching emotional prosodies with reduced sound intensity showed prolonged peak latency and decreased amplitude in N 2 /P 3 complex and smaller theta band synchronization. These findings suggest that though it cannot categorically affect emotionality conveyed in emotional prosodies, sound intensity contributes to emotional significance quantitatively, implying that sound intensity should not simply be taken as a control parameter and its unique role needs to be specified in vocal emotion studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} the type of musical {{analysis}} presented in this study {{is based on the assumption}} that the more thorough an understanding the performer has of his repertoire, of both musical and non-musical elements, the more authentic the performance will be. A knowledge of the wishes of the composer and of the historical period, added to an analysis of poetry, melodic contour, harmony, rhythm, accompaniment, and texture, provides the performer with the necessary background to form his interpretation of a song. The interpretation of "Wo die schonen Trompeten blasen" depends upon an accurate execution of the various rhythmic patterns in both the vocal line and the accompaniment. The sometimes opposing rhythms (two against three) between the voice and accompaniment should be carefully observed. Another important interpretive aspect is the portrayal of both characters in the poem (the soldier and his sweetheart). Character differentiation is primarily achieved through the singer's <b>vocal</b> color, <b>intensity,</b> and general deportment. The singer must thoroughly understand the poetry and have formed a definite personality for each character. In "Das irdische Leben" the individuality of each character in the poem is even more essential. The three characters are musically differentiated by the three individual patterns of vocal melody and rhythm. These three types of vocal melodies help determine the vocal color for each character. The chromatic and ever-moving accompaniment helps build the tension of this macabre tale, but the most outstanding feature of this song must be the vocal color and characterization supplied by the singer. The light, yet ironic, humor is the most important element of "Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt. " The tonal painting of the accompaniment creates the proper atmosphere for this fish tale. To project the poetry's humorous descriptions of the various fishes, the singer must pay special attention to vocal inflection and syllabic stress of the text. Careful attention should be given to the rise and fall of dynamics, which help depict an image of water movement. These three early songs of Mahler were chosen to provide the listener with a variety of mood, style, key, and musical harmony and rhythm. If the performers (both singer and accompanist) study the various musical and non-musical characteristics of the songs, the result should be a more authentic and meaningful presentation...|$|R
