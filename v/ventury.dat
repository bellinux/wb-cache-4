So it needs wind turbine that can be accommodate it, in particular during low wind velocity. Wind turbine that made and researched is prototype of <b>ventury</b> wind turbine. It is very suitable {{to be used for}} low wind velocity with high rotation velocity. In addition, it also minimum of buzzing thas 2 ̆ 7 s producted by wind turbine. This study has discussed about influence of twist angle variation of blade 300 and 450, blade quantity (3 blades, 4 blades, 5 blades and 6 blades) with wind velocity (2 m/s, 3 m/s, 4 m/s, 5 m/s) to shaft rotation of wind turbine prototype and tip speed ratio (TSR). The results showed that, in 3 m/s – 4 m/s wind velocity highest rotation of wind turbine shaft is compared with another variation has done, it found in wind turbine with 3 blades and 300 twist angle, they are 190 rpm and 311 rpm. In 5 m/s wind velocity, shaft rotation velocity of prototype of wind turbine 3 blades and 450 twist angle is the highest, 385 rpm. Meanwhile, in 2 m/s wind velocity, <b>ventury</b> wind turbine prototype with 6 blades and 450 twist angle has rotation velocity on highest shaft, it is 52 rpm...|$|E

However, upstream pressure less than the actual design pressure of the cavitating venturi could not supply a constant flow rate...|$|R
40|$|In a {{propulsion}} system, the propellant {{flow and}} mixture ratio {{could be controlled}} either by variable area flow control valves or by passive flow control elements such as cavitating <b>venturies.</b> Cavitating <b>venturies</b> maintain constant propellant flowrate for fixed inlet conditions (pressure and temperature) and wide range of outlet pressures, thereby maintain constant, engine thrust and mixture ratio. The flowrate through the venturi reaches a constant value and becomes independent of outlet pressure when the pressure at throat becomes equal to vapor pressure. In order to develop a numerical model of propulsion system, {{it is necessary to}} model cavitating <b>venturies</b> in propellant feed systems. This paper presents a finite volume model of flow network of a cavitating venturi. The venturi was discretized into a number of control volumes and mass, momentum and energy conservation equations in each control volume are simultaneously solved to calculate one-dimensional pressure, density, and flowrate and temperature distribution. The numerical model predicts cavitations at the throat when outlet pressure was gradually reduced. Once cavitation starts, with further reduction of downstream pressure, no change in flowrate is found. The numerical predictions have been compared with test data and empirical equation based on Bernoulli's equation...|$|R

40|$|Hypertrophie obstructive {{cardiomyopathy}} (HOCM) is an {{idiopathic disease}} frequently associated with systolic anterior motion (SAM). The anterior leaflet of mitral valve is sucked by <b>Ventury</b> effect {{into the left}} ventricle outflow tract making subaortic stenosis more severe and producing mitral insufficiency at the same time. Septal myectomy along with mitral valve replacement has been the treatment of choice for a long time. An understanding of pathoanatomy and hemodynamics of the disease has opened possibility for total reconstructive treatment of both subaortic stenosis and mitral insufficiency in such patients. This is a case report of 50 -year-old male with severe subaortic stenosis (136 / 70 mmHg) due to HOCM and SAM along with grade IV mitral insufficiency. Septal myectomy was performed. Mitral insufficiency was managed by reducing the height of posterior cusp along with remodeling of mitral annulus by Carpentier-Classic ring. In that way, subaortic obstruction was reduced to 30. 9 / 10 mmHg while mitral insufficiency was lowered to negligible level.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{conceptual}} model of saline intrusion within coastal karst aquifers by analyzing Rainfall–Discharge–Salinity data and to assess freshwater resources using a lumped modeling approach. In a first step, we analyzed 4 years of data (rainfall, discharge and salinity times series) ofthe Port-Miou brackish submarine spring in South France (400 km 2). A conceptual model of the aquifer was then designed to differentiate a deep brackish reservoir and a shallower fresh one. Salinity variations at the spring are assumed to be controlled mainly by dilution originating from the fresh water in the shallower reservoir. In a second step, a lumped modeling approach was developed based on the conceptual model to simulate discharge as well as salinity over time. We proposed a reservoir-model to take into account slow and fast components in the shallower part of the aquifer and a saline intrusion in the deeper one. This Rainfall–Discharge–Salinity model was calibrated and validated for two periods of 1. 5 years at a daily time step and was also tested to reproduce a multi-annual evolution of the available discharge and salinity time series. Good simulation results were obtained to reproduce water and mass budgets as well as discharge and salinity dynamics during several hydrological cycles. The simultaneous modeling of hydrodynamics and quality data showed the robustness of the model in addition to its easy implementation. Our results led us to propose a new type of seawater mixing mechanism for brackish springs: the dilution type, in addition to the well-known <b>Ventury</b> suction and Head balance types. The application of the lumped model on the Port-Miou brackish spring validated the hydrogeological processes deduced from experimental data, given an initial quantification of the freshwater resources available in such complex brackish karstic aquifers...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) during {{an episode of}} acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure due to infection present a special problem with regard to the relief of hypoxia. In a prospective, randomized, multicenter controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of oxygen delivery by Ventimask compared with Venturi mask in patients affected by exacerbation of COPD and mild acidosis before starting with non-invasive bilevel-positive airway pressure (PAP). The study involved 80 patients with exacerbation of COPD divided in two groups: Group A= 40 patients randomized to Ventimask plus standard therapy and Group B= 40 patients randomised to <b>Ventury</b> mask plus standard therapy. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy of oxygen therapy with Ventimask compared with Venturi mask in terms of avoiding the need for non-invasive bilevel-PAP during the 1 st h and reducing PaCO 2 retention. Twenty-five patients (62 %) started with bilevel-PAP in Group A and 28 (70 %) in Group B (not significant). There were no significant changes in arterial blood gases values between the two groups. In Group A, pH and PaCO 2 were 7. 32 ± 0. 11 and 68. 5 ± 13. 6 mmHg at admission, and 7. 33 ± 0. 05 and 64. 8 ± 4. 9 mmHg after 1 h (not significant).

50|$|Between the Australian Grand Prix {{meeting at}} Calder in late 1983 {{and the start}} of the 1984 Australian Sports Car Championship, Wayne Eckersley rebuilt the inner {{workings}} of the car, redesigning both the sidepods resulting in improved ground effect aerodynamics. He also rebuilt the suspension of the car (it was found that the Tyrrell suspension designed for a Formula One car was actually inadequate for a car that was over 200 kg heavier and produced similar loading from the ground effect aerodynamics which lead to the numerous failures through testing in 1982 and racing in 1983). During this time, the Cosworth DFV's original builder Ross Calgher of Nicholson Mclaren rebuilt the engine in late 1983 at the team's base in Slacks Creek south of Brisbane.
