25|$|Nunes, {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the greatest mathematicians of his time, is best known for his contributions in the nautical sciences (navigation and cartography), which he approached, for the first time, in a mathematical way. He was the first to propose the idea of a loxodrome, and was the inventor of several measuring devices, including the nonius (from which <b>Vernier</b> <b>scale</b> was derived), named after his Latin surname.|$|E
25|$|An {{adjustable}} wood bit, {{also known}} as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with a set screw to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to drill {{a wide variety of}} holes, and can take the place of a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A ruler or <b>vernier</b> <b>scale</b> is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size.|$|E
2500|$|The nonius {{was used}} by Tycho Brahe, who {{considered}} it too complex. The method inspired improved systems by Christopher Clavius and Jacob Curtius. [...] These were eventually improved further by Pierre Vernier in 1631, which reduced the nonius to the <b>Vernier</b> <b>scale</b> that includes two scales, one of them fixed and the other movable. Vernier himself {{used to say that}} his invention was a perfected nonius {{and for a long time}} it was known as the “nonius”, even in France. In some languages, the <b>Vernier</b> <b>scale</b> is still named after Nunes, for example [...] in Swedish.|$|E

40|$|Dragging {{is one of}} {{the most}} useful and popular {{techniques}} in direct manipulation graphical user interfaces. However, dragging has inherent restrictions caused by pixel resolution of a display. Although in some situations the restriction could be negligible, certain kinds of applications, e. g., real world applications where the range of adjustable parameters vastly exceed the screen resolution, require sub-pixel-pitch dragging. We propose a sub-pixel-pitch dragging tool, popup vernier, plus a methodology to transfer smoothly into `vernier mode' during dragging. A popup vernier consists of locally zoomed grids and <b>vernier</b> <b>scales</b> displayed around them. Verniers provide intuitive manipulation and feedback of fine grain dragging, in that pixel-pitch movements of the grids represent sub-pixel-pitch movements of a dragged object, and the <b>vernier</b> <b>scales</b> show the object's position at a sub-pixel accuracy. The e#ectiveness of our technique is verified with a proposed evaluation measure that captures the smoothness of transition from standard mode to vernier mode, based on the Fitts' law.

50|$|Zero {{error is}} defined as such a {{condition}} when a measuring instrument registers a reading when {{there should not be}} any reading. In case of vernier calipers it occurs when a zero on main scale does not coincide with a zero on <b>vernier</b> <b>scale.</b> Rather the zero error may be of two types i.e. when the scale is towards numbers greater than zero it is positive else negative.The method to use a <b>vernier</b> <b>scale</b> or caliper with zero error is to use the formula: actual reading = main scale + <b>vernier</b> <b>scale</b> − (zero error).Zero error may arise due to knocks that cause the calibration at the 0.00 mm when the jaws are perfectly closed or just touching each other.|$|E

50|$|Also {{called a}} {{stereotactic}} device, the system uses {{a set of}} three coordinates (x, y, and z) in an orthogonal frame of reference (cartesian coordinates). In a brain atlas, composed by serial transverse sections of the animal or human brain, each brain structure can be assigned a number of coordinates. In most atlas, the three dimensions are: latero-lateral (x), dorso-ventral (y) and rostro-caudal (z). The mechanical device has head-holding clamps and bars which puts {{the head of the}} animal in a fixed position in reference to the coordinate system (the so-called zero or origin). Guide bars in the x, y, and z directions, fitted with high precision <b>vernier</b> <b>scales</b> allow the experimenter to position the point of a probe (an electrode, a cannula, etc.) inside the brain, at the calculated coordinates for the desired structure, through a small trephined hole in the skull.

5000|$|Cavendish's {{equipment}} was remarkably sensitive for its time. The force involved in twisting the torsion balance was very small, , about [...] {{of the weight}} of the small balls. To prevent air currents and temperature changes from interfering with the measurements, Cavendish placed the entire apparatus in a wooden box about 2 ft thick, 10 ft tall, and 10 ft wide, all in a closed shed on his estate. Through two holes in the walls of the shed, Cavendish used telescopes to observe the movement of the torsion balance's horizontal rod. The motion of the rod was only about 0.16 in. Cavendish was able to measure this small deflection to an accuracy of better than one hundredth of an inch using <b>vernier</b> <b>scales</b> on the ends of the rod.Cavendish's accuracy was not exceeded until C. V. Boys' experiment in 1895. In time, Michell's torsion balance became the dominant technique for measuring the gravitational constant (G) and most contemporary measurements still use variations of it. This is why Cavendish's experiment became the Cavendish experiment.|$|R

5000|$|Rifles {{from the}} late 19th century often {{featured}} one of two types of aperture sight called a tang sight or a ladder sight. Since the black powder used in muzzleloaders and early cartridges was not capable of propelling a bullet at high velocity, these sights had very large ranges of vertical adjustments, often {{on the order of}} several degrees, allowing very long shots to be made accurately. The [...]45-70 cartridge, for example, was tested by the military for accuracy at ranges of up to 1500 yards, which required 3 degrees of elevation. Both ladder and tang sights folded down when not in use to reduce the chance of damage to the sights. Ladder sights were mounted on the barrel, and could be used as sights in both the folded and unfolded states. Tang sights were mounted behind the action of the rifle, and provided a very long sight radius, and had to be unfolded for use, though rifles with tang sights often had open sights as well for close range use. Tang sights often had <b>vernier</b> <b>scales,</b> allowing adjustment down to a single minute of arc over the full range of the sight.|$|R

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} a fluidic technique for the self-assembly of microfabricated silicon parts onto silicon and quartz substrates using patterned shapes of hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Shape recognition {{is achieved by}} the minimization of interfacial free energy, and binding {{is due to the}} large adhesion energy between hydrophobic surfaces in water. Test parts were fabricated using deep reactive ion etching of silicon-on-insulator wafers with 15 m silicon thickness. In order to pattern the block and substrate surfaces with hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, gold films were evaporated onto the surfaces and patterned into the desired shapes. Then, the surfaces were exposed to an octadecanethiol SAM solution which forms a hydrophobic monolayer on gold but leaves the silicon (or quartz) areas water-wetting. Using a thin layer of lubricant on the binding sites, we have observed spontaneous alignment of test blocks to patterned hydrophobic regions on a substrate under water. Part-substrate shape matching has been demonstrated for square, rectangular, and complementary spiral shapes. Sub-micron alignment precision was achieved, as measured by comparing <b>vernier</b> <b>scales</b> located on the test blocks and substrate. Bonding to the quartz substrate was accomplished by using a UV-polymerizable liquid as the lubricant layer. The general approach described here may be applied easily to a variety of part and substrate material combinations, and thus can enable the assembly of complex hybrid systems...|$|R
