A <b>variable</b> <b>diagonal</b> loading term is added at each step, where the amount of loading has a closed-form solution.

40|$|Documenting {{spread and}} {{combination}} trading {{in a major}} options market for the first time, we find that spreads and combinations collectively account for over 55 % of large trades (trades of 100 contracts or more) in the Eurodollar options market and almost 75 % of the trading volume due to large trades. In terms of total volume, the four most heavily traded combinations are (in order) : straddles, ratio spreads, vertical spreads, and strangles. These four represent about two thirds of all combination trades.

40|$|Complex {{regional}} pain syndrome (CRPS) generally remains {{restricted to}} one limb but occasionally may {{spread to other}} limbs. Knowledge of the spreading pattern of CRPS may lead to hypotheses about underlying mechanisms but to date {{little is known about}} this process. The objective is to study patterns of spread of CRPS from a first to a second limb and the factors associated with this process. One hundred and eighty-five CRPS patients were retrospectively evaluated. Coxâ€™s proportional hazards model was used to evaluate factors that influenced spread of CRPS symptoms. Eighty-nine patients exhibited CRPS in multiple limbs. In 72 patients spread from a first to a second limb occurred showing a contralateral pattern in 49 %, ipsilateral pattern in 30 % and diagonal pattern in 14 %. A trauma preceded the onset in the second limb in 37, 44 and 91 %, respectively. The hazard of spread of CRPS increased with the number of limbs affected. Compared to patients with CRPS in one limb, patients with CRPS in multiple limbs were on average 7 Â years younger and more often had movement disorders. In patients with CRPS in multiple limbs, spontaneous spread of symptoms generally follows a contralateral or ipsilateral pattern whereas <b>diagonal</b> <b>spread</b> is rare and generally preceded by a new trauma.

Behavior of physical quantities at asymptotically late times can be understood in terms of the overlap probability of the system <b>variable</b> with the <b>diagonal</b> <b>variable</b> of the entire system. 1 How a small system behaves under influence of a larger environment has been investigated in a variety of approaches. The simplest, yet the most fundamental model of quantum dissipation is harmonic oscillator coupled to infinitely many oscillators that make up a bath in a mixed state. Two powerful methods to analyze this problem are the quantum Langevin equation [1], and the path integral approach [1]. In our previous work [2] we used the path integral method for the linear open system, and derived the reduced density matrix of the system, by integrating out environment variables. In the present work we employ a direct operator approach. Our new approach has an advantage, giving explicit operator solution and thereby extends previous results [2] to arbitrary initial states including correlation between the system and the environment, and to non-thermal environments.

40|$|We {{consider}} the discrete system resulting from mixed finite element approximation of a second-order elliptic {{boundary value problem}} with Crouzeix-Raviart nonconforming elements for the vector valued unknown function and piece-wise constants for the scalar valued unknown function. Since the mass matrix corresponding to the vector valued <b>variables</b> is <b>diagonal,</b> these unknowns can be eliminated exactly. Thus, the problem of designing an efficient algorithm for {{the solution of the}} resulting algebraic system is reduced to one of constructing an efficient algorithm for a system whose matrix is a graph-Laplacian (or weighted graph-Laplacian). We propose a preconditioner based on an algebraic multilevel iterations (AMLI) algorithm. The hierarchical two-level transformations and the corresponding 2 2 block splittings of the graph-Laplacian needed in an AMLI algorithm are introduced locally on macroelements. Each macroelement is associated with an edge of a coarser triangulation. To define the action of the preconditioner we employ polynomial approximations of the inverses of the pivot blocks in the 2 2 splittings. Such approximations are obtained via the best polynomial approximation of 1 in norm on a finite interval. Our construction provides sufficient accuracy and moreover, guarantees that each pivot block is approximated by a positive definite matrix polynomial. One possible application of the constructed efficient preconditioner is in the numerical solution of unsteady Navier-Stokes equations by a projection method. It {{can also be used to}} design efficient solvers for problems corresponding to other mixed finite element discretizations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} diagonal tension (shear) testing to determine factors affecting shear strength of Interlocking Compressed Earth Block (ICEB) panels. This work expands on the current information available about strength properties of ICEB assemblies, which are dry-stacked, as opposed to having mortared beds. Variables such as block strength, grout strength and grouting pattern can influence {{the results of these}} types of tests and are examined in this investigation. To study <b>variables</b> affecting <b>diagonal</b> shear strength, 9 panels were tested, consisting of blocks produced by a manual block press. Strength testing was adopted from common ASTM standards to determine constituent material properties. A modified version of ASTM E 519 test procedure is used to perform diagonal tension testing. Imaging analysis, using a high resolution camera, was run simultaneously during testing to capture displacement histories of select panels. It was determined that both block and grout strength significantly affect the shear strength of ICEB panels. Additionally, vertical grouting and block type also have a strong influence. Imaging analysis results confirm that the dominant failure mode in ICEB panels is bed joint sliding both pre and post peak load, with noticeable displacements at head joint locations on a few panels. Lastly, diagonal cracking along the block face was noticeable on several panels following peak load. Further testing remains to determine other factors affecting shear strength, namely, the application of normal pre-compression loads to the panel...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} shear design {{method is}} proposed for reinforced and prestressed concrete beams, based on {{analysis of the}} influencing factors and correlation with test results. The proposed method takes into account significant parameters influencing concrete contribution to shear capacity. Shear reinforcement contribution to shear capacity includes consideration of <b>variable</b> <b>diagonal</b> cracking angle. A non-iterative procedure and a simple formula for diagonal cracking angle, including effect of axial force, are proposed. The beneficial aspects of LRFD longitudinal reinforcement anchorage requirement and the maximum shear limit in LRFD are retained in this proposed method. Design examples are given. The example shows how Av/s is calculated and demonstrates to difference in results of the proposed method {{with those of the}} AASHTO LRFD, AASHTO Standard, and ACI- 318. ^ In a recently concluded investigation on shear limits in precast prestressed concrete girders for Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR), it was determined that the AASHTO LRFD limit of 0. 25 fâ€²cbdv for maximum shear reinforcement is attainable as long as an adequate number of strands is anchored into the abutment diaphragms. In addition, extending strands in prestressed concrete girders beyond member ends and bending them into cast-in-place pier diaphragms can be a cost-effective method of controlling creep and shrinkage effects in bridges designed as simple spans for girder and deck weights and continuous spans for additional loads. In this paper, pullout capacity of 0. 5 in. and 0. 6 in. (12. 7 and 15. 2 mm) diameter strands is evaluated. Two numerical design examples are included together with design recommendations for determining the required number and length of strands that need to be bent and embedded into the diaphragms. ^ The current AASHTO LRFD and Standard Specifications require that 4 percent of the total prestressing force be used for the design of end zone reinforcement in pretensioned concrete girders. In addition, AASHTO LRFD requires that the end zone reinforcement be placed within a distance from the end equal to one-fifth of the girder depth, while AASHTO Standard requires that the same amount of steel be placed within one-fourth of the girder depth. This requirement creates excessive reinforcement congestion in the end zone. In this study, a literature review was conducted to document the development of end zone reinforcement specifications. Analytical methods using strut-and-tie and equilibrium analysis models for end zone reinforcement design are discussed. Further, strains and stresses in the end zone reinforcement of various girders designed based on the current specifications were determined experimentally at prestress transfer. The results showed that the stress level in the end zone reinforcement was less than the stress recommended by the specifications. The locations of maximum moment predicted by the analytical model developed by Gergely and Sozen were found consistent with the crack locations observed. As a result of the analytical and experimental investigations, new end zone reinforcement details were developed. The new details installed in inverted tees and NU I-girders have been tested experimentally. The results showed the new details would reduce the amount of current reinforcement by 40 percent and it is effective in controlling crack propagation in the end zone, and eliminating the end zone congestion. ...|$|R
