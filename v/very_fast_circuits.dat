40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{procedure}} {{is shown to}} modify a finite state machine {{in such a way}} that an OneShot -Coding of their states is possible. The characteristic of One-Shot-Codes for finite state machines result in some properties of the realized sequential networks. The main advantage is less power dissipation, better electromagnetic compatibility and <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> <b>circuits</b> because only one bit changes between all successive states. 1 Introduction In the past tense (mostly in the 60 th) a lot of researchers, for instance Unger[4], had investigated many kinds of Finite State Machine (FSM) state codes. State encoding is a necessary part in the design of digital sequential circuits because all signals must be mapped to two possible electrical states: high voltage state or low voltage state. Hence, every state of a FSM has to be assigned at least to one binary tuple. This binary tuple represent points in a Boolean hypercube. The characteristic of One-Shot Codes (see also [4]) is that neighbour s [...] ...|$|E

2500|$|At Hockenheim in Germany (another <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> <b>circuit)</b> however, Senna's {{bad luck}} ended after scoring a treble – pole, fastest lap and the win, {{but he had}} to fight almost all the way with Prost to do so. After both McLarens {{suffered}} bad mid-race stops for tyres, Prost emerged in the lead and looked to have the race in his grasp but lost top gear with less than two laps to go. Berger's pointless season continued with a tire puncture causing a spectacular accident and robbing him of a possible podium. Mansell picked up a third place and mused everyone's thoughts: [...] "If any of the circuits in the world is ideal for McLaren-Honda, it's Hockenheim." [...] Patrese, Piquet and Warwick took the remaining three points-paying positions, respectively.|$|R
25|$|The British Grand Prix at the <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> Silverstone <b>circuit</b> proved {{much the}} same – McLaren front row, Senna retiring, and Prost winning. Mansell {{finished}} second in his home race to please the British fans, whose Mansellmania coupled with the tifosi made for hysteria. Nannini finished third, Piquet 4th, while both Minardis, Martini followed by Pérez-Sala, took the final 2 points positions.|$|R
50|$|The old Spa circuit was {{essentially}} a speed course with drivers managing higher average speeds than on other race tracks. Back then, the Belgians took pride in having a <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> <b>circuit,</b> and to improve average speeds, in 1939 the former slow uphill U-turn {{at the bottom of}} the Eau Rouge creek valley, called the Ancienne Douane (until 1920, there was a German Empire customs office here), was cut short with a faster sweep straight up the hill, called the Raidillon. Until 2000, it was possible to travel over the race track when it was still a public road. At Eau Rouge, southbound traffic was allowed to use the famous uphill corner, while the opposite downhill traffic had to use the old road and U-turn behind the grand stands, rejoining the race track at the bottom of Eau Rouge.|$|R

For the first time, spatial and temporal stochastic and deterministic reliability effects are handled toghether in an efficient framework. The paper first introduces an equivalent transistor SPICE model, comprising the currently most important aging effects (i. e NBTI, hot carriers and soft breakdown). A simulation framework then uses this SPICE model to minimize the number of circuit factors and to build a circuit model.

50|$|The 1927 race at Montlhéry was won by Frenchman Robert Benoist in a Delage. 1929 saw a brief {{return to}} Le Mans, which was won by William Grover-Williams in a Bugatti; {{this was the}} man who had won the first ever Monaco Grand Prix earlier in the year. The 1930 French Grand Prix at Pau was one of the more memorable French Grand Prixs of the pre-World War II period. This race, held in September on a one-off {{triangular}} 9.8-mile (15.8 km) public road circuit just a few kilometres away from the current Pau Grand Prix track saw a famous Blower Bentley compete in the race with Briton Tim Birkin driving. The Bentleys had been dominating the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but this blower Bentley had its headlights and mudguards removed, as these were not needed for this race; giving it the appearance of an open-wheel car. The Bentley performed well- at this <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> <b>circuit</b> which actually suited the powerful Bentley, Birkin would pass the pits at 130 mph (<b>very</b> <b>fast</b> for that time), and overtook car after car- to the amazement of the crowd.

50|$|F1 {{returned}} to Europe {{to start the}} 2nd European tour - made up almost entirely of <b>fast</b> <b>circuits.</b> The French Grand Prix at the <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> <b>Circuit</b> Paul Ricard with its long 1.1 mile Mistral Straight came after the North American tour - where pole-sitter Keke Rosberg averaged more than 140 mph in qualifying, ahead of Senna, Alboreto, Prost and Nelson Piquet. The weather was hot, and after making an excellent start, double world champion Piquet {{made the most of}} his BMW engine's superior power (this engine was the most powerful in F1 at the time) and Pirelli tires that for once, seemed to work properly. After making an excellent start that propelled him to 3rd, Piquet passed Senna on the Mistral Straight, and then he passed the leader Rosberg on Lap 10. Senna went into the pits and fell down the order; while driving hard to make up places he crashed massively at the <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> Signes corner after the Mistral Straight after the Renault engine in his Lotus failed and dropped oil on the rear tires, causing him to spin off while turning into the right hand corner. Rosberg had wrecked his tires early on, and was harried by Prost and his teammate, defending champion Niki Lauda. After a long battle where Rosberg held up the two McLarens and allowed Piquet to get away, Lauda went out with gearbox failure (the Austrian so far had only finished once this season), Prost eventually took Rosberg, who went into the pits to have his tires changed. Rosberg stormed after Prost, who was putting considerable pressure on Piquet. The Finn eventually passed the French Prost for 2nd, behind Piquet.|$|R

50|$|The <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> Hockenheim <b>circuit</b> in West Germany- {{the longest}} circuit {{of the year}} once again played host to the {{historic}} German Grand Prix. Surprisingly at this power circuit, Prost qualified his McLaren on pole position showing {{the benefits of a}} good car set up, and took the race victory ahead of Lauda and Warwick. Piquet retired yet again- this time with gearbox problems. The first part of the race saw a stirring drive from Senna- he was as high as 6th in his uncompetitive Toleman- but then his car's rear wing failed and he spun off near the Ostkurve chicane.|$|R
50|$|The French Grand Prix, usually run in late June/early July was run in May at the <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> Dijon-Prenois <b>circuit.</b> Patrick Tambay took pole in his Renault; he {{finished}} 2nd to Niki Lauda in a McLaren that {{was superior to}} all other cars at this short circuit that {{was made up of}} long, fast corners. This would be the last time the French Grand Prix was held at the Dijon circuit; the cars were lapping in the 1 minute 2 second range during qualifying. The FIA stipulated that any lap during a Formula One event that was under a minute did not count as a completed lap.|$|R
5000|$|The next {{race was}} the German Grand Prix at the <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> Hockenheim <b>circuit</b> near Stuttgart, and Tambay secured Ferrari's fourth {{consecutive}} pole position. He lost {{the lead to}} Arnoux early on however, and later suffered an engine failure to promote Piquet to second. The Brazilian inherited the lead briefly during Arnoux's pit stop, but the Frenchman could not be stopped and recorded his second victory of the year. A fire three laps from home prevented Piquet from picking up second, which instead went to Andrea de Cesaris, collecting some points for Alfa Romeo. Patrese was third, scoring his first points of the year ahead of Prost, Lauda and Watson.|$|R
25|$|The {{second half}} of the year started at the <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> forested Hockenheim <b>circuit</b> in Germany and Mansell {{continued}} where he left off, taking pole ahead of Senna, Berger, Patrese, Prost and Alesi.

At {{the end of the first}} lap, Mansell led from Berger, Senna, Prost, Alesi and Patrese.|$|R
50|$|Norton's {{first use}} of the name 'Manx' {{was applied to the}} 'Manx Grand Prix' model {{available}} from 1936-1940, a special racing version of their 'International' roadster, with telescopic forks and a plunger rear suspension, magnesium for the crankcases and cambox, and no provision for lighting. Just after WW2, the 'Grand Prix' was dropped, and Norton named their 1947 racing model the 'Manx'. It was a lightly redesigned prewar racing Norton International, an overhead cam single-cylinder machine available as a 350cc or 500cc. The Norton factory race bikes under team manager Joe Craig were experimental models, and a version was available to buy from the factory in Bracebridge Street - to selected customers. Fitted with the McCandless brothers Featherbed frame for 1950, the Manx gained a new lease of racing life as a racing machine, the new frame giving the fine steering necessary for high speed navigation of some <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> racing <b>circuits</b> of the time.|$|R
50|$|At Reims-Gueux, Alfa Romeo {{were largely}} unchallenged at the French Grand Prix at the <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> Reims-Gueux <b>circuit,</b> {{due to the}} {{withdrawal}} of the works Ferraris of Ascari and Villoresi. The Alfas produced yet another lockout of the front row of the grid, with Fangio taking pole {{for the third time in}} six races. The power of the Alfas suited this public road circuit- made up entirely of long straights, and Farina, starting from second, led for the first quarter of the race before fuel problems put him to the back of the field. He fought his way back to third before he was forced to retire (he was ultimately classified seventh). Fangio picked up the fastest lap on his way to his second consecutive victory. Fagioli finished second for the fourth time out of five starts, while Peter Whitehead, in a privateer Ferrari, took a maiden podium in his first start of the season. Fangio took the championship lead as a result of his victory. Fagioli remained in second, while Farina dropped to third, four points behind his Argentinian teammate.|$|R
40|$|It may be {{predicted}} now, even assuming very conservative approach, {{that the next}} generation of the Low Level RF control systems for future accelerators will use extensively such technologies like: <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> programmable <b>circuits</b> equipped with DSP, embedded PC and optical communication I/O functionalities, as well as multi-gigabit optical transmission of measurement data and control signals.

The design bases on a relatively simple and cheap FPGA chip Cyclone. Commercially available SERDES (serializer/deserializer) and optical transceiver chips were applied. The optoelectronic module is embedded on the main LLRF BMB (backbone mother board). The MB provides communication with the outside computer control system, programmable chip configuration, integration with other functional modules and power supply.

50|$|One of {{the works}} Ferrari 512S Spyders, entered and {{to be driven by}} Jacky Ickx and Peter Schetty crashed in practice; neither driver took part in the race. This just about proved to be fatal for Ferrari, because Ickx was {{considered}} to be the best Nürburgring driver in the world at that time, next to Formula One world champion Jackie Stewart. Even with the experienced John Surtees who knew the long circuit well and had lots of success at the challenging mountain circuit in the past, things did not look good for Ferrari- as most {{of the works}} Porsche drivers- including Jo Siffert, Brian Redman, Hans Herrmann and Vic Elford were all known to be Nürburgring specialists and were <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> around the <b>circuit.</b>|$|R
50|$|With the Swedish GP {{cancelled}} {{due to a}} lack of funding, {{there was}} a 5-week gap between the Monaco and French GP's. The French Grand Prix would kick off a tour of Grands Prix held at fast circuits; and this Grand Prix, held at the <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> Dijon-Prenois <b>circuit</b> in eastern France saw the home fans get an all-French front row, but instead of the usual Ligiers, it was the two turbocharged Renaults who were in dominant form, Jean-Pierre Jabouille on pole ahead of René Arnoux and Villeneuve. At the start, Villeneuve beat Jabouille into the first corner, with Scheckter third after Arnoux had a bad start. As the front two began to drive away from the field, Arnoux began a charge up the order, and by mid-race he was back in third. In the second half of the race, the two Renaults found another gear, and Jabouille drove past Villeneuve to take the lead, and Arnoux began to close him down and caught him with four laps left. Jabouille won much to the happiness of the fans, and they received much more entertainment behind as Villeneuve and Arnoux battled for second for four laps, banging wheels repeatedly, and ultimately it was Villeneuve who prevailed.|$|R
2500|$|... 1985 {{was to see}} Keke Rosberg set {{the all-time}} Formula 1 {{qualifying}} lap record for 17 years after posting fastest qualifying time for the race with an average speed of 258.983km/h (160.92mph). Silverstone, which was already a <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> <b>circuit,</b> was becoming <b>faster</b> and faster and the cars were lapping the circuit in the low 1-minute range. The race was an exciting one with Brazilian rising star Ayrton Senna making a great start from 4th and taking the lead by the first corner. He led {{until late in the}} race, when his car was running out of fuel while Prost was pushing him hard; Senna eventually ran out of fuel and Prost went on to take victory. 1986 saw a huge crowd thanks to Mansell being a favourite to win; his newly found fame and place in a competitive team would help the British Grand Prix to see huge crowds for several years. This race saw 42-year-old Jacques Laffite get involved in a first corner accident and slam head-on into the barriers, breaking both his legs and ending his Formula One career. Nigel Mansell, whose car broke {{at the start of the}} first race, got into his teammate Piquet's spare car and won the race; although this was the last F1 race at Brands Hatch. A number of people had concerns about the speeds of the cars on the small track; particularly the European Grand Prix held at Brands Hatch the previous year. The southern English circuit was getting to be very fast- now with these 1,000+ hp, 1,180 pound cars, pole sitter Piquet's average qualifying speed was 140.483mph (227.583km/h) and his lap time was in the 1 minute 6-second range, compared to the 1 minute 20-second range in 1976. But Brands Hatch's demise was for political reasons- the international motorsports governing body at the time, FISA, had instituted a policy of long-term contracts for one circuit per Grand Prix. Brands Hatch was perceived as a poorer facility, and considering most of the track was located in a very old forest it did have very little run-off and room to expand, something Silverstone had in acres. Silverstone and the BRDC had signed a seven-year contract with Formula 1 and FISA at some point in 1986, to run from 1987 to 1993.|$|R
50|$|Nearly {{two months}} after the third round, the European season began in Spain at the <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> Montjuic street <b>circuit</b> in Barcelona. The Grand Prix Drivers Association was not happy with the state of the barriers, which were not bolted properly, and the drivers {{threatened}} not to take part. Mechanics from the teams went around the entire circuit to attempt to repair/fasten down the barriers. After work was done on the circuit, the drivers agreed that the circuit was still not safe enough. Reigning world champion and championship leader Emerson Fittipaldi had no intention to race because of the condition of the barriers, and went home on Sunday morning. The organisers of the event then locked the cars and motorhomes inside the circuit confines for breach of contract and threatened to keep them there. This being incompatible with the timeschedule for the next race at Monaco, the teams decided to cater for the organisers wishes and raced anyway.|$|R
50|$|The South African Grand Prix, {{held at the}} <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> Kyalami <b>circuit</b> {{had been}} a point of {{contention}} all throughout the year: South Africa, ruled by a racial segregation regime, had {{declared a state of}} emergency and controversy ensued throughout the year whether this race would take place or not. No one wanted to go there, but governing body president Jean-Marie Balestre announced that the race would take place. Despite the Renault and Ligier teams pulling out due to French governmental pressure and only 20 cars starting, the race was an exciting one - Nigel Mansell took pole at an average speed of 147 mph (235 km/h). Rosberg took the lead, but then went off on some oil at Crowthorne which had been dropped by Italian Piercarlo Ghinzani's Toleman, whose Hart engine had failed. Mansell took the lead from the Finn - a lead which he was to keep to the end. Rosberg drove hard and caught 2nd-placed Prost before the finish, who ran out of fuel - but was still classified 3rd to make it a Williams 1-2; Williams was the third team this year to finish a race 1-2, the others being Ferrari and McLaren. A few days later, it was announced that the South African GP was struck off the calendar for 1986, and this would be the last South African GP until 1992, which was won again by Mansell in a Williams-Renault.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{was first}} tested during the Italian Grand Prix in [...] In testing it proved far {{faster than the}} 312T5 chassis the team were then using and Gilles Villeneuve {{preferred}} it, though he had reservations about the handling. Early unreliability of the turbo engine put paid to Villeneuve's [...] championship hopes but he did score back to back victories in Monaco and Spain, {{as well as several}} podium places. Because of the problematic handling the 126CK was at its best on fast tracks with long straights such as Hockenheim, Silverstone, Monza and the Österreichring. The car proved to be <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> but Gilles Villeneuve found the handling to be very difficult, calling the car [...] "a big red Cadillac". According to Villeneuve's teammate Didier Pironi and English engineer Harvey Postlethwaite, who arrived at Ferrari well into the 1981 season, it was not the chassis that was the main cause of the car's handling problems, but the very bad aerodynamics of the car. Postlethwaite later said that the 126CK [...] "had a quarter of the downforce that the Williams or Brabham had that year". The poor aerodynamics of the car, coupled to the chassis' hard suspension, created a tendency to make the car slide into corners before the ground effect pulled the car back on to the track. This had the undesired effects of exposing the drivers to even larger g-forces than the Williams FW07 or Brabham BT49 and making the car tend to overuse its tyres. The engine had massive turbo lag, followed by a steep power curve; this upset the balance of the chassis; although the engine was the most powerful engine that year, even more so than the Renault. At the Österreichring one gaggle of 6 naturally aspirated, better handling cars formed behind Didier Pironi for a number of laps, followed by three other cars shortly afterwards: none of them, however, could find their way past easily due to the Ferrari's power advantage on the <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> Austrian <b>circuit.</b> The same thing also happened at Jarama that year; 4 cars were stuck behind Villeneuve on the tight and twisty circuit, but he was able to hold off the cars behind him thanks to the car's power advantage.|$|R
5000|$|... 2 {{weeks after}} France was the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The F1 circus {{came to this}} <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> {{airfield}} <b>circuit</b> minus one of its top drivers: Pedro Rodriguez had been driving a Ferrari 512S sportscar at a German Interserie race at the Norisring street circuit, and he crashed very badly and was killed. The popular Mexican was 31. At the start Regazzoni and Ickx took the lead for Ferrari with Stewart third. At {{the tail of the}} field Oliver ran into the back of Graham Hill's Brabham, putting both men out of the race. Stewart and Siffert overtook Ickx during the second lap and on lap four Stewart overtook Regazzoni at Stowe Corner. The Scottish star immediately began to build up a lead. Siffert overtook Regazzoni {{in the course of the}} fifth lap and then things began to settle down with Stewart ahead of Siffert, Regazzoni and Ickx. The major interest in the race was supplied by Fittipaldi, who had made a bad start and was driving through the field from 11th place at the end of the first lap. Siffert began to suffer vibration problems and was caught and repassed by Regazzoni on lap 17. On lap 37 Ickx went into the pits to retire with engine trouble and five laps later Siffert also disappeared with a bad misfire. This put Peterson up to third place with Schenken and Fittipaldi chasing him. On Lap 48 Regazzoni disappeared with engine trouble. Stewart kept going and it looked as though Peterson and Schenken were going to be the other men on the podium but with a few laps to go Schenken suffered transmission failure and retired, leaving third place for Fittipaldi, and a home victory for Stewart, ahead of Peterson. Everyone else was lapped.|$|R

But {{concerns}} about the bumpy Mosport Park's safety arose when Briton Ian Ashley had a horrendous accident while cresting a bumpy rise. Ashley's Hesketh flipped over the Armco guardrails and went into a television tower. The German-born Englishman was seriously injured and safety operations to rescue him were inefficient and time-consuming; {{and the lack of}} safety at Mosport was underlined when Jochen Mass lost control of his McLaren and hit a guardrail that virtually flattened upon impact. Jody Scheckter won this race in his Wolf, but with safety not being good enough for Formula One at the rough and <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> Mosport Park <b>circuit,</b> a new proposal was brought forward: a track called the Circuit Île Notre Dame; a man-made island {{in the middle of the}} St. Lawrence sea-way that was the site of the famous Expo '67; specific roads on the island were combined and modified, and then pit facilities were built to make a temporary race track. The Canadian Grand Prix was first held there in 1978 and it has been held there ever since, with the exception of 2 separate years when the event was cancelled.|$|R
50|$|A {{modified}} version of the car dubbed the FW09B was introduced in Round 10 of the season at Brands Hatch for the 1984 British Grand Prix. Unfortunately from that race {{until the end of the}} season both Rosberg and Laffite only recorded one finish each and neither was in the points. Rosberg was 8th at the Dutch Grand Prix while Laffite ended the season in Portugal with a disappointing 14th place, following which the FW09 was retired. One particular incident that was more or less a summation of Williams's season was at the Austrian Grand Prix at the Österreichring - which was at the time the <b>fastest</b> <b>circuit</b> used by Formula One with average lap speeds as high as 150+ mph - Rosberg drove into the pits from 9th place and informed technical director Patrick Head that he was retiring the car from the race because it was dangerously unstable at the Österreichring's <b>very</b> <b>fast</b> sweepers and he feared he might have a massive accident - all too commonplace at such a <b>fast</b> <b>circuit.</b> The Finnish driver, who had amazing reflexes and had a flat-out driving style was not one to just quit out of fear, and Head, a hard-nosed character with little patience for losing, accepted Rosberg's decision wholeheartedly. Williams, which along with Ferrari and Brabham were one of the few race winners in a season dominated by McLaren drivers Niki Lauda and Alain Prost, finished sixth in the constructors' championship in 1984 having scored 25.5 points.|$|R
