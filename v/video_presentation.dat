5|$|On April 29, 2006, American comedian Stephen Colbert {{appeared}} as the featured entertainer at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, {{which was held}} in Washington, D.C., at the Hilton Washington hotel.

Standing {{a few feet from}} U.S. President George W. Bush, {{in front of an audience}} of celebrities, politicians, and members of the White House Press Corps, Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media. He spoke in the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of conservative pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity.|$|E

Airbus Group, in 17 February 2016, broadcast a YouTube <b>video</b> <b>presentation</b> of its vision of the hangar of the future in which it plans to use Air-Cobot.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol segment {{followed}} the performances. A tribute {{was made to}} the 20,000 volunteers {{who participated in the}} Games, with Singapore swimmer Rainer Ng making a short speech thanking the volunteers and eight other athletes presenting bouquets to eight representative volunteers. This was then followed by speeches from Ng Ser Miang, Chairman of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, and Jacques Rogge, IOC President, with Mr. Rogge officially declaring the Games closed in accordance with tradition. The Olympic flag was then lowered with the singing of the Olympic Anthem. In the handover ceremony, the Olympic flag was handed over from Teo Ser Luck, acting as the Mayor of Singapore, through Jacques Rogge, to Ji Jianye, Mayor of Nanjing, China, the host city of the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics. The national anthem of China was then played with the raising of China's flag, and a short <b>video</b> <b>presentation</b> showcasing Nanjing followed. The Youth Olympic Flame was then finally extinguished to the sounds of a flugelhorn. A Celebration Concert marked {{the end of the show}} with songs and performances from local artistes.|$|E

25|$|The {{second half}} of this decade also saw a {{dramatic}} increase in display configurations being deployed, including widescreen canvases, multiple projections and video mapped onto the architectural form. This shift has been underlined by the transition from broadcast based technology - fixed until this decade firmly in the 4x3 aspect ratio specifications NTSC and PAL - to computer industry technology, where the varied needs of office presentation, immersive gaming and corporate <b>video</b> <b>presentation</b> have led to diversity and abundance in methods of output. Compared to the ~640x480i fixed format of NTSC/PAL, a contemporary laptop using DVI can output a great variety of resolutions up to ~2500px wide, and in conjunction with the Matrox TripleHead2Go can feed three different displays with an image coordinated across them all.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new data model called algebraic video that provides operations for the composition, search, navigation and playback of digital <b>video</b> <b>presentations.</b> <b>Video</b> <b>presentations</b> are composed using a video algebra that consists {{of a set of}} basic operations on video segments to produce a desired video stream. The video algebra contains operations for temporally and spatially combining video segments as well as for attaching attributes to these segments. Algebraic video access methods also query and navigation operations. Query and navigation allow users to discover <b>video</b> <b>presentations</b> of interest by describing desired attributes and exploring a presentation's context. Unlike previous approaches, algebraic video permits video expressions to be nested in arbitrarily deep hierarchies. It also permits video segments to inherit attributes by context. Experience with a prototype algebraic video system suggests that algebraic video is an effective way to access and manage video. The protot [...] ...|$|R

500|$|A green-screen and computer-generated {{effects were}} used for the video to create a minimal and performance-based clip.

Accordingly, there were no concerns of cutting; the images were easily merged into one another using computers. A high number of camera lens glare effects was used in the video, part of which was inspired by British designer Gareth Pugh's Autumn/Winter 2009 <b>video</b> <b>presentation.</b> Knowles further explained that the fashion and choreography were the main elements of the music video: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{pavilion}} by Hadid, {{the first}} woman to win the Pritzker Prize, is a tensioned fabric shell fitted over a curving aluminum framework exceeding 7,000 pieces. [...] Although the frame is composed of 7,000 individually bent pieces, no two of which are alike, the shell is made up of a mere 24 custom-made panels of fabric. As expected it accommodates a centennial-themed, audio and <b>video</b> <b>presentation</b> on its interior fabric walls. Its opening was originally expected to be delayed until at least mid-July 2009. [...] The themed presentation that portrays Chicago’s transformation as a result of Burnham's plan is by London-based, Chicago-trained filmmaker Thomas Gray. It is accompanied by a multi-channel soundtrack created by Chicago's Lou Mallozzi of Experimental Sound Studio. The pavilion is described as resembling a [...] "futuristic camping tent". Hadid conceptualized how tension alters appearance as fabric is pulled taut or twisted, which resulted in the elliptical structure and its strategic light-availing gashes and pod-like openings for visitors to experience. The diagonal lines in the structure are a reflection of Burnham’s 1909 city plan, which envisioned a fanned grid of streets emanating diagonally from Chicago’s city center out into the suburbs.|$|E
