25|$|Research {{indicates}} ethanol {{is involved}} in the inhibition of L-type calcium channels. One study showed the nature of ethanol binding to L-type calcium channels is according to first-order kinetics with a Hill coefficient around 1. This indicates ethanol binds independently to the channel, expressing noncooperative binding. Early studies showed a link between calcium and the release of vasopressin by the secondary messenger system. Vasopressin levels are reduced after the ingestion of alcohol. The lower levels of vasopressin from the consumption of alcohol have been linked to ethanol acting as an antagonist to voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Studies conducted by Treistman et al. in the aplysia confirm inhibition of VGCC by ethanol. <b>Voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> recordings have been done on the aplysia neuron. VGCCs were isolated and calcium current was recorded using patch clamp technique having ethanol as a treatment. Recordings were replicated at varying concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mM) at a <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> of +30 mV. Results showed calcium current decreased as concentration of ethanol increased. Similar results have shown to be true in single-channel recordings from isolated nerve terminal of rats that ethanol does in fact block VGCCs.|$|E

However much current is needed to clamp the voltage is opposite in sign and equal in magnitude to the current through the membrane.|$|E

25|$|During {{exocytosis}} at the bipolar ribbon synapse, vesicles {{are seen}} to pause at the membrane and then upon opening of the calcium channels to promptly release their contents within milliseconds. Like most exocytosis, Ca2+ regulates the release of vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. Different types of ribbon synapses have different dependence on Ca2+ releases. The hair cell ribbon synapses exhibit a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration, while the photoreceptor synapses is less steeply dependent on Ca2+ and is stimulated by much lower levels of free Ca2+. The hair cell ribbon synapse experiences spontaneous activity {{in the absence of}} stimuli, under conditions of a constant hair cell membrane potential. <b>Voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> at the postsynaptic bouton showed that the bouton experiences a wide range of excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes. The current amplitude distribution is a positive-skew, with a range of larger amplitudes for both spontaneous and stimulus evoked release. It was thought that this current distribution was not explainable with single vesicle release, and other scenarios of release have been proposed: coordinated multivesicular release, kiss-and-run, or compound fusion of vesicles prior to exocytosis. However it has been recently proposed that uniquantal release with fusion pore flickering is the most plausible interpretation of the found current distribution. In fact, the charge distribution of currents is actually normally distributed, supporting the uniquantal release scenario. It has been shown that the skewness of the current amplitude distribution is well explained by different time courses of neurotransmitter release of a single vesicles with a flickering fusion pore.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The two-microelectrode {{technique}} of <b>voltage</b> <b>clamping</b> sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers {{was used to}} examine the changes in contraction which occur during trains of <b>voltage</b> <b>clamps.</b> (A "train " is defined as a series of <b>voltage</b> <b>clamps</b> delivered at a particular rate, beginning after a rest long enough that the effects of previous stimulation have died away.) Contractions showed striking staircases, or progressive changes in peak isometric tension, during trains. Short <b>clamps,</b> <b>clamps</b> to <b>voltages</b> more negative than [...] 20 or [...] 30 mV, or holding potentials less negative than the resting potential favored negative staircases, while long clamps, <b>clamps</b> to positive <b>voltages,</b> and holding potentials near the resting potential each favored positive staircases. The staircase behavior appeared to be due to changes in the initial rate of recovery of the ability to contract. The changes in staircase behavior as a function of <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage</b> suggested that the relationship between peak tension and <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage</b> should depend on the experimental design. When the steady-state contraction was plotted as a function of <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage,</b> voltage-tension relations like those recently reported for working ventricle were obtained, with a threshold between [...] 30 and [...] 40 mV and a steep relation between tension and voltage.

2500|$|The early {{historical}} {{roots of}} the field {{can be traced to}} the work of people such as Louis Lapicque, Hodgkin & Huxley, Hubel & Wiesel, and David Marr, to name a few. Lapicque introduced the integrate and fire model of the neuron in a seminal article published in 1907; this model is still one of the most popular models in computational neuroscience for both cellular and neural networks studies, as well as in mathematical neuroscience because of its simplicity (see the recent review article for the centenary of Lapicque's original paper). About 40 years later, Hodgkin & Huxley developed the <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> and created the first biophysical model of the action potential. Hubel & Wiesel discovered that neurons in the primary visual cortex, the first cortical area to process information coming from the retina, have oriented receptive fields and are organized in columns. David Marr's work focused on the interactions between neurons, suggesting computational approaches to the study of how functional groups of neurons within the hippocampus and neocortex interact, store, process, and transmit information. Computational modeling of biophysically realistic neurons and dendrites began with the work of [...] Wilfrid Rall, with the first multicompartmental model using cable theory.|$|E
40|$|The Na+, K+ ATPase is an {{essential}} membrane protein in eukaryotic cells, which transports Na+ out of the cell in exchange for K+ into the cell. For this transport it hydrolyses one molecule of ATP for each cycle.

However, amalgamation of the reported rate constants for the partial reactions along with the effect of posttranslational modifications have never been attempted.

Before this discovery, there were drugs that had been found that demonstrated some type of influence on the nervous system. In the 1930s, French scientists began working with a compound called phenothiazine in the hope of synthesizing a drug that would be able to combat malaria. Though this drug showed very little hope in the use against malaria-infected individuals, it was found to have sedative effects along with what appeared to be beneficial effects toward patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. This black box method, wherein an investigator would administer a drug and examine the response without knowing how to relate drug action to patient response, was the main approach to this field, until, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, scientists were able to identify specific neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine (involved in the constriction of blood vessels and the increase in heart rate and blood pressure), dopamine (the chemical whose shortage is involved in Parkinsonâ€™s disease), and serotonin (soon to be recognized as deeply connected to depression). In the 1950s, scientists also became better able to measure levels of specific neurochemicals in the body and thus correlate these levels with behavior. The invention of the <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> in 1949 allowed for the study of ion channels and the nerve action potential. These two major historical events in neuropharmacology allowed scientists not only to study how information is transferred from one neuron to another but also to study how a neuron processes this information within itself.|$|E
2500|$|The 20th {{century was}} a golden era for electrophysiology. In 1902 {{and again in}} 1912, Julius Bernstein {{advanced}} {{the hypothesis that the}} action potential resulted from a change in the permeability of the axonal membrane to ions. Bernstein's hypothesis was confirmed by Ken Cole and Howard Curtis, who showed that membrane conductance increases during an action potential. In 1907, Louis Lapicque suggested that the action potential was generated as a threshold was crossed, what would be later shown as a product of the dynamical systems of ionic conductances. In 1949, Alan Hodgkin and Bernard Katz refined Bernstein's hypothesis by considering that the axonal membrane might have different permeabilities to different ions; in particular, they demonstrated the crucial role of the sodium permeability for the action potential. They made the first actual recording of the electrical changes across the neuronal membrane that mediate the action potential. This line of research culminated in the five 1952 papers of Hodgkin, Katz and Andrew Huxley, in which they applied the <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> technique to determine the dependence of the axonal membrane's permeabilities to sodium and potassium ions on voltage and time, from which they were able to reconstruct the action potential quantitatively.* * * * [...] Hodgkin and Huxley correlated the properties of their mathematical model with discrete ion channels that could exist in several different states, including [...] "open", [...] "closed", and [...] "inactivated".
