2500|$|The second {{method of}} flight, clap and fling, or the Weis-Fogh mechanism, {{functions}} differently. In this process, found in very small insects such as thrips and chalcid wasps, the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{vibration}} {{effects of a}} vortex that occurred in high-head Francis turbines and an alternator are examined. The <b>vortex</b> <b>effect,</b> which directly affects the efficiency {{and the quality of}} the energy, was tested at the Darca- 1 hydroelectric power plant (HPP) located in Ordu Province, Turkey. Formed by undissolved oxygen in the water, the <b>vortex</b> <b>effect,</b> which is parallel to the alternator load, causes tremendous vibration within the alternator and Francis turbine bearings. This problem, which has a direct negative effect on the alternator capacity, was solved by adding an air-admission system. In doing so, power production was increased by 11. 11 %, from 44 MW to 49. 5 MW. This caused a significant head loss, specifically in the Francis turbines.

We have investigated the transport properties of two sets of samples: (i) asymmetrical antidots where vortices are driven by an unbiased ac current and (ii) symmetrical antidots where {{in addition to the}} ac drive a dc bias was used. For each sample, the rectified dc voltage is measured as a function of drive amplitude and frequency, magnetic field, and temperature. As unambiguously shown by our data, the voltage rectification in the asymmetric antidots is induced by the intrinsic asymmetry in the pinning potential created by the antidots, whereas the rectification in the symmetric antidots is induced by the dc bias. In addition, the experiments reveal interesting collective phenomena in the <b>vortex</b> ratchet <b>effect.</b> At fields below the first matching field (H- 1), the dc-voltage-ac-drive characteristics present two rectification peaks, which is interpreted as an interplay between the one-dimensional motion of weakly pinned incommensurate vortex rows and the two-dimensional motion of the whole vortex lattice.
