5|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately, since storage is usually more expensive and because traditional generators can adapt to demand. However both solar power and wind power are <b>variable</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energy,</b> meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through transmission lines to {{where it can be}} used now. Since solar energy is not available at night, storing its energy is potentially an important issue particularly in off-grid and for future 100% renewable energy scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.|$|E
5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from <b>variable</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energy.</b> Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats.|$|E

40|$|Poverty {{alleviation}} {{and social}} upliftment of rural India is closely {{linked with the}} availability and use of energy for development. At the same time, sustainable supply of clean and affordable <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> sources is required if development is to be sustainable, {{so that it does}} not cause any environmental problems. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to determine the key <b>variables</b> of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> implementation for sustainable development, on which the top management should focus. In this paper, an interpretive structural modeling (ISM) - based approach has been employed to model the implementation <b>variables</b> of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> for sustainable development. These variables have been categorized under ‘enablers’ that help to increase the implementation of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> for sustainable development. A major finding of this research is that public awareness regarding <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> for sustainable development is a very significant enabler. In this paper, an interpretation of <b>variables</b> of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> for sustainable development in terms of their driving and dependence powers has been examined. For better results, top management should focus on improving the high-driving power enablers such as leadership, strategic planning, public awareness, top management support, availability of finance, government support, and support from interest groups...|$|R

However, high shares of these <b>Variable</b> <b>Renewable</b> <b>Energies</b> (VREs) challenge the power system considerably due to their temporal fluctuations and geographical dispersion. This paper systematically reviews and analyzes transmission grid extensions as an integration measure for VREs. Effects of grid extensions for fundamental properties of the power system as a function of the penetration and mix of wind coupled with solar energy were revealed in the study. The paper also provides an overview of the system implication of wind and solar PV energy and investigates a way to partly overcome transmission grid extension...|$|R

Twice a day the tides vary 100%, but they are never intermittent, on the contrary they are completely reliable.

This article explains that there are important physical differences between power grids that are dominated by power electronic based sources such as wind and solar and conventional power grids based on synchronous generators. These systems must be properly design to address grid stability and reliability.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{power is}} the least {{predictable}} {{of all of the}} <b>variable</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> sources. Grid operators use day ahead forecasting to determine which of the available power sources to use the next day, and weather forecasting is used to predict the likely wind power and solar power output available. The correlation between wind output and prediction can be relatively high, with an average uncorrected error of 8.8% in Germany over a two-year period. The variability of wind power can be seen as one of its defining characteristics.|$|E
30|$|Table  8 {{also reports}} that the error {{correction}} term (ECT) is statistically significant in relevance to the equations of CO 2 emissions, <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> consumption, the number of tourist arrivals, trade, and FDI. However, the ECT is not statistically significant for the economic growth equation. Therefore, there are long-run bidirectional causalities between the five <b>variables</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energy,</b> tourism, FDI, trade, and emissions. The presence of long-run bidirectional causality between <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> consumption {{and the number of}} tourist arrivals is an interesting result similar to that established by Ben Jebli et al. (2015 a) for the case of Tunisia. It implies that increasing <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> use attracts more tourists, because the latter are more concerned with environmental protection. In addition, more international tourists give more foreign currency to these countries, thus, enabling them to invest in <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> projects. Thus, a policy designed {{for the development of the}} tourism sector could be a good supportive policy for the expansion of the share of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> in the total energy mix.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses panel cointegration {{techniques}} {{to examine the}} causal relationship between output, <b>renewable</b> and non-renewable <b>energy</b> consumption, and international trade for a sample of 69 countries during the period 1980 - 2007. In the short-run, Granger causality tests {{show that there is}} evidence of a bidirectional causality between output and trade (exports or imports), a one way causality running from <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> consumption to trade, and a bidirectional feedback causality between non-renewable energy consumption and trade. Interestingly, there is no direct short-run causality between the three <b>variables</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energy,</b> non-renewable energy and output. However, there is an indirect short-run causality running from <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> to both non-renewable energy and output, which occurs through trade. Also, there is an indirect and bidirectional short-run causality between non-renewable energy and output through trade. In the long-run, OLS, FMOLS and DOLS estimates suggest that <b>renewable</b> and non-renewable <b>energy</b> consumption and trade have a positive and statistically significant impact on economic growth. Our policy recommendations are to encourage trade openness because this may reduce the share of non-renewable energy consumption in total energy consumption. Indeed, through technology transfer and economies of scale, more trade openness could be a good policy for combating global warming by encouraging the use of <b>renewable</b> <b>energies,</b> while increasing output. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} of <b>Variable</b> <b>Renewable</b> <b>Energies</b> (VREs) in the electricity mix poses serious challenges {{in terms of}} management of the electrical grids, as the associated variability and non-dispatchability are {{in contrast with the}} requirement that the load be instantaneously equalized by the generation. One of the goals of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) is to simulate the evolution of electricity demand and generation mix over time, therefore a proper modeling of VRE system integration is crucial. In this paper we discuss how different modeling mechanisms can profoundly impact the evolution of the electricity mix, and specifically renewable penetration. In particular, we focus on the effects of introducing a set of explicit system integration constraints in a model, WITCH, characterized by a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) framework...|$|R

40|$|Photovoltaics (PV) has {{recently}} undergone impressive growth and substantial cost decreases, while deployment for {{concentrating solar power}} (CSP) has been much slower. As the share of PV rises, the challenge of system integration will increase. This favors CSP, which can be combined with thermal storage and co-firing to reduce variability. It is thus an open question how important solar power will be for achieving climate mitigation targets, and which solar technology will be dominant in the long-term. We address these questions with the state-of-the-art integrated energy-economy-climate model REMIND 1. 5, which embodies an advanced representation {{of the most important}} drivers of solar deployment. We derive up-to-date values for current and future costs of solar technologies. We calculate a consistent global resource potential dataset for both CSP and PV, aggregated to country-level. We also present a simplified representation of system integration costs of <b>variable</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energies,</b> suitable for large-scale energy-economy-models. Finally, we calculate a large number of scenarios and perform a sensitivity study to analyze how robust our results are towards future cost reductions of PV and CSP...|$|R

40|$|Regulation {{has always}} been {{at the core of}} power systems. Two of the most {{important}} reasons for regulatory interventions to be present in today's power systems are negative environmental externalities from power generation, {{and the fact that the}} power grid is a natural monopoly. Against this background, this thesis investigates several aspects of the economics and regulatory design of power systems with a focus on the generation and transmission sector. Specifically, it investigates design alternatives for the organization of the different economic activities in these sectors with the goal to induce short- and long-term efficiency. Novel approaches are suggested to identify and tackle economic and regulatory deficits. The specific challenges that are addressed stem from the time-varying and interdependent temporal and spatial distribution of production (especially, from <b>variable</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energies)</b> and demand, as well as from the degree and exchange of information between different players in the supply chain for electric power. It is shown in the thesis that weak designs in these fields may entail significant losses of social welfare.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{share of}} electricity from {{wind and solar}} PV, the <b>variable</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energies</b> (VREs), will lead to significant temporary electricity sur-pluses in Germany in the future. Commonly discussed counter measures are a European super grid or new electric storage options. Instead, we examine in this paper how energy sector coupling, i. e., the interconnection of the power, heat, hydrogen, and natural gas sector, can help {{to make use of}} this surplus energy potential in an economic manner. To this end, we employ a detailed cost-optimizing energy system model for a German 2020 and 2050 scenario. We explore different coupling tech-nologies and their economic interrelations, as well as their interaction with electrical storage options. The model is regionally resolved and allows to locate different technologies in accordance with regional VRE supply and transmission capabilities. The results reveal systematic benefits of energy sector coupling compared to a purely electric storage solution. The heat sector absorbs large parts of the temporary electricity oversupply from VREs and makes long term electricity storage via hydrogen or natural gas questionable. While energy sector coupling initially reduces the need for bulk electricity transmission, transmission grid requirements increase for large VRE shares: the grid is extended to facilitate the sector coupling...|$|R
40|$|We study a one-period {{supply chain}} problem {{consisting}} of numerous suppliers delivering a ho- mogenous good. Individual supply is uncertain and may exhibit dependencies with other suppliers {{as well as}} with the stochastic demand. Assuming that reliability of supply represents an economic value for the customer that shall be paid accordingly, we ﬁrst derive an analytical solution for the contribution of an individual supplier to supply chain reliability. Second, applying concepts from cooperative game-theory, we propose a payoﬀ scheme based on marginal contributions that explic- itly accounts for the statistical properties of the problem. A number of desirable properties is thus achieved, including static eﬃciency as well as eﬃcient investment incentives. Lastly, in order to demonstrate the relevance and applicability of the concepts developed, we consider the example of payoﬀs for reliability in power systems that are increasingly enetrated by interdependent <b>variable</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energies.</b> We investigate empirical data on wind power in Germany, thereby conﬁrming our analytical ﬁndings.

Consequently, as the electricity industry is restructured and new renewables policies are created, {{it is important}} for policymakers to consider the impacts of renewables policy design on project financing. This report describes the power plant financing process and provides insights to policymakers on the important nexus between renewables policy design and finance. A cash-flow model is used to estimate the impact of various financing <b>variables</b> on <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> costs. Past and current <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> policies are then evaluated to demonstrate the influence of policy design on the financing process and on financing costs. The possible impacts of electricity restructuring on power plant financing are discussed and key design issues are identified for three specific <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> programs being considered in the restructuring process: (1) surcharge-funded policies; (2) renewables portfolio standards; and (3) green marketing programs. Finally, several policies that are intended to directly reduce financing costs and barriers are analyzed. The authors find that one of the key reasons that renewables policies are not more effective is that project development and financing processes are frequently ignored or misunderstood when designing and implementing <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> incentives. A policy that is carefully designed can reduce <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> costs dramatically by providing revenue certainty that will, in turn, reduce financing risk premiums...|$|R

Due to their substantial temporal and spatial aggregation, IAMs cannot explicitly represent all detailed challenges of integrating the <b>variable</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energies</b> (VRE) wind and solar in power systems, but rather rely on parameterized modeling approaches. In the ADVANCE project, six international modeling teams have developed new approaches to improve the representation of power sector dynamics and VRE integration in IAMs. In this study, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the last years 2 ̆ 019 modeling progress and study the impact of VRE integration modeling on VRE deployment in IAM scenarios. For a comprehensive and transparent qualitative evaluation, we first develop a framework of 18 features of power sector dynamics and VRE integration.
