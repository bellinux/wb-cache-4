40|$|BACKGROUND: Cusp {{prolapse}} {{management is}} important in aortic <b>valve</b> (AV) <b>sparing</b> and repair to achieve durable results. We analyzed the midterm outcomes of two different techniques for trileaflet AV prolapse repair. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2008, 376 patients underwent elective AV repair: 88 with trileaflet AV (23 %) had cusp prolapse repair, plication technique was performed in 34 (39 %), resuspension technique in 33 (37 %) and plication plus resuspension in 21 (24 %). One cusp was repaired in 55 (62 %), 2 cusps in 18 (21 %), and 3 cusps in 15 (17 %). RESULTS: No hospital deaths occurred. Patients undergoing resuspension with or without plication had more preoperative aortic insufficiency (AI; p = 0. 01) and multiple cusp prolapses (p = 0. 01). During follow-up (median, 41 months), 4 deaths occurred and 2 were cardiac related. Overall survival at 5 years was 95 % +/- 5 %. Two patients needed AV reoperation because of recurrent AI or AI plus AV stenosis. Recurrent AI grade > or = 3 + developed in 4 patients; 1 with moderate AV stenosis. Freedom from reoperation at 5 years was 100 % for plication, 96 % +/- 4 % for resuspension, and 93 % +/- 7 % for plication plus resuspension (p = 0. 6); respective freedom from AI > or = 3 + at 3 years was 100 %, 92 % +/- 8 %, and 89 % +/- 11 % (p = 0. 8). CONCLUSIONS: Cusp plication or resuspension are efficient and durable techniques to correct cusp prolapse in the trileaflet AV. Plication is typically the first choice because of its ease of use and lower risk of overcorrection; however, free margin resuspension is useful in specific situations...|$|R

40|$|Forteza et al {{from the}} Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre {{described}} {{in this issue of}} the Revista Española de Cardiología their initial experience with aortic <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> operations for aortic root aneurysm in 18 patients with Marfan syndrome. 1 The authors indicated that they have done 40 such operations for aortic root aneurysm. The early results reported are excellent and I commend them for introducing this type of conservative valve surgery in their cardiac unit. I have no doubt that in selected patients valve repair provides better clinical outcomes than valve replacement. Aortic <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> operations are complicated procedures because they require exceptional knowledge of the functional anatomy of the aortic valve as well as technical expertise. They are not easily reproducible. There are basically two types of aortic <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> operations to treat aortic root aneurysm: reimplantation of the aortic valve and remodeling of the aortic root. 2 Figures 1, 2, and 3 show sketches of these operations. Remodeling of the aortic root is a physiologically sounder procedure than reimplantion of the aortic valve 3 but we have shown in patients with Marfan syndrome that the aorto-ventricular junction continues to dilate after remodeling of the aortic root and eventually aortic insufficiency ensues. 4 For this reason, we believe that reimplantation of the aortic valve is more appropriate to treat young patients with aortic root aneurysm whether they have the Marfan syndrome or not. 5 Since the introduction of reimplantation of the aortic valve to treat aortic root aneurysms, several technical modifications have been proposed. 6 - 8 Most of these changes have focused on creating neo-aortic sinuses to reduce the velocity of closure of the aortic cusps t...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In regurgitant tricuspid aortic valves, cusp {{prolapse}} may {{be isolated}} or associated with dilatation of the proximal aorta. Newly appearing cusp prolapse can also appear after an aortic <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> operation (AVSO) and {{be responsible for}} residual aortic regurgitation. In this report, we describe our experience in repairing prolapsing aortic cusps in 44 patients with aortic regurgitation. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2003, 260 patients had aortic valve repair or <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> procedures in our department. All patients had peri-operative TEE. Prolapse {{of one or more}} of the aortic cusps was identified by TEE and confirmed by careful surgical inspection before and after <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> surgery. Forty-four patients with cusp prolapse were identified. Fifteen had an isolated prolapse, with a normal root (group I), 18 had cusp prolapse associated with dilatation of the proximal aorta (group IIa), and 11 had a newly appearing prolapse after AVSO (group IIb). Correction of the prolapsing cusp was achieved by either free edge plication, triangular resection or resuspension with PTFE. This procedure was associated with an aortic annuloplasty in group I, and with AVSO in groups II and III. RESULTS: Post-operative TEE showed AR trivial or grade I regurgitation. At a mean of 23 months follow-up, one patient with recurrent regurgitation required an aortic valve replacement with a homograft. All remaining patients were in NYHA class I or II. Echocardiography confirmed the durability of the valve repair. CONCLUSIONS: Among the common causes of aortic regurgitation, isolated cusp prolapse is frequent and is amenable to surgical repair with excellent mid-term results. In particular, in patents who are potential candidates for AVSO, identification and correction of an associated prolapse, either pre-existing or secondary to the AVSO procedure, may further extend the indications for this technique, increase its success rates and improve its long-term outcome...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: For {{patients}} with aortic regurgitation (AR), aortic <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> or repair surgery {{is an attractive}} alternative to valve replacement. In this setting, accurate preoperative delineation of aortic valve pathology and potential repairability is of paramount importance. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the diagnostic value of preoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in defining the mechanisms of AR, as identified by surgical inspection, and in predicting repairability, by using the final surgical approach as reference. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three consecutive patients (117 males, mean age: 58 +/- 14 years) undergoing AR surgery were included. Mechanisms of AR were categorized by TEE and surgical inspection as follows: type 1, aortic dilatation; type 2, cusp prolapse; and type 3, restrictive cusp motion or endocarditis. At surgery, mechanisms of AR were type 1 in 41 patients, type 2 in 62, and type 3 in 60. Agreement between TEE and surgical inspection was 93 % (kappa= 0. 90). <b>Valve</b> <b>sparing</b> or repair was performed in 125 patients and valve replacement in 38 patients. TEE correctly predicted the final surgical approach in 108 / 125 (86 %) patients undergoing repair and in 35 / 38 (93 %) patients undergoing replacement. The gross anatomic classification of AR lesions by TEE was determinant of valve repairability and postoperative outcome (4 -year freedom from > grade 2 AR, reoperation, or death, P= 0. 04).

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Due to late {{complications}} {{associated with}} the use of conventional prosthetic heart valves, several centers have advocated aortic valve repair and/or <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> aortic root replacement for patients with aortic valve insufficiency, in order to enhance late survival and minimize adverse postoperative events. Methods: From March/ 2012 thru March 2015, 37 patients consecutively underwent conservative operations of the aortic valve and/or aortic root. Mean age was 48 ± 16 years and 81 % were males. The aortic valve was bicuspid in 54 % and tricuspid in the remaining. All were operated with the aid of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Surgical techniques consisted of replacing the aortic root with a Dacron graft whenever it was dilated or aneurysmatic, using either the remodeling or the reimplantation technique, besides correcting leaflet prolapse when present. Patients were sequentially evaluated with clinical and echocardiographic studies and mean follow-up time was 16 ± 5 months. Results: Thirty-day mortality was 2. 7 %. In addition there were two late deaths, with late survival being 85 % (CI 95 % - 68 %- 95 %) at two years. Two patients were reoperated due to primary structural valve failure. Freedom from reoperation or from primary structural valve failure was 90 % (CI 95 % - 66 %- 97 %) and 91 % (CI 95 % - 69 %- 97 %) at 2 years, respectively. During clinical follow-up up to 3 years, there were no cases of thromboembolism, hemorrhage or endocarditis. Conclusions: Although this represents an initial series, these data demonstrates that aortic valve repair and/or <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> aortic root surgery can be performed with satisfactory immediate and short-term results...|$|E

MethodsTwo hundred twenty {{consecutive}} patients who had aortic <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> for aortic root aneurysm were prospectively studied with annual clinical assessments and echocardiography. Their mean age was 46 ± 15 years, 40 % had Marfan syndrome, 17 % had aortic dissection, and 7 % had bicuspid aortic valve. Reimplantation of the aortic valve was performed in 167 patients and remodeling of the aortic root in 53. Aortic cusp repair was performed in 80 patients, and reinforcement of the free margin {{of one of the}} cusps with a fine polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) suture in 48. The mean follow-up was 5. 2 ± 3. 7 years and it was complete. ResultsThere were 3 operative and 13 late deaths. Patients’ survival at 10 years was 88 % ± 3 %. Age older than 65 years, advanced functional class, and ejection fraction less than 40 % were independent predictors of death. Moderate aortic insufficiency developed in 7 patients and severe insufficiency in 6. Freedom from moderate or severe aortic insufficiency at 10 years was 85 % ± 5 % for all patients, but it was 94 % ± 4 % after reimplantation and 75 % ± 10 % after remodeling (P =. 04).

40|$|Background: <b>Valve</b> <b>sparing</b> aortic root {{reconstruction}} (VSARR) {{has become}} an alternative to traditional aortic root replacement with a valved conduit. There have been various modifications but the two broad types are aortic root reimplantation and the aortic root remodelling procedure. We present the early and late outcomes following <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> aortic root reconstruction surgery in Australia. Methods: We reviewed the ANZSCTS database for patients undergoing these procedures. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative variables were analysed. Multivariable regression was performed to determine independent predictors of 30 -day mortality. We also obtained five- and 10 -year survival estimates by cross-linking the ANZSCTS database with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's National Death Index. Results: Between January 2001 and January 2012, 169 consecutive patients underwent VSARR procedures. The {{mean age of the}} study population was 54. 4 years with 31. 4 % being females. Overall, nine patients (5. 9 %) died within 30 days post procedure and five patients (3 %) had permanent strokes. However, out of 132 elective cases, only five patients died (3. 8 %). Independent predictors of 30 -day mortality were female gender [OR 5. 65 (1. 24 - 25. 80), p= 0. 025], preoperative atrial arrhythmia [OR 6. 07 (1. 14 - 32. 35), p= 0. 035] and acute type A aortic dissection [OR 7. 71 (1. 63 - 36. 54), p= 0. 01]. Long-term survival was estimated as 85. 3 % and 72. 7 % at five- and 10 -years, respectively. Conclusions: Along with an acceptable rate of early mortality and stroke, VSARR procedures provide good long-term survival according to the ANZSCTS database. As promising procedure for pathologies that impair the aortic root integrity, they can be adopted more widely, especially in Australian and New Zealand centres with experienced aortic units.

40|$|In {{aortic valve}} repair, a large ventriculo-aortic {{junction}} {{as well as}} a low coaptation height has been found to jeopardize repair stability due to the increased cusp stress and low coaptation reserve. The repair procedure aims to correct all geometrical issues and restore a stable balance between the root and cusp size. While aortic valve repair cannot stop the degenerative process by itself, it can correct damage caused by the degenerative process and reinforce certain structures. The ventriculo-aortic junction is a tridimensional oval-shaped structure deeply embedded in the heart, which supports the base of the aortic cusp insertion. In a normal aortic valve, ventriculo-aortic junction size is closely related to body surface area. In the pathological setting, such as with chronic aortic regurgitation, aortic root aneurysm, or bicuspid aortic valve, the ventriculo-aortic junction can be substantially larger in size, thus out of proportion with body size. In patients undergoing aortic valve repair, a ventriculo-aortic junction ≥ 28 mm is an indication for performing a stable circumferential annuloplasty of this junction. When the junction is inferior to 28 mm, annuloplasty is not systematically indicated and should be guided by the ratio between cusp and ventriculo-aortic junction size. Patients exhibiting a ventriculo-aortic junction ≥ 28 mm and root dilatation should be treated with valve-sparing reimplantation or valve-sparing remodeling with circumferential annuloplasty. Those exhibiting a ventriculo-aortic junction ≥ 28 mm and no root dilatation should undergo either <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> reimplantation or a circumferential annuloplasty without root replacement. Currently, <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> reimplantation is our technique of choice to treat patients presenting with ventriculo-aortic junction dilatation given the stability of its annuloplasty and the capacity to reshape the entire aortic valve geometry. Additional studies are necessary to evaluate the final impact on valve function and long-term results of the new circumferential annuloplasty techniques without root replacement, as well as to establish the role these would play in the spectrum of aortic valve repair.

40|$|We {{present a}} case of a young female with stroke {{symptoms}} who underwent <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> resection of a presumed fibroelastoma based on echocardiographic findings. After confirming embolic stroke, she underwent excision of the lesion, which on pathology revealed a nonbacterial thrombus. Ultimately, this led to a more extensive work-up leading to the discovery of a papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, the underlying cause of her hypercoagulable state. The initial echocardiographic findings painted the clear picture of a papillary tumor on the aortic valve which was likely the source of the emboli resulting in ischemic stroke. This unique case presentation illustrates that imaging, including echocardiography, may not always coincide with the clinical diagnosis. Thus, understanding the differential diagnoses of cardiac masses is of vital clinical significance. The distinction of fibroelastoma versus the much less common finding of aortic thrombus may lead to early diagnosis of malignancy and prevention of life threatening events due to stroke or undiagnosed disease...|$|E
40|$|We {{report about}} a 37 year old male {{patient with a}} pectus excavatum. The patient was in NYHA {{functional}} class III. After performed computed tomography the symptoms {{were thought to be}} related to the severity of chest deformation. A Ravitch-procedure had been accomplished in a district hospital in 2009. The crack of a metal bar led to a reevaluation 2010, in which surprisingly the presence of an annuloaortic ectasia (root 73 &# 215; 74 mm) in direct neighborhood of the formerly implanted metal-bars was diagnosed. Echocardiography revealed a severe aortic valve regurgitation, the left ventricle was massively dilated presenting a reduced ejection fraction of 45 %. A marfan syndrome was suspected and the patient underwent a <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> aortic root replacement (David procedure) in our institution with an uneventful postoperative course. A review of the literature in combination with discussion of our case suggests the application of stronger recommendations towards preoperative cardiovascular assessment in patients with pectus excavatum...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} the impact {{and safety of}} different surgical techniques for aortic root replacement (ARR) on early and late morbidity and mortality in septuagenarians undergoing ARR. Methods Ninety-five patients (73. 8 ± 3. 2 years) were operated and divided into three groups according to the aortic root procedure; MECH-group (n = 51) patients with a mechanical composite graft, BIO-group (n = 22) patients with a customized biological composite graft, and REIMPL-group (n = 22) patients with a <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> aortic root reimplantation (David I). In 42. 1 % (40 / 95) of these patients the aortic arch was replaced. Follow-up was completed in 95. 2 % (79 / 83) of in-hospital survivors. Results Hospital mortality was 12. 6 % (12 / 95) in the entire population (MECH. 15. 7 % (8 / 51), BIO 19. 7 % (4 / 22), REIMPL 0 % (0 / 22); p = 0. 004). Two patients died intraoperatively. The most frequent postoperative complications were prolonged mechanical ventilation ((> 48 h) in 16. 8 % (16 / 93) (MECH. 7 % (7 / 51), BIO 36. 4 % (8 / 22), REIMPL 4. 5 % (1 / 22); p = 0. 013) and rethoracotomy for postoperative bleeding in 12. 6 % (12 / 95) (MECH. 12 % (6 / 51), BIO 22. 7 % (5 / 22), REIMPL 4. 5 % (1 / 22); p = 0. 19). Nineteen late deaths (22. 9 %) (19 / 83) (MECH 34. 8 % (15 / 43), BIO 16. 7 % (3 / 18), REIMPL 4. 5 % (1 / 22); p = 0. 012) occurred during a mean follow-up of 41 ± 42 months (MECH 48 ± 48 months, BIO 25 ± 37 months, REIMPL 40 ± 28 months, p = 0. 028). Postoperative NYHA class decreased significantly (p = 0. 017) and performance status (p = 0. 027) increased for the entire group compared to preoperative values. Conclusion Our data indicate that <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> aortic root reimplantation is safe and effective in septuagenarians, and is associated with low early and late morbidity and mortality. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveSparing the {{aortic valve}} {{has become a}} {{surgical}} option for patients who require repair of aortic root ectasia and have normal valve leaflets. Surgical approaches to <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> differ with regard to preservation of the native sinuses of Valsalva. The role of the sinuses {{and the importance of}} maintaining them remain controversial. MethodsBy using a time-resolved, 3 -dimensional, phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging technique, aortic root and aortic blood velocity data were acquired from 2 patients with Marfan syndrome 6 months after aortic valve–sparing surgery with straight Dacron grafts and contrasted with data from 6 normal volunteers. ResultsIn normal aortas vortical blood flow became apparent in the individual sinuses after peak systole. The vortices filled the available space behind the valve leaflets and persisted until diastole, expanding and moving inward during aortic valve closure. In contrast, no vortices were observed in the postoperative patients with Marfan syndrome with negligible sinuses. ConclusionsChanges in supravalvular flow accompany loss of sinus architecture. Whether the presence, size, and velocity of supravalvular vortices affects the function or durability of the preserved aortic valve remains to be studied...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHeart valve {{dysfunction}} is {{a significant}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} around the world. Sustainability of the artificial heart valves such as either mechanical or biological (homo-graft, xeno-graft) is not proved yet. Requirement for anti-coagulation medication and calcification within a short time are the major defects of artificial valves which may lead to re-replacement of the valve. Whereas, the bio prosthetic valves are not currently useful in clinical application, so, the <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> surgery with shorter convalescence and economical aspect can be the best alternative for valvular disease treatment. This research attempts to model the geometric dimension of aortic heart valve through a complex calculation. The objective of this research is to define the parameters such as angle between leaflets and valve base (resp. leaflet and wall of the valve) in close (resp. open) position of the valve and also the angle of leaflet free-edge in open position which are hardly measurable in reality. These parameters can be used for calculating the required dimensions of the valves’ leaflet according to the other dimension of the valve for a successful sparing surgery...|$|E
40|$|Background. Ministernotomy incisions {{have been}} {{increasingly}} {{used in a}} variety of settings. We describe a novel approach to ministernotomy using arrowhead incision and rigid sternal fixation with a standard sternal plating system. Methods. A small, midline, vertical incision is made from the midportion of the manubrium to a point just above the 4 th intercostal mark. The sternum is opened in the shape of an inverted T using two oblique horizontal incisions from the midline to the sternal edges. At the time of chest closure, the three bony segments are aligned and approximated, and titanium plates (Sternalock, Jacksonville, Florida) are used to fix the body of the sternum back together. Results. This case series includes 11 patients who underwent arrowhead ministernotomy with rigid sternal plate fixation for aortic surgery. The procedures performed were axillary cannulation (n= 2), aortic root replacement (n= 3), <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> root replacement (n= 3), and replacement of the ascending aorta (n= 11) and/or hemiarch (n= 2). Thirty-day mortality was 0 %; there were no conversions, strokes, or sternal wound infections. Conclusions. Arrowhead ministernotomy with rigid sternal plate fixation is an adequate minimally invasive approach for surgery of the ascending aorta and aortic root...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Aortic root {{surgery is}} {{transitioning}} to aortic <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> (AVS), but {{little is known}} about the relative early outcomes of AVS versus composite graft-valve replacement (CVR). This study assessed mortality differences for AVS versus CVR to guide future practice decisions. METHODS: From January 2000 to June 2011, 31 747 patients had aortic root replacement with AVS (n = 3585; 11 %) or CVR (n = 28 162; 89 %). The cohort of Overall patients was divided into two subgroups: high-risk patients (n = 20 356; 6 % AVS) having age> 75 years, endocarditis, aortic stenosis, dialysis, multiple valves, reoperation or emergency/salvage status, and the remaining low-risk patients (n = 11 388; 21 % AVS). Using logis-tic regression analysis, outcomes were presented as unadjusted operative mortality (UOM), risk-adjusted operative mortality (AOM) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for mortality. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics for the Overall group (AVS versus CVR) were: mean age (52 vs 57 years), endocarditis (1 vs 11 %), aortic stenosis (4 vs 36 %), dialysis (1 vs 2 %), multiple valves (7 vs 10 %), reoperation (6 vs 17 %) and emergency status (14 vs 12 %) (all P < 0. 0001). In high- and low-risk groups, baseline differences narrowed, and lower mortality was generally observed with AVS: (AVS versus CVR) UOM group Overall (4. ...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{report the}} results of aortic root reoperations after {{pulmonary}} autograft implantation. MethodsAll consecutive patients in our prospective Ross research database were selected for analysis, and additional information for patients requiring reoperation {{was obtained from the}} hospital records. ResultsFrom 1988 to 2009, 155 pulmonary autograft operations were performed. During this period, 41 patients required reoperation for aortic root dilatation and/or autograft valve insufficiency, in 8 patients combined with pulmonary allograft dysfunction. The freedom from autograft reoperation rate was 86 % (standard error, 3. 3 %) after 10 years and 52 % (standard error, 6. 6 %) after 15 years. The median interval to reoperation was 15. 3 years. During reoperation, 39 patients underwent aortic root replacement (mechanical conduit, 31; stentless root, 2; allograft, 3; and <b>valve</b> <b>sparing,</b> 3), and 2 patients underwent valve replacement. In 8 patients this was combined with pulmonary allograft replacement. The technical difficulties encountered included bleeding at the sternal re-entry in 5 patients. No 30 -day mortality occurred. The postoperative complications included reexploration for persistent blood loss in 3 patients and cerebrovascular accident in 3 patients. Two patients died during the follow-up period. The survival rate after reoperation was 94 % (standard error, 4. 1 %) at 5 years. ConclusionsAn increasing number of patients requires reoperation after pulmonary autograft implantation. These reoperations can be done with very low mortality and morbidity and excellent follow-up results...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Valve</b> <b>sparing</b> aortic root {{replacement}} (VSRR) {{had been}} popularized {{in the last}} decades because preservation of the native valve allows for better hemodynamics, better left ventricular performance, lesser risk of endocarditis and avoidance of lifelong anticoagulation. Two basic types of VSRR techniques are used: reimplantation of the aortic valve (Tirone David) and remodeling of the aortic root(Yacoub). We compared the David reimplantation technique versus one or two sinus replacement in repair of aortic root aneurysm or dissection associated with aortic regurge. Patients & Methods: Fifty patients {{were divided into two}} groups: Group I (25 patients) undergone David reimplantation technique, Group II (25 patients) undergone supracoronary with one or two sinus replacement. Results: There were two deaths (8 %) within 30 days in each group. Postoperative significant regurge in Group I occurred in 1 case (4. 3 %) and in 2 cases (8. 6 %) in Group II with no significant difference. Cross clamp time was significantly shorter in Group II; 137  ± 37. 0  min versus 177 ± 33. 0  min in Group I. Significant bleeding occurred in 7 cases (28 %) in Group I which was significantly higher than Group II; 1 case (4 %). Conclusion: Replacement of one or two sinuses is not inferior to reimplantation technique regarding early survival and correction of aortic regurge. Noncoronary sinus replacement provided better results than reimplantation technique regarding postoperative bleeding and cross clamp time...|$|E
40|$|Elective root {{replacement}} in Marfan syndrome {{has improved}} life expectancy in affected patients. Three forms of surgery are now available: total root replacement (TRR) with a valved conduit, <b>valve</b> <b>sparing</b> root replacement (VSRR) and personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh sleeve. TRR {{can be performed}} irrespective of aortic dimensions and a mechanical replacement valve is a secure and near certain means of correcting aortic valve regurgitation but has thromboembolic and bleeding risks. VSRR offers freedom from anticoagulation and attendant risks of bleeding but reoperation for aortic regurgitation runs at 1. 3 % per annum. A prospective multi-institutional study has found this to be an underestimate of the true rate of valve-related adverse events. PEARS conserves the aortic root anatomy and optimises the chance of maintaining valve function but average follow-up is under 5  years and so the long-term results are yet to be determined. Patients are on average in their 30 s and so the cumulative lifetime need for reoperation, and of any valve-related complications, are consequently substantial. With lowering surgical risk of prophylactic root replacement, the threshold for intervention has reduced progressively over 30  years to 4. 5  cm and so {{an increasing number of}} patients who are not destined to have a dissection are now having root replacement. In evaluation of these three forms of surgery, the number needed to treat to prevent dissection and the balance of net benefit and harm in future patients must be considered...|$|E
