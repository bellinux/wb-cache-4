In particular, Kellogg invented a vibrating chair used to stimulate vital organs in the lower abdomen. Even today one can visit the Kellogg Discovery Center in Battle Creek, Michigan, and sit on Kellogg's vibrating chair, which is equipped to mechanically oscillate 20 times per second. Furthermore, Kellogg devised an electrotherapy exercise bed in which a sinusoidal current that produced muscular contraction but no pain could be delivered for twenty minutes and reportedly achieve the stimulation of a brisk four-mile walk.|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic touch (TT) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} <b>vibrational</b> <b>therapies</b> still in use. Dolores Krieger and Dora Kunz, in the 1970 s, pioneered the {{application}} of the method in nursing. Since then, research involving the use of therapeutic touch has been developed in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the intervention to reduce the signs and symptoms related to various diseases. Many studies have evaluated the use of TT in isolation, however, a large part of these research studies compare this strategy with other complementary therapies, such as: music, guided imagery and relaxation. The results of these studies indicate improvement or reduction of signs and symptoms investigated in patients undergoing TT. However, methodological biases make it impossible to generalize the results, making it essential to conduct well-designed clinical trials capable of determining the effectiveness of the intervention, in addition to studying populations that have not yet been addressed, such as the elderly and newborns...|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic Touch (TT) is a {{contemporary}} approach to several ancestral healing practices. As {{one of the}} oldest <b>vibrational</b> <b>therapies</b> still in use, it is expected to act on the balancing of the human beingâ€™s energy field, by the laying hands on. The hands are, therefore, vehicles of comfort, affection, support and healing. This article illustrates a systematic review of the literature (RSL), on the effects of TT in the newborn. Objective: To know the effect of TT in the newborn. Methods: We carried the research on the Online Knowledge Library platform (Biblioteca do Conhecimento Online/B-On) by researching on the available electronic databases. The articles which addressed the TT as an intervention in the newborn were included. From the 237 articles found, eight ones were selected according to the inclusion criteria previously established. Results: All studies demonstrated benefits of applying TT, such as calming effect after nursing procedures, because it reduces pain, reduces the motor activity, decreases the level of cortisol, facilitates feeding, suction/ swallowing and thus increases weight, stabilizes vital signs, promotes rest, improves interaction with the environment and saves energy for growth and healing. Conclusions: The practice of TT in the newborn can contribute to his well-being, bringing him physical, psychological and spiritual benefits...|$|R
