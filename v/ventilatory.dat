5|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin, {{has been}} shown to improve the <b>ventilatory</b> response, but this has been poorly studied and is {{associated}} with an increased risk of thrombosis. Similarly, the drug acetazolamide can reduce bicarbonate levels, and thereby augment to normal <b>ventilatory</b> response, but this has been researched insufficiently to recommend wide application.|$|E
5|$|The blunted <b>ventilatory</b> {{response}} {{is attributed to}} several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced <b>ventilatory</b> response in a vicious circle.|$|E
5|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is often}} administered without tracheal intubation in selected {{cases where the}} procedure is brief in duration, or procedures where the depth of anesthesia {{is not sufficient to}} cause significant compromise in <b>ventilatory</b> function. Even for longer duration or more invasive procedures, a general anesthetic may be administered without intubating the trachea, provided that patients are carefully selected, and the risk-benefit ratio is favorable (i.e., the risks associated with an unprotected airway are believed to be less than the risks of intubating the trachea).|$|E
5|$|Respiratory failure {{may require}} {{intubation}} of the trachea and breathing support through mechanical ventilation, generally on an intensive care unit. The need for <b>ventilatory</b> support can be anticipated by measurement of two spirometry-based breathing tests: the {{forced vital capacity}} (FVC) and the negative inspiratory force (NIF). An FVC of less than 15ml per kilogram body weight or an NIF of less than 60cmH2O are considered markers of severe respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for <b>ventilatory</b> assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
5|$|No single {{method for}} {{confirming}} tracheal tube placement {{has been shown}} to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the standard of care. Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral breath sounds will be heard upon listening to the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area over the stomach. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with <b>ventilatory</b> excursions. A small amount of water vapor will also be evident within the lumen of the tube with each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.|$|E
25|$|Neurally Adjusted <b>Ventilatory</b> Assist (NAVA) is {{adjusted}} by {{a computer}} (servo) and is similar to ATC but with more complex requirements for implementation.|$|E
25|$|Inadequate <b>ventilatory</b> {{response}} to exertion was {{indicated by the}} fact that, despite resting values in the normal range, PetCO2 rose markedly with exertion even when the divers breathed air {{at a depth of}} only a few feet.|$|E
25|$|Within each <b>ventilatory</b> pattern {{there are}} several {{variations}} that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a “zone of comfort” (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one <b>ventilatory</b> pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all {{the parameters of the}} pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the <b>ventilatory</b> pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the <b>ventilatory</b> pattern).Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as fuzzy logic, rule based expert systems, and artificial neural networks.|$|E
25|$|Between March 31 and April 6, 1977, 59 {{individuals}} developed type B botulism. All ill persons {{had eaten}} {{at the same}} Mexican restaurant in Pontiac, Michigan and all had consumed a hot sauce made with improperly home-canned jalapeño peppers, either by adding it to their food, or by eating a nacho that had had hot sauce used in its preparation. The full clinical spectrum (mild symptomatology with neurologic findings through life-threatening <b>ventilatory</b> paralysis) of type B botulism was documented.|$|E
25|$|Insects {{were once}} {{believed}} to exchange gases {{with the environment}} continuously by the simple diffusion of gases into the tracheal system. More recently, however, large variation in insect <b>ventilatory</b> patterns have been documented and insect respiration appears to be highly variable. Some small insects do not demonstrate continuous respiratory movements and may lack muscular control of the spiracles. Others, however, utilize muscular contraction of the abdomen along with coordinated spiracle contraction and relaxation to generate cyclical gas exchange patterns and to reduce water loss into the atmosphere. The most extreme form of these patterns is termed discontinuous gas exchange cycles.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam therapy, {{compared}} with other drug therapies, increases risk of death when used for intractable epilepsy {{in an analysis of}} 302 patients. The risk of death from nitrazepam therapy may be greater in younger patients (children below 3.4 years in the study) with intractable epilepsy. In older children (above 3.4 years), the tendency appears to be reversed in this study. Nitrazepam may cause sudden death in children. It can cause swallowing incoordination, high-peaked esophageal peristalsis, bronchospasm, delayed cricopharyngeal relaxation, and severe respiratory distress necessitating <b>ventilatory</b> support in children. Nitrazepam may promote the development of parasympathetic overactivity or vagotonia, leading to potentially fatal respiratory distress in children.|$|E
25|$|The {{respiratory}} system (also respiratory apparatus, <b>ventilatory</b> system) is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants. The {{anatomy and physiology}} that make this happen varies greatly, {{depending on the size}} of the organism, the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. In land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs. Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles, but atria in birds. These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply, thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood. These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways, or hollow tubes, of which the largest is the trachea, which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi. These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the bronchioles. In birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi. It is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration.|$|E
500|$|Air in {{subcutaneous}} tissue does not usually pose a lethal threat; {{small amounts of}} air are reabsorbed by the body. [...] Once the pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum that causes the subcutaneous emphysema is resolved, with or without medical intervention, the subcutaneous emphysema will usually clear. [...] However, spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema can, in rare cases, progress to a life-threatening condition, and subcutaneous emphysema due to mechanical ventilation may induce <b>ventilatory</b> failure.|$|E
500|$|Varanus salvadorii has mammal-like aerobic abilities; this is {{accomplished}} {{by means of a}} positive pressure gular pump in the animal’s throat to assist lung ventilation. [...] The majority of lizards cannot run and breathe at the same time due to Carrier's constraint, but monitor lizards are exceptions to this rule. [...] The development of this <b>ventilatory</b> pump is analogous to the evolution of the diaphragm in mammals, which ventilates the lung independently of locomotion; scientists place V. salvadorii as the species with the highest endurance in this regard. This would suggest the lizard is at an evolutionary midpoint, relying on both forms of breathing.|$|E
500|$|Long-term use of benzodiazepines {{has been}} {{associated}} with long-lasting deficits of memory, and show only partial recovery six months after stopping benzodiazepines. It is unclear whether full recovery occurs after longer periods of abstinence. Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression. Paradoxical excitement occasionally occurs with benzodiazepines, including a worsening of seizures. Children and elderly individuals or those with a history of alcohol abuse and individuals with a history of aggressive behavior or anger are at increased risk of paradoxical effects. Paradoxical reactions are particularly associated with intravenous administration. After nighttime administration of midazolam, residual 'hangover' effects, such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions, may persist into the next day. This may impair the ability of users to drive safely and may increase the risk of falls and hip fractures. Sedation, respiratory depression and hypotension due to a reduction in systematic vascular resistance, and an increase in heart rate can occur. If intravenous midazolam is given too quickly, hypotension may occur. A [...] "midazolam infusion syndrome" [...] may result from high doses, and is characterised by delayed arousal hours to days after discontinuation of midazolam, and may lead to an increase in the length of <b>ventilatory</b> support needed.|$|E

2500|$|There are 5 basic <b>ventilatory</b> patterns: VC-CMV, VC-IMV, PC-CMV, PC-IMV, and PC-CSV. The {{combination}} VC-CSV is {{not possible}} because volume control implies machine cycling and machine cycling makes every breath mandatory, not spontaneous. A sixth pattern, TC-IMV is possible but rare.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characteristic}} pulmonary function {{finding in}} asbestosis is a restrictive <b>ventilatory</b> defect. This manifests as {{a reduction in}} lung volumes, particularly the vital capacity (VC) and total lung capacity (TLC). The TLC may be reduced through alveolar wall thickening; however, {{this is not always}} the case. [...] Large airway function, as reflected by FEV1/FVC, is generally well preserved. [...] In severe cases, the drastic reduction in lung function due to the stiffening of the lungs and reduced TLC may induce right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). In addition to a restrictive defect, asbestosis may produce reduction in diffusion capacity and a low amount of oxygen in the blood of the arteries.|$|E
2500|$|While {{shortness}} of breath is generally caused by disorders of the cardiac or respiratory system, other systems such as [...] neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine, hematologic, and psychiatric may be the cause. DiagnosisPro, an online medical expert system, listed 497 distinct causes in October 2010. The most common cardiovascular causes are acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure while common pulmonary causes include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema and pneumonia. On a pathophysiological basis the causes can be divided into: (1) an increased awareness of normal breathing such as during an anxiety attack, (2) {{an increase in the}} work of breathing and (3) an abnormality in the <b>ventilatory</b> system.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can be used}} as a {{short-term}} measure, for example during an operation or critical illness (often in the setting of an intensive-care unit). It may be used at home or in a nursing or rehabilitation institution if patients have chronic illnesses that require long-term <b>ventilatory</b> assistance. [...] Due to the anatomy of the human pharynx, larynx, and esophagus and the circumstances for which ventilation is needed, additional measures are often required to secure the airway during positive-pressure ventilation in order to allow unimpeded passage of air into the trachea and avoid air passing into the esophagus and stomach. The common method is by insertion of a tube into the trachea: intubation, which provides a clear route for the air. This can be either an endotracheal tube, inserted through the natural openings of mouth or nose, or a tracheostomy inserted through an artificial opening in the neck. In other circumstances simple airway maneuvres, an oropharyngeal airway or laryngeal mask airway may be employed. If the patient is able to protect his/her own airway and non-invasive ventilation or negative-pressure ventilation is used then an airway adjunct may not be needed.|$|E
2500|$|All of {{the above}} {{influences}} of low atmospheric pressures on breathing are accommodated primarily by breathing deeper and faster (hyperpnea). [...] The exact degree of hyperpnea {{is determined by the}} blood gas homeostat, which regulates the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This homeostat prioritizes the regulation of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide over that of oxygen at sea level. That is to say, at sea level the arterial partial pressure of CO2 is maintained at very close to 5.3kPa (or 40mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, {{at the expense of the}} arterial partial pressure of O2, which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective <b>ventilatory</b> response. [...] However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the partial pressure of O2 in the ambient air) falls to below 50-75% of its value at sea level, oxygen homeostasis is given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis. This switch-over occurs at an elevation of about 2500m (or about 8000ft). If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperpnea at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, with a consequent rise in the pH of the arterial plasma. This is one contributor to high altitude sickness. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then hypoxia may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.|$|E
60|$|I {{have already}} {{informed}} {{the reader that}} the cabin of the Tomtit was twelve feet long by eight feet wide--a snug apartment, but scarcely large enough, as it struck me, for five men to sleep in comfortably. Nevertheless, the experiment was to be tried in Clovelly harbour. I bargained, at the outset, for one thing--that the cabin hatch should be kept raised at least a foot all night. This <b>ventilatory</b> condition being complied with, I tumbled into my hammock; Mr. Migott rolled into his; and Sam Dobbs, Dick Dobbs, and Bob Dobbs cast themselves down promiscuously {{on the floor and}} the lockers under us. Out went the lights; and off went my friend and the Brothers Dobbs into the most intolerable concert of snoring {{that it is possible to}} imagine.|$|E

50|$|A {{government}} {{experiment to}} test <b>ventilatory</b> threshold was held between November and December 2004. Subjects included 32 physically active males (age: 22.3; TV: 180.5; TM: 75.5 kg; VO2max: 57.1 mL/kg/min) encountered a continuous test of increasing loads on a treadmill, cardiorespiratory and other variables were observed using ECG (recording of the electrical {{activity of the}} heart) and gas analyzer. During the test, {{subjects were asked to}} point at a scale from 6 to 20 reflecting their feeling of discomfort. The RPE threshold was recorded as constant value of 12-13. Averages of <b>ventilatory</b> and RPE threshold were conveyed by parameters that were monitored and then compared by using t-test for dependent samples. No significant difference was found between mean values of <b>ventilatory</b> and RPE threshold, when they were expressed by parameters such as: speed, load, heart rate, absolute and relative oxygen consumption. The conclusion of this experiment was: the fixed value (12-13) of RPE scale may be used to detect the exercise intensity that corresponds to <b>ventilatory</b> threshold.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>ventilatory</b> effects, peripheral chemoreceptors may influence neuroendocrine responses to exercise that can influence activities other than ventilation. Circulation of the glucose-promoting hormone, glucagon and a neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, is increased in carotid- and aortic-body-enervated dogs, suggesting that peripheral chemoreceptors respond to low glucose levels in and may respond to other neuroendocrine signals in {{addition to}} what is traditionally considered to be their sole role of <b>ventilatory</b> regulation.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} using high {{tidal volume}} (VT) and transpulmonary pressure {{can damage the}} lung, causing ventilator-induced lung injury. Permissive hypercapnia, a <b>ventilatory</b> strategy for acute respiratory failure in which the lungs are ventilated with a low inspiratory volume and pressure, has been accepted progressively in critical care for adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients requiring mechanical ventilation {{and is one of}} the central components of current protective <b>ventilatory</b> strategies.|$|E
50|$|In kinesiology, the <b>ventilatory</b> {{threshold}} (VT1) {{refers to}} the point during exercise at which ventilation starts to increase {{at a faster rate}} than VO2 (V - volume, O2 - oxygen). One's threshold is said to reflect levels of anaerobiosis and lactate accumulation. As the intensity level of the activity being performed increases, breathing becomes faster; more steadily first and then more rapid as the intensity increases. When breathing surpasses normal ventilation rate, one has reached <b>ventilatory</b> threshold. For most people this threshold lies at exercise intensities between 50% and 75% of VO2 max. A major factor affecting one's <b>ventilatory</b> threshold is their maximal ventilation (amount of air entering and exiting lungs). This is dependent on their personal experience with the activity and how physically fit the person is. Comparison studies of more athletic people have shown that your <b>ventilatory</b> threshold occurs at a higher intensity if you are more active or have been training for that exercise; although, in some cases shorter continuous tests can be used because of rapid alterations in ventilation.|$|E
