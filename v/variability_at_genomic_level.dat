40|$|The {{oxytocin}} (OXT) {{is a very}} abundant nonapeptide neurohypophysial hormone {{implicated in}} several physiological aspects including social, sexual and maternal behaviour, induction of parturition and milk ejection. This study reports the first full characterization of the goat and sheep Oxytocin-Neurophysin I gene, their promoters, amino acid sequences and polymorphism detection. Using the genomic DNA as template, we sequenced and compared the whole Oxytocin–Neurophysin I gene plus 958 / 960 nucleotides at the 5 ’ flanking region and 478 / 477 nucleotides at the 3 ’ flanking region, in 56 sheep and 29 goat belonging to different breeds/genetic types reared in Italy, Greece, Germany and South Africa. The sheep and goat OXT gene (EMBL LT 592265, LT 592266) was found to extend over 907 bp, including 510 bp of exonic regions and 397 bp of intronic regions. In both species the gene contains only 3 exons, {{ranging in size from}} 153 bp (exon 1) to 202 bp (exon 2). The comparison of obtained sequences showed a high degree of genetic variability at these loci: 16 and 18 polymorphic sites in goat and sheep with a transition/transversion ratio of 4 and 1, respectively. Some of the observed mutations could be responsible for alteration of gene expression. In sheep the SNP g. 1879 T>A took place inside the polyadenylation site while in goat the g. 959 G>T would involve the CpG–potential first splice donor site. In particular, we report a first possible example of trans-speciﬁc polymorphism at DNA promoter level in goat and sheep (transition g. 438 T>C) and also the first in a hormone coding gene. This SNP was found both in goat and sheep OXT promoters and it alters a putative binding site of the transcription factor Oct- 1. The relative frequency of T allele was of 0. 9196 and 0. 9138 in sheep and goat, respectively. Through an in vitro reporter assays, we have also demonstrated a significant effect of this SNP on the sheep OXT promoter activity, providing an important contribution to the assessment of its effect on gene expression. Comparison of sequences obtained from the sheep and goat with those available in the database for several other mammalian species revealed several interesting examples of species/breed-specific markers located both in coding and non-coding regions. OXT gene polymorphisms will provide new opportunities to select the best dairy goats and sheep for all the physiological processes controlled by this hormone. Furthermore, the observed differences at OXT loci may be utilized as valuable specie/breed specific markers. The lack of <b>variability</b> <b>at</b> <b>genomic</b> <b>level</b> in sheep and goat OXT gene should be attributed mainly to the paucity of the studies carried out, which represents the real limit for the genetic improvement of these species and therefore, further researches in this direction are necessary to estimate the frequencies of the detected mutations in larger sheep and goat populatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) {{continues to}} spread unchecked since its first documentation in 1981. Two decades later, nearly 50 million individuals are living with HIV/AIDS world wide, according to figures released by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) 1. There {{are two types of}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) responsible for this infection/disease. A major proportion of the infection worldwide is caused by the HIV- 1 virus, which was identified in 19832, 3. The type 2 (HIV- 2) virus was first detected in West Africa and is significantly prevalent in those regions, Portugal and India with rare cases reported from western countries, Korea and Philippines 4 - 10. Since, the commencement of the AIDS epidemic two decades ago, HIV- 1 has evolved, differing from one geographical location to another 11.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain new {{insights}} about the relations between phenotypic and genetic variations between different accessions inside the species Crocus sativus L. we carried out a molecular marker analysis by using the AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) and the MS-AFLP (Methyl Sensitive AFLP, susceptible to the different methylation state of cytosines) methodologies. The first approach gives us the possibility to investigate the <b>variability</b> <b>at</b> the <b>genomic</b> <b>level</b> while with the second one we have the possibility to detect <b>variability</b> also <b>at</b> the epigenomic level (the methylation of the cytosine is the main epigenetic modification of the DNA). The two methodologies have been applied on a core collection made of 27 samples belonging to: 1) different accessions of the species C. sativus from different origins; 2) different species belonging to the Crocus series; 3) different wild type species belonging to the Crocus genus. All the samples before the extraction of the DNA have been grown for at least 3 years in the same environmental conditions in Cuenca (Spain). The AFLP analysis detects that between different species there are high genetic variations <b>at</b> the <b>genomic</b> level: the species C. oreocreticus and C. cartwrightianus have the most similar AFLP profile to C. sativus. On the contrary the differences inside the species C. sativus are extremely low, just few not clear variations have been detected that will need further clarifications in future. The MS-AFLP analysis, conversely to AFLP, reveals the presence of high epigenomic variation not only between different species but also between different accessions inside the species C. sativus. It has been detected that the epigenome is variable not only between accessions from different Countries but also between accessions sampled from several locations of the same Country: all the Spain accessions analysed show different epigenomes. These results give rise to {{the hypothesis that the}} epigenetic variations could have an important role in determining the phenotypic differences sometimes observed between saffron accessions. Obviously this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by further experiment...|$|R

The recent transmission and plentiful genome sequences available provided a good opportunity to study the origin and evolution of epitopes on the proteins of human influenza virus. In the present study, the B-cell epitope compositions in the pandemic strains, circulating traditional seasonal strains, swine strains as well as highly virulent avian strain H 5 N 1 were identified with the aid of the Immune Epitope DataBase (IEDB) and were compared <b>at</b> <b>genomic</b> <b>level.</b> A total of 14210 distinct sequences down-loaded from NCBI database were used for analysis. Some epitopes on proteins HA or NA, not conserved in recent seasonal strains, were found in 2009 pandemic strains but existed in the early human strains (1919 - 1935). The pandemic strain shared higher conserved epitopes with “bird flu” virus H 5 N 1 than classic human seasonal strains. The epitopes that could exist at common antigenic regions of HA protein are needed to further identify. The genetic exchanges between human and swine population by transmission was very active but the princepal side of the transmission could be from swine to human.

40|$|Conjugated {{linoleic}} acids are 18 carbones {{fatty acids}} members comprising a consecutive (conjugated) double bonds {{system with a}} various cis/trans geometry sequence, giving rise to at least 16 different isomers.

We evaluated the biological response of human primary adipose tissue cultured adipocytes to that CLA isomer, alone or present in a commercial mixture, using system biology approaches (primarily transcriptomics and metabolomics). We found that CLA changed the biological activity of at least 45 metabolic pathways <b>at</b> the <b>genomic</b> <b>level,</b> which transcriptional activities was associated to a parallelle metabolome adipocyte change (lipidome upmost) (r 2 value transcriptome/ metabolome of 0. 89). In pairwise analysis, it appeared that 6 of these pathways <b>at</b> the <b>genomic</b> <b>level</b> were tightly associated to the metabolomic response, such as apoptosis, interleukine- 6, proteasome, reticulum endoplasmic stress, transcription role of heterochromatine, cell proliferation through EGFR dependent tyrosine kinase, gamma-aminobutyrate receptor.

In conclusion, the implementation of a multi-omic global approach allowed the identification of a set of biological pathways <b>at</b> the <b>genomic</b> <b>level</b> associated to the metabolic balance of CLA-treated adipocytes.

Unexpectedly, a PKS gene was amplified from cultures of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum, a saxitoxin producer, which is not known to produce a polyketide. In each case the presence of a PKS gene was correlated with the presence of bacteria in the cultures as identified by amplification of the bacterial 16 S ribosomal RNA gene.
