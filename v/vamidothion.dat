Real matrix-induced signal suppression or enhancement {{due to the}} ionization process was simulated by using postcolumn introduction experiments. Results were compared with global matrix effects that occur during a routine analysis. Four pesticides were studied: carbendazim, fenuron, thiabendazole, and <b>vamidothion.</b> These compounds have different behaviors in terms of matrix effects. Good correlations were shown, demonstrating that the main matrix effect {{is due to the}} ionization step. Good results were also obtained for the RSD values (< 5 % for routine analysis and < 35 % for postcolumn introduction) ...|$|E
40|$|A method {{based on}} liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) -mass spectrometry (MS) /MS {{was developed for}} sensitive determination {{of a number of}} less gas chromatography (GC) -amenable organophosphorus pesticides (OPs; acephate, methamidophos, monocrotophos, omethoate, oxydemeton-methyl and <b>vamidothion)</b> in cabbage and grapes. For extraction, several solvents were evaluated with respect to the possibility of direct injection, matrix-induced suppression or enhancement of response, and extraction efficiency. Overall, ethyl acetate was the most favourable solvent for extraction, although a solvent switch was required. For some pesticide/matrix combinations, reconstitution of the residue after evaporation required special attention. Extracts were analysed on a C 18 column with polar endcapping. The pesticides were ionised using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation on a tandem mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The final method is straightforward and involves extraction with ethyl acetate and a solvent switch to 0. 1 % acetic acid/water without further cleanup. The method was validated at the 0. 01 and 0. 5 mg/kg level, for both cabbage and grapes. Recoveries were between 80 and 101 % with R. S. D. < 11 % (n= 5). The limit of quantification was 0. 01 mg/kg and limits of detection were between 0. 001 and 0. 004 mg/kg. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|It was {{demonstrated}} that {{four out of}} six of the very polar organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), i. e. acephate, methamidophos, monocrotophos, omethoate, oxydemeton-methyl and <b>vamidothion,</b> could not be extracted from water using commonly available SPE cartridges. In addition, GC analysis on all six compounds {{was found to be}} troublesome due to their polar and thermolabile character. This initiated the development of an alternative highly sensitive and selective method for the determination of the above mentioned very polar OPs in water, based on LC-MS. Large volume (1 ml) water samples were directly injected onto an RP 18 HPLC column with a polar endcapping. The latter was essential for obtaining retention and maintaining column performance under 100 % aqueous conditions during the sampling. The compounds were ionized using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and detected on a tandem mass spectrometer operated in multiple reaction-monitoring mode. The detection limits were in the range of 0. 01 - 0. 03 μg/l. Compared to conventional GC methods, the developed LC-MS procedure is very straightforward, fast and more reliable. This application demonstrates the applicability of LC-MS for analysis of polar OPs in surface, ground and drinking water, as a more favourable alternative to GC. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Abstract: Our {{previously}} reported procedure for analyzing pesticides in aqueous samples involving liquid-solid extraction by graphitzed carbon black (GCB) followed by liquid chromatography was appropriately modified for extending the analysis to very polar pesticides and pesticide metabolites. For this purpose, a 1 -g GCB reversible extraction cartridge was adopted. Pesticide reextraction {{was performed by}} back-flushing the cartridge with a suitable eluant phase. The advantages of back-flush over forward flush desorption are illustrated. On extracting 2 L of drinking water spiked with the pesticides considered, {{the performance of the}} GCB cartridge was compared to that of a 1 -g C 18 bonded silica cartridge as well as to those of discontinuous and continous liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) techniques. The influence of the presence of humic substances in water {{on the quality of the}} analysis of the pesticides considered was assessed. The limits of quantification (5 times the limit of detection) of this method for the pesticides considered by analyzing municipal waters were below 0. 1 mug/L, except for <b>vamidothion</b> and cymoxanil. Quantitative recoveries of even the most polar pesticides were obtained by submitting to the analysis volumes of ground and surface water samples no greater than 1 and 0. 5 L, respectively...|$|E
