40|$|The {{combination}} of the bands of a multiespectral sensor for the simulation of a <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band</b> represents an attractive possibility for {{the handling of the}} data of remote sensing, searching for your improvement. This work presents a methodology for the simulation of the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band</b> of sensor TM Landsat 5 through the linear {{combination of}} the spectral bands that possess spectral overlapping with the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band</b> of reference (<b>panchromatic</b> <b>band</b> of sensor ETM+ Landsat 7). The analysis of the spectral overlapping was made using from the discretization of the spectral curves. For resampling the images in a finer grating than the original grating was used the combined filter of restoration and interpolation. After the processes of restoration and interpolation, the images had been linearly combined for the simulation of the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band,</b> using two different methods. Visual and statistics tests were accomplished to confirm the effectiveness of the methodology. Pages: 4005 - 401...|$|R
50|$|Such band {{combinations}} {{are commonly}} bundled in satellite data sets, for example Landsat 7, which includes six 30 m resolution multispectral bands, a 60 m thermal infrared band plus a 15 m resolution <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band.</b> SPOT, GeoEye and DigitalGlobe commercial data packages also commonly include both lower-resolution multispectral bands {{and a single}} <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band.</b> One of the principal reasons for configuring satellite sensors this way is to keep satellite weight, cost, bandwidth and complexity down. Pan sharpening uses spatial information in the high-resolution grayscale band and color information in the multispectral bands to create a high-resolution color image, essentially increasing {{the resolution of the}} color information in the data set to match that of the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pan-sharpening {{techniques}} {{can result in}} spectral distortions when pan sharpening satellite images {{as a result of}} the nature of the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band.</b> The Landsat <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band</b> for example is not sensitive to blue light. As a result, the spectral characteristics of the raw pansharpened color image may not exactly match those of the corresponding low-resolution RGB image, resulting in altered color tones. This has resulted in the development of many algorithms that attempt to reduce this spectral distortion and to produce visually pleasing images.|$|R

40|$|Extraction of {{individual}} tree crown objects {{in urban areas}} using available VHR space-borne imaging systems remains a challenging image processing task mainly because of two factors: the limited spectral information offered by the sensors and their limited spatial resolution. The spectral information of available VHR satellite sensors {{is not sufficient to}} discriminate tree crowns from other land cover classes such as grassland and shrubs using spectral pixel-based classification techniques. This can be solved by using a contextual classification approach, while the limitation of spatial resolution can be reduced by using Super resolution mapping (SRM). In this paper we extend the contextual Markov Random Field (MRF) based SRM method developed earlier for multispectral images to include the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band</b> with higher spatial resolution. We apply this method for extraction of tree crown objects from Quickbird images, setting the spatial resolution of superresolved map to that of the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band,</b> 0. 6 m. We apply the proposed method for identification of tree crown objects in a residential area in the Netherlands.

40|$|Moving vehicle {{detection}} {{has become}} increasingly important in transportation management and road infrastructure development. State-of-the-art moving vehicle detection techniques require multi-frame images {{or at least a}} stereo pair of aerial photos for moving information extraction.

To find out the moving information of a vehicle, we utilize the unnoticeable time delay between multspectral and <b>panchromatic</b> <b>bands</b> of the QuickBird (or Ikonos) imagery.

40|$|A noise {{characterization}} of the Landsat- 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) instrument was performed {{as part of a}} near-real time performance assessment and health monitoring program. Perl'ormance data for the integrated Landsat- 7 spacecraft and ETM+ were collected before, during, and after the spacecraft thermal vacuum testing program at the Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space (LMMS) facilities in Valley Forge, PA. The Landsat- 7 spacecraft and ETM+ instrument were successfully launched on April 15, 1999. The spacecraft and ETM+ are now nearing the end of the on orbit engineering checkout phase, and Landsat- 7 is expected to be declared operational on or about July 15, 1999. A preliminary post-launch noise characterization was performed and compared with the pre-launch characterization. In general the overall noise levels in the ETM+ are at or below the specification levels. Coherent noise is seen in most bands, but is only operationally significant when imaging in (he <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band</b> (band 8). This coherent noise has an amplitude as high as approximately 3 DN (peak-to-peak, high gain) at the Nyquist rate of 104 kHz, and causes the noise levels in <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band</b> images at times to exceed the total noise specification by up to approximately 10 %. However, this 104 kHz noise is now much weaker than it was prior to the successful repair of the ETM+ power supplies that was completed in May 1998. Weak and stable coherent noise at approximately 5 kHz is seen in all bands in the prime focal plane (bands 1 - 4 and 8) with the prime (side A) electronics. Very strong coherent noise at approximately 20 kHz is seen in a few detectors of bands 1 and 8, but this noise is almost entirely in the turn-around region between scans when the ETM+ is not imaging the Earth. Strong coherent noise was seen in 2 detectors of band 5 during some of the pre-launch testing; however, this noise seems to be temperature dependent, and has not been seen in the current on orbit environment. Strong 91 kHz coherent noise was observed in the redundant (side B) <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band</b> data after the completion of spacecraft thermal vacuum testing.

In order to benefit from both sources of information, several pansharpening methods have been developed to produce a multispectral image at the spatial resolution of the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} suggest a novel approach to the pansharpening problem within a Bayesian framework. This Bayesian data fusion (BDF) method relies on statistical relationships between the various spectral <b>bands</b> and the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>band</b> without suffering from restricting modeling hypotheses. Furthermore, it allows the user to weight the spectral and panchromatic information with respect to either visual or quantitative criteria, which leads to adaptable results according to users' needs and study areas. The performance of this approach was compared to existing methods based on markedly different subset images from very high spatial resolution IKONOS images. Results showed that BDF yielded the highest spectral consistency. Furthermore, small details were adequately added to the pansharpened images with little artifact as compared to those created using wavelet-based methods. Finally, the method was fast and easy to implement owing to its straightforward formulation. As it does not have any intrinsic limitations on the type of data to be processed or the number of bands to be merged, it also appears to be very promising for. optical/SAR or hyperspectral image fusion...|$|R
