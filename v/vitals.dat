5|$|The armor {{protection}} of the Gangut-class ships had to protect against two different threats as revealed during the Russo-Japanese War. Japanese high explosive shells had riddled the unarmored portions of Russian ships and had even sunk several ships with their heavy armor belts unpenetrated. The Russians decided that the entire {{side of the ship}} needed to be armored, even though this would limit the thickness of the main belt. They developed a system where the outer armor would break up or at least slow shells down and burst immediately behind the outer armor and an inboard armor bulkhead would stop the splinters and shell fragments from reaching the <b>vitals.</b> This system likely would have worked against the British armor-piercing shells that performed so badly at the Battle of Jutland, but would have failed against the improved shells introduced afterwards with their redesigned fuses. A related weakness was that the turrets and conning towers lacked the inboard splinter bulkhead even though they used armor thickness roughly equivalent to that of the main belt.|$|E

40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} reasons for inadequate documentation of <b>vital</b> signs in an electronic health record. BACKGROUND: Monitoring <b>vital</b> signs is crucial to detecting and responding to patient deterioration. The ways in which <b>vital</b> signs are documented in electronic health records have received limited attention in the research literature. A previous study revealed that <b>vital</b> signs in an electronic health record were incomplete and inconsistent. DESIGN: Qualitative study. METHODS: Qualitative study. Data were collected by observing (68 hours) and interviewing nurses (n= 11) and doctors (n= 3), and analysed by thematic analysis to examine processes for measuring, documenting and retrieving <b>vital</b> signs in four clinical settings in a 353 -bed hospital. RESULTS: We identified two central reasons for inadequate <b>vital</b> sign documentation. First, there was an absence of firm guidelines for observing patients' <b>vital</b> signs, resulting in inconsistencies in the ways <b>vital</b> signs were recorded. Second, there was a lack of adequate facilities in the electronic health record for recording <b>vital</b> signs. This led to poor presentation of <b>vital</b> signs in the electronic health record and to staff creating paper 'workarounds'. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated inadequate routines and poor facilities for <b>vital</b> sign documentation in an electronic health record, and makes an important contribution to knowledge by identifying problems and barriers that may occur. Further, it has demonstrated the need for improved facilities for electronic documentation of <b>vital</b> signs. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: patient safety may have been compromised because of poor presentation of <b>vital</b> signs. Thus, our results emphasised the need for standardised routines for monitoring patients. In addition, designers should consult the clinical end-users in order to optimise facilities for electronic documentation of <b>vital</b> signs. This could have a positive impact on clinical practice and thus improve patient safety...|$|R

Os níveis de adição de <b>vital</b> glúten foram de 10, 15, 17, 5, 20 e 30 % para a farinha de arroz e de 10, 20 e 30 % para a farinha de aveia. Ao amido de trigo, extraído da farinha de trigo utilizada como padrão, foi adicionado <b>vital</b> glúten de forma a reconstituir o teor de glúten {{original}} da farinha. Os melhores resultados do teste de panificação foram obtidos com 17, 5 % de <b>vital</b> glúten na farinha de arroz e 20 % de <b>vital</b> glúten na farinha de aveia. Foram obtidos pães com volumes específicos inferiores aos de trigo (2, 67 cm³/g para <b>vital</b> glúten + farinha de arroz, 3, 07 cm³/g para <b>vital</b> glúten + farinha de aveia e 4, 14 cm³/g para <b>vital</b> glúten + amido de trigo contra 5, 15 cm³/g para os de farinha de trigo). As melhores misturas foram analisadas quanto às suas características reológicas e comparadas com a farinha de trigo original. A mistura de amido de trigo e <b>vital</b> glúten apresentou características farinográficas extensográficas inferiores à farinha de trigo e deu origem a pães de menor volume e com estrutura compacta. No geral, a adição de <b>vital</b> glúten propiciou a obtenção de pães com características aceitáveis, embora inferiores às do pão de farinha de trigo. As características dos pães contendo <b>vital</b> glúten foram: pouca simetria e quebra praticamente inexistente.

The breads obtained showed lower volume values than those made of wheat flour (2. 67 cm³/g for <b>vital</b> gluten+rice flour, 3. 07 cm³/g for <b>vital</b> gluten+oat flour and 4. 14 cm³/g for <b>vital</b> gluten+wheat starch and 5. 15 cm³/g for standard wheat flour). The rheological characteristics of the best blends were analyzed and compared to the standard wheat flour. The blend of <b>vital</b> gluten and flour starch showed inferior rheological characteristics than the original wheat flour. Also, their breads showed lower volume and compact structure. In general, breads with acceptable characteristics were obtained with the addition of <b>vital</b> gluten to rice flour, oat flour and wheat starch although these characteristics were inferior to those from the breads produced with the original wheat flour.
