Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to <b>ventilate</b> the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy.

5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively <b>ventilate</b> their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E

5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical ventilation. Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, such measures can also increase leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the sutures in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the lowest possible airway pressures that still maintain oxygenation are typically used. Mechanical ventilation can also cause pulmonary barotrauma when high pressure is required to <b>ventilate</b> the lungs. Techniques such as pulmonary toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve pulmonary compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of double-lumen endo-bronchial tubes that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These tubes are typically coaxial, with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1–2cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker. These tubes enable one to <b>ventilate</b> both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during thoracic surgery, as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the thoracic cavity.|$|E
5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not <b>ventilate</b> their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the body fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E

When indoor PM 2. 5 concentration was more than 90 ug/m 3, and outdoor PM 2. 5 concentration was less than 300 ug/m 3 after <b>ventilated</b> window operating for an hour, indoor PM 2. 5 concentration decreased for 9 - 16 %, {{it is appropriate to}} operating the <b>ventilated</b> window, but it was still 0. 18 - 0. 27 times more than the secondary standard.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model of subtropical mode water is presented, based on <b>ventilated</b> thermocline theory and on numerical solutions of a planetary geostrophic basin model. In <b>ventilated</b> thermocline theory, the western pool is a region bounded {{on the east}} by subsurface streamlines that outcrop at {{the western edge of}} the interior, and in which additional dynamical assumptions are necessary to complete the solution. Solutions for the western pool were originally obtained under the assumption that the potential vorticity of the subsurface layer was homogenized. In the present theory, it is instead assumed that all of the water in the pool region is <b>ventilated</b> and, therefore, that all the Sverdrup transport is carried in the uppermost, outcropping layer. The result is the formation of a deep, vertically homogeneous, fluid layer in the northwest corner of the subtropical gyre that extends from the surface to the base of the <b>ventilated</b> thermocline. This <b>ventilated</b> pool is an analog of the observed subtropical mode waters. The pool also has the interesting properties that it determines its own boundaries and affects the global potential vorticity–pressure relationship.
