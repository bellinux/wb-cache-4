5|$|Despite {{the desire}} of silver delegates to {{nominate}} a candidate who shared their beliefs, and although several states instructed their delegates {{to vote for a}} specific candidate, there was no overwhelming favorite for the nomination going into the convention. With a two-thirds <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delegates needed to nominate, almost every silver delegate would have to vote for the same candidate to assure success, though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate's chances.|$|E

5|$|In the US Senate, however, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration.

Virtually nothing {{was left of the}} original proposal, and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate in the first place was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E

5|$|After seeing Toulmin's {{letters of}} {{recommendation}} from Jefferson and Madison, {{the board of}} trustees of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University) in Lexington, Kentucky, elected him president of the seminary in February 1794. He was the first president of the seminary who was not a Presbyterian, and his election was effected when the Baptist and more liberal members of the board united against the more conservative Presbyterian members. His Unitarian views offended many of the conservative board members, and at their insistence, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation requiring a unanimous <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board of regents to re-elect the seminary's president.

Other delegatesincluding future Bill of Rights drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected.

5|$|Before the 2006 election, Hastert {{expressed}} his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained {{control of the}} House.
