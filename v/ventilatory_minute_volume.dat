Intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of dermorphin (3 nmol/rat) decreased respiration rate and relative <b>ventilatory</b> <b>minute</b> <b>volume</b> maximally by 38 % and 50 % of baseline respectively. SK&F 86466 dose-dependently reversed the dermorphin-induced depression of ventilatory parameters, while SK&F 86466 exerted no effect on dermorphin-induced analgesia or depression of locomotor activity due to catalepsia.

50|$|<b>Ventilatory</b> rate (<b>minute</b> <b>volume)</b> is tightly {{controlled}} and determined primarily by {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide as determined by metabolic rate. Blood levels of oxygen become important in hypoxia. These levels are sensed by blood gas chemoreceptors {{on the surface of}} the medulla oblongata for pH, and the carotid and aortic bodies for oxygen and carbon dioxide. Afferent neurons from the carotid bodies and aortic bodies are via the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and the vagus nerve (CN X), respectively.|$|R
40|$|Cardiorespiratory and {{metabolic}} {{data were}} collected in 36 septic patients and 80 patients critically ill after nonseptic general surgery or trauma. Septic patients, particularly nonsurviving septics, showed early and sustained increases in metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, cardiac work, and <b>minute</b> <b>ventilatory</b> <b>volume.</b> They had lower levels of respiratory quotient and total peripheral resistance than nonseptic patients. High cardiac work was related to increasing oxygen transport. Both increases in metabolic utilization with high CO 2 production, and abnormal increases in VD/VT appeared responsible for the higher <b>minute</b> <b>ventilatory</b> <b>volumes.</b> Respiratory quotient was negatively related to metabolic rate; this relation was modulated by the rate of caloric intake and, in nonseptic patients, was also influenced by the hemodynamic state. These data suggest that poor prognosis in sepsis is characterized by an early sustained stress response with more severe abnormalities in cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory function than {{is seen in the}} nonseptic stress response.

40|$|The circulatory and {{respiratory}} responses to five levels of treadmill exercise were recorded for 75 normal males divided equally {{in the age}} groups 20 to 29, 30 to 39, and 40 to 49 years. Parameters studied included heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, intra-arterial blood pressure, <b>minute</b> <b>ventilatory</b> <b>volume,</b> oxygen uptake, and carbon dioxide elimination. Values for peripheral vascular resistance, left ventricular work, and stroke work indices were calculated. Intergroup and intragroup differences were analyzed by modified covariance technique using oxygen uptake per square meter of body surface area as the concomitant variable reflecting a specific midrange work level. Significant differences were observed between groups in cardiac output, stroke volume, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure as well as pressure-related variables with regard to absolute values and trend over the exercise spectrum. The results indicate that normal untrained males in {{the fourth and fifth}} decades of life react to moderate and heavy upright exercise with statistically significant systemic pressure elevations as compared to 20 -year-olds. A tendency toward initially high cardiac output and stroke volume during light exercise was observed in the older men. Relatively smal...|$|R

50|$|Respiratory <b>minute</b> <b>volume</b> (or <b>minute</b> {{ventilation}} or <b>minute</b> <b>volume)</b> is {{the volume}} of gas inhaled (inhaled <b>minute</b> <b>volume)</b> or exhaled (exhaled <b>minute</b> <b>volume)</b> from a person's lungs per minute.

30|$|An {{attentive}} {{observer of}} Fig.  3 and Fig.  4 will notice that AVM 2, which optimizes by minimizing inspiratory power, {{does not always}} have the lowest inspiratory power. On the other hand, MFV, which optimizes by minimizing inspiratory pressure, does not always have the smallest tidal pressure. These findings {{can be explained by}} the mismatch of dead space VD. For ASV and AVM 2, the calculation of the optimal frequencies is based on VD-A and not on VD-E. Therefore, if VD-A is significantly lower than VD-E, the Enghoff alveolar <b>minute</b> <b>volume</b> is underestimated. To get the same Enghoff alveolar <b>minute</b> <b>volume,</b> we increased the alveolar <b>minute</b> <b>volume</b> until the desired Enghoff alveolar <b>minute</b> <b>volume</b> was reached (resulting in the same simulated PaCO 2 level). Hence, the calculation for the optimal frequencies for ASV, AVM 2, and MFV cannot be done at the same alveolar <b>minute</b> <b>volume</b> to reach the same Enghoff alveolar <b>minute</b> <b>volume.</b> If VD-E is used for the optimal frequency calculation of ASV and AVM 2, this mismatch will not occur, and AVM 2 will have the lowest inspiratory power compared to ASV and MFV.|$|R
