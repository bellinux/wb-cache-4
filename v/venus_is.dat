5|$|A solar transit of <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> an {{extremely}} rare event, {{and the last}} solar transit of the planet before 2004 was in 1882. The most recent solar transit was in 2012; the next one will not occur until 2117.|$|E
5|$|<b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} planet from the Sun, {{orbiting}} it every 224.7 Earth days. It has the longest rotation period (243 days) of any {{planet in the}} Solar System and rotates {{in the opposite direction}} to most other planets. It has no natural satellites. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6 – bright enough to cast shadows at night and, rarely, {{visible to the naked eye}} in broad daylight. Orbiting within Earth's orbit, <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> an inferior planet and never appears to venture far from the Sun; its maximum angular distance from the Sun (elongation) is 47.8°.|$|E
50|$|<b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> a Swedish frigate, {{designed}} by Fredrik Henrik af Chapman. <b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> {{captured by the}} Russians in 1789 in Oslofjord. The frigate retained the same name in Imperial Russian service until 1807, when she was sold to the Kingdom of Naples.|$|R
50|$|<b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> {{appointed}} {{assistant manager}} of Middlesbrough on 26 October 2010, working again with Mowbray. After Mowbray was sacked by Middlesbrough in October 2013, <b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> made caretaker manager. Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson commented that <b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> on the shortlist of candidates {{to be the}} next permanent manager. On 25 October he led Middlesbrough to a 4-0 win over Doncaster Rovers. Mark Venus' tenure as caretaker manager came to an end on 13 November when Aitor Karanka was appointed as the new Middlesbrough head coach.|$|R
5|$|The first vortex on <b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} {{at the north}} pole by the Pioneer Venus mission in 1978. A discovery of the second large 'double-eyed' vortex {{at the south pole}} of <b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> made in the summer of 2006 by Venus Express, which came with no surprise.|$|R
5|$|Idunn Mons, a mons of {{the planet}} <b>Venus,</b> <b>is</b> named after Iðunn. The {{publication}} of the United States-based Germanic neopagan group The Troth (Idunna, edited by Diana L. Paxson) derives its name {{from that of the}} goddess. The Swedish magazine Idun was named after the goddess; she appears with her basket of apples on its banner.|$|E
5|$|In principle, the {{simultaneous}} occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit {{of a planet}} is possible. But these events are extremely rare because of their short durations. The next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit of Mercury will be on July 5, 6757, and a Solar eclipse and a transit of <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> expected on April 5, 15232.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{symbol for}} <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> {{the same as}} that used in biology for the female sex: a circle with a small cross beneath. The Venus symbol also {{represents}} femininity, and in Western alchemy stood for the metal copper. Polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity, and the symbol for Venus has sometimes been understood to stand for the mirror of the goddess.|$|E
50|$|Double <b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} by Salt Publishing in 2003.|$|R
40|$|Examples of fold-and-thrust belts from {{a variety}} of tectonic {{settings}} on <b>Venus</b> <b>are</b> introduced. Predictions for the mechanics of fold-and-thrust belts on <b>Venus</b> <b>are</b> examined on the basis of wedge theory, rock mechanics data, and currently known conditions on Venus. The theoretical predictions are then compared with new Magellan data...|$|R
50|$|Until the mid 20th century, {{the surface}} {{environment}} of <b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> {{believed to be}} similar to Earth, and hence it was widely believed that Venus could harbor life.In 1870, the British astronomer Richard Proctor said the existence of life on <b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> impossible near its equator, but possible near its poles.|$|R
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} of <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide. The amount of nitrogen {{in the atmosphere}} is relatively small compared {{to the amount of}} carbon dioxide, but because the atmosphere is so much thicker than that on Earth, its total nitrogen content is roughly four times higher than Earth's, even though on Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The pentagram of <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> {{the path}} that Venus makes as {{observed}} from Earth. Successive inferior conjunctions of Venus repeat very near a 13:8 orbital resonance (Earth orbits 8 times for every 13 orbits of Venus), shifting 144° upon sequential inferior conjunctions. The resonance 13:8 ratio is approximate. 8/13 is approximately 0.615385 while Venus orbits the Sun in 0.615187 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{troposphere}} on Venus contains 99% of {{the atmosphere}} by mass. Ninety percent {{of the atmosphere}} of <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> within 28km of the surface; by comparison, 90% of the atmosphere of Earth is within 10km of the surface. At a height of 50km the atmospheric pressure is approximately equal to that at the surface of Earth. On the night side of Venus clouds can still be found at 80km above the surface.|$|E
50|$|The work is Straub's third {{novel and}} his second {{published}} novel, as Under <b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> not officially published until 1984. Straub began writing Julia at {{the advice of his}} literary agent after Under <b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> rejected by his publishers, as his agent recommended that he try writing a gothic novel.|$|R

50|$|A sequel, Voyage to <b>Venus</b> <b>was</b> {{proposed}} {{but never}} made.|$|R
5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{depicts the}} Roman goddess of love, beauty and {{fertility}} reclining languidly on her bed, {{her back to}} the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Velázquez's <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus {{because of the presence of}} her son, Cupid.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> {{the only}} {{surviving}} female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively {{by members of}} the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.|$|E
5|$|<b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> known {{not to have}} a {{magnetic}} field. The reason for its absence is not clear, but is probably related to the planet's slow rotation or the lack of convection in the mantle. Venus only has an induced magnetosphere formed by the Sun's magnetic field carried by the solar wind. This process can be understood as the field lines wrapping around an obstacle—Venus in this case. The induced magnetosphere of Venus has a bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause and magnetotail with the current sheet.|$|E

5|$|When the Italian {{physicist}} Galileo Galilei first {{observed the}} planet in the early 17thcentury, he found it showed phases like the Moon, varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> furthest from the Sun in the sky, it shows a half-lit phase, {{and when it is}} closest to the Sun in the sky, it shows as a crescent or full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun, and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the Ptolemaic geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric and centred on Earth.|$|E
5|$|With a few exceptions, {{the farther}} a planet or belt {{is from the}} Sun, the larger the {{distance}} between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For example, <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts {{have been made to}} determine a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the Titius–Bode law), but no such theory has been accepted. The images {{at the beginning of this}} section show the orbits of the various constituents of the Solar System on different scales.|$|E
5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E

5|$|Almost a {{thousand}} impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show {{a range of}} states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> thought to be unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, {{over a period of}} about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E
5|$|Simonovich-Efimova died on 24 February 1948 in Moscow, Soviet Union. Posthumously, she was {{inducted}} into the International Academy of Puppeteers for her innovations in life-sized puppets. The couple are known as the Adam and Eve of Russian puppetry. She left a large legacy, including around 3,000 works, some of which are housed in a memorial workshop at their former home, though art historians mostly ignored her work {{until the end of the}} 20th century. Her works can be seen in the permanent collections of the Russian Museum, Tretyakov Gallery, the Tver Regional Art Gallery, among others. There have been posthumous solo exhibitions of her work in 1959, 1968 and 1975. In 2011, The Museum of Russian Art (TMORA) in Minneapolis, Minnesota included some of her ethnic paintings of women in their native dress. The following year, her 1935 book, Adventures of a Russian Puppet Theatre: Including Its Discoveries in Making and Performing with Hand-Puppets, Rod-Puppets and Shadow-Figures (English version) was reprinted by Martino Publishing. The Efimova crater on <b>Venus</b> <b>is</b> named after Simonovich-Efimova.|$|E
