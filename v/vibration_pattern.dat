50|$|Ultrasonic scalers, {{also known}} as power scalers, are {{effective}} in removing calculus, stain, and plaque. These scalers are also useful for root planing, curettage, and surgical debridement. Not only is tenacious calculus and stain removed more effectively with ultrasonic scalers than with hand instrumentation alone, {{it is evident that}} the most satisfactory clinical results are when ultrasonics are used in adjunct to hand instrumentation. There are two types of ultrasonic scalers; piezoelectric and magnetostrictive. Oscillating material in both of these handpieces cause the tip of the scaler to vibrate at high speeds, between 18,000 and 50,000 Hz. The tip of each scaler uses a different <b>vibration</b> <b>pattern</b> for removal of calculus. The magnetostrictive power scaler vibration is elliptical, activating all sides of the tip, whereas the piezoelectric vibration is linear and is more active on {{the two sides of the}} tip.|$|E

40|$|Complex {{vibration}} modes, {{which can}} be characterised by the superposition of standing and travelling bending waves, occur for instance in structures with inhomogeneous damping distribution. The existence of complex structural modes {{raises the question of}} their influence on sound radiation properties. In this paper an analytical model of a simply supported rectangular plate is introduced. It allows a quick calculation of complex <b>vibration</b> <b>patterns</b> with different properties, avoiding time consuming and sometimes unstable damped modal analysis in finite-element-software. Using this model it is possible to generate <b>vibration</b> <b>patterns</b> with varying level and spatial distribution of travelling waves as well as different symmetry of amplitude distributions, in order to reveal the important influence factors on sound radiation. Despite the fact that the analytical model generates idealised <b>vibration</b> <b>patterns,</b> the presented consideraton significantly improves phenomenological understanding of acoustic effects in complex vibration modes. The accuracy of the presented model is validated by results of finite element modal analysis and is evaluated in terms of resulting amplitude and phase distributions of the vibrating surface. The results of both suggested approaches are compared using modal radiation efficiencies, spatial distributions of far field acoustic intensity and sound field directivity. Some additional conclusions are made using the analytical model concerning important acoustic metrics of structural <b>vibration</b> <b>patterns.</b> It is shown, that vibration shapes of even order are very sensitive to the presence of travelling waves regarding their radiation capability and character of sound pressure field...|$|R

The short and long signals correspond to 200 ms and 600 ms, respectively.

LDVs enablelaser-based non-contact measurement of the vibration velocity anddisplacement of a certain point on a vibrating object, and scanningLDVs permit multipoint measurements.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} analyzing the vibration signals of rotating machines and diagnoses preventive maintenance requirements using Vibration Signature Analysis Technique. The concept of Vibration Signature Analysis of Rotating Machines lies {{on the fact that}} all rotating machines in good condition have a fairly stable <b>vibration</b> <b>pattern,</b> which can be considered its 'Signature'. Under any anomalous condition of working of such machines, the <b>vibration</b> <b>pattern</b> gets changed. The amount of variation can be detected and the nature of anomalies can be analyzed to get an idea about the malfunctioning of the rotating machine. In order to develop the technique to be applied, it is proposed to simulate the vibration signals of a rotating machines using MATLAB to store the signature of rotating machines under healthy conditions. Deformation can now be introduced in the signature or can be acquired from other sources. Such deformed signals are to be processed in order to know the type of defect the rotating parts of the machine is suffering from. Based on the type of defect, preventive maintenance schedule can be proposed. This paper also aims at overcoming the limitations of traditional Vibration Signature Analysis techniques...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{detonation}} (knocking) {{in the internal}} combuction engines, especially in the Otto (petrol) engine, that makes some damages, low fuel economy and performance. Until now, the detonation problem has not been solved completely. In this paper, the problem had been studied to discover the new method, how to reject detonation without any changes of engine structure, easy to install and can be activate immediately. The detonation phenomenon have been explained by three theory, that are auto ignition theory, detonation theory and flame vibration, that make noise, detonation (knocking) and damages of some equipments. The detonation can be cause by many things, such as high compression ratio, low grade of fuel, bad combustion camber, low turbulence, large spark advance (timing). For the conventional ignition system, a governor and a vacuum advancer control the ignition timing. It is reliable mechanism, but can not work properly at all conditions. Most of them make detonation occur at low speed and low endurance of the contact breaker. The last technology, electronically device with detonation sensor replace the conventional system. Combination ignition system, the new system, integration of conventional and electronically system, can control the detonation, by making correction of the spark advance (ignition timing) automatically in all condition of speed and load (throttle), using fuzzy logic reasoning (calculation) in the microcontroller. This research also tries to detect detonation by using the <b>vibration</b> <b>pattern</b> {{with the hope of}} detonation detection by this method will be more stable and reliable. Detonation detection with machine vibration recordings was be done by measuring its intensity, but this often happens is unstable.
