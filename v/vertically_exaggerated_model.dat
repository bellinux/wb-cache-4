40|$|The {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to analyze the}} effectiveness of devices for artificially destratifying lakes. A criterion for the effectiveness of mixing was selected. This criterion was applied {{to a number of}} variations of mechanical mixing devices in an attempt to indicate trends in optimization of designs. Experiments were performed in a <b>vertically</b> <b>exaggerated</b> scale <b>model</b> of Ham's Lake. Destratification was accomplished by a jet of water from two different sizes of propellers in different configurations (shrouded, skirted, and free) miXing the top water with the bottom water. Data taken from the experiments included density profiles as a function of time. The data obtained were analyzed determining the progression of the stability index with time. Adequate simulation of the prototype destratification experi-ments of Steichen (10) was achieved with the present model. The appropriate non-dimensional parameters are the overall Richardson number J • g~pH/pU 2. and a characteristic time obtained from the volume of the lake divided by the volume flow rate of the pump. AnalyZing the effects of varying propeller size and geometrical con-straints on mixing efficiency revealed the following facts: Operation of a pump with a shrouded propeller resulted in a shorter destrati-fication time and higher destratification efficiency than an unshrouded propeller when both pumps had the same power consumption rates. For the pump system operating with an unshrouded propeller increasing propeller size resulted in increased destratification efficiency over the shaft input power range studies.

Potential for an interaction between these groups exists; however, their distributions are rarely determined in tandem. Here we have examined the vertical distribution of AOA and anammox bacteria through the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), one of the most intense and <b>vertically</b> <b>exaggerated</b> OMZs in the global ocean, using a unique combination of intact polar lipid (IPL) and gene-based analyses, at both DNA and RNA levels. To screen for AOA-specific IPLs, we developed a high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry method targeting hexose-phosphohexose (HPH) crenarchaeol, a common IPL of cultivated AOA. HPH-crenarchaeol showed highest abundances in the upper OMZ transition zone at oxygen concentrations of ca. 5 mu M, coincident with peaks in both thaumarchaeotal 16 S rDNA and amoA gene abundances and gene expression. In contrast, concentrations of anammox-specific IPLs peaked within the core of the OMZ at 600 m, where oxygen reached the lowest concentrations, and coincided with peak anammox 16 S rDNA and the hydrazine oxidoreductase (hzo) gene abundances and their expression. Taken together, the data reveal a unique depth distribution of abundant AOA and anammox bacteria and the segregation of their respective niches by > 400 m, suggesting no direct coupling of their metabolisms at the time and site of sampling in the Arabian Sea OMZ.

This yields a color scheme approximately the same as those seen by the human eye. The other two scenes use data from the infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum to maximize the range of wavelengths shown.

40|$|Vol. 14, No. 8 Abstract: 3 D object fusion {{is a new}} {{geometric}} modeling tool. It provides an easy and fast way to generate novel models from two or more existing geometric models by using 3 D cutting and pasting operations. A new montage mesh fusion method is proposed based on local harmonic mapping in this paper. The approach first extracts mesh regions to be fused by approximating offset curves on meshes, then parameterizes the regions using harmonic mapping with holes, and the smooth mesh fusion is finally obtained by topology combination and fusion control. Compared with the global harmonic mapping method, this approach has the following advantages. (1) The efficiency of the algorithm is greatly improved. The computational cost involved no longer increases exponentially {{with the number of}} vertices of the meshes to be fused. (2) The algorithm is robust as the ambiguity in graph structure combination is alleviated. (3) The detail of the cut mesh is fully kept. (4) The topology restriction of the original algorithm is eliminated.

However, it is not well understood how the approximation applies to the discrete stochastic case or how it extends to spatially inhomogeneous systems. We study the behaviour of the discrete stochastic Michaelis-Menten approximation as a function of system size and show that significant errors can occur for small volumes, in comparison with a corresponding mass action system. We then explore some consequences of these results for quantitative modelling. One consequence is that fluctuation-induced sensitivity, or stochastic focusing, can become highly <b>exaggerated</b> in <b>models</b> that make use of Michaelis-Menten kinetics even if the approximations are excellent in a deterministic model. Another consequence is that spatial stochastic simulations based on the reaction-diffusion master equation can become highly inaccurate if the model contains Michaelis-Menten terms. ...|$|R

While many currently available virtual globes {{have proven to}} be quite useful for remote geologic investigation, they were never designed for the purpose of serving as virtual geologic instruments. Their shortcomings have become more obvious as earth scientists struggle to visualize recently released digital elevation models (DEMs) of very high spatial resolution (0. 5 - 1 m 2 per sample) and extent (> 2000 km 2). We developed Crusta as an alternative virtual globe to allow users to easily visualize their custom imagery and more importantly their custom topography. Crusta represents the globe as a thirty-sided polyhedron to avoid distortion of the display, particularly the singularities at the poles that characterize projections that use a latitude-longitude grid as the basis for their topography models. The Crusta polyhedron defines thirty "base patches, " each of which is a four-sided region.

40|$|Abstract A {{climatology}} of {{the stratosphere}} is determined from a 20 -year integration with the stratospheric {{version of the}} Atmospheric General Circulation Model LMDz. The model has an upper boundary at near 65 km, uses a Doppler spread non-orographic gravity waves drag parameterization and a subgrid-scale orography parameterization. It also has a Rayleigh damping layer for resolved waves only (not the zonal mean flow) over the top 5 km. This paper describes the basic features of the model and some aspects of its radiative-dynamical climatology. Standard first order diagnostics are pre-sented but some emphasis {{is given to the}} model’s ability to reproduce the low frequency variability of the stratosphere in the winter northern hemisphere. In this model, the stratospheric variability is dominated at each altitudes by patterns which have some similarities with the arctic oscillation (AO). For those patterns, the signal sometimes descends from the stratosphere to the tro-posphere. In an experiment where the parameterized orographic gravity waves that reach the stratosphere are <b>exaggerated,</b> the <b>model</b> stratosphere in the NH presents much less variability. Although the stratospheric vari-ability is still dominated by patterns that resemble to the AO, the downward influence of the stratosphere along these patterns is near entirely lost. In the same time, the persistence of the surface AO decreases, which is con-sistent with the picture that this persistence is linked to the descent of the AO signal from the stratosphere to the troposphere. A comparison between the stratospheric version of the model, and its routinely used tropospheric version is also done. It shows that the introduction of the stratosphere in a model that already has a realistic AO persistence can lead to overestimate the actual influence of the stratospheric dynamics onto the surface AO. Although this result is certainly model dependent, it suggests that the introduction of the stratosphere in a GCM also call for a new adjustment of the model parameters that affect the tropospheric variability...|$|R
