5|$|When the war ended, Holt's planned {{expansion}} to {{meet the}} military's needs was no longer needed. The company was left in a difficult situation. The types of tractors needed by the military were <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> farmers needed. Their situation was worsened as artillery tractors were brought back from Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt's unsold inventory of military tractors. The company moved to focus less on agricultural machinery and more on producing road-building equipment. To keep the company afloat, they borrowed heavily.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court has {{eventually}} adopted {{some elements}} of Harlan's approach, holding that only some Bill of Rights guarantees were applicable against the states—the doctrine known as selective incorporation. However, under Chief Justice Earl Warren during the 1960s, {{an increasing number of}} rights were deemed sufficiently fundamental for incorporation (Harlan regularly dissented from these rulings). Hence, the majority of provisions from the Bill of Rights have been extended to the states; the exceptions are the Third Amendment, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Seventh Amendment, the excessive bail provision of the Eighth Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, and the Tenth Amendment. Thus, although the Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan's general reasoning, the end result of its jurisprudence is <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> Harlan advocated.|$|E

25|$|The {{architecture}} of Eanna in period III was <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> had preceded it.

This period corresponds to Early Dynastic Sumer c 2900BC, {{a time of great}} social upheaval when the dominance of Uruk was eclipsed by competing city-states. The fortress-like {{architecture of}} this time is a reflection of that turmoil. The temple of Inanna continued functioning during this time in a new form and under a new name, 'The House of Inanna in Uruk' (Sumerian: e2-dinanna unuki-ga). The location of this structure is currently unknown.|$|E

His feeling of disenchantment remained until the Munich Crisis in 1938, when he decided that war was inevitable.

25|$|However, since 2001 {{the civil}} society in the three {{southern}} Thai provinces has experienced a widespread imposition of legalistic Salafi norms and the reality {{on the ground is}} today <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> it was in former southern Thailand. Salafism has heavily eroded Patani cultural identity and current insurgent groups have extreme religious goals, such as an Islamic Caliphate, to the detriment of Patani nationalism. Although some of the present-day insurgents are very likely former PULO members, it is still unclear whether they fight for PULO's cause and it is likely that many may have become part of the more active and religious organisations that have overtaken PULO. In recent years PULO's leadership has largely lost control over its insurgents and has a very limited overall degree of influence over the insurgency in southern Thailand.|$|E
25|$|In England, by the 1890s, {{a long-standing}} Rugby Football Union ban on {{professional}} players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were {{working class and}} {{could not afford to}} take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.|$|E
25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates off-state leakage path, causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges that occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate oxide edge (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttle and satellites are <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> we use on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth's space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying very different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure the safe space journey and also space-walk of astronauts.|$|E

500|$|Nansen's plan {{required}} a small, strong and manoeuvrable ship, powered by sail and an engine, {{capable of carrying}} fuel and provisions for twelve men for five years.

[...] The ship would then drift with the ice towards the pole and eventually reach the sea between Greenland and Spitsbergen. Should the ship founder, a possibility which Nansen thought very unlikely, the party would camp on a floe and allow itself to be carried towards safety.

Influenced by David Beauchard’s Epileptic and David Mazzucchelli’s City of Glass, Alanguilan altered the story's structure to focus on Elmer's son, Jake. Alanguilan also drew on an event from his teenage years, when he found his father's diary and read about the death of Gerry's uncle Dennis. The new format turned the story into one about Alanguilan, his parents, and his [...] "fears of losing them as they get older."

500|$|Series creator Damian Kindler {{conceived}} the pilot in 2001.

A few years later, Kindler asked Amanda Tapping {{to take part in}} the project, and she accepted. Sanctuary originally started as an eight-part bi-weekly web series in 2007, produced by Vancouver-based Stage 3 Media. The producers of the series were looking to expand the series on other mediums, including television. Due to the success of the web series, in January2008, the Sci Fi Channel announced the commissioning of a first season of 13 episodes.

[...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> I would have done myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated." [...] Eno also thinks the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E
