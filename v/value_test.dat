See the examples {{illustrated in the figure}} for spaces that have and have not been partitioned using recursive partitioning, or recursive binary splitting.

40|$|Boundary <b>value</b> <b>testing</b> in the white-box setting tests {{relational}} expressions with boundary values. These relational expressions {{are often}} a part of larger conditional expressions or decisions. It is therefore important, for effective testing that {{the outcome of a}} relational expression independently influences the outcome of the expression or decision in which it is embedded. Extending MC/DC to boundary <b>value</b> <b>testing</b> was proposed in the literature as a technique to achieve this independence. Based on this idea, in this paper we formally define a new coverage criterion - masking boundary value coverage (MBVC). MBVC is an adaptation of masking of conditions to boundary <b>value</b> <b>testing.</b> Mutation based analysis is used to show that test data satisfying MBVC is more effective in detecting relational mutants than test data satisfying BVC. In this paper, we give a formal argument justifying why test data for MBVC is more effective compared to that for BVC in detecting relational mutants. We performed an experiment to evaluate effectiveness and efficiency of MBVC test data relative to that for BVC, in detecting relational mutants. Firstly, mutation adequacy of the test set for MBVC was higher than that for BVC in 56...|$|R

50|$|BBC HD {{began as}} a trial station on 15 May 2006 to test the {{possibility}} and technical practicality of broadcasting programmes in HD. The first programme to be broadcast that was specifically made for HD was natural history programme Planet Earth, which was shown on the 27 May 2006. The trial by 450 businesses and homes was set to last until June 2007, however just before this deadline the BBC Trust began a Public <b>Value</b> <b>Test</b> of the service to determine whether, as the BBC argued, the service was of worth to the general public. As a result, the HD service was extended throughout the testing period which began on 21 May.

50|$|Most lessor {{accounting}} is not substantially changed between ASC 840 and ASC 842. The {{change from}} executory costs to nonlease components, discussed above, applies equally to lessors. Leveraged leasing is discontinued, though leveraged leases entered into before the effective date of ASC 842 {{can continue to}} be accounted for under ASC 840 unless they are modified. The distinction between sales-type and direct financing leases has changed: whereas in ASC 840 the test was whether the fair value of the leased asset {{was different from the}} lessor's cost or carrying amount (if so, the lease is a sales-type lease), in ASC 842, any lessor lease that meets the lessee finance lease tests (based on rents and guaranteed residuals due from the lessee) is a sales-type lease; direct financing treatment applies if the lease is capital only because a third-party residual guarantee causes the present <b>value</b> <b>test</b> to be met.|$|E

50|$|On 28 July 2011, the BBC Trust {{approved}} {{proposals to}} introduce the listing of pay content delivered on-demand via broadband. The trust will allow the BBC to {{continue to play a}} part in Freesat as the plans did not represent a significant change to the approval previously given in 2007.

Under the plans some pay content, such as films, would be added to the Freesat EPG alongside the existing free-to-air content. However, there would be no adult material or live streamed sports coverage. Freesat itself will not supply any of the on demand content, but will allow third parties to do so through its EPG. Some content will also be made available through existing channels using an on-screen prompt that would take viewers to an on demand environment. Pay-TV sales would be handled by a third party, with Freesat operating the conditional access system that would underpin it. The plan is to use the upcoming launch of G2 spec receivers to add support for Digital Rights Management and where technically possible on existing receivers.|$|E

Evidence on the association between fruit and vegetable intake and ovarian cancer risk has not been consistent. We analyzed and pooled the primary data from 12 prospective studies in North America and Europe. Fruit and vegetable intake was measured at baseline in each study using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. To summarize the association between fruit and vegetable intake and ovarian cancer, study-specific relative risks (RR) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model, and then combined using a random-effects model. Among 560, 441 women, 2, 130 cases of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer occurred during a maximum follow-up of 7 to 22 years across studies. Total fruit intake was not associated with ovarian cancer risk-the pooled multivariate RR for the highest versus the lowest quartile of intake was 1. 06 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 0. 92 - 1. 21; P <b>value,</b> <b>test</b> for trend = 0. 73; P <b>value,</b> <b>test</b> for between-studies heterogeneity = 0. 74].
