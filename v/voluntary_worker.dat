While in Penang, she attended Dharma lectures by Venerable Taixu and his disciple, Venerable Cihang, at the Kek Lok Si Temple. Pitt subsequently became one of Cihang's disciples, and studied under him. She was responsible for setting up the Maha Bodhi School in Penang and Singapore (1946), to promote Buddhist education to the young.

Authors: Cecilia Andersson and Elisabet Aronsson Pivac, Department of Health Sciences, Social Care Program – Elderly and disability. Supervisor: Yvonne Johansson Date: 2006 - 05 - 26 The purpose of the research was to visualize the <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> {{thoughts of}} {{their role in the}} voluntary organization, and to understand why they have chosen to be engaged in voluntary work. To recover the answers to our questions we have undertaken an empirically based study using the qualitative method. The data collection comprised of interviews with six <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> from three different municipalities. We found that the <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> take big pride and joy in their engagement and that they have no intention of ending it...|$|R

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. The drastic {{reduction}} of funds allocated annually to public libraries {{has caused a}} serious shortage of financial and other resources. At the same time, various policy documents published in recent years emphasise the importance of public libraries {{for the development of}} South African society as a whole. Public libraries will therefore have to adapt and extend their services to cater for the needs of the communities they serve and to take their rightful place in the development of these communities. Using members of the local communities as <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> is a proposed {{solution to the problem of}} providing extended services and remaining within budgetary limits. Research on designing an effective programme for using <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> in public libraries was therefore imperative. The research was undertaken, firstly, on the basis of an intensive literature study and, secondly, by conducting an empirical study by means of structured interviews with a number of librarians in public libraries. The interviews were conducted after completion of the literature study. The purpose of the interviews was to determine whether the use of <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> according to the proposed programme was supported by librarians in the public library sector. The opinions of respondents were subsequently analysed and objections to the use of <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> were identified. The predetermined guidelines set on the basis of the literature study were followed to eliminate these objections. It was found that none of the objections to the use of <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> could be sustained if the guidelines on designing and implementing a voluntary workers' programme were followed. Every possible resource was utilised to design a structured programme for recruiting potential <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> from different communities and using them for rendering essential and extended services. The guidelines indicated that public library management should, first of all, determine the relevance of using <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> by means of internal and external needs analyses. Should it be found that the aid of <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> is relevant for rendering various services, a co-ordinator should be appointed to design and implement the voluntary workers' programme. It is suggested that the programme should be developed and implemented as follows,The co-ordinator, as the manager of the programme, will be responsible for compiling a policy, procedures, recruitment and selection strategies, a training schedule and a budget. These tasks may be delegated to other staff members so that they could play a role in training, supervising, motivating, evaluating and giving recognition to <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers.</b> Finally, the co-ordinator should evaluate the effectiveness of the programme on the basis of data gathered from supervisors, <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> and relevant community members. The report on the findings should then be made available to all roleplayers. The programme should subsequently be adapted and improved according to the findings published in this report. The researcher therefore recommends that <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> should be recruited on the basis of the structured voluntary workers' programme and used for rendering essential and extended services...|$|R

Statistics are presented on selected characteristics of nursing homes using <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> and the services they perform. Factors that may contribute to the increased use of <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> also discussed. Methods—The data presented in this report were collected from the 1985 a 1999 National Nursing Home Surveys (NNHS). NNHS {{is a part of the}} Nation Health Care Survey, which measures health care utilization across various types providers. Conducted periodically since 1973, NNHS obtains information from a nationally representative sample of nursing home facilities based on interviews administrators and staff. Sample data are weighted to produce annual national estimates. Results—In 1999, 87 percent of all nursing homes reported using <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers,</b> up from 78 percent in 1985. In 1985, unpaid workers were most like found in large nursing homes (100 beds or more). By 1999, about the same proportion of nursing homes, large and small, reported their use. In 1999, the Northeast region had the greatest proportion of nursing homes that used volunteers— 93 percent. Chain-affiliated and independent facilities used volunteers with about the same frequency, and about the same percentage of nursing hom certified by either Medicaid or Medicare used <b>voluntary</b> <b>workers</b> as did dually-certified facilities.
