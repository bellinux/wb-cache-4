40|$|Classical Amplitude Spectrum {{analysis}} and Full Amplitude Spectrum analysis exhibit deficiencies {{in analyzing the}} two perpendicular directional <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>signals</b> of a rotating rotor. The shape of Classical Amplitude Spectrum {{is influenced by the}} installing position of its sensor. Neither Classical Amplitude Spectrum nor Full Amplitude Spectrum can indicate the actual radial rotor vibration amplitude on every frequency. Therefore, the previous two methods are not convenient to be used in rotating machine diagnoses. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new rotor vibration analyzing tool here called Synthetic Amplitude Spectrum (SAS). The paper discusses the principle of SAS analysis, provides the specific making process of SAS, and applies it to two other current important analyzing methods in rotating machine diagnoses, resulting in two SAS extensions. The two extensions include a short-time SAS array tool for rotor vibration time-frequency {{analysis and}} a SAS waterfall plot tool for analyzing rotor vibration during machine startup or shutdown. The experiments and theoretical analysis showed that SAS and its two extension methods are not influenced by the installation position of the two sensors, and each amplitude of the spectrums can represent the actual radial rotor vibration amplitude on the frequency...|$|R

The data processing method based on frequency-domain analysis were established. Intrinsic <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement</b> is defined to eliminate the effect of steady velocity displacement and extract the useful information of <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement.</b> The actual frequency, amplitude and phase of the superimposed <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement</b> and the entrance pressure were obtained by the frequency-domain analysis of the intrinsic <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement</b> and the entrance pressure. The control precision of the superimposed <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement</b> frequency and amplitude of MAR proved to be high. The direct current component of entrance pressure {{can be seen as}} the mean entrance pressure which stands for the flow resistance. The study of mean entrance pressure is useful in discovering the energy consumption mechanism of the polymer processing introduced vibration energy.

The phase difference of the dynamic components of shear strain and shear stress at the capillary wall proved to be as same as the phase difference of superimposed <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement</b> and the entrance pressure. In {{order to get the}} loss angle, the intrinsic <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement</b> was defined and original signal was transformed from time domain representation to frequency domain representation by DFT. The experiment results show that the loss angle increases greatly with the increase of the superimposed <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement</b> frequency. It indicates that the viscous losses increase while the elastic properties decrease with the increase of the superimposed <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement</b> frequency. The loss angle didn’t change notably with the increase of the piston steady velocity and the superimposed <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement</b> amplitude. This indicates that the viscoelastic properties keep consistence when the shear rate and piston amplitude changes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAcceleration sensors {{are usually}} {{used to measure}} the {{vibration}} of a structure. Although this is the most accurate method, it cannot be used remotely because these are contact-type sensors. This makes measurement difficult in areas that cannot be easily approached by surveyors, such as structures located in high or dangerous areas. Therefore, a method that can measure the structural vibration without installing sensors is required for the vibration measurement of structures located in these areas. Many conventional studies have been carried out on non–contact-type vibration measurement methods using cameras. However, they have been applied to structures with relatively large <b>vibration</b> <b>displacements</b> such as buildings or bridges, and since most of them use targets, people still have to approach the structure to install the targets. Therefore, a new method is required to supplement the weaknesses of the conventional methods. In this paper, a method is proposed to measure <b>vibration</b> <b>displacements</b> remotely using a camera without having to approach the structure. Furthermore, an estimation method for the measurement resolution and measurement error is proposed for the <b>vibration</b> <b>displacement</b> of a cylindrical structure measured using the proposed measurement method. The proposed methods are described, along with experimental results that verify their accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Spring vibration–isolated {{foundations}} {{are widely}} used today to support medium-speed mills in thermal power plants. The vibration of machine body {{should be considered in}} the design and vibration evaluation of the foundation of dynamic machine. To investigate the dynamic characteristics and vibration reduction measures used with these foundations, eight mills, including one mill supported by a non-isolated foundation, were tested on site. Vibration safety was evaluated based on the test results. Furthermore, a mill-foundation coupled finite element model was built using ANSYS to analyze modal and harmonic responses. The calculation results were generally in accordance with the test results. Finally, vibration reduction measures were discussed by parametric analysis including the number of isolators and the mass ratio of the foundation to that of the machine. This study shows that the vibration could be effectively reduced by the spring vibration–isolated foundation, particularly for the ground. The <b>vibration</b> <b>displacements</b> of medium-speed mills supported by spring vibration–isolated foundations meet code requirements, but the <b>vibration</b> <b>displacements</b> of the machine body are larger than the code requirements.

Many engineering materials suitable for vibration permit a peak vibration velocity of around 1 m/s.
