25|$|Apart from Pli selon pli, {{the only}} {{substantial}} new work {{to emerge in}} the first half of the 1960s was the final version of Book 2 of his Structures for two pianos. Boulez and Yvonne Loriod gave the premiere at the Donaueschinger Musiktage in October 1961. Midway through the decade, however, Boulez appeared to find his <b>voice</b> <b>again.</b> Éclat, a short and brilliant piece for small ensemble, had its first performance in Los Angeles in March 1965 and by 1970 it had grown into a substantial half-hour work, Éclat/Multiples. In 1968 the final version of Figures—Doubles—Prismes for large orchestra, a version of two movements from Livre pour quatuor for string orchestra (Livre pour cordes) and the two versions of Domaines (clarinet solo/clarinet and ensemble) all received first performances.|$|E
25|$|To appease her worried father, Bella {{attends a}} movie with her school friend, Jessica. While there, she {{carelessly}} approaches a group of dangerous-looking men outside a bar and discovers she can hear Edward's voice when her adrenaline is high. Desperate to hear his <b>voice</b> <b>again,</b> Bella continually seeks out danger; she convinces Jacob Black to repair two old motorcycles and teach her to ride. Their friendship grows, and Jacob admits that he has romantic feelings for Bella, though she does not reciprocate them. When a vampire named Laurent tries to attack and kill her, Bella is saved by a pack of giant wolves. Later, Bella learns that Jacob and other tribe members are shapeshifters who assume a wolf form to protect humans from vampires. Bella also discovers that the vampire Victoria has returned to Forks, seeking to kill Bella to avenge her mate, James', death.|$|E

500|$|Angelou, as a woman, {{demonstrated}} {{the formation of}} her own cultural identity throughout her narratives. [...] Angelou presented herself {{as a role model}} for African-American women by reconstructing the Black woman's image throughout her autobiographies, and has used her many roles, incarnations, and identities to connect the layers of oppression with her personal history. [...] Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome appeared throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. The women Angelou presented in her autobiographies, especially Caged Bird, influenced the woman Angelou became. According to Manora, three characters in Caged Bird, Angelou's mother Vivian, her grandmother Annie Henderson, and Mrs. Flowers (who helps Angelou find her <b>voice</b> <b>again</b> after her rape), collaborated to [...] "form a triad which serves as the critical matrix in which the child is nurtured and sustained during her journey through Southern Black girlhood".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to directing some television work, Bogdanovich returned to acting with a recurring guest {{role on the}} cable television series The Sopranos, playing Dr. Melfi's psychotherapist, also later directing a fifth-season episode. He also voiced the analyst of Bart Simpson's therapist in an episode of The Simpsons, and appeared as himself in the [...] "Robots Versus Wrestlers" [...] episode of How I Met Your Mother along with Arianna Huffington and Will Shortz. Quentin Tarantino also cast Bogdanovich as a disc jockey in [...] and [...] [...] "Quentin knows, because he's such a movie buff, that when you hear a disc jockey's voice in my pictures, it's always me, sometimes doing different voices," [...] said Bogdanovich. [...] "So he called me and he said, 'I stole your voice from The Last Picture Show for the rough cut, but I need you {{to come down and}} do that <b>voice</b> <b>again</b> for my picture...'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The cartoon was not {{the first}} cartoon to feature a soundtrack {{connected}} to the action. Fleischer Studios, headed by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer, had already released a number of sound cartoons using the DeForest system in the mid-1920s. However, these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film. For Willie, Disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat. This precise timing is apparent during the [...] "Turkey in the Straw" [...] sequence when Mickey's actions exactly match the accompanying instruments. Animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the film's original music. This role has been variously attributed to Wilfred Jackson, Carl Stalling and Bert Lewis, but identification remains uncertain. Walt Disney himself was voice actor for both Mickey and Minnie and would remain the source of Mickey's voice through 1946 for theatrical cartoons. Jimmy MacDonald took over the role in 1946, but Walt provided Mickey's <b>voice</b> <b>again</b> from 1955 to 1959 for The Mickey Mouse Club television series on ABC.|$|E
2500|$|Duff McKagan {{praised the}} album, saying that [...] "Axl sounds amazing" [...] and [...] "I think Axl's finally made the record {{he always wanted}} to". Slash reacted {{positively}} to the title track, stating [...] "That sounds cool. It's good to hear Axl's <b>voice</b> <b>again,</b> y'know?" [...] When the album was released, Slash responded by saying [...] "It's a really good record. It's {{very different from what}} the original Guns N' Roses sounded like, but it's a great statement by Axl... It's a record that the original Guns N' Roses could never possibly make. And {{at the same time it}} just shows you how brilliant Axl is." [...] In a later interview, Slash stated the album was [...] "exactly what I thought it would sound like," [...] with many synthesizers and digital augmentations. Izzy Stradlin, soon after the album was released, said [...] "I have listened to some tracks off the record and I enjoyed them" [...] and [...] "I like what I've heard." [...] Steven Adler said he [...] "didn't like the album, not one bit." [...] Gilby Clarke stated [...] "I think it's a really good record – I honestly do. I think it's a great record... Knowing what I know what direction he wanted to take the band, I think he hit the nail on the head; I think he did a great job" [...] Matt Sorum called the album a 'toe-tapper'. Early Guns N' Roses guitarist Tracii Guns said he thought the album was [...] "over-indulgent, sterile and not that exciting." ...|$|E
