SALTIRSOIL calculates the composition of the soil solution, mainly saturation extract, given an irrigation water composition and amount, crop type, climate features and basic physical and chemical soil data. The lower Palancia river basin, in the limit between València and Castelló provinces in Spain, was selected as study area in order to test the model. This agricultural area is interesting because several factors that cause soil salinization, such as high evapotranspiration to rainfall ratios and high salinity irrigation waters, meet. Five experimental plots have been monitored in this area since late spring 2007. The plots were selected in order to test SALTIRSOIL under the four combinations resulting from the following two factors: irrigation water salinity: low or high, and irrigation technique: drip or basin. Soil sampling in different places within the plots, four depths down to 90 cm and throughout the year has been performed, and saturated soil pastes prepared and analysed, {{in order to have a}} representative soil salinity dataset from each plot. Irrigation waters have also been sampled and analysed regularly. Furthermore, soil solution ceramic <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractors</b> have been installed at three depths (30, 60 and 90 cm) at the water inlet and outlet in basin irrigated plots and close to selected drip emitters in those drip irrigated. Soil solution from these <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractors</b> has been sampled and analysed every time an irrigation or rainfall event has occurred. In addition to this, a broad soil survey has been performed in the whole basin using a salinity sensor based on frequency-domain reflectometry in order to upscale SALTIRSOIL from the plot to the basin scale, that is to test the GISSALTIRSOIL model once is linked.

500|$|The risk of {{transmission}} from mother to baby is highest {{if the mother}} becomes infected {{around the time of}} delivery (30% to 60%), since insufficient time will have occurred for the generation and transfer of protective maternal antibodies before the birth of the child. In contrast, the risk falls to 3% if the [...] infection is recurrent, and is 1–3% if the woman is seropositive for both HSV-1 and HSV-2, and is less than 1% if no lesions are visible. Women seropositive for only one type of HSV are only half as likely to transmit HSV as infected seronegative mothers. To prevent neonatal infections, seronegative women are recommended to avoid unprotected oral-genital contact with an HSV-1-seropositive partner and conventional sex with a partner having a genital infection during the last trimester of pregnancy. Mothers infected with HSV are advised to avoid procedures that would cause trauma to the infant during birth (e.g. fetal scalp electrodes, forceps, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractors)</b> and, should lesions be present, to elect caesarean section to reduce exposure of the child to infected secretions in the birth canal. The use of antiviral treatments, such as acyclovir, given from the 36th week of pregnancy, limits HSV recurrence and shedding during childbirth, thereby reducing the need for caesarean section.|$|R

Being born in safe conditions requires to be surrounded by professionals who acquire a rigorous knowledge of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Nowadays, midwives and obstetricians learn mainly in delivery ward during real childbirths. For difficult childbirths, the use of obstetrical instruments (forceps, spatulas or <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractors)</b> is unavoidable. However, the use of such instruments increases the risks of lesions for the mother and the fetus. In practical, only clinical experience acquired in the delivery ward enables these risks to be reduced. Nowadays, simulators in medicine have a real appeal in the medical environment. These tools enable doctors to visualize the position of the organs in the human body, to plan their movements or to carry out a more complete post operational control. A birth simulator provides a training tool and a research tool to compare various techniques for the use of obstetrical instruments or to validate new methods. It is in this context that we have developed, in collaboration with researchers and medical doctors, a new type of instrumented forceps to offer new solutions for training obstetricians for the safe use of obstetrical forceps delivery. The main contributions of this paper are the design of instrumented forceps coupled with the BirthSIM simulator and the path analysis during the forceps blades placement.

This analysis, encompassing the period end-December, 1984, to beginning-August, 1991, focuses on risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HIV- 1 infection. Rate of vertical transmission, based on 721 children born to 701 mothers more than 18 months before the time of analysis, was 14. 4 % (95 % Cl 12. 0 - 17. 1 %). Transmission was associated with maternal p 24 -antigenaemia and a CD 4 count of less than 700 /microliters. In a multivariate analysis, odds ratios of transmission were: 2. 25 (95 % Cl 0. 97 - 5. 23) in breastfed children vs never-breastfed children; 3. 80 (1. 62 - 8. 91) in children born before 34 weeks' gestation; and 0. 56 (0. 30 - 1. 04) in children delivered by caesarean section. Transmission was higher with vaginal deliveries in which episiotomy, scalp electrodes, forceps, or <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractors</b> were used, but only in centres where these procedures were not routine. On {{the basis of these}} results, HIV-infected women contemplating pregnancy should be counselled according to their immunological findings and, if they have p 24 -antigenaemia or a low CD 4 count, warned of an increased risk of viral transmission. Caesarean deliveries may have a protective effect, although it is premature to recommend routine operative delivery. The mechanism for the higher infection rate in children born before 34 weeks' gestation is unclear, but could reflect inadequate passive or active immunity at that age, combined with substantial transmission during labour or delivery. The balance of evidence suggests that mothers with established infection can transmit HIV infection through breastmilk, although the relative importance of this route remains to be define...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Risk {{factors for}} severe perineal {{lacerations}} are nowadays well-known and they include operative vaginal deliveries and extractions in occiput posterior (OP) positions. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess whether OP position increases the risk for anal sphincter injury when compared with occiput anterior (OA) positions in operative deliveries using Thierry's spatulas. METHODS: Retrospective study of 163 extractions with Thierry's spatulas over a five-year period (January 2000 to December 2005) performed in a general hospital. Singleton cephalic pregnancies at term were studied and the incidence of severe perineal lacerations was noted in deliveries in OP and OA positions. RESULTS: In these 163 cases, the varieties of presentation obtained by vaginal examination were 129 in anterior and 34 in posterior positions. Eleven posterior positions rotated anteriorly on delivery and 23 remained in a posterior position. The OA group (n= 140) and the OP group (n= 23) were constituted. Anal sphincter injury occurred significantly more often in the OP group compared with the OA group (17. 4 % versus 2. 9 %, p= 0. 014) with an odds ratio of 7. 1 (95 % CI 1. 6 - 31). Only one fourth-degree laceration was noted. Within the OP group, the incidence of vaginal lacerations was increased compared to the OA group, but without any significant difference (43. 5 % versus 27. 9 %, p= 0. 20). In a logistic regression model, the OP position was 6. 4 times (95 % CI 1. 3 - 31. 5) more likely to be associated with anal sphincter injury than OA position. The incidence of OP position was 14. 1 % within the whole population studied and Thierry's spatulas permit anterior rotations of occipito posterior presentation in only 32. 4 % of cases. CONCLUSION: The efficiency of Thierry's spatulas is proven. As with forceps and <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractors,</b> extraction with Thierry's spatulas is a risk factor for perineal laceration compared to a spontaneous delivery. In deliveries with spatulas, OP head positions further increase this perineal risk against OA positions.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of antenatal care in {{developing}} countries is to identify women whose pregnancy or delivery is likely to raise problems and to refer them {{at the appropriate time}} to a hospital facility where the necessary medical equipment and expertise (<b>vacuum</b> <b>extractors,</b> cesarian sections, human skill, etc.) is available. This approach, which is known as the Risk Approach (RA) strategy, is expected to significantly reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. However, the RA will function properly only if the women identified at risk agree to give birth in a hospital on the one hand, and if they can indeed reach this hospital on the other hand. In this article the authors assess to what extent women with a risk of difficult labor (nulliparous or primiparous women under 150 cm, history of previous difficult delivery or stillbirth, women with transverse lie) agreed to give birth in a hospital. This descriptive survey, which covered 5060 pregnancies monitored in the Kasongo District, Maniema, in eastern Zaire, showed that the referral success rate in this socioeconomically very disadvantaged region was only 33 %, despite some favorable conditions, such as a strong emphasis on community participation, a complementarity of health centers and hospital, and the absence of financial barriers within the health services system. Of the various hypotheses tested, the geographic accessibility of the hospital and the parturient's perception of the risk status were the two most important factors determining the compliance rate. A stratified analysis shows that the intensity of the parturient's perception has a different impact on compliance whether rural or urban situations are considered. In their conclusions, the authors stress the importance of the problem and the need for additional qualitative studies (open interviews, focus group discussions) to better understand the reasons of this low compliance. The phenomenon observed in Kasongo is definitely not a unique one, and unawareness of this problem is likely {{to be one of the}} reasons for the low success of pregnancy monitoring programs when they are assessed in terms of reduction of maternal morbidity and mortality. antenatal care risk approach strategy referral compliance...|$|R

Similarly, for frank breech presentations, instead of using the fetal leg as tractor, we sometimes apply the <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor</b> on the breech presentation in order to perform {{the first step of}} the total breech extraction. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor</b> is not traumatic for the fetus and enable a quick extraction. This study was conducted to describe the technique we use in our ward.

40|$|International audienceAIM: Clinical Practice Guidelines of the French College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians {{concerning}} operative deliveries {{were published}} in December 2008. That is why a national survey was performed for the year 2007 so as to obtain an inventory of obstetrical practices regarding the geographical distribution {{of the type of}} instrument used for operative deliveries following the level of each teaching hospital concerned. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included in our study 49 teaching hospitals from metropolitan France and the overseas departments and territories. For the year 2007, we noted the number of operative deliveries, the type of instrument used, as well as the level of the maternity concerned with its total number of patients, births, cesarean sections, vaginal deliveries, and episiotomies. RESULTS: We obtained data from all 49 centres. The mean number of deliveries per year was 2203 for level I teaching hospitals, 2060 for level II and 2720 for level III, respectively. The rate of operative delivery was quite different from one centre to the other, ranging from 5. 3 to 34. 1 % of all births. Similarly, for the type of instrument used, there existed clear geographical disparities although the notion of "School's instrument" was not as preeminent as before since most centres used at least two instruments. Moreover, the rate of cesarean varied from 9 to 29. 5 % (all levels concerned) with a national mean rate of 20. 7 % for teaching hospitals. Finally, mean rate of episiotomies ranged from 3. 6 to 60 %. DISCUSSION: This study showed that important differences existed between teaching hospitals in the use of instruments and that obstetrical practices are far from being uniform. However, in 2007, the routine use of more than one instrument in each centre was most usual, as opposed to the situation some decades ago. The use of obstetrical <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractors</b> has been largely disseminated.

In both groups deliveries were stimulated by 10 IU of oxytocin in 500 mL of crystalloid solvent, with 15 - 20 drops per minute. As anaesthetic, Bupivacain (0, 25 % or 0, 125 %) was used by the 18 G catheters Braun and Wigon. Level of application was L 2 -L 3 part of spine. Results. The results of this study indicate that deliveries with EA were shorter in duration, but also had much more <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor</b> and forceps appliance (over 2. 5 times) than those without EA. Apgar score was significantly higher in the experimental group with multiple deliveries. However, there was no significant deference between average Apgar score of newborns of patients with EA and that of newborns of patients without EA. Conclusion. Application of EA decreases duration of delivery, and has no any adverse effects on newborns...|$|E
40|$|Nine out of 232 infants on {{whom the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor</b> was {{employed}} developed subaponeurotic haemorrhage {{and two of}} these infants died. In a further 78 infants born by vacuum extraction, all of whom received intramuscular vitamin K 1, four sustained subaponeurotic haemorrhage and one died. This type of haemorrhage was not encountered in over 12, 000 infants born by other methods. Its relationship to vacuum extraction {{was found to be}} significantly more frequent when the thrombotest level was 10 % or below of normal adult activity. It is suggested that infants born by vacuum extraction and with a thrombotest level of 10 % or below might be protected from subaponeurotic haemorrhage by the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 5 % (1 in 20) of all {{deliveries}} in the United States are operative vaginal deliveries.

This article reviews in detail the indications, contraindications, patient selection criteria, choice of instrument, and technique for vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery. The use of vacuum extraction at the time of cesarean delivery will also be discussed.

40|$|THE <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor</b> or ventouse {{has been}} widely used on the Continent as an {{alternative}} to forceps delivery for about 15 years, but in the British Isles the first modern report of its exten-sive use was by Chalmers and Fothergill (I 960). An unsuccessful attempt to effect delivery by suction, using a cupping glass, was recorded as early as 1706. Simpson, in I 849, wrote a treatise 'On a suction-tractor, or new mechanical power, as a substitute for the forceps in tedious labours'. Since that time there have been various arbitrarydesigns of suction apparatus, using rubber or metal cups. The mathematical calculations and experiment essential to the designing of a tech-nically efficient suction apparatus were carried out by Malstrom (1954, 1957). The instrumen...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the human}} fetus, an {{increased}} lactate and glucose level can be anticipated when hypoxia and stress are present {{and is likely}} to be a function of both anaerobic metabolism and catecholamine-mediated glycogenolysis/glycolysis. AIM: We assessed if measurement of lactate in cord artery blood after vaginal and cesarean delivery may predict glucose concentration. STUDY DESIGN: Umbilical artery cord blood lactacidemia, acidemia, and glucose concentration was tested by 'mini-lab' Radiometer ABL 90 FLEX analyzers (Radiometer®, Copenhagen, Denmark) after vaginal delivery (VD), spontaneous (n= 493) and by <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor</b> (n= 41) or by cesarean delivery (CD), elective (n= 120) and emergency (n= 68) in at term, vigorous neonates delivered from March to December 2012 at the 2 nd level maternity ward of Policlinico Abano Terme, Abano Terme (Italy). RESULTS: Cord blood lactacidemia and glucose levels were significantly higher in VD by <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor</b> than in all other groups (5. 32 ± 1. 96 mmol/L, p= 0. 050 and 103. 6 ± 30. 5 mg/dL, p< 0. 001, respectively) and significantly lower in elective CD group (1. 77 ± 0. 99 mmol/L, p< 0. 001 and 69. 8 ± 13. 0 mg/dL, p< 0. 001). The cord blood lactate concentration was significantly and positively correlated with glucose levels (r= 0. 434, p< 0. 001), but significantly and negatively correlated with pH (r=- 0, 662, p< 0. 001), NaHCO 3 (-) (r=- 0, 802, p< 0. 001), and base excess (BE) (r=- 0, 698, p< 0. 001). However, in multivariate linear regression analysis, only BE, PaCO 2 and cord blood lactate were significant predictive variables (R(2) = 0. 410; p< 0. 001) of glucose levels at birth. CONCLUSION: Cord blood artery lactate and glucose concentration are significantly and positively correlated at birth in healthy, at term vaginally and cesarean delivered neonates, but BE is the best indicator of activated fetal gluconeogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Brachial plexus {{injuries}} {{represent a}} low percentage of delivery complications. Most newborns fully {{recover from the}} injury, very few retain a permanent neurological deficit whereas some remain unnoticed. An objective {{of this study was}} to establish delivery factors for brachial plexus palsy at the Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics and relation between the deficits with length of delivery, the length of delivery periods, induction of delivery and surgical interventions at delivery. The analysed group involved 90 newborn babies with an injury of brachial plexus made at the delivery in the period between 01. 01. 1996 and 31. 12. 2005. The controlled group included 90 newborns randomly selected. The comparison was made using an χ 2 test. The incidence of injuries of plexus brachialis was 1. 72 per 1, 000 newborns. Analysing the length of delivery there was no difference found between the analysed and controlled group (p > 0. 05). In the group of newborns with the injury of brachial plexus it was found that the second delivery period was significantly shorter (p < 0. 01). In the analysed group 89 (98. 8 %) newborn babies were delivered vaginally and one (1. 2 %) was delivered by the cesarean section. 13 newborns (14. 4 %) from the analysed group were delivered with application of <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor</b> and in the controlled group it was the case with one (1. 2 %) newborn baby (p < 0. 01). The delivery of 98. 8 % newborns from the analysed group started spontaneously and two deliveries (1. 2 %) were induced. Risk factors for injuries of plexus brachialis in newborns at the Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics of the University Clinical Centre Tuzla include shortened second delivery period and completion of deliveries applying the <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor...</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The use of {{epidural}} anaesthesia in delivery {{with the}} purpose to reduce pain and fear in a pregnant woman has the influence on the physiological status {{of the woman in}} childbirth and the course of delivery. From the epidural space of the pregnant woman, one part of free anaesthetic comes in the foetal circulation through the mother's circulation and placenta and connects with the foetal proteins. A lower value of albumins and serum proteins in the foetal circulation give bigger free fraction of anaesthetic which is accumulated in the foetal liver, brain and heart full of blood. Objective. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the influence of epidural anaesthesia on the newborn. Methods. Retrospective study of 6, 398 documents of newborns was performed in our Clinic of Gynaecology and Obstetrics 'Narodni front' during 2006. The first group was made of 455 newborns from deliveries with epidural anaesthesia and the second was the control group of 5, 943 remaining newborns. In both groups we analysed the following: sex, week of gestation, weight, Apgar score, measure of care and resuscitation, perinatal morbidity and then the obtained results were compared. Results. Most of deliveries were vaginal without obstetric intervention (86. 6 %). The number of deliveries finished with <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor</b> (4. 6 %) was statistically significantly bigger in the group with epidural anaesthesia than in the control group. Most of the newborns in the first group were born on time (96. 5 %) in 39. 0 ± 1. 0 week of gestation and with foetal weight 3448 ± 412 grammes. There was no statistical significance in Apgar score between both groups. Epidural anaesthesia does not increase the degree of the newborn's injury. Lower pH of blood was found in the newborns from deliveries with <b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor</b> or operated on (the Ceasarean section). Conclusion. Application of epidural anaesthesia decreases duration of delivery and has no adverse effects on the newborn and hypoxic encephalopathy is lower...|$|E
40|$|Objectives : To measure {{pre-intervention}} {{quality of}} routine antenatal and childbirth care in rural districts of Burkina Faso, Ghana and Tanzania {{and to identify}} shortcomings. Methods : In each country, we selected two adjoining rural districts. Within each district, we randomly sampled 6 primary healthcare facilities. Quality of care was assessed through health facility surveys, direct observation of antenatal and childbirth care, exit interviews and review of patient records. Results : By and large, quality of antenatal and childbirth care in the six districts was satisfactory, but we did identify some critical gaps common to the study sites in all three countries. Counselling and health education practices are poor; laboratory investigations are often not performed; examination and monitoring of mother and newborn during childbirth are inadequate; partographs are not used. Equipment required to provide assisted vaginal deliveries (<b>vacuum</b> <b>extractor</b> or forceps) was absent in all surveyed facilities. Conclusion : Quality of care in the three study sites can be improved with the available human resources and without major investments. This improvement could reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity...|$|E
