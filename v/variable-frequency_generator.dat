40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive assessment of small-signal stability for a “more-electric” aircraft power system {{consisting of a}} synchronous <b>variable-frequency</b> <b>generator</b> which supplies several power electronic controlled loads via an 18 -pulse autotransformer rectifier unit (ATRU) for AC-DC conversion. Functional models for key power system components and loads are derived. Numerical tools employed for the automatic calculation of linearized equations and operating points are described, {{and the influence of}} leading design and operational parameter on system stability is evaluated...|$|E
50|$|The A380 uses four 150 kVA <b>variable-frequency</b> {{electrical}} <b>generators,</b> eliminating constant-speed {{drives and}} improving reliability. The A380 uses aluminium power cables instead of copper for weight reduction. The {{electrical power system}} is fully computerised and many contactors and breakers {{have been replaced by}} solid-state devices for better performance and increased reliability.|$|R
25|$|Bleed {{air systems}} have been in use for several decades in {{passenger}} jets. Recent improvements in solid-state electronics have enabled pneumatic power systems {{to be replaced by}} electric power systems. In a bleedless aircraft such as the Boeing 787, each engine has two <b>variable-frequency</b> electrical <b>generators</b> to compensate for not providing compressed air to external systems. Eliminating bleed air and replacing it with extra electric generation is believed to provide a net improvement in engine efficiency, lower weight, and ease of maintenance.|$|R
