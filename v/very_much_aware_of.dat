40|$|Purpose: A lot of {{accidents}} {{occur in the}} laboratory {{due to lack of}} proper knowledge regarding laboratory safety measures, indifferent attitude &amp; improper implementation of safe laboratory practices. In view of this, the present study on knowledge, Attitude &amp; Practice (KAP) of laboratory safety measures was carried out among paramedical staff of laboratory services of tertiary care teaching hospital, western India. Method: This was a comparative study which used a standardized, structured self-administered questionnaire to survey knowledge, attitude and practice of paramedical staff. The KAP study enrolled 81 respondents. Results: Regarding knowledge- the majority knew the very important issues related with laboratory safety like Post Exposure Prophylaxis (96. 55 %) &amp; discarding of blood samples (93. 10 %) etc. In regard to attitude towards the scientific process, all are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> about importance <b>of</b> protective devices (i. e. Wearing Gloves) and Biomedical waste management. In regard to the practice in laboratory, the entire study subject group (100 %) replied â&# 8364;&# 339;YESâ&# 8364;&# 157; in each question that shows the good quality work of the laboratory. Conclusion: The induction training on Laboratory safety is very important and motivating exercise for improving the laboratory safety measures...|$|R

His home {{was on the}} southwest corner of 11th Avenue and 82nd Street (across the Avenue from the home of his mother), Albert Edward Parfitt's home was on 82nd Street next to Johnson's, and the last, closest to Tenth Avenue, was the home of Arthur S. Tuttle who was Assistant Engineer of The Water Supply of The City Works Department of The City of Brooklyn. Parfitt was the architect of these three homes. Johnson's house burned down before 1900, Parfitt's was demolished by a developer in 1928 and replaced with seven, run-of-the-mill, fully detached, single-family homes, and Tuttle's house was remodeled over 10 years ago and clad in bright-white and sky-blue brick.|$|E

He requested the Spanish friars be given leave of their parish posts. Many of the friars left voluntarily, and were replaced by native Filipino priests in lower ranks and American bishops in the ranks of the episcopacy. Negotiations also began for the compulsory sale of vast Roman Catholic Church holdings. Although the sale was affected by pressure from influential sectors like some bishops and certain delegates, it achieved Taft’s goal of sequestering all the Roman Catholic Church lands, something that the ill-fated Philippine Republic had failed to achieve. After taking the land, the governor intended to redistribute the land. This not only reduced the financial position of the Roman Catholic Church, but also diminished the influential clout it had during the Spanish colonial period.|$|E

2500|$|The German {{historian}} Eberhard Jäckel wrote {{a series}} of newspaper articles later turned into the book David Irving's Hitler: A Faulty History Dissected, attacking Irving and maintaining that Hitler was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> and approved of the Holocaust. Jäckel attacked Irving for claiming that a note from Heinrich Himmler's notebook – [...] "Jewish transport from Berlin, not to be liquidated", dated 30 November 1941 – proved that Hitler {{did not want to}} see the Holocaust happen. Jäckel maintained that the order referred only to that train, and argued that if Hitler had ordered the people on that train to be spared, it must stand to reason that he was aware of the Holocaust. Jäckel went on to argue that because the [...] "Final Solution" [...] was secret, it is not surprising that Hitler's servants were ignorant of the Holocaust, and that anyhow, five of Hitler's servants interviewed by Irving later claimed that they believed that Hitler was aware of the Holocaust. Jäckel argued on the basis of Hitler's statements in Mein Kampf that the Führer was always committed to genocide of the Jews, and that because Hitler later attempted to execute the foreign policy he outlined in Mein Kampf, it is a reasonable assumption that Hitler was always committed to genocide, which in Jäckel's opinion disproves Irving's claim that Hitler was unaware of the Shoah. Jäckel used Hitler's tendency to involve himself in minutiae to argue that it is simply inconceivable that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust. As evidence against Irving, Jäckel used Hitler's [...] "Prophecy Speech" [...] of 30 January 1939, where Hitler declared: ...|$|E
