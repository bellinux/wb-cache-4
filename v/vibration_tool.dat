In order to perform the machining experiments, a 1 D <b>vibration</b> <b>tool</b> and a 2 D <b>vibration</b> <b>tool</b> are designed and manufactured. The cutting forces and surface roughness of the work-pieces in 1 D UAT and 2 D UAT are measured in different cutting speeds and feed rates and compared with that in conventional machining. To investigate {{the effect of the}} ultrasonic vibration on the material properties, hardness tests are performed on the work-piece material and micro-hardness tests are carried out on the chip specimens. The results showed that reduction in the cutting forces occurred in UAT. The results also showed that the surface roughness is exceled in UAT in comparison with the conventional machining. While no detectable effect of the ultrasonic vibration on the work-piece material could be observed, the chip micro-hardness experiments showed that the softening phenomenon occurred in UAT, which can be the cause of the force reduction in UAT...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in drilling technology have enabled wells reaching up to 10 km and beyond. Conventional intervention technology has limitations when {{reaching into the}} high deviated and long horizontal sections of these extended reach wells. This thesis presents {{a new type of}} material and technique that has been introduced to intervention applications the latest years - the composite intervention cable. The composite cable is lighter than the conventional steel wireline and has a higher strength, stiffness and electrical current transfer capability. One of the main benefits of the composite intervention cable is the high stiffness of the composite material, allowing a surface injector head to push the cable into the well and thereby eliminate the necessity of a well tractor. However, pushing the composite cable into the high deviated and long horizontal wells will cause helical buckling and lock-up. Axial oscillations and vibration can effectively reduce the friction forces that arise between the locked cable and the inner wall of the production pipe. Analyzing and testing the use of a <b>vibration</b> <b>tool</b> together with the composite intervention cable are therefore one of the main objectives of the thesis. To investigate the forces and stress involved in pushing the composite cable into a well and to further test the concept of using a <b>vibration</b> <b>tool,</b> a practical test model has been built. The results were used to address the advantages and limitations of the cable and the <b>vibration</b> <b>tool</b> and to utilize comparison with the simulation results. The test results show that the reach of the composite cable is limited by the friction forces that arise between the compressed cable and the inner wall of the production tubing. Therefore, lock-up should be set as the dimensional maximum axial force that could be applied to the cable. Further it is proven that axial vibration reduces the friction force between a locked cable and the inner wall of the production pipe. This permits a higher axial force to be transmitted through the system before lock-up again is reached. However, {{it is unlikely that the}} <b>vibration</b> <b>tool</b> alone is suffiecient to implement the use of a injector head to push the cable and PLT into the challenging highly deviated and horizointal wells. An advance in vibration technology and further development of well-tractors and injector heads could implement the composite intervention cable to help increase the recovery rate and further follow up latest advance in extended reach drilling, even into complex ultra-long wells. </p...|$|E

The field is {{owned and operated by}} Calumet Oil Company. Phillips Petroleum Company will contribute their proprietary vibration core analysis of cores recovered from the pilot test area. To achieve the project objectives, the work has been divided into nine tasks, some are concurrent, while other tasks rely on completion of previous steps. The operator, Calumet Oil Company operates several field in Osage County Oklahoma. The North Burbank Unit will be the site of the test. The team will then determine where within the field to optimally locate the vibration test well. With the location determined, the test well will be drilled, cored, logged and 7 -inch production casing run and cemented. In a parallel effort, OGCI will be designing, building, and testing {{a new version of the}} downhole <b>vibration</b> <b>tool</b> based on their patented and field proven whirling orbital vibrator. With the field test tool built to run in 7 -inch casing. Reliability testing of the downhole tool and surface power source will be conducted in nearby field operated by Calumet Oil Company. After the core is recovered, Phillips Petroleum Company will be conducting laboratory tests utilizing their proprietary sonic core apparatus to determine fluid flow response to a range of vibration frequencies. These results, in turn, will allow final adjustments to the frequency generation mechanisms of the downhole <b>vibration</b> <b>tool.</b> One or more offset wells, near to the vibration test well, will be equipped with downhole geophones and or hydro-phones to determine the strength of signal and if the producing formation has a characteristic resonant frequency response. Surface geophones will also be set out and arranged to pick up the signal generated by the downhole <b>vibration</b> <b>tool.</b> The downhole vibrator will be installed in the test well. Monitoring the production and injection for the pilot test area will continue. As the frequency of the downhole tool is changed, the recording of seismic signals, both on the surface and downhole, will also be conducted. The results of the data collection will be a matrix of varying vibration stimulation conditions corresponding to changes in production fluid rates and seismic responses. The report on the results of the downhole vibration stimulation will be prepared and delivered using several venues. Technical papers will be submitted to the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Workshops are planned to be held for operators in Osage County and surrounding areas.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to mitigating chatter <b>vibrations</b> in machine <b>tools</b> is presented. Encountered in {{many types of}} metal removal processes, chatter is a dangerous condition which results from {{the interaction of the}} cutting dynamics with the modal characteristics of the machine-workpiece assembly. <b>Tool</b> <b>vibrations</b> are recored {{on the surface of the}} workpiece during metal removal, imposing a waviness which alters the chip thickness during subsequent cutting passes. Deviations from the nominal chip thickness effect changes in the cutting force which, under certain conditions, can further excite vibrations. The chatter mitigation strategy presented is based on periodically altering the impedance of the cutting tool assembly. A cyclic electric (or magnetic) field is applied to the spindle quill which contains an electro-rheological (or magneto-rheological) fluid. The variable yield stress in the fluid affects the coupling of the spindle to the machine tool structure, changing the natural frequency of oscillation. Altering the modal characteristics in this fashion disrupts the modulation of current <b>tool</b> <b>vibrations</b> with previous <b>tool</b> <b>vibrations</b> recorded on the workpiece surface. Results from a simulated milling process reveal that significant reductions in vibration amplitude can be achieved through proper selection of fluid and excitation frequency...|$|R

The report provides details of the work done on the project entitled ''Enhanced Oil Recovery with Downhole Vibration Stimulation in Osage County Oklahoma''. The project is divided into nine separate tasks. Several of the tasks are being worked on simultaneously, while other tasks are dependent on earlier tasks being completed. The vibration stimulation Well 111 -W- 27 is located in section 8 T 26 N R 6 E of the North Burbank Unit (NBU), Osage County Oklahoma. It was drilled to 3090 -feet cored, logged, cased and cemented. The rig moved off August 6, 2001. Phillips Petroleum Co. has performed several core studies on the cores recovered from the test well. Standard porosity, permeability and saturation measurements have been conducted. In addition Phillips has prepared a Core Petrology Report, detailing the lithology, stratigraphy and sedimentology for Well 111 -W 27, NBU. Phillips has also conducted the sonic stimulation core tests, the final sonic stimulation report {{has not yet been}} released. Calumet Oil Company, the operator of the NBU, began collecting both production and injection wells information to establish a baseline for the project in the pilot field test area since May 2001. The original 7 -inch Downhole <b>Vibration</b> <b>Tool</b> (DHVT) has been thoroughly tested and it has been concluded that it needs to be redesigned. An engineering firm from Fayetteville AR has been retained to assist in developing a new design for the DHVT.

40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{arising from}} hand power tools {{has long been}} associated with several disorders of the hand and arm, which are collectively termed as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Owing to high prevalence of HAVS among the operators of the power tools, particularly the percussive tools, the desire to develop low <b>vibration</b> <b>tool</b> designs, has been widely recognized. The design of vibration isolators or assessment of vibration performance of tools necessitates development of dynamic model of the tool coupled {{with that of the}} hand-arm system (HAS) to account for energy absorption within the HAS. This dissertation research is aimed at development of dynamic model of a percussive chipping hammer together with a biomechanical model of the hand-arm system. The model could serve as an essential tool for identifying effective vibration attenuation design features. The dynamic model of the tool is formulated considering identifications of various component contact pairs and the air flows between the primary piston and the striker. A tool tip-workpiece contact model is integrated to the tool model to describe the interactions between the tool and an energy dissipator. A biomechanical model of the hand-arm system is implemented to the tool model to develop a coupled hand-tool system, which could be applied to determine the hand vibration responses {{as a function of the}} push force. The properties of different impact pairs are identified from the theory of visco-elastic collision between rigid bodies. The validity of the hand-tool model is examined on the basis of available measured data under selected levels of the hand push force. A simple model of an anti-vibration glove is further introduced to study its effectiveness in limiting the vibration exposure. The simulation results show that the percussive tool model coupled with the biomechanical hand-arm model can yield reasonably good trends in view of the hand-transmitted vibration. The results suggest that the tool vibration transmitted to the hand is more sensitive to variations in push force and the operating speed. Slight increases in the diameter of the upper chamber orifices and the weight of the tool body, together with lower the striker mass, could yield notable reductions in the magnitudes of vibration transmitted to the hand-arm system. The results further show that the anti-vibration gloves yield very minimal vibration attenuation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to study the {{feasibility}} of using multiresolution analysis through the use of wavelet transform, to analyze the <b>tool</b> <b>vibration</b> signal, in order to indirectly establishing the end of turning tool life. To do so, several turning experiments were carried out with different cutting conditions and the <b>tool</b> <b>vibration</b> was measured using accelerometers. After the cuttings, the vibration signals were analyzed in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain and their behaviors were compared with the workpiece surface roughnesses. As the tool wears, the workpiece roughness increases and the <b>tool</b> <b>vibration</b> signal change its features. So, it was necessary to extract from the signal the feature that follows the surface roughness behavior in order to establish the end of tool life based on the workpiece roughness criterion. The analysis was done on the acceleration (signal generated by the sensor), velocity (first integration of the signal) and displacement (second integration) of the tool. The main conclusion of this work is that, the best parameter of the <b>tool</b> <b>vibration</b> signal to follow the surface roughness behavior, is the second level inverse of the wavelet transform of the tool displacement signal...|$|R
40|$|A new {{adaptive}} {{technique is}} presented {{for the increase}} of the dynamic stiffness of the cutting tool in a lathe by active control of the <b>tool</b> <b>vibration</b> in the cutting speed direction. Due to the statistic properties of <b>tool</b> <b>vibration</b> that are induced by the stochastic behavior of chip formation process, the controller {{is based on the}} filtered-x LMS algorithm which controls an adaptive filter that is based on Wiener filter theory. Hence, the adaptation of the filtered-x LMS algorithm is gradient-based and it is based on a classical optimization technique, the method of steepest descent. In the cutting experiments a tool holder construction with integrated actuators, i. e. secondary sources was used. The cutting experiments shows that the adaptive technique presented in this paper enables an increase in the dynamic stiffness of the cutting tool, i. e. <b>tool</b> <b>vibrations</b> are suppressed...|$|R
