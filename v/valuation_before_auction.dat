40|$|Abstract: We examine gender {{differences}} in bargaining outcomes in a highly competitive and commonly used market; the taxi market in Lima, Peru. We find that men face higher initial prices and rejection rates. To explain the inferior treatment of men we conduct an experiment where passengers send a signal on <b>valuation</b> <b>before</b> negotiating. The signal eliminates {{gender differences}} and the response is shown only {{to be consistent with}} statistical discrimination. In separating the role of statistical and taste-based discrimination within the market, we address the concern that discrimination may be implicit...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a large market in which sellers compete by {{offering}} auctions to buyers instead of simple fixed price contracts. Two variants {{of the model}} are studied. One extends a model first analyzed by Wolinsky (1988) in which buyers learn their valuations only after meeting sellers. The other variant extends the model of McAfee (1993) in which buyers know their <b>valuations</b> <b>before</b> they choose among available auctions. The equilibrium array of auctions is characterized for each case and the efficiency properties of the equilibria are analyzed. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} Treasury {{security}} {{prices in the}} secondary market decrease significantly <b>before</b> <b>auctions</b> and recover shortly after. Hence, Treasury security prices tend to be lower on auction days, implying a large issuance cost for the Treasury Department, which {{is estimated to be}} 9 - 18 basis points of the auction size (amounts to over half a billion dollars for issuing Treasury notes in 2007). These results appear to be consistent with the hypothesis of dealers’ limited risk-bearing capacity and the imperfect capital mobility of Treasury investors, highlighting the important role of capital mobility even in the most liquid financial marketsLiquidity, Slow-moving capital, Supply shocks, Treasury auction...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{a dynamic}} trade institution, where an auction is {{combined}} with a “Buy-It-Now ” option. This option presents a take-it-or-leave-it price offered by the seller to a potential bidder <b>before</b> the <b>auction.</b> If the buyer rejects this buyout price, the object is auctioned off. In equilibrium, sales should only {{take place in the}} auction. An experimental test reveals that average buyout prices and profits are well captured by the theoretical prediction. However, a substantial amount of sales takes place <b>before</b> the <b>auction.</b> This is caused by offering (too) low or accepting (too) high buyout prices. We discuss alternative explanations, as risk preferences and (wrong) formation of belief...|$|R
40|$|We empirically {{examine the}} link between the when-issued market and the auction for Treasury bills. We find that on average it is cheaper to buy Treasury bills in the auction than in the when-issued market just <b>before</b> the <b>auction</b> closes. Surprisingly, primary dealers often submit bids in the auction that are higher in price than the {{concurrent}} when-issued ask price. We present evidence to show that {{this is due to the}} cost of revealing positive information too early by trading in when-issued markets <b>before</b> the <b>auction.</b> In addition, we examine what determines the dispersion of bids in the auction as well as test for collusive behavior in the bidding process...|$|R
