Secretly the nuns continued performing the church's work, catechizing children and adults, performing sacraments for the sick, and writing religious literature. In 1949, Sister Mary Augustina was arrested held in Kaunas, then sent to Kretinga and finally to Vilnius, where she was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. She was sent to the concentration camp at Abezė near Inta in the Komi Republic of Russia and after five years received amnesty. Upon her release, she returned to the sisters in Kaunas and resumed with their works. Between 1977 and 1990, Sister Mary Augustina participated in the underground literary movement, writing poems under the pseudonym [...] "Vynmedžio šakelė" [...] (meaning <b>vine</b> <b>stem),</b> which were published in Žurnalą Rūpintojėlis (Journal Pensive). She also translated theological works from French, German, and Polish sources into Lithuanian. Sister Mary Augustina died on 9 February 1990 at the home in Kaunas.

40|$|We have {{characterized}} the virome in single grapevines by 454 high-throughput sequencing of double-stranded RNA {{recovered from the}} <b>vine</b> <b>stem.</b> The analysis revealed a substantial set of sequences {{similar to those of}} fungal viruses. Twenty-six putative fungal virus groups were identified from a single plant source. These represented half of all known mycoviral families including the Chrysoviridae, Hypoviridae, Narnaviridae, Partitiviridae, and Totiviridae. Three of the mycoviruses were associated with Botrytis cinerea, a common fungal pathogen of grapes. Most of the rest appeared to be undescribed. The presence of viral sequences identified by BLAST analysis was confirmed by sequencing PCR products generated from the starting material using primers designed from the genomic sequences of putative mycoviruses. To further characterize these sequences as fungal viruses, fungi from the grapevine tissue were cultured and screened with the same PCR probes. Five of the mycoviruses identified in the total grapevine extract were identified again in extracts of the fungal cultures...|$|E
40|$|Aiming to {{evaluate}} the effect of vineyard floor management practices on water use and vine performance, a field experiment was carried out at the Dão Wine Research Station, located at Nelas, Center Portugal. The experiment {{was set up in}} 2010 in a mature vineyard planted with the red grape variety ‘Touriga Nacional’, using a 2 x 2 factorial design with the following treatments: inter-row soil management (permanent resident vegetation vs. soil tillage) and undervine floor management (mulch vs. herbicide). In this paper it will be presented data from 2013 growing season (four seasons after experiment setup). The volumetric soil moisture, assessed with a capacitance probe to a 1. 5 m depth, showed a decreasing pattern throughout the growing season in all treatments with the resident vegetation presenting lower values as compared to the tillage treatment, while no significant differences were observed between the two undervine floor management practices. From budburst to flowering the resident vegetation treatment showed a higher soil water depletion (up to 1. 5 m depth) than the tillage treatment but the relative situation was reversed during the flowering-veraison period, while no significant differences were observed during the ripening period. <b>Vine</b> <b>stem</b> water potential values showed a decreasing pattern along the season attaining very low values during September but with no significant differences between treatments. In general the soil management practices did not significantly affect vine vigor, yield and berry composition however, since these results are only from one season, further data analysis in ongoing in order to allow stronger conclusions. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{measurement}} and modelling of transpiration from squash (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne) {{growing in the}} field under a tropical maritime climate. Measurements were carried out on Tongatapu (175 degrees 12 ' W, 21 degrees 08 ' S), a coral atoll located in the Pacific Ocean. Transpiration was determined from heat-pulse measurements of sap flow in the <b>vine</b> <b>stem</b> using the T-max method. Steady-state porometry was used to monitor stomatal conductance (g(S), mm s(- 1)). The data were used to derive parameters for a functional model of conductance that includes response functions for light, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit of the air, and a novel response function for soil moisture. Leaf area development was monitored through the growing season using a point quadrant approach. The maximum leaf area was about 2. 7 m(2) per plant and the effective ground area was about 1 m(2) for each plant. Transpiration losses were calculated using a 2 -layer big-leaf model in combination with modelled stomatal response and measured leaf area. In general, the sap flow measurements were in good agreement with the calculations of plant water use. Peak water use was between 3 and 5 L per plant per day. Daily transpiration measurements from heat-pulse were used to derive a crop factor, K-C, for squash in this tropical maritime climate. The derived seasonal pattern of K-C {{was similar to the}} FAO recommended crop factor for squash. However, the growing season was a little shorter. Measured sap flow also revealed periods of short-term drought and leaf fungal disease that reduced the actual transpiration losses, and there was often a rapid recovery from water stress following rainfall events...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Tedeleaceae are late Paleozoic Filicalean ferns {{with two}} known genera, Ankyropteris and Senftenbergia, which {{partially}} overlap morphologically {{and have the}} same known stratigraphic ranges [...] Namurian A to Lower Permian in Euramerica. Ankyropteris is anatomically known and Senftenbergia is almost exclusively based on compression specimens. Both genera exhibit abaxially, laminar-borne sori and/or solitary sporangia with some schizaeoid attributes. The sporangia are pyriform to tear-drop shaped, erect to slightly curved with a two to multiseriate apical annulus and mature spores usually of the Raistrickia type. Detailed morphological comparisons of Ankyropteris with Senftenbergia emphasize generic overlaps as well as lack of congruence. Ankyropteris brongniartii, a classic vine in anatomy, defines the stratigraphic range of the genus and provides recurrent ecological observations of habit and associated plants in ecotonal swamp reaches {{as well as in}} volcanic environments and on other clastic substrates. Ankyropteris may have originated from the clepsydroid zygopterid clade outside of the swamps. Ankyropteris brongniartii occurred as an epiphytic vine on Psaronius tree ferns as they expanded into coal swamps and often co-occurred with Paralycopodites even earlier in Middle Pennsylvanian. <b>Vine</b> <b>stem</b> anatomy and functional morphology of aphlebiae are emphasized in A. brongniartii with comparisons to Austroclepsis, an early "vining" false tree fern. Anatomical comparisons of Ankyropteris species based on shoots emphasize divergent habits with similar robust sizes; all exhibited aphlebiae. Known only from coal balls, Ankyropteris corrugata (Westphalian A-B) had a rampant habit on exposed peat with a succulent, dichotomous rhizome and erect fronds. The Lower Pennsylvanian specimen of Ankyropteris hendricksii is a compact tree fern with crowded frond bases and intercalated roots. Tyloses commonly occur in A. corrugata and A. brongniartii indicating water-stressed conditions. Apical meristems of shoot and fronds are reported for the first time, suggesting response growth to disturbance and rapid burial...|$|E

40|$|English ivy (Hedera helix) is {{a member}} of the ginseng family of plants (Araliaceae). It grows as a vine for up to ten years {{producing}} deeply lobed, alternating, waxy leaves with three to five points. When the plant is mature and ready to bear fruit, the leaves are only slightly lobed, if at all. Leaves are thick, waxy, shiny dark green and have distinct pale colored veins. Mature plants produce umbels (umbrella –shaped clusters) of greenish white flowers in the fall resulting in a deep purple, soft skinned, berry-like fruit in the spring. Each berry may contain up to three seeds that can be widely dispersed by birds. <b>Vine</b> <b>stems</b> begin pale green and slender when growing along the ground and quickly become woody and stout on climbing <b>vines.</b> <b>Stems</b> produce rootlets that give the vine a hairy appearance and produce a sticky substance that allows the vine to cling to vertical surfaces.

It grows so rapidly that it surrounds and covers many native plants so that sunlight doesn’t reach them and they die. Once the vines create a thick mat across the ground, other plants have little chance to get reestablished. On trees, the vines can cling to the trunk and branches and grow up and over a 90 foot tree.
