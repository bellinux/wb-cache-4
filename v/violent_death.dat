40|$|ObjectiveTo assess if <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> were {{associated}} with pay days in Guatemala. DesignInterrupted time series analysis. SettingGuatemalan national autopsy databases. ParticipantsDaily violence-related autopsy data for 22 418 decedents from 2009 to 2012. Data were provided by the Guatemalan National Institute of Forensic Sciences. Multiple pay-day lags and other important days such as holidays were tested. Outcome measuresAbsolute and relative estimates of excess <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> on pay days and holidays. ResultsThe occurrence of <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> {{was not associated with}} pay days. However, a significant association was observed for national holidays, and this association was more pronounced when national holidays and pay days occurred simultaneously. This effect was observed mainly in males, who constituted the vast majority of <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> in Guatemala. An estimated 112 (coefficient= 3. 12; 95 % CI 2. 15 to 4. 08; p< 0. 01) more male <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> occurred on holidays than were expected. An estimated 121 (coefficient= 4. 64; 95 % CI 3. 41 to 5. 88; p< 0. 01) more male <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> than expected occurred on holidays that coincided with the first 2 days following a pay day. ConclusionsMen in Guatemala experience <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> at an elevated rate when pay days coincide with national holidays. Efforts to be better prepared for violence during national holidays and to prevent <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> by rescheduling pay days when these days co-occur with national holidays should be considered.

5000|$|The NEJM {{article on}} the survey states that both the IFHS and the IBC [...] "indicate that the 2006 study by Burnham et al. {{considerably}} overestimated the number of <b>violent</b> <b>deaths.</b> For example, to reach the 925 <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> per day reported by Burnham et al. for June 2005 through June 2006, as many as 87% of <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> would have been missed in the IFHS and more than 90% in the Iraq Body Count. This level of underreporting is highly improbable, given {{the internal and external}} consistency of the data and the much larger sample size and quality-control measures taken in the implementation of the IFHS." [...] The article also notes that the IFHS and IBC are consistent with each other on both the distribution of <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> by province and on the trend in levels of <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> over time, while both sources are inconsistent with the results of the Burnham et al. survey on these issues.|$|R

40|$|This paper intents to {{show that}} deep social transformations {{that took place in}} the Soviet Union, between middle 80 s and middle 90 s during XXth. century, provoqued a {{significant}} increase in <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> rates (suicides, homicides and accidents).   Our study follows a theoretical perspective based on Durkheim ideas, that try to explain variations in <b>violent</b> <b>deaths</b> rates analyzing changes in the intensity and nature of social relationships. The analysis of evolution of specific rates by region, sex and age allowed us to verify that groups more directly affected by social transformations were those that also presented the highest rates in the proportion of <b>violent</b> <b>deaths.</b>   </div...|$|R

X. 1905 piano sonata. The incident led him to further promote the anti-German and anti-Austrian ethos of the Russian Circle, which he had co-founded in 1897 and which would be officially banned by the Austrian police in 1915. In 1906 he approached the Czech poet Petr Bezruč, with whom he later collaborated, composing several choral works based on Bezruč's poetry. These included Kantor Halfar (1906), Maryčka Magdónova (1908), and Sedmdesát tisíc (1909).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, due to hunting, the Alpine ibex survived in the Gran Paradiso and Vanoise area. Approximately 60 {{individual}} ibex survived, here. Ibex were intensively hunted, partly for sport, {{but also because}} their body parts were thought to have therapeutic properties: talismans were made from a small cross-shaped bone near the ibex's heart {{in order to protect}} against <b>violent</b> <b>death.</b> Due to the alarming decrease in the ibex population, Victor Emmanuel, soon to be King of Italy, declared the Royal Hunting Reserve of the Gran Paradiso in 1856.

5|$|Amy Dudley's death {{caused a}} scandal. Despite the inquest's outcome, Robert Dudley was widely {{suspected}} to have orchestrated his wife's demise, a view {{not shared by}} most modern historians. He remained Elizabeth's closest favourite, but with respect to her reputation she could not risk a marriage with him. A tradition that Sir Richard Verney, a follower of Robert Dudley, organized Amy Dudley's <b>violent</b> <b>death</b> evolved early, and Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious and influential libel of 1584 against Robert Dudley, by then Earl of Leicester, perpetuated this version of events. Interest in Amy Robsart's fate was rekindled in the 19th century by Walter Scott's novel, Kenilworth. The most widely accepted modern explanations of her death have been breast cancer and suicide, although a few historians have probed murder scenarios. The medical evidence of the coroner's report, which was found in 2008, is compatible with accident as well as suicide and other violence.|$|E

Avidhava navami ("Unwidowed ninth"), the ninth lunar day, is for married women who died before their husband. Widowers invite Brahmin women as guests for their wife's shraddha. The twelfth lunar day is for children and ascetics who had renounced the worldly pleasures.

5|$|Andronikos I was {{the last}} of the Komnenoi to rule Constantinople, {{although}} his grandsons Alexios and David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204. Nevertheless, Andronikos's role in the collapse of the empire is controversial; historians disagree over the extent to which his brief reign influenced events after his death. Andonikos's coup, together with his <b>violent</b> <b>death,</b> had weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely. Furthermore, his so-called 'anti-Latin' policy has been criticised by some historians as a failure, in view of the increasing hostility it caused towards Byzantium in the west. In particular, Andonikos's failure to prevent the massacre of Latins in Constantinople in 1182 has been seen as especially significant, since henceforth Byzantine foreign policy was invariably perceived as sinister and anti-Latin in the west. It has even been argued that Andronikos's attempts to crush the aristocracy were damaging to the empire's military power, since the aristocracy had become indispensable to the defences of the state. On the other hand, his reforms in the provinces were both wise and beneficial to the internal health and prosperity of the empire.|$|E
