40|$|We {{report a}} 32 -year-old woman (1 -gravid, 1 -para) with a <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesion</b> in her uterus that {{was pointed out}} on {{ultrasound}} at 8 weeks' gestation. Amniocentesis at 15 weeks' gestation showed a normal female karyotype, 46 XX. As the pregnancy advanced, the mole-like lesion became relatively reduced. Throughout gestation, the maternal human chorionic gonadotropin level was normal, but the serum alpha fetoprotein level rose as her pregnancy progressed. Her fetus did not exhibit any remarkable anomalies. The patient visited our hospital complaining of a diminished feeling of fetal movements at 36 weeks 5 days' gestation, and intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) was confirmed. She delivered a 2336 -g female without any definite anomalies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pemphigus vulgaris is an {{autoimmune}} disease, normally {{associated with}} oral lesions that generally affects patients aged 40 - 60 years. The {{aim of this}} study was to report a case of pemphigus vulgaris presenting at an uncommon age with advanced periodontal disease, and to describe the treatment performed from the time of diagnosis through oral environment restoration and follow-up monitoring. One gingival <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesion</b> was biopsied. After the histological confirmation of pemphigus vulgaris, the patient was referred to a specialist for treatment of this systemic disease. With the improvement of the patientÕs clinical condition, teeth were extracted and oral rehabilitation was performed. The patient is being followed and is taking the appropriate medication. A direct immunofluorescence test was performed, but the patient had already started treatment with immunosuppressive medication at the time of the perilesional biopsy. The result of this test was negative. Pemphigus vulgaris manifests as extremely painful and persistent oral lesions. Thus, patient motivation to maintain oral health, preventive measures and the promotion of oral health, should be prioritized to avoid the worsening of the patientÕs systemic condition.

40|$|Direct {{immunofluorescence}} (IF) staining {{was compared}} with virus isolation for detection of herpes simplex viruses (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) directly in clinical materials. These included 199 <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesion</b> specimens and 280 tissue specimens. Correspondence between IF and isolation results was 88 % in testing for HSV in lesion specimens and 98 % in testing for HSV in various tissue (mostly brain) specimens. Overall, IF was positive for 82 % of the specimens in which HSV was demonstrated, and virus was isolated from 89 % of the HSV-positive specimens. IF was markedly {{more sensitive than}} isolation for demonstrating VZV in lesion and tissue specimens, detecting all of the specimens positive for VZV, whereas isolation detected only 23 %. IF detected VZV antigen {{in a number of}} lesion specimens taken late after onset, past the time when they would be expected to yield infectious virus. Specificity of positive IF reactions for HSV or VZV in the absence of virus isolation was supported by the facts that (i) staining was obtained with only a single, presumably homologous, immune conjugate, (ii) clinical symptoms were compatible with infection with the virus for which positive IF findings were obtained, and (iii) positive electron microscopy findings for herpesviruses or positive serological results for VZV were also obtained in some instances. Factors to be considered in achieving specificity of IF staining for these human herpesviruses are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Scrub typhus {{is caused}} by Orientia tsutsugamushi (formerly Rickettsia) and is {{transmitted}} to humans by an arthropod vector of the Trombiculidae family (Leptotrombidium deliense and L. akamushi). It {{is the most common}} re-emerging Rickettsial infection in India and many other South East Asian countries. In fact, scrub typhus is confined geographically to the Asia Pacific region, a billion people are at risk and nearly a million cases are reported every year. Scrub typhus appears particularly to be distributed in the tsutsugamushi triangle which is distributed over a very wide area of 13 million km 2 bound by Japan in the east, through China, the Philippines, tropical Australia in the south, and west through India, Pakistan, possibly to Tibet to Afghanistan, and southern parts of the USSR in the north. Eschar is the characteristic lesion that starts as a <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesion</b> at the site of mite feeding. Later, an ulcer forms with black necrotic center and an erythematous border along with regional lymphadenopathy. Other features are fever, maculopapular rash starting from the trunk, and spreading to the limbs.

40|$|The {{blisters}} in the inherited disorder, Hailey-Hailey disease, may {{be caused}} by defective epidermal junctional complexes. We evaluated these structural complexes in vivo and in vitro. We induced a <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesion</b> in the apparently normal skin of a patient with Hailey-Hailey disease and studied a biopsy of this lesion by transmission electron microscopy. To determine whether acantholysis was related to a defect in the number or assembly of intercellular junctions, we cultured Hailey-Hailey disease keratinocytes in medium containing 0. 1 mM Ca 2 + and increased the [Ca 2 +] to 1. 1 mM in order to induce assembly of cell-cell junctions. Keratinocytes were examined by double immunofluorescence with antibodies to the desmosome protein, desmoplakin, and the adherens junction protein, vinculin, at intervals after the increase in [Ca 2 +]. Characteristic Hailey-Hailey disease histopathology was observed by electron microscopy of the patient's skin after trauma, but we found no splitting of desmosomes. Based on the location, intensity, and rate of change of immunofluorescent staining, Hailey-Hailey and normal keratinocytes did not differ in their ability to assemble desmosomes and adherens junctions. Furthermore, we observed no significant morphologic differences between normal and Hailey-Hailey keratinocytes cultured in low and high [Ca 2 +]-containing media; Hailey-Hailey cells contained abundant normal-appearing desmosomes in 1. 1 mM [Ca 2 +]. Since Hailey-Hailey disease keratinocytes can assemble normal-appearing adherens junctions and desmosomes in vitro, the functional defect may not lie in assembly of cell-cell adhering junctions, or additional perturbation may be required to expose the defect...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} gain insight into the {{pathogenesis}} of the <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesion</b> of local primary vaccinia infection, newborn rabbits were injected with 0. 5 mg of purified inactivated vaccinia virus {{in an attempt to}} render them immunologically tolerant. Within a few days these, and control normal rabbits of the same age, were infected on the skin with active vaccinia virus. Most of the tolerant-prepared rabbits failed to develop a local lesion of vaccinia but some developed a very atypical lesion. Successful virus isolation from some, and the presence of inclusions in the tissues of others, indicated successful infection with the virus. Skin allergy to the active virus failed to develop in the test animals but did in the controls. Thus, there was a high degree of correlation between inability to produce delayed hypersensitivity to the viral antigens and failure to develop a vaccinial skin lesion, indicating the probable allergic nature of the primary lesion. There was also a high mortality rate in the group of tolerant-prepared, infected animals. It was associated with a spreading of the virus from the site of infection to the organs, suggesting that generalized vaccinial infection was the cause of death. The observations were compatible with the hypothesis that death was due to viral toxicity. The observations also suggest that, in the animal possessing normal immunological function, active immunity develops rapidly, perhaps {{at the level of the}} draining lymph node, to prevent appreciable virus from leaving the site of infection. The absence of detectable immunological activity toward vaccinia virus early in the tolerant-prepared animals and even after 1 month in some of the survivors, indicates that a high degree of immunological tolerance was produced against these microbial antigens...|$|E

40|$|Vibrio tapetis is {{primarily}} {{known as the}} causative agent for brown ring disease in bivalves, {{although it has been}} isolated from cultivated fish during mortalities on farms. Here we describe the first isolation of V. tapetis from wild-caught and subsequently captive-held Dover sole Solea solea. Pathological features consisted of multifocal circular greyish-white skin discolourations evolving into <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesions</b> and subsequent ulcerations on the pigmented side. On the non-pigmented side, multiple circular lesions-white at the center and red at the edges-were evident. Histological examination of the <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesions</b> revealed dermal fluid-filled spaces, collagen tissue necrosis and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, with large numbers of small rod-shaped bacteria. In the deep skin lesions, loss of scales and dermal connective tissue, with degeneration and fragmentation of the myofibres bordering the ulceration, were noted. Serotyping, DNA-DNA hybridization and REP- and ERIC-PCR techniques showed that the retrieved isolates displayed a profile similar to the representative strain of genotype/serotype O 2 which originally was isolated from carpet-shell clam Venerupis decussata and to which isolates obtained from wedge sole Dicologoglossa cuneata were also closely related...|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the major}} {{pathogens}} for human herpetic diseases, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV 1) causes herpes labialis, genital herpes and herpetic encephalitis. Our aim here was to investigate the infectious process of HSV 1 in rhesus macaques and the pathological features induced during this infection. Clinical symptoms that manifested in the rhesus macaque during HSV 1 infection included <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesions</b> and their pathological features. Viral distribution in the nervous tissues and associated pathologic changes indicated the typical systematic pathological processes associated with viral distribution of HSV 1. Interestingly, <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesions</b> recurred in oral skin or in mucosa associated with virus shedding in macaques within four to five months post‐infection,and viral latency‐associated transcript (LAT) mRNA was found in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) on day 365 post‐infection. Neutralization testing and enzyme‐linked immunospot (ELISpot) detection of specific T cell responses confirmed the specific immunity induced by HSV 1 infection. Thus, rhesus macaques could serve as an infectious model for HSV 1 due to their typical clinical symptoms and the pathological recurrence associated with viral latency in nervous tissues...|$|R

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) targets {{specific}} tissues {{for primary}} infection, secondary high-titer replication (e. g. foot and mouth where it causes typical <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesions)</b> and long-term persistence at some primary replication sites. Although integrin aVb 6 receptor {{has been identified}} as primary FMDV receptors in animals, their tissue distribution alone fails to explain these highly selective tropism-driven events. Thus, other molecular mechanisms must play roles in determining this tissue specificity. We hypothesized that differences in certain biological activities due to differential gene expression determine FMDV tropism and applied whole genome gene expression profiling to identify genes differentially expressed between FMDV-targeted and non-targeted tissues in terms of supporting primary infection, secondary replication including <b>vesicular</b> <b>lesions,</b> and persistence. Using statistical and bioinformatic tools to analyze the differential gene expression, we identified mechanisms that could explain FMDV tissue tropism based on its association with differential expression of integrin aVb 6 heterodimeric receptor (FMDV receptor), fibronectin (ligand of the receptor), IL- 1 cytokines, death receptors and the ligands, and multiple genes in the biological pathways involved in extracellular matrix turnover and interferon signaling found in this study. Our results together with reported findings indicate that differences in (1) FMDV receptor availability and accessibility, (2) type I interferon-inducible immune response, and (3) ability to clear virus infected cells via death receptor signaling play roles in determining FMDV tissue tropism and the additional increase of high extracellula...|$|R
