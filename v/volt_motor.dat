50|$|The first {{dedicated}} Technic motor was a 4.5 volt rounded brick (p/n 6216m) {{released in}} 1977 {{as part of}} the Expert Builder Power Pack (960-1) and Supplementary Set (870-1), this output via a small protruding axle that would rotate when the motor was powered. The motor was not geared, resulting in high-RPM, low-torque output. Gearboxes and a square casing were available. A 12 <b>volt</b> <b>motor</b> of the same physical dimensions as the 4.5 <b>volt</b> <b>motor</b> was also available in set 880-1. The 12 volt version is visually distinguishable by being black, rather than grey.|$|E

50|$|Some seeders/spreaders have {{directional}} fins {{to control}} {{the direction of the}} material that is thrown from the spreader. All broadcast spreaders require some form of power to spin the disk. On hand carried units, a hand crank spins gears to turn the disk. On tow behind units, the wheels spin a shaft that turns gears which, in turn, spin the disk. As is partially visible in one of the photos, with tractor mounted units, a mechanical P.T.O. shaft connected to the tractor and controlled by the tractor operator, spins the disk. There are some seeder/spreaders made for garden size tractors that use a 12 <b>volt</b> <b>motor</b> to spin the dispersing disk and yaw.|$|E
50|$|Tape tension {{was another}} cause of unreliability. Prerecorded eight-track tapes tended to hold {{only a single}} album, about 46 minutes of content, or 11.5 minutes per track. Consumers wanted the ability to record more music on a single cartridge, so {{manufacturers}} came out with units of greater capacity, i.e. 60 and 90 minutes tapes. A few 100 minutes tapes do exist. With the corresponding increase in tape length, there was a greater velocity differential between the tape being drawn {{from the center of}} the reel and the tape being fed back to the outer edge of the reel as it passed the capstan/pinch-roller assembly (loop length). A 90-minute tape also exerts more drag on the tape deck motor, making a large AC 120 <b>volt</b> <b>motor</b> imperative to play the longest tapes. Over time, cheaper tapes may tighten, making it more difficult to feed, and to maintain a constant playback speed. Once a tape sheds most of its graphite backing, it will bind up and the tape won't play.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in early mobile radio technology was that of converting the six or twelve volt power supply of the vehicle to the high voltage needed to operate the vacuum tubes in the radio. Early tube-type radios used dynamotors - essentially a six or twelve <b>volt</b> <b>motor</b> that turned a generator to provide the high voltages required by the vacuum tubes. Some early mobile radios were {{the size of a}} suitcase or had separate boxes for the transmitter and receiver. As time went on, power supply technology evolved to use first electromechanical vibrators, then solid-state power supplies to provide high voltage for the vacuum tubes. These circuits, called [...] "inverters", changed the 6V or 12V direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) which could be passed through a transformer to make high voltage. The power supply then rectified this high voltage to make the high voltage DC required for the vacuum tubes, (called valves in British English). The power supplies needed to power vacuum tube radios resulted in a common trait of tube-type mobile radios: their heavy weight due to the iron-core transformers in the power supplies. These high voltage power supplies were inefficient, and the filaments of the vacuum tubes added to current demands, taxing vehicle electrical systems. Sometimes, a generator or alternator upgrade was needed to support the current required for a tube-type mobile radio.|$|E

5000|$|The Inter Autoscooter is a French {{three-wheeled}} microcar {{that first}} {{appeared at the}} 1953 Paris Salon. Some say it was produced {{to compete with the}} Messerschmitt KR175 which also appeared that year. This is not surprising as both cars were built by aircraft companies and shared a similar cockpit and tandem seating layout. The Inter was produced by SNCAN in their aircraft factory at Villeurbanne in the region of Lyon; Just over 300 units were built between 1954 and 1956. Early advertising literature reveals that two models were offered, one with a cockpit cover that hinged open from the side and named the Berline, the other an open bodied version called the Torpedo. Both cars were powered by a small Ydral 175cc two-stroke engine driving the single rear wheel. The Inter had some unusual features not least being its ability to fold together its two front half axles so as to facilitate easy storage, however this feature only appears on the first few cars made as it proved to be impractical and was soon discontinued. The Inter also featured a device called a gyrostarter, this was in effect a kind of electric kick start made by the American electromechanical giant WestinghouseThe device consists of a built in electric 6 <b>volt</b> <b>motor</b> with a clutched flywheel, the momentum of the rotating flywheel is transferred to the engine by means of its clutch once it has built up sufficient speed, it sounds much like a helicopter preparing for take off! The device switches to being a generator once the engine is running. Considering the very small production run, approximately 38 vehicles survive in the hands of museums and collectors, of which only a few are still in running condition.|$|E

40|$|Petroleum {{activities}} have been frequently associated to environmental damage due to occurrence of {{oil spill in}} worldwide sea waters. In addition to this problem it must be considered that many non-petrol companies process oil derivatives and discharge their rejection in rivers, accidentally or purposely. The monitoring of water contamination is usually carried out by government agencies, {{as well as by}} private committees. Therefore, population rarely becomes totally aware of the facts concerning oil contamination in rivers and seas, unless these committees and agencies publish accurate data about it. Social participation is an important demand as to promoting politically correct environmental management, however it is necessary to provide instrumental support to achieve this aim. In this work it is proposed a “do it yourself” viscometer designed to estimate oil rate in bodies of water contaminated by ship spill or industry discharge. The instrument includes, among other components: one electric drill, one DC – 6 <b>volt</b> <b>motor</b> and one multimeter. Results show their reliability on the basis that the instrument allows a procedure which is capable of measuring viscosity in immiscible solutions unlike conventional viscometers. The viscometer is suggested as a tool for Rapid Assessment Program, which can meet social technology availability in order to cover qualitative and quantitative parameters...|$|E

40|$|The Idaho Botanical Garden is {{sponsoring}} a Senior Design team from Boise State University {{to create an}} interactive model of a Venus flytrap allowing patrons of the Idaho Botanical Garden firsthand experience with a carnivorous plant without activating or harming a live flytrap. This {{is a continuation of}} a project started in the 2012 Fall Semester. This year’s design approach has revolved around fixing the complications that were encountered in the first project. The external, life-like covering has experienced design revisions due to the limited amount of weight the 5 <b>volt</b> <b>motor</b> and multi-joint drive shaft can maneuver. The covering is to be made with a porous foam and 3 D paint to accomplish a light, but realistic appearance. The functionality of the design is accomplished with joystick sensors modeling Venus flytrap hairs, a stepper motor to close and open the model leaves, and an Arduino processor to model to correct Venus flytrap behavior. The Plexiglas case is fitted to the flytrap box to protect the mechatronics and increase the functional and visible lifespan. The model is expected to experience 400 activations daily. The mechatronic Venus flytrap is sure to be a main attraction, almost as popular as the real specimen...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the iterative process and steps taken {{to build a}} tidal power generator which works efficiently while causing no harm to marine life or habitat. A tidal power generator is a device that converts the mechanical energy from the horizontal tides in the ocean (or any flowing water body) into electrical energy. The design was undertaken as an interdisciplinary capstone project for seniors in mechanical and electrical engineering. The results {{will be used for}} research purposes in determining the efficiency of the specific design used and the overall feasibility of tidal power generation. A preliminary prototype consisting of the mechanical linkages and an airfoil was built and tested in the air to prove the various concepts employed work. Based on the results obtained, a full scale model was built and tested in the wind tunnel. An elliptical airfoil was used in harnessing the mechanical energy from the tidal flow. A deflector mounted on the system was to make the elliptical airfoil work bi-directionally. The mechanical linkage consisted of a belt and four sprockets which enable the generator to only see rotary motion in one direction. Finally, a small electric motor was used as a generator to convert the mechanical energy harnessed into electrical energy. The tests performed show that tidal power generation through airfoils is a viable technology with a lot of potential. Using a bi-symmetric airfoil, 5 mW of power was produced with a small six <b>volt</b> <b>motor</b> in 40 miles/hour wind, with the airfoil moving at over 200 rpm. Rudimentary testing of the same system with an 85 % efficient permanent magnet DC generator shows possibilities of over 50 W. Given more time in the wind tunnel and the water tunnel (which were fully occupied by graduate students and broken respectively), more elaborate tests could have been performed on the tidal generator. Some improvements which can be made to the system include using lighter bellows seals that can collapse under their own weight, this would decrease the force required to move the airfoil and hence increase the rpm and power generation. Also, an improved design should include a control system that takes into account the flow speed of the water and consequently adjusts the angle of attack of the airfoil. The switching mechanism for the airfoil should also be improved to allow for bi-directional functionality of the system. The system met the majority of its functional requirements and with some minor improvements and more testing {{has the potential to be}} very successful...|$|E

40|$|Introduction & {{objectives}} Adaptive {{deep brain}} stimulation (aDBS) uses feedback from brain signals to guide stimulation. A recent acute trial of unilateral aDBS showed that aDBS can lead to substantial improvements in contralateral hemibody Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and may be superior to conventional continuous DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). We test whether potential benefits are retained with bilateral aDBS and {{in the face of}} concurrent medication. Methods We applied bilateral aDBS in 4 patients with PD undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. aDBS was delivered bilaterally with independent triggering of stimulation according to the amplitude of beta activity at the corresponding electrode. Mean stimulation voltage was 3. 0 +/- 0. 1 <b>volts.</b> <b>Motor</b> assessments consisted of double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores that included both limb and axial features. Results UPDRS scores were 43 % (p= 0. 04; Cohen's d= 1. 62) better with aDBS than without stimulation. Motor improvement with aDBS occurred despite an average time on stimulation (ToS) of only 45 %. Levodopa was well tolerated during aDBS and led to further reductions in ToS. Conclusion Bilateral aDBS can improve both axial and limb symptoms and can track the need for stimulation across drug states...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 A machine {{capable of}} demonstrating and solving {{queueing}} problems {{is useful to}} any systems engineer. This paper describes a successful queueing simulator constructed from readily available materials. The machine is easy to operate, portable, and simple enough {{to be built in}} any well equipped machine shop. The educational values of a queueing simulator are unlimited. For this reason the paper was oriented towards classroom applications. Example problems present ample opportunity to compare theoretical and simulator solutions. Although constant, normal, and Poisson distributions are illustrated, any arrival or service pattern is acceptable. More realistic answers are obtained for many problems because arrival and service rates can be correlated to queue length. Single-server, multi-server, and multi-stage queues can be analyzed. This versatility aids conceptual realization required for system modifications. From the data available, simulator and theoretical solutions compare reasonably well. When making an industrial waiting line study a number of proposals must be investigated. By comparing them on the simulator the most economical one can usually be chosen. Thus, in addition to being an educational aid, the simulator is a practical problem solving device. Principles of operation are visually displayed by schematics of the electrical and mechanical systems. Queue length is determined by the number of one-quarter inch steel balls waiting for service from holes punched in a tape, The number and spacing of the tape holes represents the desired mathematical distribution. Tape speeds are controlled by varying the voltages applied to 12 <b>volt</b> <b>motors.</b> Total material cost amounted to 200, External power is supplied by 110 volt AC current.

The current system {{does not have a}} user-friendly interface and is very loud (approx. 90 dB). These issues were addressed to answer the following question: how can the current PVAC system be optimized to decrease noise and produce a user friendly interface while maintaining current run time? To obtain the sound reduction desired it was decided to surround the motors with a hard plastic polystyrene case created by a vacuum forming process and then lined with sound-reducing convoluted foam. The motor exhaust was channeled through a single muffler out of the bottom of the case. This resulted in a sound reduction of over 20 decibels.
