50|$|In economics, the 'J curve' {{refers to}} the trend of a country’s trade balance {{following}} a devaluation or depreciation under a certain set of assumptions. A devalued currency means imports are more expensive, and {{on the assumption that}} the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> and exports change little immediately, this causes a depreciation of the current account (a bigger deficit or smaller surplus). After some time, though, the volume of exports may start to rise because of their lower more competitive prices to foreign buyers, and domestic consumers may buy fewer of the costlier imports. Eventually, if this happens, the trade balance should improve on what it was before the devaluation. Likewise, if there is a currency revaluation or appreciation the same reasoning may be applied and will lead to an inverted J-curve.|$|E
5000|$|The {{manner in}} which the Soviet Union transacted trade varied from one trade partner to another. Soviet trade with the Western industrialized {{countries}}, except Finland, and most Third World countries was conducted with hard currency, that is, currency that was freely convertible. Because the ruble was not freely convertible, the Soviet Union could only acquire hard currency by selling Soviet goods or gold on the world market for hard currency. Therefore, the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> from countries using convertible currency depended on the amount of goods the Soviet Union exported for hard currency. Alternative methods of cooperation, such as barter, counter trade, industrial cooperation, or bilateral clearing agreements were much preferred. These methods were used in transactions with Finland, members of Comecon, the People's Republic of China, Yugoslavia, and a number of Third World countries.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a model of}} {{international}} duopoly is developed involving competition in both prices and levels of environmental friendliness, {{and the implications of}} government policies are studied.

Whether consumers lose or gain from such a regulatory increase depends on consumption spillover effects. We also show that, under certain conditions, the duopoly's equilibrium choice of levels of environmental friendliness is socially optimal. ...|$|R

5000|$|During {{the medieval}} era, Arab {{entrepreneurs}} adopted sugar production techniques from India and expanded the industry. Medieval Arabs {{in some cases}} set up large plantations equipped with on-site sugar mills or refineries. The cane sugar plant, which is native to a tropical climate, requires both {{a lot of water}} and a lot of heat to thrive. The cultivation of the plant spread throughout the medieval Arab world using artificial irrigation. Sugar cane was first grown extensively in medieval Southern Europe during the period of Arab rule in Sicily beginning around the 9th century known as the Emirate of Sicily [...] In addition to Sicily, Spain which at the time was known as Al-Andalus was an important center of sugar production [...] beginning in the 9th century. Sugar was exported throughout Europe. The <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> increased in the later medieval centuries as indicated by the increasing references to sugar consumption in late medieval Western writings. But cane sugar remained an expensive import. Its price per pound in 14th and 15th century England was about equally as high as imported spices from tropical Asia such as mace (nutmeg), ginger, cloves, and pepper, which had to be transported across the Indian Ocean in that era.|$|E
