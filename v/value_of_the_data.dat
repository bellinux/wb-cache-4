25|$|IT security: Sometimes {{referred}} to as computer security, information technology security (IT security) is information security applied to technology (most often some form of computer system). It is worthwhile to note that a computer {{does not necessarily mean}} a home desktop. A computer is any device with a processor and some memory. Such devices can range from non-networked standalone devices as simple as calculators, to networked mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise/establishment due to the nature and <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> within larger businesses. They are responsible for keeping all of the technology within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to breach into critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.|$|E

60|$|The {{observations}} {{for solar}} radiation were {{taken with a}} black-bulb thermometer, and also with actinometers, but the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> afforded by the latter not being fixed or comparative, I shall give the results in a separate section. (See Appendix K.) From a multitude of desultory observations, I conclude that at 7,400 feet, 125.7 degrees, or + 67 degrees above {{the temperature of the}} air, is the average maximum effect of the sun's rays on a black-bulb thermometer* [From the mean of very many observations, I find that 10 degrees is the average difference {{at the level of the}} sea, in India, between two similar thermometers, with spherical bulbs (half-inch diam.), the one of black, and the other of plain glass, and both being equally exposed to the sun's rays.] throughout the year, amounting rarely to + 70 degrees and + 80 degrees in the summer months, but more frequently in the winter or spring. These results, though greatly above what are obtained at Calcutta, are not much, if at all, above what may be observed on the plains of India. This effect is much increased with the elevation. At 10,000 feet in December, at 9 a.m., I saw the mercury mount to 132 degrees with a difl: of + 94 degrees, whilst the temperature of shaded snow hard by was 22 degrees; at 13,100 feet, in January, at 9 a.m., it has stood at 98 degrees, diff. + 68.2 degrees; and at 10 a.m., at 114 degrees, diff. + 81.4 degrees, whilst the radiating thermometer on the snow had fallen at sunrise to 0.7 degree. In December, at 13,500 feet, I have seen it 110 degrees, diff. + 84 degrees; at 11 a.m., 11,500 feet; 122 degrees, diff: + 82 degrees. This is but a small selection from many instances of the extraordinary power of solar radiation in the coldest months, at great elevations.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} method to {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> a sensor in a classification task when the uncertainty is represented by belief functions as understood in the transferable belief model. This reliability is represented by a discounting factor that minimizes {{the distance between the}} pignistic probabilities computed from the dis- counted beliefs and <b>the</b> actual <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> in a learning set. We then describe {{a method to}} tune <b>the</b> discounting factors <b>of</b> several sensors when their reports are merged in order to reach an aggregated report. They are computed so that together they minimize the distance between the pignistic probabilities computed from the combined dis- counted belief functions and <b>the</b> actual <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> in a learning set.
