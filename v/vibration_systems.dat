50|$|There are {{two main}} {{technologies}} of vibration drilling: self-maintained <b>vibration</b> <b>systems</b> and forced <b>vibration</b> <b>systems.</b> Most vibration drilling technologies are still at a research stage. It {{is the case of}} the self-maintained vibrations drilling: the eigen frequency of the tool is used {{in order to make it}} naturally vibrate while cutting; vibrations are self-maintained by a mass-spring system included in the tool holder. Other works use a piezoelectric system to generate and control the vibrations. These systems allow high vibration frequencies (up to 2 kHz) for small magnitude (about a few micrometers); they are particularly suitable for drilling small holes. Finally, vibrations can be generated by mechanical systems: the frequency is given by the combination of the rotation speed and the number of oscillation per rotation (a few oscillations per rotation), the magnitude is about 0.1 mm.|$|E

Moreover, the average method is applied to derive the power transfer rate under the condition of two harmonic force excitation systems.

40|$|Magnetic damper has the {{advantages}} of a linear damping force, a non-contact mechanism and being good at hot and vacuum circumstances. However, its damping coefficient is not so large, {{so that it is}} necessary to use a force magnifying mechanism in order to obtain a large resisting force. When the damping force is magnified by a magnifying mechanism, the inertia force of a conductor plate is also magnified. This magnified inertia force exerts a bad influence on the effects of vibration suppression for a vibration system in high frequency range. In this paper, two types of <b>vibration</b> <b>systems</b> in which a magnetic damper was attached to a primary mass through a spring were considered in order to make the magnetic damper effective in wide frequency range.
