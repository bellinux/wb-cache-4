25|$|STEC-HUS occurs after {{ingestion}} of {{a strain of}} bacteria expressing Shiga toxin(s), usually types of E. coli, that expresses <b>verotoxin</b> (also called Shiga-like toxin). E. coli can produce stx1 and/or stx2 Shiga toxins, the latter being more dangerous and {{a combination of both}} toxins in certain ratios is usually associated with HUS. These Shiga toxins bind GB3 receptors, globotriaosylceramide, which are present in renal tissue more than any other tissue and are also found in central nervous system neurons and other tissue. Children have more GB3 receptors than adults which may be why children are more susceptible to HUS. Cattle, swine, deer, and other mammals do not have GB3 receptors, but can be asymptomatic carriers of Shiga toxin-producing bacteria. Some humans can also be asymptomatic carriers. Once the bacteria colonizes, diarrhea followed by bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, typically follows. HUS develops about 5–10 days after onset of diarrhea, with decreased urine output (oliguria), blood in the urine (hematuria), kidney failure, thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets) and destruction of red blood cells (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia). Hypertension is common. In some cases, there are prominent neurologic changes.|$|E

The prevalence of <b>verotoxins</b> in fecal samples was lower in yearling cattle than in cull cows, whereas the prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in fecal samples was higher in yearling cattle than in cull cows.

This inflammation results in the diarrhea and even dysentery that are the hallmarks of Shigella infection. Some strains of Shigella produce toxins which contribute to disease during infection. S. flexneri strains produce ShET1 and ShET2, which may contribute to diarrhea.

40|$|Summary. Fourteen {{hybridoma}} {{cell lines}} were isolated that produced monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to purified <b>Verotoxins</b> 1 and 2 (VT 1, VT 2) of Escherichia coli of serotype 0 1 57 : H 7. Of these MAbs, eight {{were obtained by}} immunisation of BALB/c mice with purified VT 1, and six were obtained from BALB/c mice immunised with purified VT 2. With the exception of MAb 1 C 5, with a heavy chain of IgGZb class, antibodies produced from mice immunised with heat-treated toxin were of IgM class. MAbs produced from mice immunised with heat-treated VT 1 or VT 2 reacted with both <b>verotoxins</b> in ELISA, and Western-blot analysis revealed that they reacted with subunit A and the Al fragment of nicked subunit A of both toxins, but not with subunit B; furthermore, none of them neutralised Vero cytotoxicity or mouse lethality of either toxin. In contrast, MAbs produced from mice immunised with heat-treated and formalin-treated VTl reacted in Western blots with subunits A and B of VT 1 and subunit A, but not subunit B, of VT 2, reacted in ELISA with VT 1 only, and neutralised Vero cytotoxicity and mouse lethality of VT 1 but not of VT 2.

Gb 3 within detergent-resistant membranes, an index of glycolipid-cholesterol enriched lipid rafts, is required for in vitro cytotoxicity.

Detergent-sensitive glomerular components may provide age-related protection against <b>verotoxin</b> glomerular binding. Mouse glomeruli remained <b>verotoxin</b> unreactive after detergent extraction, whereas tubular binding was lost. Cholesterol extraction induced strong <b>verotoxin</b> binding in poorly reactive adult glomeruli, suggesting cholesterol can mask Gb 3 in glomerular lipid rafts.

Treatment of ACHN cells with VTs induced prompt growth inhibition and cell death, and fragmentation of the genomic DNA in cells, typical of apoptosis, was observed. The expression of apoptotic antigen 7 A 6 detected by APO 2. 7 antibody in ACHN cells further supports the occurrence of apoptosis {{as a result of}} VT treatment. Cycloheximide enhanced VT-mediated apoptosis of ACHN cells, suggesting a strong correlation between the inhibition of protein synthesis and VT-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-α had a synergistic effect on VT-mediated apoptosis in ACHN cells.

Both VT 1 and VT 2 stimulated a weak, transient increase in c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity and a strong activation of both p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activity in human monocytes, which was sustained in the case of p 38 MAP kinase. Stimulation of human monocytes with VT 2 (100 ng ml− 1) did not result in an increase in apoptosis; however, the toxin stimulated the release of both TNF-α and GM-CSF. Pretreatment of human monocytes with the p 38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB 203580, at concentrations from 100 nm to 10 μm, significantly decreased the VT 1 - and VT 2 -induced TNF-α and GM-CSF release from monocytes. In contrast, inhibition of MEK 1 with PD 98059 only significantly decreased GM-CSF release. Pretreatment of monocytes with SP 600125 inhibited both GM-CSF and TNF-α production; however, significant effects upon p 38 MAP kinase and ERK activation were observed.

Our survey of doctors {{who took care of}} those patients showed that most patients had received antibiotics, especially fosfomycin which comprised 84 % of the prescribed treatment. Since the administration of antibiotics for EHEC infection is under discussion, we analysed the effect of fosfomycin on production/release of <b>verotoxins</b> (VTs). Addition of fosfomycin into EHEC culture in CAYE broth at 2 and 5 h after start of incubation caused marked increase of VT 1 release. This observation warns of the possibility of fosfomycin treatment making the disease worse...|$|R
