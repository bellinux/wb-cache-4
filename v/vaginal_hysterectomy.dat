25|$|Ureteral {{injury is}} not {{uncommon}} and occurs in 0.2 per 1,000 cases of <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomy</b> and 1.3 per 1,000 cases of abdominal hysterectomy. The injury usually occurs in the distal ureter close to the infundibulopelvic ligament or as a ureter crosses below the uterine artery, often from blind clamping and ligature placement to control hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomy</b> is {{performed}} entirely through the vaginal canal and has clear advantages over abdominal surgery such as fewer complications, shorter hospital stays and shorter healing time.

2500|$|Handy {{named his}} sister Cornelia Holbrook of [...] in San Francisco administrix of his estate, which he divided among his five children. His ex-wife Mary unsuccessfully contested the will, and Holbrook sold all of Handy's Arizona property, {{including}} his office, horses, buggies, medical books, instruments, and mining claims. Handy's mother Roseanne's name {{was on the}} deed that Handy had coerced Mary into signing over. After the divorce, Roseanne Handy dropped the lawsuit to evict Mary from the Handy home. A year later Mary got a judge to cancel the deed and she regained ownership of the home. Three months after Goodfellow vainly tried to save her husband, Goodfellow performed his first <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomy</b> on Mary. Her continued health challenges {{turned out to be}} from cervical cancer. She recovered for about four months when the cancer returned. Longing to see her children before she died, she asked her former sister-in-law and mother-in-law to send the children to Tucson, but they refused. Mary died on January 28, 1893.|$|E
30|$|This {{technique}} was {{developed over the}} last 25  years. As early as 1984, our teacher, Kurt Semm, was already using laparoscopic assistance in difficult <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies</b> [14].|$|R
30|$|Laparoscopic hysterectomies {{first began}} by being laparoscopic {{assisted}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies,</b> then total laparoscopic hysterectomies and with introduction of mechanical morcellation mostly supra cervical laparoscopic hysterectomies using three, {{four or five}} ports (or trocars).|$|R
40|$|Objective. To provide {{descriptive}} statistics on hysterectomy for benign gynecological {{conditions in the}} Netherlands and to analyze regional and temporal variations in hysterectomy rates and surgical routes. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. Dutch hospitals. Population. All women with a hysterectomy for benign gynecological conditions in the Netherlands in 19952005. Methods. This study {{is based on an}} analysis of the Dutch registry of hospital admissions for 19952005. Main outcome measures. The age-adjusted hysterectomy rate and age- and diagnosis-adjusted proportion of <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies</b> for each Dutch healthcare region and time period. Results. The average annual crude hysterectomy rate for benign disease only, was 17. 2 per 10 similar to 000 women of all ages. The vaginal route was chosen for 50. 8 % of the patients. During the study period, the number of hysterectomies for bleeding disorders declined almost 25 %. Among 27 Dutch healthcare regions, the age-adjusted hysterectomy rates for bleeding disorders and pelvic organ prolapse varied 2. 2 - and 2. 3 -fold, respectively. The average annual age- and diagnosis-adjusted proportion of <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies</b> varied from 43. 4 to 63. 8 %. The regional differences with regard to rate and proportion declined slightly over time. Conclusions. The Netherlands is among the countries with the lowest hysterectomy rates and the highest proportion of <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies.</b> The regional differences indicate that a further decrease in the hysterectomy rates and an increase in the proportion of <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies</b> are possibl...|$|R

50|$|Injuries to the ureter {{with certain}} forms of trauma {{including}} penetrating abdominal injuries and injuries at high speeds followed by an abrupt stop (e.g., a high speed car accident). The ureter is injured in 0.2 per 1,000 cases of <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies</b> and 1.3 per 1,000 cases of abdominal hysterectomies, near the infundibulopelvic (suspensory) ligament or where the ureter courses posterior to the uterine vessels.|$|R

5000|$|Vaginal {{evisceration}} is an [...] of {{the small}} intestine that occurs through the vagina, typically subsequent to <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomy,</b> and especially {{as a consequence of}} sexual intercourse after the surgery. It is a surgical emergency.|$|E

30|$|With {{this series}} {{we were also}} able to confirm that this {{technique}} can be applied in most adnexectomy procedures; in prolapse cases, because the ligament stumps are discernable; and in cases of a narrow vagina or an immobile uterus, as fewer instruments are employed than with the classical technique, and these can be kept near {{the middle of the}} vaginal shaft. This means that the number of <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies</b> will increase.|$|R
30|$|Discussion: <b>Vaginal</b> radical <b>hysterectomy</b> with laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy is {{feasible}} and safe {{with regards to}} mortality and has low morbility.|$|R
30|$|We {{believe these}} studies have {{essentially}} demonstrated that thermal hemostasis is less painful than traditional hemostasis with sutures. Purohit confirmed this and noted {{a decrease in the}} use of analgesics in 88 % of cases if <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies</b> were carried out with laparoscopic bipolar forceps [14]. In a recent paper Zubke et al. [15] decreased the dose of pain medication in 65 % of cases with the use of BiClamp instead of classical ligatures.|$|R
50|$|When {{performing}} a <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomy,</b> surgeons should aim to avoid damaging surrounding tissue or drying the vaginal cuff. Surgeons should take extra care to align the tissues, and include sufficient undamaged tissue. Instead of single-layer figure-of-eight sutures, two-layer sutures can aid in preventing vaginal evisceration.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomy</b> is {{performed}} entirely through the vaginal canal and has clear advantages over abdominal surgery such as fewer complications, shorter hospital stays and shorter healing time.

30|$|With reduced {{postoperative}} pain requirements, less need for sutures and shortened postoperative stay, important economic arguments could be raised {{for this new}} approach. While we observed one unusual complication out of 40 cases (2.5 %), {{we feel that the}} BiClamp bicoagulation forceps offer a safe and interesting new concept to <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies</b> that can be combined with other vaginal operations, for example, the insertion of a tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) and pelvic floor surgery [10].|$|R
40|$|Background Large {{geographic}} {{variations in}} hysterectomy rates are well known; however, {{very little is}} known about geographic variations in the route of the procedure, i. e. whether it is performed abdominally or vaginally. We compared utilization rates for abdominal and <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies</b> for the 14 Regional Health Authorities of England, and Northern Ireland over a three-year period. Methods Data were collected in the form of hospital episode statistics and small area analysis techniques were used to document regional variations. Results Large regional differences in the utilization of <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies</b> were recorded. Three areas in particular (Northern Ireland, Yorkshire and NW Thames) displayed high vaginal to abdominal ratios. Northern Ireland recorded the highest ratio (0366), Mersey Regional Health Authority the lowest (0 - 139). The use of the vaginal route was found to increase with age, and was the most common route for the> 65 years age group. Conclusion Despite an increasing volume of evidence advocating the use of the vaginal route, {{there appears to be a}} resistance to its use, except in older women. The role of physician practice style, and in particular group clinical judgement, is highlighted as being significantly involved in explaining the observed geographic variations...|$|R

We emphasize {{the use of the}} vaginal route and posterior colpotomy in the application of natural orifice surgery in <b>vaginal</b> <b>hysterectomies</b> and surgical access to adnexa, which includes tubal ligation. We highlight the need for mastering these surgical modalities, which can bring great advantages to patients in Brazil...|$|R
