25|$|The {{principal}} {{mechanism of}} ventilation in VIP latrines is {{the action of}} wind blowing {{across the top of}} the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> The wind creates a strong circulation of air through the superstructure, down through the squat hole, across the pit and up and out of the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> Unpleasant fecal odors from the pit contents are thus sucked up and exhausted out of <b>vent</b> <b>pipe,</b> leaving the superstructure odor-free. In some cases solar-powered fans are added giving a constant outwards flow from the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flies {{searching for}} an {{egg-laying}} site are attracted by fecal odors coming from the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe,</b> but they are prevented from entering by the flyscreen at the outlet of the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> Some flies may enter into the pit via the squat hole and lay their eggs there. When new adult flies emerge, they instinctively fly towards light. However, if the latrine is dark inside, the only light they can see {{is at the top}} of the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> Since the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> is covered by a fly screen at the top, flies will not be able to escape and eventually will die and fall back into the pit.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{most modern}} high-efficiency heating {{appliances}} {{do not require}} a chimney. Such appliances are generally installed near an external wall, and a noncombustible wall thimble allows a <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> to run directly through the external wall.|$|E

50|$|Poor {{plumbing}} vent {{design or}} extra windy conditions affecting <b>vent</b> <b>pipes</b> {{can also cause}} water seals to be siphoned or blown out of traps.|$|R
25|$|The {{ventilated}} improved {{pit latrine}} (VIP) is a pit latrine {{with a black}} pipe (<b>vent</b> <b>pipe)</b> fitted to the pit and a screen (flyscreen) at the top outlet of the pipe. VIP latrines are an improvement to overcome the disadvantages of simple pit latrines, e.g. fly and mosquito nuisance and unpleasant odors. The smell is carried upwards by the chimney effect and flies are prevented from leaving the pit and spreading disease.|$|E
25|$|In Reactors 1, 2, and 3, {{overheating}} {{caused a}} reaction between {{the water and}} the zircaloy, creating hydrogen gas. On 12 March, an explosion in Unit 1 was caused by the ignition of the hydrogen, destroying {{the upper part of the}} building. On 14 March, a similar explosion occurred in the Reactor 3 building, blowing off the roof and injuring eleven people. On the 15th, there was an explosion in the Reactor 4 building due to a shared <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> with Reactor 3.|$|E
25|$|The {{water in}} the toilet bowl is {{connected}} to a pipe shaped like an upside-down U. One side of the U channel is arranged as a siphon tube longer than the {{water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The bottom of the drain pipe limits the height of {{the water in the}} bowl before it flows down the drain. The water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas entering the building. Sewer gas escapes through a <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> attached to the sewer line.|$|E

25|$|An {{experimental}} <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> {{was installed}} at Lake Nyos in 2001 to remove {{gas from the}} deep water, but such a solution for the much larger Lake Kivu would be considerably more expensive. No plan has been initiated {{to reduce the risk}} posed by Lake Kivu. The approximately 500million tonnes of carbon dioxide in the lake is a little under 2 percent of the amount released annually by human fossil fuel burning. Therefore, the process of releasing it could potentially have costs beyond building and operating the system.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drainâ€”thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> attached to the sewer line.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the limited ability to handle {{transverse}} loads with brick, chimneys in houses were often built in a [...] "stack", with a fireplace on each floor of the house sharing a single chimney, often with such a stack at the front and back of the house. Today's central heating systems have made chimney placement less critical, and the use of non-structural gas <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> allows a flue gas conduit to be installed around obstructions and through walls.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, a <b>venting</b> <b>pipe</b> was {{inserted}} into the lake, {{in an effort to}} prevent the disaster from recurring. Initially a pump was needed to pull water from the bottom, but as carbon dioxide began to come out of solution it created buoyancy in the water in the pipes, allowing the pump to be turned off.|$|R
5000|$|Southerly Mine Control Hut: This is {{the larger}} of the two structures, being square in plan and mostly buried in the first dune. The {{entrance}} is from the west, and has a front hall with a steel door which has been attached more recently. The walls have timber grounds cast into the concrete, and the ceiling has two <b>vent</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|These were {{specifically}} {{made for}} the Photo-Reconnaissance Spitfires, including the PR Mk X and XI; no armament was fitted and the [...] "D" [...] shaped leading edges of the wings, ahead of the main spar, were converted into integral fuel tanks, each carrying 66 gallons. To avoid the expansion of fuel in hot weather damaging the wing, pressure relief valves, incorporating small external <b>vent</b> <b>pipes,</b> were fitted near the wing tips.|$|R
2500|$|Each camp-site has between {{eight and}} fifteen camping pads, a toilet, {{untreated}} rainwater tanks, camp benches and, except for Blanket Bay, a shelter. [...] The Clivus Multrum toilets are a self-contained, waterless, odourless continuous composting system. [...] They were sized above their capacity {{taking into account}} climatic factors. [...] Waste material and wood shavings compost in the tanks and the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> to reduce odours. Recycled red gum posts were sought from demolished wharfs at Docklands, which are used as feature posts for the toilets and shelter.|$|E
2500|$|Composting toilets use {{bacteria}} to decompose human feces into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens {{as well as}} most of the mass of the waste. [...] Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of [...] "humanure" [...] for growing food. The risk is microbial and viral contamination. [...] In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months. [...] To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Human {{whistling}} unaided by any instrument can be {{used for}} musical recreation, as a whistled language for communication over distances too great for articulate speech, or even as [...] a form of harassment. Musical instruments include the nose whistle or nose flute, the tin whistle and the slide whistle. [...] Since a whistle produces a loud sound that carries over a great distance, whistles are useful for signalling. [...] On ships, the boatswain's call is used to alert members of the crew. A dog whistle {{can be used}} to train a dog for hunting, herding, or other occupations. Industrial plants often use a steam whistle to signal shift changes or to give alarms of emergencies; steam locomotives were equipped with train whistles for warning and signalling. A small-scaled steam whistle is found on a whistling kettle, to alert the user that water is boiling. [...] Storage tanks may be equipped with a whistle vent which sounds continually as the tank is being filled; when the tank level covers the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe,</b> the whistle stops and the tank is full.|$|E
40|$|AbstractGas venting is an {{important}} step in the emergency repair of natural gas pipeline accidents. Accurately estimating the gas venting time is of great significance for arranging gas pipeline emergency repair process. Therefore, the venting model is built with Stoner Pipeline Simulator (SPS), and the influencing factors of venting time are studied by SPS dynamic simulation. The results show that pipe length, pipe pressure, pipe diameter and diameter of gas <b>venting</b> <b>pipe</b> can affect the gas venting time. And then a empirical law of natural gas <b>venting</b> time and <b>pipe</b> parameters is summed up, which can provide theoretical support for the organization of emergency repair...|$|R
50|$|Finch {{recognized}} that when tobacco curing barns switched from wood to gas or oil fired heaters in the 1940s, bluebirds {{were attracted to}} the metal <b>vent</b> <b>pipes</b> with rain caps as potential nesting sites. Millions of bluebirds became trapped in the pipes and the combustion chambers to starve. As many as 20 dead bluebirds were found when the burners were cleaned. The eastern bluebird was virtually extirpated from tobacco producing areas in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|A {{gooseneck}} (or goose neck) is a 180Â° {{pipe fitting}} {{at the top}} of a vertical pipe that prevents entry of water. Common implementations of goosenecks are ventilator piping or ducting for bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans, ship holds, landfill methane <b>vent</b> <b>pipes,</b> or any other piping implementation exposed to the weather where water ingress would be undesired. It is so named because the word comes from the similarity of pipe fitting to the bend in a goose's neck.|$|R
60|$|The sixth is the {{indispensable}} water-hole. It is short, but tricky. Teeing off from {{just outside the}} bathroom door, you have to loft the ball {{over the side of}} the bath, holing out in the little <b>vent</b> <b>pipe,</b> at the end where the water runs out.|$|E

Saxon {{registered}} another black mark against Oakland. Mary was one more destroyed. They lived only five years, on the average, Saxon had heard somewhere. She looked at the coin and tossed it into the kitchen sink. When she cleaned the clams, she heard the coin tinkle down the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E

50|$|Sutton Manor {{was one of}} {{the largest}} pits in the Lancashire Coalfield, the deepest of the two shafts going over 2,000 ft into the earth. Owing to their depth, they were not filled in: instead two three-metre thick {{reinforced}} concrete plugs were lifted into position over the two shafts, with <b>venting</b> <b>pipes</b> for methane. This has meant that annual surveys are carried out on the shafts; however recent surveys have shown that the shafts have little water in them.|$|R

The {{samples were collected}} with SUMMA canisters and were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a modified EPA TO- 14 procedure. The {{data suggest that the}} <b>vent</b> <b>pipes</b> of the 218 -W- 4 C trenches had elevated concentrations of volatile organic compounds.

40|$|Discrete and {{continuous}} measurement of indoor radon concentrations, air flow rates, and pressure differentials for passive and active operational configurations of a passive radon control system were {{performed at the}} Biotechnology Research and Development Facility of the University of Florida, in Alachua County, Florida. The system was installed during construction and incorporated an extended six-inch gravel bed underneath the entire foundation slab with upper and lower surfaces covered by reinforced polyethylene sheeting and vented by two vertical four-inch diameter metal <b>vent</b> <b>pipes</b> extended through the building roof. Pressure differentials were measured between the radon passive mitigation pipes and the outdoors and across mitigation pumps installed during the experiments. Air flow rates were continuously and simultaneously monitored at the radon <b>vent</b> <b>pipes</b> for different configurations of the building use. Measurements were performed using sensors that were integrated into an on-site data-logging system. Average indoor radon concentrations were reduced from above 4 pCiA to approximately 3. 5 pCV 1 with concentrations exceed 4 pCiI 1 is some area, with only one system vent operating. The concentrations are further reduced by 36 % with both vents operating. Concentrations are reduced by approximately 70 % with a suction fan installed {{on one of the}} system vents while the other vent left capped. Evaluation of the measurement results for different testing configurations, and recommendation for aspects to be observed for designing similar passive radon mitigation systems are presented...|$|R
50|$|<b>Vent</b> <b>pipe</b> of a {{wide variety}} of {{materials}} are used, for example polyvinyl chloride (PVC), unplasticized PVC, bricks, etc. Whatever material is used, durability (including corrosion resistance), availability, cost and ease of construction are important factors. The <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> is sufficiently long such that the roof does not interfere with the action of wind across the top of the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe.</b> For both flat and sloped roofs, the top of the <b>vent</b> <b>pipe</b> should be at least 500 mm higher than highest point of the roof.|$|E

50|$|The Fettler's Quarters {{is a small}} {{rectangular}} timber structure sheltered by a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. The building faces south-east, is clad {{with a mixture of}} weatherboards and chamferboards and stands on timber stumps, on a slightly sloping site. The main and rear elevations have centrally placed sash windows. Attached to the north-east of the earlier quarters is a more recent rectangular structure clad in corrugated iron, sheltered by a skillion roof. The main elevation has a timber door and a window with two sets of glass louvres. A similar window exists on the rear elevation of the building. A <b>venting</b> <b>pipe</b> projects from the roof.|$|R
50|$|An {{above ground}} air-raid shelter {{constructed}} during World War Two {{is located at}} the back of the house and is currently used as a guest room. It has a modern en-suite added to the room. There is a concrete pit or bunker under the western side of the house, accessible via a small timber hatch in the floor of one of the 1930s rooms. It measures 2.7m long by 1.2m wide and is 1.5m high. It has two large <b>vent</b> <b>pipes</b> inserted in the concrete ceiling, which emerge in the space between the top of the concrete structure and the floorboards of the house.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{availability}} of sheet products for flashing builders used creative methods to minimize water penetration such as angling roof shingles away from the joint, placing chimneys at the ridge, building steps into the sides of chimneys to throw off water and covering seams between roofing materials with mortar flaunching. The introduction of manufactured flashing decreased water penetration at obstacles such as chimneys, <b>vent</b> <b>pipes,</b> walls which abut roofs, window and door openings, etc. thus making buildings more durable and reducing indoor mold problems. In builders books, by 1832 Loudons An EncyclopÃ¦dia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture and Furniture... gives instruction on installing lead flashing and 1875 Notes on Building Construction gives detailed instruction and is well illustrated with methods still used today.|$|R
