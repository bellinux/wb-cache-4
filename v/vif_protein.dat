5000|$|APOBEC3G (Apolipoprotein editing complex 3 G) {{is another}} {{intrinsic}} immune protein which interferes with HIV infection. APOBEC3G is a cytidine deaminase against single stranded DNA which introduces transversion mutations into the HIV genome during reverse transcription by randomly changing cytidine basepairs into uracil. Though {{this will not}} necessarily stop viral integration, the resulting progeny viral genomes are too riddled with mutations to be viable. APOBEC3G expression is disrupted by the HIV <b>vif</b> <b>protein</b> which induces its degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome system.

50|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme {{catalytic}} polypeptide (APOBEC) family of proteins. The encoded protein is a cytidine deaminase that has antiretroviral activity by generating lethal hypermutations in viral genomes.

There are only one to two members of this family of genes in nonprimate mammals but at least seven members in primates. APOBEC3H is an antiviral effector. In Old world monkeys APOBEC3H has efficient antiviral activity against primate lentiviruses and it is sensitive to inactivation by the simian immunodeficiency virus <b>Vif</b> <b>protein,</b> and is capable of hypermutating retroviral genomes. The typical human APOBEC3H gene is inherently poorly expressed in primate cells and is ineffective at inhibiting retroviral replication.

Here, we demonstrate that primate lentiviral Vif (virion infectivity factor) proteins represent previously uncharacterized substrate receptor proteins that contain divergent BC-box motifs. These molecules selectively assemble with a Cul 5 –E 3 ligase to suppress the antiviral activity of autologous cytidine deaminase APOBEC 3 G.

While {{there are a}} number of antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), they are all expensive, invasive, susceptible to resistance, and are not curative. One potential future drug target is the interaction between the human antiviral APOBEC 3 proteins and the HIV counterdefense <b>protein,</b> <b>Vif.</b> Vif binds to and neutralizes the DNA-mutating APOBEC 3 proteins by recruitment of an E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets them for degradation. Design of small molecule therapeutics to disrupt this interaction and free the antiviral APOBEC 3 proteins has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the Vif E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex and conflicting reports as to which of the seven different APOBEC 3 proteins contribute to HIV restriction in vivo. To determine which APOBEC 3 proteins contribute to HIV restriction, we performed a comprehensive analysis of both human and rhesus macaque APOBEC 3 families in T cells. Based on six criteria (expression, virion incorporation, HIV restriction, viral genome mutation, neutralization by Vif, and conservation), we found that four APOBEC 3 proteins have the potential to restrict HIV replication. To better understand the Vif E 3 ligase complex responsible for neutralizing these proteins, we performed extensive purification experiments with HIV Vif and discovered that Vif interacts with the cellular transcription factor Core Binding Factor Beta (CBFB). We discovered that CBFB not only allows for reconstitution of the Vif E 3 ligase complex in vitro, but also stabilizes Vif in vivo, subsequently facilitating ligase assembly and allowing for APOBEC 3 degradation. This functional interaction is highly conserved, being required to enhance the steady-state levels of <b>Vif</b> <b>proteins</b> from all tested HIV subtypes and required for the degradation of all restrictive human and rhesus APOBEC 3 proteins by their respective lentiviral <b>Vif</b> <b>proteins.</b> Mutagenesis screening revealed that CBFB interacts with Vif and its normal RUNX transcription partners on genetically separable interfaces, indicating this essential virus-host interaction may serve as a viable drug target with minimal off-target effects. Disruption of this newly identified and highly conserved CBFB-Vif interaction would release the entire multitude of restrictive APOBEC 3 proteins and significantly inhibit HIV infection, making this interaction a promising new target for small molecule therapeutics...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The human APOBEC 3 G (A 3 G) protein {{activity}} {{is associated with}} innate immunity against HIV- 1 by inducing high rates of guanosines to adenosines (G-to-A) mutations (viz., hypermutation) in the viral DNA. If hypermutation {{is not enough to}} disrupt the reading frames of viral genes, it may likely increase the HIV- 1 diversity. To counteract host innate immunity HIV- 1 encodes the <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> that binds A 3 G protein and form complexes to be degraded by cellular proteolysis. METHODS: Here we studied the pattern of substitutions in the vif gene and its association with clinical status of HIV- 1 infected individuals. To perform the study, unique vif gene sequences were generated from 400 antiretroviral-naïve individuals. RESULTS: The codon pairs: 78 - 154, 85 - 154, 101 - 157, 105 - 157, and 105 - 176 of vif gene were associated with CD 4 + T cell count lower than 500 cells per mm(3). Some of these codons were located in the (81) LGQGVSIEW(89) region and within the BC-Box. We also identified codons under positive selection clustered in the N-terminal region of <b>Vif</b> <b>protein,</b> between (21) WKSLVK(26) and (40) YRHHY(44) regions (i. e., 31, 33, 37, 39), within the BC-Box (i. e., 155, 159) and the Cullin 5 -Box (i. e., 168) of vif gene. All these regions are involved in the Vif-induced degradation of A 3 G/F complexes and the N-terminal of <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> binds to viral and cellular RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive evolution of vif gene was mostly to optimize viral RNA binding and A 3 G/F recognition.

40|$|The {{vif gene}} {{of human and}} simian {{immunodeficiency}} viruses (HIV and SIV) encodes a late gene product that is essential for viral infectivity in natural target cells. Virions produced {{in the absence of}} Vif are abnormal in their ultrastructural morphology and are severely impaired in the ability to complete proviral DNA synthesis upon entry into new target cells. Because previous studies failed to detect <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> in virus particles, Vif is believed to influence virus infectivity indirectly, by affecting virion assembly, release, and/or maturation. In this report, we reexamined the possibility that Vif is a virion-associated protein. Utilizing high-titer Vif-specific antibodies, a sensitive immunoblot technique, and highly concentrated virus preparations, we detected a 23 -kDa Vif-reactive protein in wild-type HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) and a 27 -kDa Vif-reactive protein in wild-type SIVSM virions. Neither protein was present in virions derived from vif-deficient HIV- 1 and SIVSM proviral constructs. <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> content was similar among different strains of HIV- 1 and was independent of the cell type (permissive or nonpermissive) used to produce the virus. To determine the subvirion localization of Vif, HIV- 1 virions were treated with proteinase K or Triton X- 100 to remove virion surface proteins and the viral membrane, respectively, purified through sucrose, and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> content was not affected by the removal of external surface proteins or by the removal of the viral membrane and submembrane p 17 Gag matrix protein. Instead, Vif colocalized with viral core structures which sedimented at a density of 1. 25 g/ml on linear sucrose gradients (enveloped HIV- 1 particles sediment at a density of 1. 17 g/ml). Finally, the amount of <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> packaged into virions was estimated to be on the order of 1 molecule of Vif for every 20 to 30 molecules of p 24 Gag, or between 60 and 100 molecules of Vif per particle.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{emergence}} of AIDS {{in the early}} 20 th century has provoked studies {{to better understand the}} evolutionary history of viruses and the factors that govern their spread. Pandemic Human Immunodeficiency Virus-type 1 (HIV- 1), which currently infects 34 million people worldwide, emerged following the transmission of a lentivirus between chimpanzees and humans. A growing list of apparently nonpathogenic, species-specific simian strains (known as Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) has now been characterized in dozens of African primates, suggesting that primate lentiviruses are older and more widespread than originally thought. To estimate the extent to which primates and lentiviruses have coexisted, and to determine whether past and present lentivirus infections exhibit pathogenesis, we tracked the interaction between host and virus on a molecular level over evolutionary time. Specifically, we characterized the lentivirus-driven evolution of host restriction factor APOBEC 3 G (A 3 G) in Old World Monkey (OWM) species. We found that residues 128 and 130 of A 3 G, which determine susceptibility to antagonism by the lentiviral accessory <b>protein</b> <b>Vif,</b> are undergoing recurrent adaptive evolution in both ancestral and contemporary primate populations. We used a broad panel of SIV Vif isolates to demonstrate that natural variation in OWM A 3 G confers resistance to Vif-mediated degradation, suggesting that adaptive variants of the host factor were selected upon exposure to pathogenic lentiviruses at least 5 - 6 million years ago (MYA). Furthermore, in members of the divergent Colobinae subfamily of OWM, a multi-residue insertion event in A 3 G that arose approximately 12 MYA blocks the activity of Vif, suggesting an even more ancient origin of SIV. In response to these two adaptive strategies employed by OWM hosts, <b>Vif</b> <b>proteins</b> have counter-evolved to target distinct surfaces of the A 3 G substrate. Furthermore, some <b>Vif</b> <b>proteins,</b> like that of SIVsm infecting sooty mangabeys, have evolved broad specificity that may facilitate cross-species transmission events. Our findings support that a genetic conflict between primates and lentiviruses has been underway for millions of years and continues to this day. The ancient and ongoing conflict we described may have important implications for our understanding of HIV pathogenesis and spread in human populations. Our studies reveal that, while primate lentiviruses may have modern consequences for human health, they have ancient origins in our non-human primate relatives...|$|R

Here, we demonstrate that while h-A 3 F, like h-A 3 G, was able to suppress primate lentiviruses other than HIV- 1 (simian immunodeficiency virus from African green monkeys [SIVagm] and Rhesus ma-caques [SIVmac]), the interaction between <b>Vif</b> <b>proteins</b> and h-A 3 F appeared to differ from that with h-A 3 G. H-A 3 F showed no change in its species specificity against HIV- 1 or SIVagm Vif when a negatively charged amino acid was replaced with a lysine at position 128, a residue critical for h-A 3 G recognition by HIV- 1 Vif. However, HIV- 1 Vif, but not SIVagm Vif, was able to bind h-A 3 F and induce its polyubiquitination and degradation through the Cul 5 -containing E 3 ubiquitin ligase. Interference with Cul 5 -E 3 ligase function by depletion of Cul 5, through RNA interference or overexpression of Cul 5 mutants, blocked the ability of HIV- 1 Vif to suppress h-A 3 F.

All macaques maintained stable circulating CD 4 + T cells, developed low viral loads, maintained the engineered mutations, yielded no histological lesions, and developed immunoprecipitating antibodies early post-inoculation. Sequence analysis of nef and vpu from three lymphoid tissues revealed {{a high percentage of}} G-to-A-substitutions. Our results show that while the presence of HCCH and SLQYLA domains are critical in vivo, there may exist APOBEC 3 negative reservoirs that allow for low levels of viral replication and persistence but not disease...|$|E
40|$|Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, {{catalytic}} polypeptide-like editing complex 3 G (APOBEC 3 G) is a DNA editing enzyme. APOBEC 3 G hypermutates {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) DNA, resulting in the inhibition of viral propagation. The HIV- 1 accessory protein viral infectivity factor (Vif) targets APOBEC 3 G for degradation. The objective of this work was to evaluate whether the inhibitory effect of Vif on A 3 G can be diminished by pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP). PAP is an N-glycosidase synthesized by the pokeweed plant, Phytolacca americana. In this study, I show that PAP reduced <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> accumulation by depurinating Vif open reading frame (ORF). Decreased <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> levels {{in the presence of}} PAP were correlated with increased A 3 G levels. The antiviral enzyme reduced viral particle release by approximately 100 -fold and the virions released from PAP expressing cells were 11 -fold less infectious. The expression of PAP also reduced the levels of integrated HIV- 1 DNA...|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{restriction}} factors, which render cells intrinsically {{resistant to}} viruses, potentially impose genetic barriers to cross-species transmission and emergence of viral pathogens in nature. One such factor is APOBEC 3 G. To overcome APOBEC 3 G-mediated restriction, many lentiviruses encode <b>Vif,</b> a <b>protein</b> that targets APOBEC 3 G for degradation. As with many restriction factor genes, primate APOBEC 3 G displays strong signatures of positive selection. This is interpreted {{as evidence that}} the primate APOBEC 3 G locus reflects a long-term evolutionary "arms-race" between retroviruses and their primate hosts. Here, we provide direct evidence that APOBEC 3 G has functioned as a barrier to cross-species transmission, selecting for viral resistance during emergence of the AIDS-causing pathogen SIVmac in captive colonies of Asian macaques in the 1970 s. Specifically, we found that rhesus macaques have multiple, functionally distinct APOBEC 3 G alleles, and that emergence of SIVmac and simian AIDS required adaptation of the virus to evade APOBEC 3 G-mediated restriction. Our evidence includes the first comparative analysis of APOBEC 3 G polymorphism and function in both a reservoir and recipient host species (sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques, respectively), and identification of adaptations unique to <b>Vif</b> <b>proteins</b> of the SIVmac lineage that specifically antagonize rhesus APOBEC 3 G alleles. By demonstrating that interspecies variation in a known restriction factor selected for viral counter-adaptations {{in the context of a}} documented case of cross-species transmission, our results lend strong support to the evolutionary "arms-race" hypothesis. Importantly, our study confirms that APOBEC 3 G divergence can be a critical determinant of interspecies transmission and emergence of primate lentiviruses, including viruses with the potential to infect and spread in human populations...|$|R

CAEV Vif deletion mutants demonstrated an attenuated replication phenotype in primary goat cell cultures {{and resulted in}} abortive infection when inoculated into goats. In this study, we determined the in vitro replication phenotype of five CAEV Vif point mutant infectious molecular clones {{and the ability of}} the corresponding in vitro translated <b>Vif</b> <b>proteins</b> to interact with the CAEV Pr 55 gag in the glutathione S–transferase (GST) binding assay. Here we show that (i) three of the mutants (S 170 E, S 170 G, S 197 G) behaved as the wild-type CAEV according to virus replication and Vif–Gag interactions; (ii) one mutant (Vif 6 mut) was replication incompetent and bound weakly to GST–Gag fusion proteins; and (iii) one mutant (Vif RG) was impaired for replication while retaining its interaction properties. This mutant points out the critical importance of the CAEV Vif tryptophan residue at position 95 for efficient virus replication, defining for this lentivirus a functional domain unrelated to the Gag binding region...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHIV- 1 Vif regulates viral {{infectivity}} by inhibiting the encapsidation of APOBEC 3 G (APO 3 G) through proteasomal {{degradation of}} the protein. Here we compared various <b>Vif</b> <b>proteins</b> {{for their ability to}} induce APO 3 G degradation and rescue viral infectivity. We found that Vif expressed from proviral vectors caused relatively inefficient degradation of APO 3 G in HeLa cells yet was very effective in inhibiting APO 3 G's antiviral activity. On the other hand, Vif expressed autonomously from a codon-optimized vector caused very efficient APO 3 G degradation and also effectively inhibited APO 3 G's antiviral effects. In contrast, a Vif chimera containing an N-terminal fluorescent tag efficiently induced APO 3 G degradation but was unable to restore viral infectivity. The lack of a direct correlation between APO 3 G degradation and rescue of viral infectivity suggests that these two properties of Vif are functionally separable. Our data imply that intracellular degradation of APO 3 G may not be the sole activity of Vif required for the production of infectious virions from APO 3 G-expressing cells...|$|R
40|$|The HIV- 1 <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> {{counteracts}} the antiviral activity {{exhibited by}} the host cytidine deaminases APOBEC 3 G and APOBEC 3 F. Here, we show that defective vif alleles can readily be found in HIV- 1 isolates and infected patients. Single residue changes in the <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> sequence are sufficient to cause the loss of Vif-induced APOBEC 3 neutralization. Interestingly, not all the detected defects lead to a complete inactivation of Vif function since some mutants retained selective neutralizing activity against APOBEC 3 F but not APOBEC 3 G or vice versa. Concordantly, independently hypermutated proviruses with distinguishable patterns of G-to-A substitution attributable to cytidine deamination induced by APOBEC 3 G, APOBEC 3 F, or both enzymes were present in individuals carrying proviruses with completely or partly defective Vif variants. Natural variation in Vif function may result in selective and partial neutralization of cytidine deaminases and thereby promote viral sequence diversification within HIV- 1 infected individuals...|$|E

D. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 136 pages, appendix 1 - 2. The mammalian immune {{system must be}} dynamic {{in the face of}} a diverse and ever-changing array of pathogens. Successful pathogens have evolved to overcome host immunity. One of the most successful pathogens in the last century is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is the etiological agent responsible for the global acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. Currently, one of the most studied host-pathogen interactions is between the cellular anti-retroviral APOBEC 3 (A 3) proteins and HIV viral infectivity factor (<b>Vif)</b> <b>protein.</b> A 3 proteins are cytosine deaminases that primarily inhibit retroviruses and retrotransposons by mutating cytosines to uracils in retroviral DNA during reverse transcription. When HIV Vif is present, it can bind to certain A 3 proteins and recruit cellular degradation complexes to target these anti-retroviral proteins for proteasomal degradation. HIV-like viruses (lentiviruses) infect other mammals and are the inspiration for studying A 3 proteins in other mammals. The ultimate goal of this comparative study was to gain a better understanding of how the lentiviral <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> counteracts host A 3 proteins. The first component of this dissertation is dedicated to the process of determining the complete A 3 protein repertoires of cow and sheep (representatives of the artiodactyl lineage), which are both infected with a lentiviruses. The second component of this dissertation was to test if these artiodactyl A 3 proteins were functional. Cow and sheep A 3 proteins demonstrate intrinsic DNA cytosine deaminase activity and localize in cells similar to human A 3 proteins. Furthermore, certain cow A 3 proteins are capable of restricting HIV and are neutralized in the presence of cattle-specific lentiviral Vif (bovine immunodeficiency virus). The last component of this dissertation, a panel of conserved mammalian A 3 proteins were tested to determine if each A 3 protein interacts specifically with its species lentiviral <b>Vif</b> <b>protein.</b> It was shown that each representative host A 3 protein is degraded in the presence of its species specific lentiviral Vif, suggesting a conserved interaction between mammalian A 3 proteins and their species specific lentiviral <b>Vif</b> <b>protein...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> of HIV- 1 allows virus {{replication}} by degrading {{several members of}} the host-encoded APOBEC 3 family of DNA cytosine deaminases. Polymorphisms in both host APOBEC 3 genes and the viral vif gene have the potential to impact the extent of {{virus replication}} among individuals. The most genetically diverse of the seven human APOBEC 3 genes is APOBEC 3 H with seven known haplotypes. Overexpression studies have shown that a subset of these variants express stable and active proteins, whereas the others encode proteins with a short half-life and little, if any, antiviral activity. We demonstrate that these stable/unstable phenotypes are an intrinsic property of endogenous APOBEC 3 H proteins in primary CD 4 + T lymphocytes and confer differential resistance to HIV- 1 infection in a manner that depends on natural variation in the <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> of the infecting virus. HIV- 1 with a <b>Vif</b> <b>protein</b> hypo-functional for APOBEC 3 H degradation, yet fully able to counteract APOBEC 3 D, APOBEC 3 F, and APOBEC 3 G, was susceptible to restriction and hypermutation in stable APOBEC 3 H expressing lymphocytes, but not in unstable APOBEC 3 H expressing lymphocytes. In contrast, HIV- 1 with hyper-functional Vif counteracted stable APOBEC 3 H proteins as well as all other endogenous APOBEC 3 s and replicated to high levels. We also found that APOBEC 3 H protein levels are induced over 10 -fold by infection. Finally, we found that the global distribution of stable/unstable APOBEC 3 H haplotypes correlates with the distribution a critical hyper/hypo-functional Vif amino acid residue. These data combine to strongly suggest that stable APOBEC 3 H haplotypes present as in vivo barriers to HIV- 1 replication, that Vif is capable of adapting to these restrictive pressures, and that an evolutionary equilibrium has yet to be reached...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAPOBEC 3 G (A 3 G) is a host {{cytidine}} deaminase that inhibits retroviruses. HIV {{and related}} primate lentiviruses encode Vif, which counteracts A 3 G by inducing its degradation. This Vif-mediated A 3 G inhibition is species specific, {{suggesting that the}} A 3 G-Vif interaction has evolved as primate lentiviruses have adapted to their hosts. We examined the evolutionary dynamics of the A 3 G-Vif interaction within four African green monkey (AGM) subspecies, which are each naturally infected with a distinct simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We identified single amino acid changes within A 3 G in two AGM subspecies that render it resistant to <b>Vif</b> <b>proteins,</b> except for <b>Vif</b> from the viruses that naturally infect these subspecies. Moreover, experimental infection of AGMs shows that Vif can rapidly adapt to these arising Vif-resistant A 3 G genotypes. These data suggest that despite being generally nonpathogenic in its natural host, SIV infection selects for Vif-resistant forms of A 3 G in AGM populations, driving Vif counterevolution and functional divergence...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, {{catalytic}} polypeptide-like 3 G (APOBEC 3 G, or hA 3 G) protein, provides {{cells with}} an intracellular antiretroviral {{activity that is}} associated with the hypermutation of viral DNA through cytidine deamination. Indeed, hA 3 G belongs to a family of vertebrate proteins that contain one or two copies of a signature sequence motif unique to cytidine deaminases (CTDAs). We have constructed secondary structure models of the APOBEC proteins through a combination of structure prediction and subsequent alignment with nucleotide CTDAs whose structures have been solved to high resolution. Secondary structure elements common to all CTDAs are predicted, in addition to structural features that are apparently unique to the APOBEC family of proteins. Most notably, a putative looped-out helix abuts an amino acid that modulates the susceptibility of A 3 G proteins to the antagonistic action of the human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) <b>Vif</b> <b>proteins.</b> Using the structure models as a guide, we reflect on mutagenesis studies of the APOBEC 1 (A 1), hA 3 G and activation induced deaminase (AID) proteins, with emphasis on the determinants of cytidine deamination and antiviral activities...|$|R
