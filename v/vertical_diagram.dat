40|$|A goal (from a manifold) of my {{graduation}} {{project is}} to fluidify the traditionally rigid boundary between process and product. This implies to leave the hierarchical mode of concept driven essentialist architecture. Instead, I {{want to make a}} shift towards the non-hierachical ecological(ontologically flat) field of potential(context), from where the objectile becomes. This ecological praxes might, as Gilles Deleuze explains, “be defined as a search to identify in each partial locus of existence the potential vectors of subjectification and singularization. ” 1 It is about getting rid of the preconceived mind to find the difference that makes the difference. The process is best describe like the notion of “walking as controlled falling”. I am set in motion by a particular desire. To fulfill this desire I will have to move. To move is to go through a “phase transition” which enables new discoveries. “Walking as controlled falling” is surrendering to constraints like gravity and those of your body, whilst having a certain degree of freedom. As Brian Massumi explains, “you move forward by playing with the constraints, not avoiding them. There’s an openness of movement, even though there’s no escaping constraint. ” 2 It is about the reciprocal determination between freedom and constraint that can only be found upon experimentation. Inevitably there will be mistakes, as risk implies both success and failure. But without risk, there will neither success nor failure and the project will end up in a state of aesthetic purgatory! How can I to avoid this? Bruno Latour would give me the following anwser: “Drawing and modelling do not constitute an immediate means of translation of the internal energies and fantasies of the architect’s mind’s eye, or a process of transferring ideas from a designer’s mind into a physical form, from a powerful “subjective” imagination into various “material” expressions. Rather, the hundreds of models and drawings produced in design form an artistically created primal matter that stimulates the haptic imagination, astonishes its creators instead of subserviently obeying them, and helps architects fix unfamiliar ideas, gain new knowledge about the building- to-come, and formulate new alternatives and “options,” new unforeseen scenarios of realization. ” 3 It is about problem finding instead of problem solving. It is not about judging content at face value. It is about findingthe intent which makes content. 4 It is about thinking in the relationality between objects which allows for a manifold of interpretations, thus, affords a different (or similar) outcome. It is about searching. To search in the field of potential is to discover. Rediscover. Doubt. Decide. Doubt. And Make! It means to integrate and embrace all possible constraints early in the project. It means, for example, no fundamental hierarchical difference between the installations or urban environment. It is truly about beeing in the middle. About the milieu. About everything at once at the same time! 5 NOTES 1. Felix Guattari, The Three Ecologies, 1989 Continuum, P. 4 2. Brian Massumi, Mary Zournazi, Zournazi Massumi Interview 3.

From this “phase space” research question can come to light. These questions would not necessarily need to be resolved, however (and more importantly), they need a thorough quasi-objective investigation. My most recent question, for example, investigates the possibilities to translate the positive spatial conditions of a field condition into a <b>vertical</b> <b>diagram.</b> It could be that there is no “ultimate” resolution or model to do this. However, the investigation can trigger new questions, thus, cascade into an entirely new vision. This vision could not have been envisioned if the original question had not been asked.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{analysis}} of Higgs-regulated planar amplitudes of N= 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to four loops for the four-gluon amplitude and to two loops for the five-gluon amplitude. Our calculations are consistent with a proposed all-loop ansatz for planar MHV n-gluon amplitudes that is the analog of the BDS ansatz in dimensional regularization. In all cases considered, we have verified that the IR-finite parts of the logarithm of the amplitudes have the same dependence on kinematic variables as the corresponding functions in dimensionally-regulated amplitudes (up to overall additive constants, which we determine). We also study various Regge limits of N= 4 SYM planar n-gluon amplitudes. Euclidean Regge limits of Higgs-regulated n ≥ 4 amplitudes yield results similar in form to those found using dimensional regularization, but with different expressions for the gluon trajectory and Regge vertices resulting from the different regulator scheme.

40|$|A {{new way of}} {{visualizing}} the Sommerfeld {{theory of}} propagation over a flat, imperfectly reflecting earth is presented. The Sommerfeld theory arises because the ray theory of propagation from a source {{in the presence of}} a flat, imperfectly reflecting earth is only an approximation.

40|$|A meander is a topological {{configuration}} {{of a line}} and a simple closed curve in the plane (or a pair of simple closed curves on the 2 -sphere) intersecting transversally. In physics, meanders provide a model of polymer folding, and their enumeration {{is directly related to}} the entropy of the associated dynamical systems. We combine recent results on Masur-Veech volumes of the moduli spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials in genus zero and our previous result that horizontal and <b>vertical</b> separatrix <b>diagrams</b> of integer quadratic differentials are asymptotically uncorrelated to derive two applications to asymptotic enumeration of meanders. First, we get simple asymptotic formulae for the number of pairs of transverse simple closed curves on a sphere and for the number of closed meanders of fixed combinatorial type when the number of crossings 2 N goes to infinity. Second, we compute the asymptotic probability of getting a simple closed curve on a sphere by identifying the endpoints of two arc systems (one on each of the two hemispheres) along the common equator. Here the total number of minimal arcs of the two arc systems is considered as a fixed parameter while the number of all arcs (same for each of the two hemispheres) grows. The number of all meanders with 2 N crossings grows exponentially when N grows. However, the additional combinatorial constraints we impose in this article yield polynomial asymptotics.

The structure was analysed at various scales of analysis, using different methodologies e. g. profile diagrams (0. 1 ha) and <b>vertical</b> structure <b>diagrams</b> (1 ha). All profile diagrams suggested presence of stratification to some extent. However, simultaneous evaluation of several adjacent profile diagrams showed {{that the use of}} one profile diagram only can be very misleading: gaps or layers apparent in a diagram did usually not reflect gaps or layers that could be recognized in the field. Structure diagrams of abundance, basal area and crown cover showed that this forest community is not stratified, with the exception of an understorey layer below 7. 5 m dominated by palms. The {{vertical structure}} was described using arbitrarily chosen height intervals. From the forest floor to the canopy top basal area, percentage of deciduous species (and individuals), and percentage of compound-leaved species (and individuals), increased, but total number of individuals and number of species decreased. Leaf sizes tended to decrease in the same direction, and crown cover was approximately evenly distributed. Species from different families dominated different parts along the vertical plane.

The decays of B mesons to charmless three-body Khh final states can be described by a b → u tree-level spectator diagram and a b → s(d) g one-loop penguin diagram. (Although b → u W-exchange, annihilation, or <b>vertical</b> W loop <b>diagrams</b> can also contribute to these final states, {{they are expected to}} be smaller and we neglect them for simplicity.) Three-body decays of B mesons to final states with odd numbers of kaons (s-quarks) are expected to proceed dominantly via the b → sg penguin transition since the b → u contribution in these cases has an additional CKM suppression. In contrast, decays with two kaons in final state proceed via b → u tree transition (with possible contribution from b → dg penguin), and have no contribution from b → sg penguin. From this simple consideration we can naively expect that the Kππ and KKK final states have the largest signal among other three-body Khh final states.
