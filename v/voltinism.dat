In particular, the authors suggest that 2 °C warming might lead to, for example, about one extra generation for Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, two extra generations for Diptera, almost three generations for Hymenoptera, and almost five generations for Aphidoidea. These changes in <b>voltinism</b> might happen through biological dispersal and/or natural selection; the authors point to prior examples of each in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Adaptations include {{undergoing}} one seasonal generation, two or even more, called <b>voltinism</b> (Univoltism, bivoltism, and multivism, respectively). Most lepidopterans in temperate climates are univoltine, {{while in}} tropical climates most have two seasonal broods. Some others may {{take advantage of}} any opportunity they can get, and mate continuously throughout the year. These seasonal adaptations are controlled by hormones, and these delays in reproduction are called diapause. Many lepidopteran species, after mating and laying their eggs, die shortly afterwards, having only lived {{for a few days}} after eclosion. Others may still be active for several weeks and then overwinter and become sexually active again when the weather becomes more favorable, or diapause. The sperm of the male that mated most recently with the female is most likely to have fertilized the eggs, but the sperm from a prior mating may still prevail.|$|E
50|$|Although little {{published}} {{information is}} available specifically on phenological responses to climate change in Saskatchewan, these are likely to follow general worldwide and regional trends. One such trend is advanced flowering in early-season plants and delayed flowering in late-season plants, leading to increased risk of reproductive failure due to frost damage from cold snaps. For instance, trembling aspen in Alberta {{has been shown to}} have advanced in flowering date by 26 days over the past century. Changes in flowering phenology also have the potential to greatly impact plant-pollinator dynamics. Asynchronies between flower availability and pollinator activity may lead to lower pollination rates and declines in ecologically and economically important insect species. This in turn could impact insectivorous consumers and thus have cascading effects on entire food chains.Other insect species may benefit from warmer temperatures. Increased <b>voltinism</b> and winter survival in many insects has the potential for dramatic population increases in pest species such as foliage-eating Lepidoptera and bark-boring Coleoptera.|$|E

Groups of larvae were confined in growth chambers and incubated in situ at time intervals representing the observed range of annual thermal variation. Estimates of daily growth rates (g) were derived from change in average length over the incubation period. Using multiple regression, I found temperature and larval size to have significant positive and negative effects on g, respectively. Equations derived for each stream described a substantial proportion of the variance among observed g values (X 2 = 0. 7 l- 0. 82) but {{did not differ significantly}}. Therefore, the data from all streams were combined to derive a single general equation which, along with larval size dis-tribution, biomass, and temperature data, was used to model the variation in annual biomass turnover(G) and hypothetical size-dependent <b>voltinism</b> among the study streams. Size distribution of larvae did not differ significantly among streams and variation in G (range = 12. 8 - 18. 6) was attributed primarily to variation in thermal regime. Differences in <b>voltinism</b> were predicted to be minor but were closely dependent on both terminal size of larvae and thermal regime. The model provides evidence that spatial variation of G on the order of 31 % can be expected for midge communities within a < 30 km 2 area of this Appalachian Mountain basin.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{altering}} geographical ranges, population dynamics and phenologies of many organisms. For ectotherms, increased ambient temperatures frequently have direct consequences for metabolic rates, activity patterns and developmental rates. Consequently, in many insect species both an earlier beginning and prolongation of seasonal duration occurred {{in parallel with}} recent global warming. However, from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, the number of generations (<b>voltinism)</b> and investment into each generation {{may be even more}} important than seasonality, since an additional generation per unit time may accelerate population growth or adaptation. Using a dataset extending back to the mid-nineteenth century, I report changes in the <b>voltinism</b> of butterfly and moth species of Central Europe. A significant proportion of 263 multi-voltine species showed augmented frequency of second and subsequent generations relative to the first generation in a warm period since 1980, and 44 species even increased the number of generations after 1980. Expected ecological consequences are diverse. Since multi-voltinism has been linked to insect outbreaks they include an increase in the abundance of herbivorous pests of agriculture and forestry. However, disruption of the developmental synchrony associated with multi-voltinism and host plant phenology may also reduce fitness, potentially having unexpected consequences for species of conservation concern.

40|$|Abstract: The {{occurrence}} of climate changes {{is evident from}} increase in global average temperature, changes in the rainfall pattern and extreme climatic events. These seasonal and long term changes would affect the fauna, flora and population dynamics of insect pests. The abiotic parameters {{are known to have}} direct impact on insect population dynamics through modulation of developmental rates, survival, fecundity, <b>voltinism</b> and dispersal. Among the climatic factors, temperature is an important factor. The studies showed that, declined survival rate of brown plant hopper Nilaparvatha lugens (Stal) and rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guen) at higher temperature indicates the impacts of rising temperature could do the changes in the pest population dynamics of rice ecosystem. The alteration in the <b>voltinism</b> also could be the results of warming and it is more profit to multivoltine species and <b>voltinism</b> could be reflected in changes in the geographical distribution. Beside these, elevated CO 2 also showed some impact on pest’s population abundance, the crop grown under the elevated CO 2 could alter the nutritional value of plants; it may alter the insect abundance and increase the consumption rate of herbivores. Therefore climate change would result in changes in the population dynamics of insect pests. Thus temperature rise plays a pivotal role in insect population dynamics.

40|$|To stimulate {{further study}} on {{seasonal}} adaptations in insects, two hypotheses are proposed, one accounting for latitudinal variations in diapause intensity {{and the other}} pertaining to the phenotypic plasticity of critical photoperiod for diapause induction. (1) In some species with constant <b>voltinism,</b> diapause intensity increases southward to cope with higher risks of untimely termination of diapause before winter. In other species with variable <b>voltinism,</b> it decreases southward presumably because of stronger selection for nondiapause phenotypes and positive correlations between diapause intensity and incidence. (2) Clinal variations of critical photoperiod for diapause induction may be mimicked by phenotypic responses to temperature. Such plasticity expands the latitudinal range of adaptation. In a noctuid moth, the critical photoperiod is increased by long photoperiods in the early stage of development, so that photoperiod itself may also be involved in phenotypic adaptation to climatic gradients...|$|E
40|$|The inheritances {{of three}} life history traits {{contributing}} to <b>voltinism</b> were investigated in two latitudinally distinct ecotypes of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner). While critical photoperiod and post-diapause development time (PDD) were clearly different, larval development time {{did not play}} a critical role in differences between the expression of <b>voltinism</b> in the ecotypes tested. The ecotype adapted to a bivoltine habitat exhibited shorter critical photoperiod (14. 80 hour) than the ecotype (15. 33 hour) that originating from a univoltine habitat. The F 1 progenies had somewhat intermediate responses with clear indication of a sex-linked inheritance. The F 2 progenies further affirmed that the male parent had more influence on the offspring 2 ̆ 7 s diapause response than the female parent. The minimum number of genes estimates and the response from backcross progenies suggested that the critical photoperiod is controlled by a few loci, one of which may be located on the sex chromosome. Correspondingly, the PDD in both ecotypes demonstrated the adaptive importance of this trait for <b>voltinism,</b> with the southern population completing PDD earlier than the northern ecotype. The F 1 crosses had responses consistent with an apparent sex linkage. The further crosses indicated that the male parent had more influence on the PDD times of the resulting progenies. The overall results indicated that both ecotypes had adopted unique diapause responses, which ultimately leads to seasonal synchrony in their ecosytem. Furthermore, the presence of genetic variation within each ecotype was discussed. ...|$|E

The Appendix is available online: [URL] Data associated with this paper have been archived online: [URL] change in climate is known to affect seasonal timing (phenology) of the life stages of poikilothermic organisms whose development depends on temperature. Less understood is the potential for even greater disruption to the life cycle when a phenology shift exposes photoperiod-sensitive life stages to new day lengths. We present a conceptual framework and model to investigate the ways that photoperiod-cued diapause can interact with a change in climate or latitude to influence <b>voltinism</b> in poikilothermic organisms. Our degree-day phenology model combines detailed spatial climate data, latitude- and date-specific photoperiods, and development and photoperiod response parameters. As an example, we model the biological control beetle Galerucella calmariensis and map the number of generations expected following its introduction into diverse climates throughout the continental United States. Incorporation of photoperiodism results in a complex geography of <b>voltinism</b> that differs markedly from predictions of traditional phenology models. Facultative multivoltine species will be prone to univoltism when transported to either warmer or southern climates due to exposure of the sensitive stage to shorter day lengths. When moved to more northern locations, they may attempt too many generations for the season duration thereby exposing vulnerable life stages to harsh weather in the fall. We further show that even small changes in temperature can result in large and unexpected shifts in <b>voltinism.</b> Analogous effects may be expected for organisms from wide variety of taxa that use photoperiod as a seasonal cue during some stage of their life cycle. Our approach is useful for understanding the performance and impacts of introduced pests and beneficial organisms as well as for predicting responses of resident species to climate change and climate variability...|$|E

30|$|Butterflies were {{classified}} {{according to their}} habitat type and niche breadth. Habitat type was determined based on their larva habitats, such as grassland species (GL), forest edge species (FE), and forest interior species (FI). If a species was found {{in more than one}} habitat, the habitat was considered the one in which the species was most often observed. Niche breadth modified the method of Kitahara and Fujii (2005) and used diet breadth and <b>voltinism</b> (number of generations per year) to determine the niche breadth of each species. Diet breadth was classified into two categories based on range of host plant species by larvae. Feeding specialists are species feeding on plants of one plant genus, whereas feeding generalists are species feeding on more than one plant family. Univoltine species are classified as seasonal specialists, whereas multivoltine species are classified as seasonal generalists. If a species was a feeding specialist and seasonal specialist, it was considered as specialist species. If a species was a feeding generalist and seasonal generalist, it was considered as generalist species. Intermediate species was species with specialist in one of the two ecological traits.

40|$|The {{persistence}} of crustacean populations in ephemeral ponds requires appropriate adaptations in life history strategies (e. g. in hatching phenology). Organisms {{take advantage of}} pond filling when it occurs and hedge their bets for the possibility to complete one or more life cycles or to produce resting stages that ensure that the population will not go extinct. We carried out laboratory experiments to investigate the dynamics of a sexual population of Heterocypris barbara from a vernal pool in Lampedusa Island (Sicily). Experimental organisms were obtained hydrating sediments from Aria Rossa temporary pond. Recruitment from resting eggs, <b>voltinism,</b> mean body size and sex ratio were observed in microcosms at different conductivities (high 2. 0 - 2. 7 mS cm- 1, intermediate 1. 0 - 1. 1 mS cm- 1 and low 0. 5 - 0. 6 mS cm- 1). Microcosms were kept in laboratory controlled conditions: constant (24 °C 12 : 12 L:D and 16 °C 10 : 14 L:D photoperiod) or fluctuating thermal regimes. The experiment lasted 7 months. Resting and non-resting egg production and up to a bivoltine life cycle were observed. Recruitment events from egg bank and <b>voltinism</b> varied by thermal regime and conductivity. A prolonged recruitment phase occurred in conditions {{that could be considered}} a proxy of a rainy season (16 °C, 10 : 14 L:D and low conductivity) or of long hydroperiods (spring thermal fluctuating regime and intermediate conductivity). At 24 °C, age at reproduction of females from resting eggs almost doubled at low conductivity (in comparison with high conductivity). Low conductivity also reduced hatching time of resting eggs while it increased development time and age at maturity. In thermal fluctuating regime, degree-days to reproduction were about double than at constant 24 °C. Males, observed in all microcosms, reached maturity faster and had a shorter life span than females. Males initially outnumbered females, but later in the experiments females became dominant.

40|$|Abstract. 1. With {{respect to}} {{seasonal}} availability for herbivores, plants defended by synthesising qualitative compounds {{differ from those}} protected by accumulation of quantitative macromolecules, leaf toughness, and low water and/or nutrient content. While the palatability of the former plants remains relatively constant during the season, the palatability of the latter group decreases with leaf age. 2. It was hypothesised that in seasonal temperate environments, quantitative plant defences should restrict the annual numbers of insect generations. To test this hypothesis, European butterflies were used as a model, both non-corrected regressions and tests controlling for phylogeny were carried out, and potentially confounding factors such as body size or occurrence in short-season environments were treated as covariables. 3. Non-phylogenetically controlled regressions corroborated that butterflies feeding on quantitatively protected hosts (woody plants + grasses) form fewer generations than species feeding on qualitatively protected forbs. Plant defences fitted <b>voltinism</b> better than butterfly size, and remained significant even after controlling for short seasons. Using independent contrasts, feeding on woody plants plus grasses, and feeding on woody plants only, predicted fewer generations. These patterns, however, applied exclusively for foliage-feeding species. 4. The association between plant defences and <b>voltinism</b> represents a hitherto overlooked pattern in the ecology of temperate herbivores. It may explain why large insects tend to form fewer generations and feed on structurally complex hosts, and why some species remain monovoltine although they are not restricted by short season.

40|$|Changes in the {{seasonal}} timing of recurring biological events {{are considered to}} be a major component of the global “fingerprint” of climate change. One effect of these changes is that ecologically important seasonal species interactions could become desynchronised {{as a result of these}} shifts (i. e. phenological mismatching), leading to reductions in fitness for some or all of the organisms concerned. One important, but unresolved, issue is the extent to which variations in <b>voltinism</b> (the number of generations a population of a species produces per year) may serve to exacerbate, or confer resilience to, the effects of seasonal shifts. Univoltine organisms (those with one generation per year) will always suffer the deleterious consequences of phenological mismatch, whereas multivoltine species are likely to experience at least some relief from these negative effects in generations that occur later in the season. Conversely, univoltine species will experience continual selection to adapt to changing seasonality, whereas multivoltine species will experience reduced or no selection during those generations that occur later in the season. Here, we present a new theoretical model to explore the population consequences of scenarios of changing seasonality and varying <b>voltinism</b> in clonal species. We find that organisms that undergo multiple generations per year show greater resilience to phenological mismatching in the spring and adapt better to changing seasonality, because of the recovery of population size and genetic diversity after each spring mismatching event. These results have clear implications for management and conservation of populations that are threatened by the effects of mismatch...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{diapause}} {{is common}} in the Chrysomelidae, and allows ‘escape in time’ of conditions unfavourable for growth and development. Chrysophtharta agricola (Chapuis) (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae), which undergoes one or two generations per year, spends 7 – 8 months in reproductive diapause, emerging in spring to feed and oviposit. We manipulated photoperiod and temperature to test their effects on induction and termination of diapause in the laboratory; we also conducted field studies for validation of results, and to examine patterns of <b>voltinism</b> {{as determined by the}} onset of diapause. A critical photoperiod of between 12 and 16 h of light was required to initiate diapause in the laboratory and field, although 55 % of beetles entered diapause in response to low temperature (9 °C) alone. At short photoperiods (8 L : 16 D), high temperature (21 °C) subverted diapause in 20 % of adults. Therefore, <b>voltinism</b> in C. agricola is a seasonally plastic trait dependent on emergence time of teneral adults. Diapause termination was primarily influenced by temperature, although photoperiod had an effect at low temperatures. Beetles accumulated day-degrees (DD) during overwintering, with beetles collected later terminating diapause sooner than those collected earlier (total DD was similar). Diapause termination is, therefore, dependent on DD accumulation above the threshold temperature (6. 7 °C), rather than a specific environmental cue. Results are discussed in ecological and applied contexts, and provide the ability to predict the population phenology of C. agricola.

40|$|A {{warmer climate}} may {{increase}} the risk of attacks by insect pests on agricultural crops, and questions on how to adapt management practice have created a need for impact models. Phenological models driven by climate data can be used for assessing the potential distribution and <b>voltinism</b> of different insect species, but the quality of the simulations is influenced by a range of uncertainties. In this study, we model the temperature-dependent activity and development of the Colorado potato beetle, and analyse the influence of uncertainty associated with parameterization of temperature and day length response. We found that the developmental threshold has a major impact on the simulated number of generations per year. Little is known about local adaptations and individual variations, but the use of an upper and a lower developmental threshold gave an indication on the potential variation. The day length conditions triggering diapause are known only for a few populations. We used gridded observed temperature data to estimate local adaptations, hypothesizing that cold autumns can leave a footprint in the population genetics by low survival of individuals not reaching the adult stage before winter. Our study indicated that the potential selection pressure caused by climate conditions varies between European regions. Provided that there is enough genetic variation, a local adaption at the northern distribution limit would reduce the number of unsuccessful initiations and thereby increase the potential for spreading to areas currently not infested. The simulations of the impact model were highly sensitive to biases in climate model data, i. e. systematic deviations in comparison with observed weather, highlightening the need of improved performance of regional climate models.

40|$|Latitudinal clines in thermal {{reaction}} {{norms of}} development {{are a common}} phenomenon in temperate insects. Populations from higher latitudes often develop faster throughout the range of relevant temperatures (i. e countergradient variation) because they {{must be able to}} complete their life cycle within a shorter seasonal time window compared to populations at lower latitudes. In the present study, we experimentally demonstrate that two species of butterflies Anthocharis cardamines (L.) and Pieris napi (L.) instead show a cogradient variation in thermal reaction norms of post-winter pupal development so that lower latitude populations develop faster than higher latitude populations. The two species share host plants but differ in the degree of phenological specialization, {{as well as in the}} patterns of <b>voltinism.</b> We suggest that the pattern in A. cardamines, a univoltine phenological specialist feeding exclusively on flowers and seedpods, is the result of selection for matching to the phenological pattern of its local host plants. The other species, P. napi, is a phenological generalist feeding on the leaves of the hosts and it shows a latitudinal cline in <b>voltinism.</b> Because the latitudinal pattern in P. napi was an effect of slow development in a fraction of the pupae from the most northern population, we hypothesize that this population may include both bivoltine and univoltine genotypes. Consequently, although the two species both showed cogradient patterns in thermal reaction norms, it appears likely that this was for different reasons. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London.
