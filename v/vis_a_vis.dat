25|$|The {{issue of}} Muslim {{presence}} on {{the territory of the}} two countries is often viewed in relation to the relations between the Ottoman Sultans and local Princes.

One of the main issues was that of Capitulations (Ottoman Turkish: ahdnâme), which were supposedly agreed between the two states and the Ottoman Empire {{at some point in the}} Middle Ages. Such documents have not been preserved: modern Romanian historians have revealed that Capitulations, as invoked in the 18th and 19th centuries to invoke Romanian rights <b>vis</b> <b>à</b> <b>vis</b> the Ottomans, and as reclaimed by nationalist discourse in the 20th century, were forgeries.

40|$|The article re-examines {{trauma and}} {{bereavement}} and {{the category of}} loss considered to be traumatic bereavement. It is argued that {{the perspective of the}} relation to the deceased is an insufficiently acknowledged source of traumatic disruption following bereavement. The significance of the relational aspect in bereavement is present in the paradigm of the Two-Track Model of Bereavement (S. Rubin, 1981, 1999). The implications of this approach are examined {{in the case of a}} soldier exposed to trauma and death. The case is examined from a traditional trauma perspective stressing exposure to life threat and again from a perspective stressing the significance of the relationship to the deceased. An exami-nation of the different intervention strategies and theiroutcome lends support to the impor-tance of the relational aspects in this case of trauma and supports the use of the Two-Track Model of Bereavement.

25|$|Furthermore, as {{a result}} of social workers' {{training}} in counseling and their experience in helping their clients with accessing benefits such as unemployment insurance and disability benefits, they are particularly well-suited to help individuals and families learn how to become financially self-sufficient.

In addition, social workers often work with low-income or low to middle-income people who are either unbanked (do not have a banking account) or underbanked (individuals who have a bank account but tend to rely on high cost non-bank providers for their financial transactions). Social workers who have an understanding of financial institutions would be able to guide individuals and families to use mainstream financial institutions and thereby hold onto more of their income and spend less on high cost non-bank financial services.|$|E
25|$|The biggest {{irritants}} came in 1982. In that year, the ABA discarded {{their system}} in which how well a pro did during the season had at least some bearing on who became Number one Pro for the year. Previously to 1982, who won the most money decided who was number one Pro. A pro's winnings were his points. The reason for the change was that Kevin McNeal, the ABA Number One Pro for 1981, had a runaway season and had wrapped up the title a full month before the Grand National, rendering the event <b>vis</b> <b>a</b> <b>vis</b> Number one Pro irrelevant. This resulted in a low turnout of big-name pros like Stu Thomsen and Greg Hill, both of whom opted to attend the NBL-sanctioned $10,000 pursed Knott's Berry Farm Mongoose International Grand Championships race being held the same weekend. Lack of pro attendance due to a foregone conclusion would mean lack of publicity for the ABA in the BMX press, which in turn would breed reluctance in both various BMX Industry and non-BMX industry-related companies to sponsor the Grand Nationals. The ABA {{wanted to make sure}} in 1982 that the pros attended their Grand Nationals and it was a relevant event.|$|E
40|$|We {{model the}} role of a parliament’s {{structure}} in shaping the accountability of elected representatives. In a setting in which lawmakers interact with a lobby through a bargaining process and with voters by means of elections, we show that only a sin-gle legislative body who can make {{take it or leave it}} offers to the lobby can be held unambiguously accountable to voters. Whenever the pressure group enjoys some bar-gaining power, two chambers might instead provide better discipline, depending on the rules governing their interaction, and in particular the allocation of the decision powers among them. We show that bicameralism with restricted amendment rights provides the best incentives, while unrestricted amendment rights result in a status quo bias. Furthermore, by adding complexity of the legislative process, the presence of a second chamber might lead to an undesirable outcome, i. e. a decline in the legislator’s bargaining power <b>vis</b> <b>a</b> ̀ <b>vis</b> the lobby and <b>a</b> reduction in his accountability.

The method is local feature based and is robust to image warping, occlusion, illumination anomalies, and sensed feature generation errors.

Traditionally fault tolerance is implemented using hardware redundancy, the higher the redundancy, greater the cost and possibilities of more failures occurring.

An algorithm has been developed, simulated and evaluated on the practical case study <b>vis</b> –a- <b>vis</b> <b>a</b> traditional dual redundant system.

[...] The mid-January announcement that Late Night would continue until February 20 precluded any notion of starting the tour immediately following Springsteen's appearance at Super Bowl XLIII, in addition to the band feeling that they had just gotten off the Magic Tour and [...] "Wait, let’s stop a minute." [...] Meanwhile, the June 1 start date of The Tonight Show posed problems for Weinberg's continued presence on the tour. [...] O'Brien told a Variety reporter at the time of the announcement that he hoped that Weinberg would follow him to Los Angeles and that he also hoped an arrangement could be worked out to let Weinberg go on the road with Springsteen as had been done for past tours. [...] At NBC, the coexistence between the drummer's two bosses was known as the Weinberg-Springsteen Rule, and was not typically extended to other talent at the network. [...] In a high-profile Rolling Stone cover story interview, Springsteen was vague about the matter: [...] "All I know is this – it's all gonna work out, one way or another. If people wanna come out and see the E Street Band, they'll be able to come out and see the E Street Band." [...] And whether Weinberg would stay with O'Brien and move or not was a subject of conflicting news reports until O'Brien confirmed on February 18 that Weinberg and the band were indeed coming with him. [...] A few days later, E Streeter Steven Van Zandt said of Weinberg's availability for the post-June 1, European leg: “We’re still figuring that out. We’ll see. I think Max will be there for most of it. ... I know he was very much trying to figure it out.” [...] Weinberg had not missed an E Street Band show since joining the outfit in 1974, and Van Zandt said that no amount of rehearsal by another drummer could replace Weinberg's intuitive understanding of Springsteen's performance gambits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} support the designer of Visual Interactive Systems (<b>VISs)</b> in adapting <b>a</b> <b>VIS</b> {{to the evolution of}} its users. This process is called co-evolution of users and systems. The approach is based on the identification of the patterns of interaction between the user and an interactive system and on their use for the evolution of the system to facilitate novel usages introduced by the user. The approach is focused on WIMP systems and is based on the recently introduced PCL (Pictorial Computing Laboratory) model of interaction, within which we provide a novel definition of interaction pattern. The proposal assumes that the <b>VIS</b> is observed by <b>an</b> external system called SIC (Supporting Interaction Co-evolution), which is in charge of recording the interactions between the user and the VIS and of analyzing the relevant interaction patterns. In particular, SIC exploits a UML-based statechart specification of the VIS in order to associate observed user activities with the states of the interactive process. This information provides a useful basis for a variety of pattern recognition techniques. Two techniques called usual state and recurrent sequence recognition are illustrated and the results of a first experiment are discussed...|$|R
