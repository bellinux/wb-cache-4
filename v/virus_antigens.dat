40|$|Tissues from mink {{infected}} with aleutian disease virus were {{examined by the}} electron microscope {{for the presence of}} virus particles. Virus-like particles, measuring 22 nm in diameter, were observed in macrophages of spleen, mesenteric lymph node and in Kupffer cells in liver of mink ten to 13 days after infection. The virus-like particles were usually present in vacuoles inside the cytoplasm of macrophages and Kupffer cells and, occasionally, similar particles were observed inside the nucleus. Cells from uninfected mink did not contain such patricles. To correlate the existence of these virus-like particles with the presence of aleutian disease <b>virus</b> <b>antigen</b> in infected cells, tissues were processed for immunoferritin technique. It was found that aleutian disease <b>virus</b> <b>antigen</b> was present in vacuoles inside the cytoplasm of cells from the infected spleen, lymph node and liver, and that the location was {{similar to that of the}} 22 nm virus-like particles.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{has shown that}} virus can be readily {{detected}} by immunofluorescent staining in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) of SJL mice persistently infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). Considering the low CNS virus content, large amounts of <b>virus</b> <b>antigen</b> were found in the white matter, the site of demyelinating lesions. <b>Virus</b> <b>antigen</b> was detected in all animals killed after post-infection (PI) Day 21, a time which can be considered as the beginning of the persistent phase of this infection, and the appearance of <b>virus</b> <b>antigen</b> in white matter corresponded closely in time with the onset of demyelination. The pathogensis of this persistent infection can now be reasonably well reconstructed from the temporal observations made in this study. It would appear that between the second and third week PI, virus replication largely shifts from neurons in spinal cord gray matter to other cell types located in white matter. While a lower-grade persistent infection (in terms of the relative number of cells containing <b>virus</b> <b>antigen)</b> is established and maintained in cells in the gray matter and inflammatory and leptomeningeal infiltrates, cells in white matter appear to be mainly responsible for perpetuating the infection. Why these cells should supplant neurons as the most susceptible host cell during the chronic phase of the infection is discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{antigen capture}} {{immunoassay}} to detect West Nile (WN) <b>virus</b> <b>antigen</b> in infected mosquitoes and avian tissues has been developed. With this assay purified WN virus was detected at {{a concentration of}} 32 pg/ 0. 1 ml, and antigen in infected suckling mouse brain and laboratory-infected mosquito pools could be detected when the WN virus titer was 10 (2. 1) to 10 (3. 7) PFU/ 0. 1 ml. In a blindly coded set of field-collected mosquito pools (n = 100), this assay detected WN <b>virus</b> <b>antigen</b> in 12 of 18 (66. 7 %) TaqMan-positive pools, whereas traditional reverse transcriptase PCR detected 10 of 18 (55. 5 %) positive pools. A sample set of 73 organ homogenates from naturally infected American crows was also examined by WN <b>virus</b> <b>antigen</b> capture immunoassay and TaqMan {{for the presence of}} WN <b>virus.</b> The <b>antigen</b> capture assay detected antigen in 30 of 34 (88. 2 %) TaqMan-positive tissues. Based upon a TaqMan-generated standard curve of infectious WN virus, the limit of detection in the antigen capture assay for avian tissue homogenates was approximately 10 (3) PFU/ 0. 1 ml. The recommended WN <b>virus</b> <b>antigen</b> capture protocol, which includes a capture assay followed by a confirmatory inhibition assay used to retest presumptive positive samples, could distinguish between the closely related WN and St. Louis encephalitis viruses in virus-infected mosquito pools and avian tissues.

50|$|To {{increase}} their effectiveness, vaccines should be administered {{as soon as}} possible after a dog enters a high-risk area, such as a shelter. 10 to 14 days are required for partial immunity to develop. Administration of B. bronchiseptica and canine-parainfluenza vaccines may then be continued routinely, especially during outbreaks of kennel cough. There are several methods of administration, including parenteral and intranasal. However, the intranasal method has been recommended when exposure is imminent, due to a more rapid and localized protection. Several intranasal vaccines have been developed that contain canine adenovirus in addition to B bronchiseptica and canine-parainfluenza <b>virus</b> <b>antigens.</b> Studies have thus far not been able to determine which formula of vaccination is the most efficient. Adverse effects of vaccinations are mild, but the most common effect observed up to 30 days after administration is nasal discharge. Vaccinations are not always effective.

5000|$|A direct oncogenic viral {{mechanism}} involves either {{insertion of}} additional viral oncogenic genes into the host cell or to enhance already existing oncogenic genes (proto-oncogenes) in the genome. Indirect viral oncogenicity involves chronic nonspecific inflammation occurring over decades of infection, {{as is the}} case for HCV-induced liver cancer. These two mechanisms differ in their biology and epidemiology: direct tumor viruses must have at least one virus copy in every tumor cell expressing at least one protein or RNA that is causing the cell to become cancerous. Because foreign <b>virus</b> <b>antigens</b> are expressed in these tumors, persons who are immunosuppressed such as AIDS or transplant patients are at higher risk for these types of cancers. Chronic indirect tumor viruses, on the other hand, can be lost (at least theoretically) from a mature tumor that has accumulated sufficient mutations and growth conditions (hyperplasia) from the chronic inflammation of viral infection. In this latter case, it is controversial but at least theoretically possible that an indirect tumor virus could undergo [...] "hit-and-run" [...] and so the virus would be lost from the clinically diagnosed tumor. In practical terms, this is an uncommon occurrence if it does occur.|$|E

40|$|AbstractResponse-guided {{therapy is}} of limited use in {{developing}} countries because hepatitis C virus RNA detection by sensitive molecular methods is time- and labor-consuming and expensive. We evaluated early predictive efficacy of serum hepatitis C <b>virus</b> core <b>antigen</b> kinetics on sustained virologic response in patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus during pegylated interferon plus ribavirin treatment. For 478 patients recruited, hepatitis C virus RNAs were detected at baseline, and at weeks 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 using Cobas TaqMan. Architect hepatitis C <b>virus</b> core <b>antigen</b> was performed at baseline, and weeks 4 and 12. Predictive values of hepatitis C <b>virus</b> core <b>antigen</b> on sustained virologic response were compared to hepatitis C virus RNA. In the first 12 weeks after treatment initiation the dynamic patterns of serum hepatitis C <b>virus</b> core <b>antigen</b> and hepatitis C virus RNA levels were similar in sustained virologic response, relapse, and null response patients groups. Although areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves of hepatitis C <b>virus</b> core <b>antigen</b> were {{lower than those of}} hepatitis C virus RNA at the same time points, modeling analysis showed that undetectable hepatitis C <b>virus</b> core <b>antigen</b> (rapid virological response based on hepatitis C <b>virus</b> core <b>antigen)</b> had similar positive predictive value on sustained virologic response to hepatitis C virus RNA at week 4 (90. 4 % vs 93. 3 %), and hepatitis C <b>virus</b> core <b>antigen</b> decrease greater than 1 log 10 IU/mL (early virological response based on hepatitis C <b>virus</b> core <b>antigen)</b> had similar negative predictive value to hepatitis C virus RNA at week 12 (94. 1 % vs 95. 2 %).

40|$|Upon the {{addition}} of antibody to measles virus, measles <b>virus</b> <b>antigens</b> expressed {{on the surface of}} infected cells can be modulated from the cell's membrane in vitro. Removal of measles <b>virus</b> <b>antigens</b> from the surface of cells occurs relatively rapidly and is accompanied by a parallel reduction in the ability of antibody and complement to lyse these cells. Modulation of surface viral antigens can occur in the absence of cap formation and is fully reversible once measles virus antibodies are removed from culture medium. Protracted exposure of acutely infected cells to measles virus antibodies results in a population of cells that exhibit normal cytomorphology and growth behavior. These cells continue to express measles <b>virus</b> <b>antigens</b> internally, but not at the cell surface, and are refractory to immune lysis. Once antiviral antibody is removed, measles <b>virus</b> <b>antigens</b> again appear on the cell surface, giant cell and syncytial formation occur, and cell death follows.
