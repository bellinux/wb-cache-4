5|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{is divided}} into an anterior lobe, a posterior lobe, and the flocculonodular lobe. The anterior and posterior lobes are connected in the middle by the <b>vermis.</b> The cerebellum has a much thinner outer cortex that is narrowly furrowed horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Congenital {{malformation}} or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar <b>vermis</b> is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the <b>vermis.</b> The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E

40|$|Vermicompost, {{a product}} of the {{composting}} system that utilizes earthworms for the decomposition of the biosolids and/or solid wastes is now considered in organic farming. But since it is applied in solid form, it is difficult for some plants to take up the nutrient contents. The liquid form is the <b>vermi</b> tea which facilitates the plants for fast absorption of the nutrients. The main objective {{of this study is to}} develop a <b>vermi</b> tea brewing machine taking into consideration system components and material specifications. Specifically, it aimed to establish the operating time of the machine and to evaluate its performance in terms of brewing efficiency and percent yield. The properties of the produced <b>vermi</b> tea were also evaluated. This is a developmental type of study which consists of development stage, preliminary testing stage and the performance testing stage. The <b>vermi</b> tea brewing machine comprised mainly of the cylindrical container, copper tubings, air pump, vermicompost container and support frame. During preliminary testing, the established machine’s operating time was 24 hours. Performance testing of the machine resulted to 99. 58 % yield and the brewing efficiency was acceptable in terms of the dissolved oxygen after the process. Properties of the produced <b>vermi</b> tea were tested by accredited laboratories and resulted to ph of 4. 23, total NPK of 0. 033 %, dissolved oxygen of 5. 62 mg/L, total coliform of 4, 500, 000 CFU/ml, mold of 3, 000 CFU/ml and yeast of 3, 000 CFU/ml.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{commodities}} in the Province of Apayao is corn. In the municipality of Conner, a previous study conducted showed that corn farmers heavily rely {{on the use of}} inorganic fertilizers and still produce low yield. This study was then conducted to compare traditional farming against the use of an intervention using <b>Vermi</b> Tea as supplemental spray. Results of this endeavor showed that the farms applied with supplemental organic spray performed better that that of the usual farmer’s practice in various aspects of corn growth and yield. Findings show that <b>vermi</b> tea, when used as a foliar spray can significantly improve the growth and yield of corn. Due to the presence of plant growth regulators, and its ability to improve the condition of the soil, the corn farm sprayed with <b>vermi</b> tea produced taller corn crops with longer and thicker ears. As reflected in this study, corn when applied with the <b>vermi</b> tea can have an increased yield which can go as high as two tons/ha. More importantly, <b>vermi</b> tea promotes the use of organic fertilizer which does not entail high cost and can be prepared using agricultural wastes and other locally available materials. This will not only contribute to the reduction of the amount of total waste but will also help minimize the use of chemical fertilizers. The technology intervention promoted in this project complements and supports various government agency thrusts and priorities which are geared towards improving the agriculture industry, maintaining environmental quality and sustainable use of resources, climate change adaptation and mitigation; and production of excellent researches that will promote quality education and contribute to the upliftment of the country and encourage multisectoral/ multidisciplinary research along the priority areas like food safety and security among others...|$|R
500|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{is located}} in the posterior cranial fossa. The fourth ventricle, pons and medulla are in front of the cerebellum. It is separated from the overlying cerebrum by a layer of leathery dura mater, the tentorium cerebelli; all of its connections with other parts of the brain travel through the pons. Anatomists classify the cerebellum as part of the metencephalon, which also includes the pons; the metencephalon is {{the upper part of the}} rhombencephalon or [...] "hindbrain". Like the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum is divided into two hemispheres; it also contains a narrow midline zone (the <b>vermis).</b> A set of large folds is, by convention, used to divide the overall structure into 10 smaller [...] "lobules". Because of its large number of tiny granule cells, the cerebellum contains more neurons than the total from the rest of the brain, but takes up only 10% of the total brain volume. The number of neurons in the cerebellum is related to the number of neurons in the neocortex. There are about 3.6 times as many neurons in the cerebellum as in the neocortex, a ratio that is conserved across many different mammalian species.|$|E

30|$|Plasmacytoid {{dendritic}} cells (pDCs), {{which are}} rare but crucial {{component of the}} immune system, serve as a bridge linking innate and adaptive immunity (Liu 2005). pDCs can produce 100 – 1000 times more type I interferon (IFN-I) than any other cell types upon viral infections or other stimulations (Siegal et al. 1999; Liu 2005; Reizis et al. 2011; Swiecki and Colonna 2015). In the recent years, the involvements of pDCs in multiple diseases, such as chronic viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and different types of cancers, have been extensively investigated (Tang et al. 2010; <b>Vermi</b> et al. 2011; Swiecki and Colonna 2015). pDC infiltration in the lesion area {{has been reported in}} the aforementioned diseases and the severity of pDC infiltration correlates with disease progression. In HIV/SIV infections, for example, pDCs migrate to lymphoid organs or mucosal tissues and contribute to pathological changes in these areas (Nascimbeni et al. 2009; Kwa et al. 2011; Li et al. 2013). Infiltration of activated pDCs to skin lesions was also reported in psoriasis, and pDCs may promote the morbidity through IFN-I dependent mechanism (Nestle et al. 2005; Reizis et al. 2011). Besides, in human tumors such as ovarian cancer, pDCs were found to be accumulated in the tumor sites through upregulation of several chemokine receptors (Zou et al. 2001; <b>Vermi</b> et al. 2011). The infiltrated pDCs may contribute to the induction and maintenance of immunotolerance in the tumor microenvironment (<b>Vermi</b> et al. 2011). The identification of immune cells by immunohistochemical analysis is essential for both clinical investigation and basic research. However, a specific antibody for pDC staining in paraffin-embedded tissue sections is still lacking.|$|R
