First, the real-time orbit and clock corrections are assessed against the IGS final products. The {{results show that}} the current IGS CLK 90 real-time stream can provide < 5  cm orbit and approximately 0.5  ns clock accuracies on both days. Second, using the proposed method the optimal local troposphere model has been determined with the overall precision of 1.42  cm on DOY 127 and 1.05  cm on DOY 185. Third, the determined local troposphere model is applied to augment real-time PPP at the user end. The results indicate that real-time PPP with local troposphere augmentation can provide 9.2 -cm horizontal and 10.1 -cm <b>vertical</b> positioning <b>accuracies</b> after 20  min of initialization time under the quiet troposphere condition, which is a significant improvement over the 13.2 -cm horizontal and 18.3 -cm <b>vertical</b> <b>accuracies</b> of real-time PPP with troposphere estimation. Moreover, the horizontal accuracies of 13.0  cm and the <b>vertical</b> <b>accuracies</b> of 12.4  cm have been obtained after 20 -min initialization time under the active troposphere condition, compared to the 16.0 -cm horizontal and 23.4 -cm <b>vertical</b> <b>accuracies</b> in the conventional troposphere estimation approach.|$|R

Nowadays direct sensor orientation is a common procedure used in simultaneous photogrammetric and Lidar surveys. Although the direct sensor orientation technologies provide a high degree of automation process due to the GNSS/INS technologies, the accuracies of the results obtained from the photogrammetric and Lidar surveys are dependent on the quality of a group of parameters that models accurately the user conditions of the system at the moment the job is performed.

40|$|The direct {{determination}} of exterior orientation parameters (EOP) of aerial images via {{integration of the}} Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and GPS is often used in photogrammetric mapping nowadays. The accuracies of the EOP depend on the accurate parameters related to sensors mounting when the job is performed (offsets of the IMU relative to the projection centre and the angles of boresigth misalignment between the IMU and the photogrammetric coordinate system). In principle, when the EOP values do not achieve the required accuracies for the photogrammetric application, the approach, known as Integrated Sensor Orientation (ISO), is used to refine the direct EOP. ISO approach requires accurate Interior Orientation Parameters (IOP) and standard deviation of the EOP under flight condition.
