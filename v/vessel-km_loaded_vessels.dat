50|$|The Charlotte Dundas {{was first}} sailed on 4 January 1803, with Lord Dundas {{and some of}} his friends and {{relatives}} on board. The crowd were pleased with what they saw, but Symington wanted to make improvements and another more ambitious trial was made on 28 March. On this occasion, the steamboat towed two <b>loaded</b> <b>vessels</b> through the canal, covering 18½ miles in 9½ hours.|$|R
50|$|The dock is {{operated}} by Ridham Sea Terminals and can accommodate shipping up to 5000 LT in four NAABSA (Not Always Afloat But Safely Aground) berths. It {{has the capacity}} to <b>load</b> <b>vessels</b> using a 23 m electric conveyor with a 40 tonne capacity crane available to load and unload containers. The dock has around 11400 m2 of warehousing as well as open storage capacity.|$|R
50|$|The dock at Llanelly was not walled, but had {{unimproved}} sloping margins; timber jetties with shoots were erected for <b>loading</b> <b>vessels.</b> The harbour {{pool was}} gated, {{and from time}} to time the provision of a second set of gates forming a lock was considered, but not proceeded with. Hydraulic machinery was provided from March 1858 by the Llanelly Dock Hydraulic Company, an entity evidently established for the purpose.|$|R

50|$|In May 2016 the millionth tonne {{of grain}} was {{exported}} through the Yarmouth Port 6 years after merchants Gleadell invested £5 million {{in developing a}} grain terminal in the new Outer Harbour. It {{is one of only}} 7 or 8 English ports capable of <b>loading</b> <b>vessels</b> over 13,000 tonnes. The millionth tonne was part of a 27,500 tonne cargo loaded onto the MV RESKO (Eastern Daily Press - Saturday 28th May 2016).|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} {{is made up}} of two sea-island berths {{that can}} <b>load</b> <b>vessels</b> of up to 350,000 DWT and a vapour recovery platform. Crude oil from the Forties pipeline undergoes stabilisation and gas processing and treatment at the Kinneil Terminal at Grangemouth before being pumped to a tank farm at Dalmeny on the southern shore of the Firth. The oil is then pumped to the Hound Point terminal where it is loaded onto tankers.|$|R
50|$|The {{mine was}} worked {{by hand and}} the skips run on wooden rails. The coal was <b>loaded</b> into <b>vessels</b> from a large wooden jetty. Due to the shallow channel at Swansea the coal {{was taken to a}} coal loading and storage depot at the head of Lake Macquarie, known as Reid's Mistake, where it was <b>loaded</b> upon oceangoing <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s, high viscocity {{oil from}} the Sarir field was piped to Tobruk for <b>loading</b> on <b>vessels,</b> because the oil was not safe to load at sea.|$|R
50|$|MACS3 {{consists}} of computer hardware {{and a range}} of software, which aim to minimize the operational load while <b>loading</b> a <b>vessel,</b> and to prevent any hard limitations from being breached.|$|R
40|$|Code Case 2564 for {{the design}} of impulsively <b>loaded</b> <b>vessels</b> was {{approved}} in January 2008. In 2010 the US Army Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel Program, with support from Sandia National Laboratories, procured a vessel per this Code Case for use on the Explosive Destruction System (EDS). The vessel was delivered to the Army in August of 2010 and approved for use by the DoD Explosives Safety Board in 2012. Although others have used the methodology and design limits of the Code Case to analyze vessels, to our knowledge, this was the first vessel to receive an ASME explosive rating with a U 3 stamp. This paper discusses lessons learned in the process. Of particular interest were issues related to defining the design basis in the User Design Specification and explosive qualification testing required for regulatory approval. Specifying and testing an impulsively <b>loaded</b> <b>vessel</b> is more complicated than a static pressure <b>vessel</b> because the <b>loads</b> depend on the size, shape, and location of the explosive charges in the vessel and on the kind of explosives used and the point of detonation. Historically the US Department of Defense and Department of Energy have required an explosive test. Currently the Code Case does not address testing requirements, but it would be beneficial if it did since having vetted, third party standards for explosive qualification testing would simplify the process for regulatory approval...|$|R
25|$|Shanties had antecedents in {{the working}} chants of British and other {{national}} maritime traditions. They were notably influenced by songs of African Americans, such as those sung whilst manually <b>loading</b> <b>vessels</b> with cotton in ports of the southern United States. Shanty repertoire borrowed from the contemporary popular music enjoyed by sailors, including minstrel music, popular marches, and land-based folk songs, which were adapted to suit musical forms matching the various labor tasks required to operate a sailing ship. Such tasks, which usually required a coordinated group effort in either a pulling or pushing action, included weighing anchor and setting sail.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 {{iron ore}} was {{discovered}} at Mount Whaleback and a mining venture was undertaken {{that included the}} establishment of a new town, Newman, 426 km of rail from the mine to the port and the development of processing equipment at both Newman and Port Hedland. In 1986, at a cost of $87 million, the existing channel was dredged to allow the port to increase the tonnage of those ships able to enter the port. Prior to dredging the port was only able to <b>load</b> <b>vessels</b> less than 2,000 tonnes but today it is able to accommodate ships over 250,000 tonnes.|$|R

2500|$|In 1892, the Detroit Dry Dock Company {{constructed}} a new dry dock near {{the foot of}} Orleans Street, just west of their original dry dock facility. [...] Dry Dock No. 2 was [...] long, [...] deep below the water line, with a width of between [...] (at the top) and [...] (at the bottom). [...] Over two thousand piles were driven into the ground to support the dock. As constructed, the dock could be flooded in twenty minutes and pumped dry in about ninety minutes. [...] The dock was sized {{to be able to}} accommodate any vessel traveling on the Great Lakes at that time, and could house even fully <b>loaded</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Many coolies {{were first}} deceived or kidnapped and, then kept in barracoons (detention centres) or <b>loading</b> <b>vessels</b> in the ports of departure, as were African slaves. In 1875, British commissioners {{estimated}} that approximately {{eighty percent of}} the workers had been abducted. Their voyages, which are sometimes called the Pacific Passage, were as inhumane and dangerous as the notorious Middle Passage of the Atlantic slave trade. Mortality was very high; [...] it is estimated that from 1847 to 1859, the average mortality rate for coolies aboard ships to Cuba was 15.2 percent, and losses among those aboard ships to Peru were as high as 40 percent in the 1850s, and 30.44 percent from 1860 to 1863.|$|R
50|$|In a {{normally}} <b>loaded</b> <b>vessel</b> any rolling from perpendicular is {{countered by}} a righting moment {{generated from the}} increased volume of water displaced by the hull on the lowered side. This assumes {{the center of gravity}} of the vessel is relatively constant. If a moving mass inside the vessel moves {{in the direction of the}} roll, this counters the righting effect by moving the center of gravity towards the lowered side. The free surface effect can become a problem in a craft with large partially full bulk cargo compartments, fuel tanks, or water tanks (especially if they span the full breadth of the ship), or from accidental flooding, such as has occurred in several accidents involving roll-on/roll-off ferries.|$|R

5000|$|They were notably {{influenced}} by songs of African Americans, {{such as those}} sung whilst manually <b>loading</b> <b>vessels</b> with cotton in ports of the southern United States.

During {{the first half of}} the 19th century, some of the songs African Americans sang also began to appear in use for shipboard tasks, i.e. as shanties.|$|R
