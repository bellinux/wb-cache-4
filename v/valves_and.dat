5|$|In all molluscs, {{the mantle}} forms a thin {{membrane}} {{that covers the}} animal's body and extends out from it in flaps or lobes. In bivalves, the mantle lobes secrete the <b>valves,</b> <b>and</b> the mantle crest secretes the whole hinge mechanism consisting of ligament, byssus threads (where present), and teeth.|$|E
5|$|The RS-25 engine {{consists}} of various pumps, <b>valves,</b> <b>and</b> other components which work in concert to produce thrust. Fuel (liquid hydrogen) and oxidizer (liquid oxygen) from the Space Shuttle's external tank entered the orbiter at the umbilical disconnect <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> from there flowed through the orbiter's {{main propulsion system}} (MPS) feed lines; whereas in the Space Launch System (SLS), fuel and oxidizer from the rocket's core stage will flow directly into the MPS lines. Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and oxidizer each branch out into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, prevalves then allow the propellants to enter the engine.|$|E
5|$|Two {{versions}} of the Manchester Mark 1 were produced, the first of which, the Intermediary Version, was operational by April 1949. The Final Specification machine, which was fully working by October 1949, contained 4,050 <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> had a power consumption of 25kilowatts. Perhaps the Manchester Mark 1's most significant innovation was its incorporation of index registers, commonplace on modern computers.|$|E

5|$|Also {{known as}} a {{manifold}} cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead. A valve cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread <b>valves,</b> <b>and</b> when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the central vault {{ceiling of the}} main {{sanctuary}} cracked, {{and had to be}} repaired. At that time the pulpit was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had separate pulpits. Underneath the sanctuary ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was fixed in the 1950s with the installation of check <b>valves,</b> <b>and</b> a concrete slab floor was installed. Though the intent was to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{hot gases}} {{produced}} by the internal combustion engines passes through the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> causes high temperatures in the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> its seat. To avoid damaging the exhaust valve, heat must be transferred from the valve to its seat during the contact they make at the opening and closing cycle. Heat transfer rate from the exhaust valve to its seat {{is a function of}} many factors. One of the most important factors is the thermal contact conductance (TCC) between the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> its seat. Very few researches have been done about estimation of the TCC between the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> its seat in the past. An experimental study has been conducted to determine the TCC between two co-axial cylinders, as the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> its seat. Furthermore, the influence of contact pressure and frequency of contact upon the TCC is studied. The results show that the TCC decreases as the frequency of contact increases. The experimental results obtained from the presen...|$|R
50|$|Endocardial cushion defects are {{associated}} with abnormalities of the atrioventricular valves (the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> the tricuspid <b>valve).</b> These include the cleft mitral <b>valve,</b> <b>and</b> the single atrioventricular valve (a single large, deformed valve that flows into both the right ventricle and the left ventricle).|$|R
5|$|Supplies and {{materials}} {{of all kinds}} poured in: 2,157 carloads of electrical equipment, 1,219 of heavy equipment, 5,389 of lumber, 1,407 of pipe and fittings, 1,188 of steel, 257 of <b>valves,</b> <b>and</b> 11 of welding electrodes. The racetracks required 85,000 vacuum tubes. Where possible, off-the-shelf components were used, but all too many components of the calutrons were unique. Two purchasing departments were established, one in Boston near Stone & Webster for facility equipment, and the other at Oak Ridge for construction supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} at the {{anterior}} end, and opens into an elongated muscular pharynx with a triangular or Y-shaped lumen, lined by myoepithelial cells. The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine, which is lined with glandular and digestive cells. The anus {{is located on the}} ventral surface close to the posterior of the body. In some species, there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface; these contain <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> may allow egestion of any excess water swallowed while feeding.|$|E
5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E

5|$|During World War II The German Navy {{deployed}} weather buoys (Wetterfunkgerät See — WFS) {{at fifteen}} fixed {{positions in the}} North Atlantic and Barents Sea. They were launched from U-boats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms (1,800 metres), limited by {{the length of the}} anchor cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the <b>valves,</b> <b>and</b> nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast) were exhausted, after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self-destructed.|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of <b>valves)</b> <b>and</b> monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E

5|$|Primitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow {{their prey}} whole, {{and start to}} digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> other {{inedible}} materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is {{passed on to the}} pyloric stomach, which always remains inside the disc. The retraction and contraction of the cardiac stomach is activated by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.|$|E
5|$|The main {{muscular system}} in {{bivalves}} is the posterior and anterior adductor muscles, although the anterior muscles {{may be reduced}} or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> contract to close the shell. They work {{in opposition to the}} ligament which tends to pull the valves apart. In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior adductor muscle has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central adductor muscle occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, striated muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull.|$|E
5|$|The use of sleeve <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E

5|$|U-43 was due {{to depart}} Lorient on a war patrol to an area off Freetown, west Africa, but early on 4 February 1941, she sank while tied to Ysere, an old sailing ship which {{was used as a}} {{floating}} pier. <b>Valves</b> <b>and</b> vents had been tampered-with the previous day, but no one had noticed the slow, but steady ingress of water into the bilges. To make matters worse and contrary to a Befehlshaber der U-Boote (BdU—U-boat command headquarters) directive, a hatch had been left open, allowing water to pour into the after torpedo room. Two petty officers were found to be most at fault; but Lüth, as captain, was ultimately responsible. However, according to author Jordan Vause, no record of punishment seems to have survived and Lüth's career {{does not appear to have}} been affected. U-43 was refloated and Lüth took it back out into the North Atlantic in May 1941.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural <b>valves)</b> <b>and</b> in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally {{has no effect on}} platelet function).|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E
