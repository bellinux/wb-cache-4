40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the potential}} for increased cross-border cooperation for border regions with a reasonable or large cross-border reliance on production and consumption of livestock commodities. The extended cross-border region of the Netherlands (NL), North Rhine Westphalia (NRW), and Lower Saxony (NDS) is a particular example in this respect. Despite the EU single market, both in peace time (i. e. without outbreaks of highly contagious livestock diseases like Classical Swine Fever) and crisis (i. e. during such outbreaks) situations, trade barriers for livestock and livestock commodities among Member States exist or are further established, resulting in (major) economic consequences. In this paper, a general framework including all critical factors, (inter) relations and (im) possibilities associated with the challenges of cross-border collaboration is presented. Furthermore, difficulties in disease control harmonization and collaboration due to current borders, as well as possibilities for future cross-border cooperation, are discussed for the cross-border region NL-NRW-NDS. To reduce the financial-economic impact of the borders, this study suggests applying <b>veterinary</b> routine <b>measures</b> more efficiently, harmonizing current <b>veterinary</b> control <b>measures</b> as well as adding economic instruments to current <b>veterinary</b> control <b>measures.</b> Moreover, a futureoriented approach should be used, which should include an analysis of changes in (contact) structure of the livestock sector in the coming ten years. Changes in such factors {{are a result of}} changing (global) autonomous drivers and institutional conditions, such as changes in consumer preferences and EU agricultural policies. Changes in (contact) structures affect the risks of disease introduction, spread and control and accordingly, the consequences of strategies to manage these diseases. The integrated approach as proposed in the general framework as well as the inventory of cross-border difficulties and possibilities for the case study NL-NRW-NDS can be used and should be regarded as a starting point to further quantify the financial-economic impact of improving cross-border collaboration and harmonization...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bluetongue (BT) is a {{vector-borne disease}} of {{ruminants}} caused by bluetongue virus that is transmitted by biting midges (Culicoides spp.). In 2006, {{the introduction of}} BTV serotype 8 (BTV- 8) caused a severe epidemic in Western and Central Europe. The principal effective <b>veterinary</b> <b>measure</b> in response to BT {{was believed to be}} vaccination accompanied by other measures such as movement restrictions and surveillance. As the number of vaccine doses available {{at the start of the}} vaccination campaign was rather uncertain, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality and the Dutch agricultural industry wanted to evaluate several different vaccination strategies. This study aimed to rank eight vaccination strategies based on their efficiency (i. e. net costs in relation to prevented losses or benefits) for controlling the bluetongue virus serotype 8 epidemic in 2008 Methodology/Principal Findings: An economic model was developed that included the Dutch professional cattle, sheep and goat sectors together with the hobby farms. Strategies were evaluated based on the least cost - highest benefit frontier, the benefit-cost ratio and the total net returns. Strategy F, where all adult sheep at professional farms in the Netherlands would be vaccinated was very efficient at lowest costs, whereas strategy D, where additional to all adult sheep at professional farms also all adult cattle in the four Northern provinces would be vaccinated, was also very efficient but at a little higher costs. Strategy C, where all adult sheep and cattle at professional farms in the whole of the Netherlands would be vaccinated was also efficient but again at higher costs.

40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{domestic}} trade in livestock, intra-communal trade across the European Union (EU) {{is subject to}} costly, additional <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures.</b> Short-distance transportation just across a border requires more measures than long-distance domestic transportation, while {{the need for such}} additional cross-border measures can be questioned. This study examined the prospects for cost reductions from relaxing additional cross-border measures related to trade within the cross-border region of the Netherlands (NL) and Germany (GER); that is, North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The study constructed a deterministic spread-sheet cost model to calculate the costs of both routine <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures</b> (standard measures that apply to both domestic and cross-border transport) and additional cross-border measures (extra measures that only apply to cross-border transport) as applied in 2010. This model determined costs by stakeholder, region and livestock sector, and studied the prospects for cost reduction by calculating the costs after the relaxation of additional cross-border measures. The selection criteria for relaxing these measures were (1) a low expected added value on preventing contagious livestock diseases, (2) no expected additional veterinary risks in case of relaxation of measures and (3) reasonable cost-saving possibilities. The total cost of routine <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures</b> and additional cross-border measures for the cross-border region was € 22. 1 million, 58 % (€ 12. 7 million) of which came from additional cross-border measures. Two-thirds of this € 12. 7 million resulted from the trade in slaughter animals. The main cost items were veterinary checks on animals (twice in the case of slaughter animals), export certification and control of export documentation. Four additional cross-border measures met the selection criteria for relaxation. The relaxation of these measures could save € 8. 2 million (€ 5. 0 million for NL and € 3. 2 million for GER) annually. Farmers would experience the greatest savings (99 %), and most savings resulted from relaxing additional cross-border measures related to poultry (48 %), mainly slaughter broilers (GER), and pigs (48 %), mainly slaughter pigs (NL). In particular, the trade in slaughter animals (dead-end hosts) is subject to measures, such as veterinary checks {{on both sides of the}} border that might not contribute to preventing contagious livestock diseases. Therefore, this study concludes that there are several possibilities for reducing the costs of additional cross-border measures in both countries...|$|E

Objective: The {{purpose of the present}} study was therefore to compare the serum albumin values obtained by SPE and BCG in canine and equine patients. Methods: Albumin measured by BCG and SPE was compared in the serum from 30 canine and 30 equine patients. Results: Good correlation was found (Spearman´s rho rs = 0. 91 in dogs and 0. 84 in horses). However, Altman and Bland analysis of results showed a positive bias of BCG with SPE (3. 41 g/l in horses and 0. 41 g/l in dogs) that increased when only hypoalbuminemic patients were considered (4. 17 g/l in horses and 1. 31 g/l in dogs).

The research was carried out {{in the form of a}} structured questionnaire, which was sent to the individual respondents after this was agreed by phone. It should answer the question whether the emergency housing of cattle in the emergency planning zone of Temelín Nuclear Power Station is sufficiently secured. The results show that emergency housing is not the priority of farmers, because only 55 % of the respondents sent back completed questionnaires. Most of them, i. e. 64 %, bred cattle in stable and grazing, 27 % in stable only and 9 % were exclusively grazing. In addition to grazing, preserved fodder (silage, haylage, hay) are mainly used for feeding and water from underground sources and from a water supply network for watering where all these sources can be protected against radioactive fallout. It was also found that electricity was used for watering. Upon its failure, except for two cases, no emergency power supply were available.

The data was analysed applying the descriptive statistical analysis method. The Master thesis consists of 48 written pages, 7 tables, 10 figures and 56 references. The study aimed at analysing the Salmonellosis hazard in the poultry farms in Klaipeda County and preparing the plans for Salmonellosis prevention. The goals: to collect the data for epidemiological analysis; to analyse the hazards of Salmonellosis in poultry farms in Klaipeda County; to prepare the plans for Salmonellosis prevention. Bacteriological analyses were carried out according to Food and Feed Microbiology LST EN ISO 6579 standards; the horizontal method for the detection of Salmonella spp. (ISO 6579 : 2002) was applied. The commercial kits were used to identify Salmonella spp. In a year 2005, 15660 poultry keepers were registrated in Klaipeda County, with the total of 817960 birds, 797974 of which were hens. In 2005 there were analysed 1524 samples for Salmonellosis. About 40. 4 % of the analysed samples were pooled samples of chicks 1 to 4 d old, in which the majority of pooled samples constituted the samples from boxes, bedding, faeces (282 samples). The pooled samples in the layer hens group amounted to 24. 6 % of the total analysed samples (faeces and the content of cloacae 347 samples). The pooled samples in a hatchery group were 10. 6 % of the total analysed samples and 31 feed ingredient samples of the diets were analysed. During the research year Salmonella spp. were not detected in any of the analysed samples. In the poultry farms of Klaipeda County the main focus for Salmonelosis prevention is to safeguard Salmonella spp. passage to poultry farms. The recent technological advances and strict feed control allow for the optimal conditions for bird raising. Special consideration is given to the personal.

First, we sought to {{evaluate}} the psychometric properties of a newly developed instrument designed to <b>measure</b> factors incoming <b>veterinary</b> medical students indicated were important (or not) in their decision to become a veterinarian. Second, we sought to produce a measure of these factors by utilizing a state-of-the-art psychometric modeling technique to produce an empirical hierarchy that illustrates the construct of interest and make appropriate inferences about the findings. Methods:The Career Influence Factors Survey (CIFS) was administered to an incoming class of veterinary medical students. Data were analyzed via the Rasch Rating Scale Model. The psychometric properties of the instrument were evaluated according to Messick’s framework of construct validity. Results: Results indicate the Career Influence Factors Survey is a psychometrically-sound instrument capable of accurately and reliably <b>measuring</b> <b>veterinary</b> medical students’ motivations for becoming a veterinarian. Substantive results indicated issues pertaining to animal welfare were the most important in making the decision to become a veterinarian. Previous exposure to a particular animal or family pet was only moderately influential in students’ decision to pursue a career in veterinary medicine. Factors such as a desire to work on food production issues and anticipated earning potential tend to be of lesser importance to incoming students. Conclusion: We encourage others to utilize the instrument and/or adopt the methodology to evaluate the psychometric properties of other instruments.

40|$|Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is {{a crucial}} {{antibody}} to protect animals from invasion by microorganisms. Although there exist several methods in <b>veterinary</b> medicine to <b>measure</b> IgG levels for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, these methods suffer from various weaknesses. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy coupled with chemometric tools such as principal component regression has been widely employed for the measurement of compounds in mixtures with the advantages that include simplicity, quickness and low test cost. Earlier investigation for IgG assay based on transmission IR spectroscopy using laboratory grade equipment has been conducted, {{but it is not}} readily transferrable to the clinic, hospital or small laboratory setting. More robust attenuated total reflectance (ATR) IR spectroscopy platforms have recently been developed for a range of roles in the field. This study investigated the possibility of using ATR-IR spectroscopy to determine the IgG concentrations in foal serum and adult horse plasma samples. The results of this work showed that immunoglobulin G concentrations predicted by ATR-IR spectroscopy with chemometric analysis had good agreement with those obtained from the radial immunodiffusion (RID) reference method. The precision of this approach was most compatible to RID method when the IgG concentration was high, but poorer for lower IgG concentrations. It was also showed that building a united calibration model for serum and plasma samples is likely. The results of this work indicate that ATR-IR spectroscopy coupled with chemometric analysis is a promising technique to measure the equine serum and plasma IgG concentrations in the veterinary clinical or hospital environment.

40|$|In 2005, Q fever was {{diagnosed}} on two dairy goat farms and 2 years later it {{emerged in the}} human population {{in the south of}} the Netherlands. From 2007 to 2010, more than 4, 000 human cases were notified with an annual seasonal peak. The outbreaks in humans were mainly restricted to the south of the country in an area with intensive dairy goat farming. In the most affected areas, up to 15 % of the population may have been infected. The epidemic resulted in a serious burden of disease, with a hospitalisation rate of 20 % of notified cases and is expected to result in more cases of chronic Q fever among risk groups in the coming years. The most important risk factor for human Q fever is living close (< 5 km) to an infected dairy goat farm. Occupational exposure plays a much smaller role. In 2009 several veterinary control measures were implemented including mandatory vaccination of dairy goats and dairy sheep, improved hygiene measures, and culling of pregnant animals on infected farms. The introduction of these drastic <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures</b> has probably ended the Q fever outbreak, for which the Netherlands was ill-prepared...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} of animal protection against cruelty, in farming, during transport and at slaughter in cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses and poultry and its {{development in the}} Czech Republic during the period 1996 - 2001 has been evaluated. The evaluation {{was carried out by}} comparison of the following parameters - <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures</b> for improvement of animal protection, violation of law, total number of failures to fulfil animal protection requirements in animal welfare to the total number of carried out inspections. In the surveyed farm animals there were only very sporadic cases of deliberate cruelty. The suffering of animals was caused mainly by neglecting the animal protection by incorect use of premises, by not observing technological procedures, by unsatisfactory hygiene, by insufficient feeding or watering, unsatisfactory care of animal at pasture, unsatisfactory care of mothers and their young, violation of animal protection during transport, in abattories and at slaughter. The consequences of the above mentioned cases were not only the suffering of animals and their possible consequent health problems, but a negative economic impact and sanctions for the farmers as well.

40|$|The {{economic}} consequences of livestock epidemics have been long studied {{for purposes of}} estimating the costs of preventive and curative <b>veterinary</b> <b>measures.</b> In this paper, we show that this catastrophic risk may have wide market consequences, and that the risk management systems are quite limited to compensate long term impacts in the European context of growing trade. Through a detailed literature review, we present the main developments of the economic research aiming at highlighting the {{economic consequences}} of animal epidemics such as Foot and Mouth Disease. We acknowledge that a very few {{studies have focused on}} the economic dynamics and on the long-run effects occurring after an epidemic disease outbreak. We discuss the relevance of a dynamic approach to reveal that the de-structuring of livestock markets affects the production dynamics as well as the whole agricultural sector. Financial implications and market constraints remain poorly studied in the livestock epidemics literature. We emphasize the growing interest of a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium approach to reveal the overall effects of epidemic outbreaks on the whole economy. This innovative research raises important challenges for the assessment and implementation of risk management policie...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} swine {{diseases}} and their control, particularly that of classical swine fever, is described {{from the first}} recordings {{to the time of}} elucidation of the etiology of the classical swine fever virus {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century. The work is subdivided according to the historical epochs. For a better understanding of the listed events the political-territorial, economic, scientific, medical and veterinary conditions of the respective epochs are described in greater detail. In the scare antique and medieval recordings little information can be found on swine diseases and their treatment. In addition, the few recordings from these epochs leave a lot of room for speculation. In contrast, the informational value of the literary sources increases significantly in modern times. From this time on efforts are made to provide an extensive overview of the occurrence of and the knowledge on the most important diseases known. In addition, a great diversity of theories on the pathogenesis and on the nature of diseases as well as general and specific therapeutic and prophylactical measures developed over the years are described. Starting with the first cases documented it is tried to reconstruct the occurrence and spread of CSF as well as the occurrence of possible earlier cases and early therapeutic attempts. A diversity of theories on the origins of the disease is discussed. Furthermore, the work shows the important process of differentiating CSF from other diseases. The elucidation of the nature of the virus by de Schweinitz and Dorset at the beginning of the 20 th century is decribed in greater detail. In addition, the ground-breaking works of Loeffler are discussed, whose discovery of the causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease in 1898 marked the birth of the science of virology. Attempts to control the disease  which were based on wrong assumption on the etiology of the virus and therefore largely remaind unsuccessful  basically concentrated on general and veterinary hygienic, serological and medicinal measures. The application of <b>veterinary</b> hygienic <b>measures,</b> which was favoured by various scientists already at an early stage, did not lead to the expected positive effects, which can be explained by the fact that the measures were not coordinated at a sopra-regional level. New impulses for immune prophylaxis and therapy as well as for the veterinary hygienic handling of the disease first came from the elucidation of the etiology of the virus. Finally, the present situation as well as present and future problems of CSF control are dicussed...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{emergence}} of Hendra virus (HeV), private veterinarians have had to adopt additional infection control strategies to manage this zoonosis. Between 1994 and 2010, seven people became infected with HeV, four fatally. All infected people were at {{a higher risk of}} exposure from contact with horses as they were either veterinary personnel, assisting veterinarians, or working in the horse industry. The management of emerging zoonoses is best approached from a One Health perspective as it benefits biosecurity as well as a public health, including the health of those most at risk, in this case private veterinarians. In 2011 we conducted a cross-sectional study of private veterinarians registered in Queensland and providing veterinary services to horses. The aim {{of this study was to}} gauge if participants had adopted recommendations for improved infection control, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the development of HeV specific management strategies during the winter of 2011. A majority of participants worked in practices that had a formal HeV management plan, mostly based on the perusal of official guidelines and an HeV field kit. The use of PPE increased as the health status of an equine patient decreased, demonstrating that many participants evaluated the risk of exposure to HeV appropriately; while others remained at risk of HeV infection by not using the appropriate PPE even when attending a sick horse. This study took place after Biosecurity Queensland had sent a comprehensive package about HeV management to all private veterinarians working in Queensland. However, those who had previous HeV experience through the management of suspected cases or had attended a HeV specific professional education programme in the previous 12 months were more likely to use PPE than those who had not. This may indicate that for private veterinarians in Queensland personal experience and face-to-face professional education sessions may be more effective in the improvement of HeV management than passive education via information packages. The role of different education pathways in the sustainable adoption of <b>veterinary</b> infection control <b>measures</b> should be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|Query (Q) fever is a {{globally}} distributed {{zoonotic disease}} caused by Coxiella burnetii, a bacterial agent for which ruminants {{are the most}} prevalent natural reservoir. Data regarding Q fever infection in camels in Algeria are limited. Therefore, a survey to detect seroprevalence of C. burnetii antibodies was conducted among healthy camel populations in a vast area in southeastern Algeria to determine distribution of the Q fever causative organism and to identify risk factors associated with infection. Between January and March 2016, blood samples were collected from 184 camels and serum samples were subsequently analysed using a commercial Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit. At the time of blood collection, a questionnaire investigating 13 potential predisposing factors associated with C. burnetii seropositivity was completed for every dromedary camel and herd. Results were analysed by a chi-square (χ 2) test and multivariate logistic regression. The seroprevalence of C. burnetii at the animal level was 71. 2 % (95 % CI: 65. 2 – 78. 3) and 85. 3 % (95 % CI: 72. 8 – 97. 8) at the herd level. At the animal level, differences in seroprevalence were observed because of herd size, animal age, animal sex, presence of ticks and contact with other herds. A multivariable logistic regression model identified three main risk factors associated with individual seropositivity: (1) age class > 11 years (OR = 8. 81, 95 % CI: 2. 55 – 30. 41), (2) herd size > 50 head (OR = 4. 46, 95 % CI: 1. 01 – 19. 59) and (3) infestation with ticks (OR 2. 2; 95 % CI: 1. 1 – 4. 5). This study of seroprevalence of C. burnetii infection in camels in Algeria revealed a high seroprevalence of Q fever in camel populations in southeastern Algeria and provided strong evidence that Q fever represents an economic, public health and <b>veterinary</b> concern. Appropriate <b>measures</b> {{should be taken to}} prevent the spread of C. burnetii and to reduce the risk of Q fever in farm animals and humans in this agro-ecologically and strategically important region of North Africa. </span...|$|R
