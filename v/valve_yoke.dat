5|$|<b>Yoke</b> <b>valves</b> {{are rated}} between 200 and 240 bar, and {{there does not}} appear to be any {{mechanical}} design detail preventing connection between any yoke fittings, though some older yoke clamps will not fit over the popular 232/240 bar combination DIN/yoke cylinder <b>valve</b> as the <b>yoke</b> is too narrow.|$|R
5|$|Adaptors are {{available}} to allow connection of DIN regulators to <b>yoke</b> cylinder <b>valves</b> (A-clamp or <b>yoke</b> adaptor), and to connect yoke regulators to DIN cylinder valves. (plug adaptors and block adaptors) Plug adaptors are rated for 232/240 bar, and can only be used with valves which are designed to accept them. Block adaptors are generally rated for 200 bar, {{and can be used}} with almost any 200 bar DIN valve.|$|R
25|$|<b>Yoke</b> <b>valves</b> (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure inlet opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an O-ring in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not to screw the yoke down too tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|R
40|$|An {{electromagnetic}} <b>valve</b> comprises a <b>yoke</b> (10); {{a magnet}} (30 a, 30 b) having pole pieces (50 a, 50 b) defining a gap; a flexure assembly (40) having one end {{attached to the}} yoke, such {{that part of the}} flexure assembly extends into the gap, the flexure assembly having at least one resilient portion formed of a resilient material and at least one magnetisable portion, wherein that part of the flexure assembly that extends into the gap is movable between the pole pieces through an intermediate position towards which it is resiliently biased such that a resilient mechanical force is generated by deflecting the resilient portion from an undetected position; and means (20) for polarising the magnetisable portion of the flexure assembly so that the part of the flexure assembly that is movable between the pole pieces is attracted towards a pole piece by a magnetic force, thereby defining a valve state; wherein the magnetisable portion and the resilient portion of the flexure assembly are configured such that the magnetic force defining the valve state is greater than the resilient mechanical force...|$|R

40|$|The {{actuation}} {{behavior of}} soft silicone-based magnetorheological eleastomers (MRE) in magnetic fields of variable strength was investigated. An {{inhomogeneous magnetic field}} {{gives rise to a}} reversible actuation effect, which {{is the result of the}} competition between magnetic and elastic forces in the material. MRE are capable to perform more sophisticated deformations than known rigid actuator materials. In this connection, the actuation behavior of MRE ring-shaped bodies in a valve-type device for the control of an air flow is demonstrated. For this purpose, MRE rings with different hardness were prepared and used in the valve. Additionally, the actuation of anisotropic MRE was compared with that of isotropic samples. The inhomogeneity of the magnetic field at the MRE material which is required for the actuation could be strongly influenced by the shape of the magnetic yoke. In the study, the closing characteristics of the <b>valve</b> with different <b>yoke</b> shapes and MRE materials were evaluated by measuring the dependence of the air flow rate on the magnetic field strength. It is demonstrated that the air flow through the valve can be controlled by the current in the field-generating coil, which yields the base for a new type of magnetic valves...|$|R
500|$|Until the 1970s, when {{submersible}} {{pressure gauges}} on regulators came into common use, diving cylinders often used a mechanical reserve mechanism to indicate to the diver that the cylinder was nearly empty. The gas supply was automatically cut-off by a spring loaded valve when the gas pressure reached the reserve pressure. To release the reserve, the diver pulled {{down on a}} rod that ran {{along the side of}} the cylinder and which activated a lever to open a bypass valve. The diver would then finish the dive before the reserve (typically [...] ) was consumed. On occasion, divers would inadvertently trigger the mechanism while donning gear or performing a movement underwater and, not realizing that the reserve had already been accessed, could find themselves out of air at depth with no warning whatsoever. These valves became known as [...] "J-valves" [...] from being item [...] "J" [...] in one of the first scuba equipment manufacturer catalogs. The standard non-reserve <b>yoke</b> <b>valve</b> at the time was item [...] "K", and is often still referred to as a [...] "K-valve". J-valves are still occasionally used by professional divers in zero visibility, where the submersible pressure gauge (SPG) can not be read. While the recreational diving industry has largely discontinued support and sales of the J-valve, the US Department of Defense, the US Navy, NOAA (the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) and OSHA (the national Occupational Health and Safety Administration) all still allow or recommend the use of J-valves as an alternative to a bailout cylinder or as an alternative to a submersible pressure gauge. They are generally not available through recreational dive shops, but are still available from some manufacturers. They can be significantly more expensive than K-valves from the same manufacturer.|$|R
40|$|Some motor {{operated}} valves now have higher torque switch settings due to regulatory requirements to ensure valve operability with appropriate margins at design basis conditions. Verifying operability with these settings imposes higher stem loads during periodic inservice testing. These higher test loads increase stresses {{in the various}} valve internal parts which may in turn increase the fatigue usage factors. This increased fatigue is judged to be a concern primarily in the <b>valve</b> disks, seats, <b>yokes,</b> stems, and stem nuts. Although the motor operators may also have significantly increased loading, they are being evaluated by the manufacturers and are {{beyond the scope of}} this study. Two gate valves representative of both relatively weak and strong valves commonly used in commercial nuclear applications were selected for fatigue analyses. Detailed dimensional and test data were available for both valves from previous studies at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Finite element models were developed to estimate maximum stresses in the internal parts of the valves and to identity the critical areas within the valves where fatigue may be a concern. Loads were estimated using industry standard equations for calculating torque switch settings prior and subsequent to the testing requirements of USNRC Generic Letter 89 [...] 10. Test data were used to determine both; (1) the overshoot load between torque switch trip and final seating of the disk during valve closing and (2) the stem thrust required to open the valves. The ranges of peak stresses thus determined were then used to estimate the increase in the fatigue usage factors due to the higher stem thrust loads. The usages that would be accumulated by 100 base cycles plus one or eight test cycles per year over 40 and 60 years of operation were calculated...|$|R
