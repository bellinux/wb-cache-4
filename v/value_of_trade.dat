25|$|Foreign {{trade has}} been the engine of Taiwan's rapid growth during the past 40 years.

The total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> increased over fivefold in the 1960s, nearly tenfold in the 1970s, and doubled again in the 1980s.

The electronics sector is Taiwan's most important industrial export sector and is the largest recipient of United States investment.|$|E

25|$|By {{the year}} 1860, the City of New Orleans {{was in a}} {{position}} of unprecedented economic, military, and political power. The Mexican–American War, along with the annexation of Texas, had made New Orleans even more of a springboard for expansion. The California Gold Rush contributed another share to local wealth. The electrical telegraph arrived in New Orleans in 1848, and the completion of the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad from New Orleans to Canton, a distance of over , added another dimension to local transportation. The combination of all these factors resulted in an increase in the price of prime field hands of 21 per cent in 1848, and further increases as the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> grew through the 1850s. By 1860 New Orleans {{was one of the greatest}} ports in the world, with 33 different steamship lines and trade worth 500 million dollars passing through the city.

500|$|It was {{not easy}} for the HBC to drive the Americans away from the North West Coast. The Americans had decades of {{experience}} and knew the coast's complex physical and human geography. It took until 1835 for the HBC to gain this level of experience, but the Americans still had several advantages. For {{a number of reasons}} they were willing and able to pay high prices for furs—much higher than the HBC could match without taking large financial losses. The American ventures were global in scope. They tapped multiple markets of which the North West Coast was but one. By the 1820s American ships routinely spent years in the Pacific, making several voyages between various places such as California, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Canton. American ships were usually stocked with a surplus of trade goods intended for trade on the North West Coast. It was always best to get rid of any extra trade goods on the North West Coast, [...] "dumping" [...] them at any price, before leaving. They would use up stowage space that could be used more profitably elsewhere. The HBC therefore faced a major challenge even after they became experienced with the coast's geography and indigenous peoples. The American system not only raised the price of furs but also lowered the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> goods. Furthermore, the indigenous people knew that increased competition served their interests and gave them bargaining power. They had no desire to see the Americans abandon the coast trade. Therefore, the HBC had to not just match but exceed the prices paid by Americans if they hoped to drive the Americans away. Beaver fur prices on the coast could be many times what the HBC was paying in the interior. There was no hope of making a profit. In order to compete on the coast the HBC had to take large, long-term financial losses.|$|E

Much analysis has been done of the Kyoto Protocol and other potential international greenhouse gas mitigation policies comparing the costs of achieving emission targets with and without trading. These studies often show large cost reductions for all Parties under trading compared to a no trading case. We investigate the welfare gains <b>of</b> including emissions <b>trading</b> {{in the presence of}} uncertainty in economic growth rates, using both a partial equilibrium model based on marginal abatement cost curves and a computable general equilibrium model. We find that the hedge <b>value</b> <b>of</b> international <b>trading</b> is small relative to its value in reallocating emissions reductions when the burden sharing scheme does not resemble a least cost allocation. We also find that the effects of pre-existing tax distortions and terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> dominate the hedge <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading.</b> We conclude that the primary <b>value</b> <b>of</b> emissions <b>trading</b> in international agreements is as a burden sharing or wealth transfer mechanism and should be judged accordingly.

2500|$|The {{details of}} the early {{dealings}} with indigenous peoples by the Dutch New Netherland settlements are not known with certainty. [...] The first recorded land transaction is reported by a letter from Peter Schagen, the deputy of the Dutch West India Company, on November 5, 1626, claiming: [...] "They have purchased the Island Manhattes from the Indians {{for the value of}} 60 guilders; 'tis 11,000 morgens in size." [...] Many secondary sources simply report this value as $24; of course: United States Dollars (and the United States) did not exist in 1626; 60 guilders likely represented the estimated <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> goods; the historical exchange rate calculation used to reach this figure is not known (if in fact it is the source of any such calculation). [...] By comparison, the value of the goods on the ship bearing the letter back to the Netherlands was 45,000 guilders. [...] Sixty guilders in 1626, converted and adjusted for inflation, would be $888 in 2001 U.S. dollars.

40|$|Nitrogen from non-point sources {{reacts with}} the {{environment}} during flow to the waterway. These reactions cause decay of the pollutant. There is a question regarding whether pollution trades between point sources and non-point sources that involve nitrogen should consider this decay. The failure to consider this decay may cause trades to fail to achieve their environmental goal or to inefficiently achieve their environmental goal. Additionally, planners may consider the decay to target reductions and improve efficiency <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> programs. ^ The dissertation uses a geographic information system (GIS) and the finite segment method to evaluate {{the need for the}} use <b>of</b> a <b>trading</b> ratio to consider decay. It uses GIS, principles of process engineering, and principles of hydrology to model the distribution of the nitrogen in the watershed with and without decay. Additionally, it compares the predictions of the concentrations with and without decay. Finally, it uses GIS to estimate appropriate <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> ratio. ^ The results show that the effect from decay during overland flow is appreciable but not always significant. The appropriate <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> ratio are likely to be less than 1. 3. Use <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> ratio may protect environmental quality and improve the efficiency of pollution control. However, sometimes the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> ratios are small relative to other factors so that the use <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> ratio is inconsequential. Finally, planners may use the decay of nitrogen from non-point sources to target the locations of the reductions to achieve the maximum decrease of concentration or to achieve the maximum increase of load without an increase in concentration. ...|$|R
