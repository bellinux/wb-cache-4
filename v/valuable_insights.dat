5|$|In addition, Euler {{was asked}} to tutor Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt, the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau and Frederick's niece. Euler wrote over 200 letters {{to her in the}} early 1760s, which were later {{compiled}} into a best-selling volume entitled Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess. This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics, as well as offering <b>valuable</b> <b>insights</b> into Euler's personality and religious beliefs. This book became more widely read than any of his mathematical works, and was published across Europe and in the United States. The popularity of the 'Letters' testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.|$|E

5|$|Eleanor's son Elliott {{authored}} numerous books, {{including a}} mystery series in which Eleanor was the detective. However, these murder mysteries were researched and written by William Harrington. They continued until Harrington's death in 2000, {{ten years after}} Elliott's death. With James Brough, Elliot also wrote a highly personal book about his parents called The Roosevelts of Hyde Park: An Untold Story, in which he revealed details about the sexual lives of his parents, including his father's relationships with mistress Lucy Mercer and secretary Marguerite ("Missy") LeHand, as well as graphic details surrounding the illness that crippled his father. Published in 1973, the biography also contains <b>valuable</b> <b>insights</b> into FDR's run for vice-president, his rise to the governorship of New York, and his capture of the presidency in 1932, particularly {{with the help of}} Louis Howe. When Elliott published this book in 1973, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. led the family's denunciation of him; the book was fiercely repudiated by all Elliot's siblings. Another of the siblings, James, published My Parents, a Differing View (with Bill Libby, 1976), which was written in part as a response to Elliot's book. A sequel to An Untold Story with James Brough, published in 1975 and titled A Rendezvous With Destiny, carried the Roosevelt saga to the end of World War II. Mother R.: Eleanor Roosevelt's Untold Story, also with Brough, was published in 1977. Eleanor Roosevelt, with Love: A Centenary Remembrance, came out in 1984.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} debate {{as to the}} star's actual distance from Earth. The debate revolves around the different methodologies to measure distanceparallax being the most central, but photometric and spectroscopic observations yielding <b>valuable</b> <b>insights</b> as well. Before the Hipparcos mission, the estimated distance for the Pleiades star cluster was around 135 parsecs or 440 light years. However, when the Hipparcos Catalogue was published in 1997, the new parallax measurement indicated a much closer distance of about 119 ± 1.0 pc (388 ± 3.2 ly), triggering substantial controversy among astronomers. If the Hipparcos estimate were accurate, some astronomers contend, then stars in the cluster {{would have to be}} fainter than Sun-like starsa notion that would challenge some of the fundamental precepts of stellar structure. Interferometric measurements taken in 2004 by the Hubble Telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors and corroborated by studies from Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory showed the original estimate of 135 pc or 440 ly to be the correct figure. However a recent study published in 2009 has argued otherwise, publishing a new parallax measurement of 8.32 mas with a very tight error factor of 0.13 mas yielding a distance of 120.2 ± 1.9 pc or 392.0 ± 6.0 ly. Which distance estimate future astrometric calculations will corroborate remains to be seen, although the upcoming Gaia mission with its expected launch in late 2012 could well prove to be the ultimate arbiter in this debate.|$|E
25|$|Mainstream {{periodicals}} gave A New Kind of Science unusually {{broad coverage}} for a science book, including articles in The New York Times, Newsweek, Wired, and The Economist. Some scientists criticized {{the book as}} abrasive and arrogant, and perceived a fatal flaw—that simple systems such as cellular automata are not complex enough to describe the degree of complexity present in evolved systems, and observed that Wolfram ignored the research categorizing the complexity of systems.

25|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{much has been}} {{discovered}} about amusia. However, there remains {{a great deal more}} to learn. While a method of treatment for people with amusia has not been defined, tone differentiation techniques have been used on amusic patients with some success. It was found with this research that children reacted positively to these tone differentiation techniques, while adults found the training annoying. However, further research in this direction would aid in determining if this would be a viable treatment option for people with amusia. Additional research can also serve to indicate which processing component in the brain is essential for normal music development. Also, it would be extremely beneficial to investigate musical learning in relation to amusia since this could provide <b>valuable</b> <b>insights</b> into other forms of learning disabilities such as dysphasia and dyslexia.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary {{accounts}} of the Battle of Bosworth {{can be found in}} four main sources, one of which is the English Croyland Chronicle, written by a senior Yorkist chronicler who relied on second-hand information from nobles and soldiers. [...] The other accounts were written by foreigners—Vergil, Jean Molinet, and Diego de Valera. [...] Whereas Molinet was sympathetic to Richard, Vergil was in Henry's service and drew information from the king and his subjects to portray them in a good light. [...] Diego de Valera, whose information Ross regards as unreliable, compiled his work from letters of Spanish merchants. [...] However, other historians have used Valera's work to deduce possibly <b>valuable</b> <b>insights</b> not readily evident in other sources. [...] Ross finds the poem, The Ballad of Bosworth Field, a useful source to ascertain certain details of the battle. The multitude of different accounts, mostly based on second- or third-hand information, has proved an obstacle to historians as they try to reconstruct the battle. [...] Their common complaint is that, except for its outcome, very few details of the battle are found in the chronicles. According to historian Michael Hicks, the Battle of Bosworth is one of the worst-recorded clashes of the Wars of the Roses.|$|E

[...] Kaehler had the greatest difficulty in persuading Thaer to allow {{the publication of his}} diaries and letters: [...] in the end he agreed to publication provided it should take place only after his death. [...] (His wife predeceased him by sixteen years.) [...] Thaer's position at the heart of power in the German army during the final part of the war, and his open-minded attitude bordering, sometimes, on criticism regarding the decisions of the army leadership mean that his records are excellent sources for historians re-evaluating the First World War.

2500|$|Wittgenstein's platonic {{relationship}} with David Pinsent (1891–1918) occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent {{in the summer}} of 1912. A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of David Hume, Pinsent soon became Wittgenstein's closest friend. The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the British Psychological Association in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912—the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including first class travel, the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent. In addition to Iceland, Wittgenstein and Pinsent traveled to Norway in 1913. Upon determining their destination, Wittgenstein and Pinsent visited a tourist office in search for a location that would fulfill the following criteria – small village located on a Fjord, a location away from tourists, and a peaceful destination to allow them to study logic and law. Suggesting Øystese, Wittgenstein and Pinsent arrived in the small village on 4 September 1913. With their vacation lasting almost three weeks, Wittgenstein was able to work vigorously on his studies. The immense progress on logic during their stay led Wittgenstein to express to Pinsent his idea to leave Cambridge and return to Norway to continue his work on logic. Pinsent's diaries provide <b>valuable</b> <b>insights</b> into Wittgenstein's personality – sensitive, nervous and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent. [...] Pinsent also writes of Wittgenstein being [...] "absolutely sulky and snappish" [...] at times, as well. In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics: [...] "I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [...] ejaculating [...] "No—Beastly!" [...] to 90 percent of what he shewed [...] us!" ...|$|E
