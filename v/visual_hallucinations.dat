5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by <b>visual</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
5|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. <b>Visual</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{modality}} referred to when people speak of hallucinations include the phenomena of seeing {{things that are}} not present or visual perception, which does not reconcile with the physical, consensus reality. There are many different causes that have been classed as psychophysiologic (a disturbance of brain structure), psychobiochemical (a disturbance of neurotransmitters), psychodynamic (an emergence of the unconscious into consciousness), and psychological (e.g., meaningful experiences consciousness); this is also the case in Alzheimer's disease. Numerous disorders can involve <b>visual</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> ranging from psychotic disorders to dementia to migraine, but experiencing <b>visual</b> <b>hallucinations</b> does not in itself mean that there is necessarily a disorder. <b>Visual</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are associated with organic disorders of the brain and with drug- and alcohol-related illness, and not typically considered the result of a psychiatric disorder.|$|E
25|$|Irritation of {{cortical}} centers {{responsible for}} visual processing (e.g., seizure activity). The irritation {{of the primary}} visual cortex causes simple elementary <b>visual</b> <b>hallucinations.</b>|$|E
50|$|Common {{causes of}} <b>visual</b> <b>hallucination</b> include Neurologic disorders, Migraine, Epilepsy, Hemispheric lesions, Optic nerve disorders, Brain stem lesions, Narcolepsy, Ophthalmologic {{diseases}} (such as Glaucoma, Retinal disease, Enucleation, Cataract formation, Choroidal disorder, Macular abnormalities), Toxic and metabolic conditions, Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, Drug and alcohol withdrawal syndromes, Hallucinogens, Schizophrenia, Affective disorders, Conversion disorders, Sensory deprivation, Sleep deprivation, Hypnosis, Intense emotional experiences.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the more}} enigmatic forms of <b>visual</b> <b>hallucination</b> is the highly variable, {{possibly}} polymodal delirium tremens. Individuals suffering from delirium tremens may be agitated and confused, especially in the later stages of this disease. Insight is gradually reduced with the progression of this disorder. Sleep is disturbed and occurs for a shorter period of time, with rapid eye movement sleep.|$|R
40|$|A 69 {{year old}} man with longstanding {{migraine}} with aura had four episodes of psychosis lasting 7 - 28 days during a 17 year period. During attacks he had formed <b>visual</b> <b>hallucination</b> and delusions, including reduplicative paramnesia. His mother was similarly affected. His EEG showed symmetrical frontal delta waves. The time course and EEG changes are similar to acute confusional migraine. The reduplicative paramnesia suggests a focal non-dominant hemisphere dysfunction...|$|R
25|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>hallucinations</b> due to focal {{seizures}} differ {{depending on}} {{the region of the}} brain where the seizure occurs. For example, <b>visual</b> <b>hallucinations</b> during occipital lobe seizures are typically visions of brightly colored, geometric shapes that may move across the visual field, multiply, or form concentric rings and generally persist from a few seconds to a few minutes. They are usually unilateral and localized to one part of the visual field on the contralateral side of the seizure focus, typically the temporal field. However, unilateral visions moving horizontally across the visual field begin on the contralateral side and move toward the ipsilateral side.|$|E

These hallucinations are not necessarily disturbing, and in some cases, the person with DLB may have insight into the hallucinations and even be amused by them, or be conscious they are not real. People with DLB also may have problems with vision, including double vision, and misinterpretation of what they see, for example, mistaking a pile of socks for snakes or a clothes closet for the bathroom.|$|E
40|$|Iron is {{essential}} for normal metabolism of human body, yet it is also postulated to be involved indifferent neurodegenerative diseases. Parkinson’s disease, {{being one of the}} most common neurodegenerative diseases in the aged population, is often observed with abnormal iron deposition in the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, the exact pathophysiology and the underlying mechanism of neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease are uncertain. Development of in vivo iron imaging technique is therefore essential to identify the role of iron in neurodegeneration. Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) are advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging techniques that exploit the underlying magnetic susceptibility property of body tissues to generate image contrast. The two techniques are proven to be capable of in vivo iron quantification. In this study, we employed both SWI and QSM to evaluate the putative iron content in different subcortical and limbic brain nuclei of Parkinson’s disease patients. The objective of this work is to examine the association between brain iron accumulation and the expression of both motor and non-motor symptoms in the Parkinson’s disease patients. SWI and QSM are employed to evaluate iron content in the iron-rich subcortical deep grey matter nuclei. Findings with both SWI and QSM suggest elevated iron concentration in substantia nigra of the Parkinson’s disease patients. Voxel-wise and slice-by-slice region-of-interest analyses with QSM indicate that spatial distribution of iron inside the substantia nigra is highly inhomogeneous, with higher concentration of iron locate mainly in the pars compacta of the structure. This result confirms the post-mortem findings of abnormal iron accumulation in the substantia nigra pars compacta of Parkinson’s disease patients. QSM is then applied to examine the association between in vivo iron content and the expression of dementia symptom in Parkinson’s disease patients. Increased iron content is observed in hippocampus and amygdala of the demented Parkinson’s disease patients. Iron concentrations in these two structures are found to be negatively correlated with cognitive functions of the patients. This result suggests that abnormal iron accumulation in the limbic structures could possibly induce dementia symptom in Parkinson’s disease. Another study is performed with QSM to assess the association of in vivo iron content with psychotic expression of <b>visual</b> <b>hallucination</b> in Parkinson’s disease patients. Abnormal iron deposition is observed in thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala of the Parkinson’s disease patients with <b>visual</b> <b>hallucination.</b> Iron concentrations in these three structures are found to be positively correlated with the severity of the <b>visual</b> <b>hallucination</b> symptom of the patients. This result suggests that iron deposition could be related to the onset of <b>visual</b> <b>hallucination</b> in the Parkinson’s disease patients and severity of the symptom could depend on the iron content in these brain nuclei. In conclusion, abnormal deposition of iron in different brain regions is confirmed to be associated with both motor and non-motor clinical manifestations of Parkinson’s disease patients. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of using SWI and QSM for in vivo iron quantification, and provides insights to future clinical applications of the two techniques in other iron-related neurodegenerative diseases. published_or_final_versionDiagnostic RadiologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is {{the second}} common {{degenerative}} dementia and has several char-acteristics including fluctuating cognition, <b>visual</b> <b>hallucination</b> and parkinsonism. We investigated clinical manifesta-tions, responsiveness to drugs and neuroimaging findings in DLB patients. Methods: Ten probable DLB patients were included in this study. For responsiveness to drugs, we measured Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) of rest tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia (finger tapping and leg agility), and Korean version of mini-mental state examina-tion (K-MMSE) before and after administration of levodopa or cholinesterase inhibitors. Brain MRI, cerebral perfusion SPECT (Tc- 99 m HMPAO) and dopamine transporter SPECT (123 I-IPT) were also performed. Re s u l t s: All patients were men and mean age of onset was 66. 9 years (range from 58 to 80). All had fluctuating cognition and parkinsonism, and 7 had <b>visual</b> <b>hallucination.</b> Mean increment of K-MMSE after administration of cholinesterase inhibitors was 2. 1 points. Levodopa reduced UPDRS scores of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia by 0. 4, 0. 6 and 1. 0 points, respectively. Cerebral perfusion SPECT using Tc- 99 m HMPAO showed hypoperfusion in occipital area as well as fronto-temporo-parietal areas. Dopamine transporter SPECT using 123 I-IPT revealed reduced uptake comparable to Parkinson’s dis-ease in the striatum. Conclusions: DLB should be first considered as one of possible diagnoses in patients showing dementia in the early stage of parkinsonism. Responsiveness of parkinsonism to levodopa seems favorable...|$|R
25|$|Neural field {{models are}} another {{important}} tool in studying neural oscillations {{and are a}} mathematical framework describing evolution of variables such as mean firing rate in space and time. In modeling the activity {{of large numbers of}} neurons, the central idea is to take the density of neurons to the continuum limit, resulting in spatially continuous neural networks. Instead of modelling individual neurons, this approach approximates a group of neurons by its average properties and interactions. It is based on the mean field approach, an area of statistical physics that deals with large-scale systems. Models based on these principles have been used to provide mathematical descriptions of neural oscillations and EEG rhythms. They have for instance been used to investigate <b>visual</b> <b>hallucinations.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{common cause}} of {{psychotic}} symptoms is substance intoxication. These acute symptoms may resolve {{after a period of}} observation or limited psychopharmacological treatment. However the underlying issues, such as substance dependence or abuse, is difficult to treat in the emergency room, as it is a long term condition. Both acute alcohol intoxication as well as other forms of substance abuse can require psychiatric interventions. Acting as a depressant of the central nervous system, the early effects of alcohol are usually desired for and characterized by increased talkativeness, giddiness, and a loosening of social inhibitions. Besides considerations of impaired concentration, verbal and motor performance, insight, judgment and short term memory loss which could result in behavioral change causing injury or death, levels of alcohol below 60 milligrams per deciliter of blood are usually considered non-lethal. However, individuals at 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood are considered grossly intoxicated and concentration levels at 400 milligrams per deciliter of blood are lethal, causing complete anesthesia of the respiratory system. Beyond the dangerous behavioral changes that occur after the consumption of certain amounts of alcohol, idiosyncratic intoxication could occur in some individuals even after the consumption of relatively small amounts of alcohol. Episodes of this impairment usually consist of confusion, disorientation, delusions and <b>visual</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> increased aggressiveness, rage, agitation and violence. Chronic alcoholics may also suffer from alcoholic hallucinosis, wherein the cessation of prolonged drinking may trigger auditory hallucinations. Such episodes can last for a few hours or an entire week. Antipsychotics are often used to treat these symptoms.|$|E
