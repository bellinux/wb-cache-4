5|$|Gaga grounds {{this sort}} of {{spectacle}} with her <b>voice.</b> <b>She</b> is still a fearsome singer when she chooses to be, {{which is to say}} rarely on records but often in concert... What she gave the faithful was easy to digest: largely bulletproof pop, swinging back and forth between brooding, panting torch songs delivered at top volume and grand-scale 1980s-style digital rock with a nightclub twist.|$|E

5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's <b>voice,</b> <b>she</b> identified it as that of the killer.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a simpler}} {{performance}} on tape {{and a more}} difficult one, with Mariah singing out more, with more licks. But we chose a happy medium. The song really calls for not anything really fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She {{wants to do something}} that's so over the top and use her talents and the <b>voice</b> <b>she</b> has. But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music really calls for.|$|E

She {{was not just a}} singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a <b>voice.</b> <b>She</b> must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.|$|E
