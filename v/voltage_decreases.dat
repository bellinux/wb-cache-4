25|$|In {{electromechanical}} regulators, {{voltage regulation}} is easily accomplished by coiling the sensing wire {{to make an}} electromagnet. The magnetic field produced by the current attracts a moving ferrous core held back under spring tension or gravitational pull. As voltage increases, so does the current, strengthening the magnetic field produced by the coil and pulling the core towards the field. The magnet is physically connected to a mechanical power switch, which opens as the magnet moves into the field. As <b>voltage</b> <b>decreases,</b> so does the current, releasing spring tension or {{the weight of the}} core and causing it to retract. This closes the switch and allows the power to flow once more.|$|E
25|$|Headphones are {{available}} with low or high impedance (typically measured at 1kHz). Low-impedance headphones {{are in the range}} 16 to 32ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given <b>voltage</b> <b>decreases.</b> In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered CMOS-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.|$|E

The monoplolar catheter electrode was inserted into the epidural space at the levels of L 3 - 4, L 4 - 5 and L 5 -S for recording the cauda equina action potentials (CEAP). Stimuli to the tibial or pernoeal nerve were given at the polotieal forssae.

All of the reactive sources in feeder 1 were connected in less than 1.4  s, and the lowest voltage of the network was increased to satisfy the limits. The OLTC agent received “incomplete” messages from the FCS agents in feeder 1. Thus, the OLTC agent changed the tap position by − 1 at 1.43  s to increase the voltage.
