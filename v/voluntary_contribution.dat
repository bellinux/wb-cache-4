Borrowers {{are encouraged to}} give any amount they wish to the organization every month, {{in addition to the}} instalment for the repayment of principal. These <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> result in an implicit interest rate of around 4. 5 %. The analysis of monthly data on <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> provide evidence that the organization is rewarding borrowers for their contributions by giving them repeat loans and that borrowers are strategically timing these <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> through their loan cycle to maximize impact. In the case of joint liability loans, borrowers in poorly performing groups make on average higher <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions,</b> and <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> in a previous loan cycle correlate with borrower discipline in a subsequent loan cycle. Thus, <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> can signal borrower quality, and joint liability borrowers appear to be using them to signal their quality independently of their group...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of school finance reforms that limit local tax revenue and, more recently, state budget cuts that have {{threatened}} K- 12 education spending, {{an increasing number of}} schools and school districts have appealed to parents and communities for <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> to augment school resources. Of course, not all schools benefit equally from these contributions leading to a common concern that <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> create inequities in school funding across communities. In this paper we examine the size and distribution of <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> to California’s K- 12 public schools in 2001. In addition, we examine how contributions have affected the distribution of resources across schools. Our results indicate that while some schools have been quite successful in raising <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions,</b> overall, contributions have not led to large inequities in the distribution of resources among high- and low-income schools. Specifically, schools raising particularly high levels of contributions, over $ 500 per pupil, do tend to have more resources, but these schools are rare and very small. Over ninety-nine percent of California elementary students attend schools where contributions have almost no effect on inputs. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Contributions,</b> Public School Finance, School Resources...|$|R

500|$|There {{have been}} a few {{isolated}} cases where RNLI crew members (not the RNLI) have claimed salvage leading to a not uncommon misconception that the RNLI is partly funded by this practice. There is no legal reason why crew members of the RNLI could not salvage a vessel and indeed frequently tow small vessels to safety, often long distances. The RNLI, however, does not support or encourage salvage because, firstly, they exist to save lives at sea and, secondly, to become involved in salvage might discourage those whose lives are at risk from calling for help. The RNLI's Sea Safety Guidelines state: [...] "There is no 'salvage' fee when you are towed by a lifeboat, but a <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution</b> to the RNLI is always very welcome!". This stance was reinforced when the RNLI was criticised for not launching a lifeboat to an unmanned fishing vessel that had run aground. A spokesman for the RNLI stated: [...] "We are not a salvage firm and our charity's aim is to provide immediate assistance for people in trouble at sea and lives are at risk." ...|$|E

40|$|School-based {{management}} programs aim {{to improve education}} outcomes by involving parents in allocation decisions about external funds transferred to the school. This paper explores the effects of two school-based {{management programs}} on parental investment in schools via <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions.</b> One program provides both a cash grant and a matching scheme for privately raised funds. Difference-in-differences estimation shows that parents in richer schools increased <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> by 28 percent, while parents in poorer schools decreased <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> by 11 percent. This implies that a matching scheme results in higher inequality in resources available to schools. The second program provides only a cash grant to poor schools.

2500|$|One of Franklin's notable {{characteristics}} was his respect, {{tolerance and}} promotion of all churches. Referring to his experience in Philadelphia, {{he wrote in his}} autobiography, [...] "new Places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by <b>voluntary</b> <b>Contribution,</b> my Mite for such purpose, whatever might be the Sect, was never refused." [...] "He helped create a new type of nation that would draw strength from its religious pluralism." [...] The evangelical revivalists who were active mid-century, such as Franklin's friend and preacher, George Whitefield, were the greatest advocates of religious freedom, [...] "claiming liberty of conscience to be an 'inalienable right of every rational creature.'" [...] Whitefield's supporters in Philadelphia, including Franklin, erected [...] "a large, new hall, that... could provide a pulpit to anyone of any belief." [...] Franklin's rejection of dogma and doctrine and his stress on the God of ethics and morality and civic virtue made him the [...] "prophet of tolerance." [...] Franklin composed [...] "A Parable Against Persecution", an apocryphal 51st chapter of Genesis in which God teaches Abraham the duty of tolerance. While he was living in London in 1774, he was present at the birth of British Unitarianism, attending the inaugural session of the Essex Street Chapel, at which Theophilus Lindsey drew together the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in England; this was somewhat politically risky, and pushed religious tolerance to new boundaries, as a denial of the doctrine of the Trinity was illegal until the 1813 Act.|$|E

There would be a new chancel screen, and an asphalt {{concrete}} floor overlaid with pitch pine under the choir stalls. They wanted a new altar of Austrian wainscot oak, and rails around it. Above the altar, they planned a retable with brass cross, flower vases and candlesticks. They wanted a wooden dado around the three chancel walls. They wanted to re-fix Barber's original pitch-pine choir stalls, but planned additional pitch pine seats for clergy, and new desks for the choir boys. They wanted a new carved oak chancel screen with a cross on top. They also wanted wrought iron gates in the chancel screen [...] "to prevent the entrance of strangers into the chancel, who visit the church during the summer months, when it is left open for private prayer."

Our findings suggest that <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> to PPPs are made essentially for retirement purposes, whereas conventional saving is undertaken for precautionary motives. The former type of saving is thus unlikely to offset the latter completely. ...|$|R

An ill-founded plausibility in great affairs is a real evil. In France we have seen the wickedest and most foolish of men, the constitution-mongers of 1789, pursuing this very course, and ending in this very event. These projectors of deception set on foot two modes of <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution</b> to the state. The first they called patriotic gifts. These, for the greater part, were not more ridiculous in the mode than contemptible in the project. The other, which they called the patriotic contribution, was expected to amount to a fourth of the fortunes of individuals, but at their own will and on their own estimate; but this contribution threatening to fall infinitely short of their hopes, they soon made it compulsory, both in the rate and in the levy, beginning in fraud, and ending, as all the frauds of power end, in plain violence. All these devices to produce an involuntary will were under the pretext of relieving the more indigent classes; but the principle of <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution,</b> however delusive, being once established, these lower classes first, and then all classes, were encouraged to throw off the regular, methodical payments to the state, as so many badges of slavery. Thus all regular revenue failing, these impostors, raising the superstructure on the same cheats with which they had laid the foundation of their greatness, and not content with a portion of the possessions of the rich, confiscated the whole, and, to prevent them from reclaiming their rights, murdered the proprietors. The whole of the process has passed before our eyes, and been conducted, indeed, with a greater degree of rapidity than could be expected.|$|E

These I esteemed the essentials of every religion; and being to be found in all the religions we had in our country, I respected them all, though with different degrees of respect as I found them more or less mixed with other articles which, without any tendency to inspire, promote, or confirm morality, served principally to divide us, and make us unfriendly to one another.
