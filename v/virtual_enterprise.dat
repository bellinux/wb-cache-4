50|$|A <b>virtual</b> <b>enterprise</b> is {{a network}} of {{independent}} companies—suppliers, customers, competitors, linked by information technology to share skills, costs, and access to one another's markets.

This flexible structure minimizes the impact of the agreement on the participants' individual organizations and facilitates adding new participants with new skills and resources.

40|$|The {{penetration}} of Internet and the World Wide Web (Web) {{in accordance with}} new technological advances urged companies to seize the opportunities offered by Electronic Commerce and Electronic Business. Especial promising are the opportunities for co-operation among companies in terms of Virtual Communities and <b>Virtual</b> <b>Enterprises</b> based on open networks and innovative Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). <b>Virtual</b> <b>Enterprises</b> provide, from one side, the possibility to share key business processes in a profitable way and, from the other side, access to capabilities and resources offered by other partners. This can lead to shorten development and manufacturing cycles, reduced time to market and operational costs, global operation and reach, and rapid adaptation to new market needs. <b>Virtual</b> <b>Enterprises</b> are goal- and purpose-oriented associations of companies and/or department of companies that have limited duration, flexible configuration, dynamic distribution of roles, and share key business processes using advanced ICTs. In the literature, two broad, well-defined categories have been identified so far, namely the static <b>Virtual</b> <b>Enterprises</b> and the Dynamic <b>Virtual</b> <b>Enterprises.</b> In Static <b>Virtual</b> <b>Enterprises</b> the relationships among the partners are static, pre-configured and can not easily change. On the contrary, Dynamic <b>Virtual</b> <b>Enterprises</b> use the IC Technologies to precipitate the best configuration of processes and resources for a certain process, as well as, to incorporate the most competent partner for that process. Dynamic <b>Virtual</b> <b>Enterprises</b> improve significantly the Static VEs and {{take full advantage of}} the open, global opportunities offered by the Internet and the global economy. Dynamic <b>Virtual</b> <b>Enterprises</b> feature very short lifetimes, dynamic business relationships among partners and flexible and autonomous behaviour. This thesis analyses, designs, develops, testes, and validates a platform for the management of dynamic <b>virtual</b> <b>enterprises</b> that supports the whole life cycle model, namely the business process specification and registration and business process execution and management. The main contribution of this thesis is an agent-based virtual marketplace, a virtual marketplace ontology, an agent-based inter-domain workflow management system, a business process definition language for dynamic VEs, an intra- and inter-domain ontology for business process management, a mechanism for dynamic selection of partners, and a negotiation ontology. The proposed platform is based on emerging Internet standards, like XML, and agent standards, like FIPA and OMG-MASIF. The agent-based platform for the management of dynamic <b>Virtual</b> <b>Enterprises</b> has been fully implemented and tested. The validation and assessment of the platform has been done by the development of four independent business and application scenarios in the context of several research projects. Based on the validation and assessment, the proposed platform reveals openness due to the flexible ontologies used for the management of shared business processes, dynamicity and flexibility due to the dynamic selection of partners and the automated negotiations, asynchronous and loosely coupled coordination of processes due to the deployment of standard autonomous intelligent agents and distribution and scalability due to the distributed execution and management of shared business processes from different intelligent agents across different administrative domains. This thesis aims to provide a systematic, coherent and state of art solution for the management of dynamic <b>Virtual</b> <b>Enterprises</b> based on standard, intelligent agent concepts and technologies. The acceptance and {{penetration of}} solutions like this will depend on the success and adoption of the intelligent agent paradigm As the Internet and the new digital economy urge companies to collaborate and share critical business processes dynamically, solutions like this will become more important, applicable and effective for day to day business operations...|$|R
