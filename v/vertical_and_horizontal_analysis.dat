40|$|Abstract—Traditional {{polarization}} diversity systems have re-lied {{on the distribution}} of obstacles within the mobile medium to achieve signal decorrelation and power coupling between or-thogonal polarizations. If the channel does not facilitate adequate power coupling, signal diversity is suboptimal because signal contribution from the polarization with lesser power is limited. Further, due to the presence of a dominant polarization, the signal power received in the orthogonal polarizations becomes a function of the transmitter orientation. The use of circular polarization at the transmitter is proposed to facilitate power coupling and alleviate the branch power imbalance between the <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> polarizations. The <b>analysis</b> shows that if circular polarization is used, the branch power im-balance between the <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> polarizations can be significantly lower than linear polarization, and that the cross polarization discrimination becomes independent of the transmitter orientation. The proposed antenna configuration to achieve circular polarization allows for {{polarization diversity}} to be implemented in the uplink and downlink. I...|$|R

The <b>analysis</b> of {{nonlinear}} error of the 3 -TPS hybrid machine tool on 5 -axis machining and the reduction the error by self-adaptation linearization are introduced in the paper. The obtained formula for nonlinear error {{can be used in}} different situations and estimate three-dimensional cutter evelope forming error. Foreword When a curved surface is processed, a mismachining tolerance caused by discrete approaching of cutting knife locus is the sum of linear approximation error and the mismachining tolerance. The linear approximation error is caused by the linear motion of cutter to cureved surface. The mismachining tolerance is bring by the normal vector turn of finished surface. During five axis machining, theoretical cutter locus is nonlinearity continuous curves determined by engagement between cutting knife and parts surfaces. In addition to the approximation error and mismachining tolerance in a mismachining tolerance, there are wobbling error of cutter or parts. This paper is based on the 3 -TPS machine tool, accurate nonlinear error expression of five axis is obtained by means of analyzing cutter’s 3 -D envelope movement.

40|$|The linear {{stability}} for {{two phase flow}} {{in parallel}} channels has been studied quite extensively. However, the analysis is valid only for infinitesimally small perturbations. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to carry out non-linear stability analysis for small finite sized perturbations. Moreover, earlier studies do not consider inclination of these channels, which exist for various applications. The focus of the present work is to carry out linear as well as non-linear stability analysis of parallel channels for various inclinations (including <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal).</b> The bifurcation <b>analysis</b> is carried out to capture the non-linear dynamics of the system and to identify regions in the parameter space for which subcritical and supercritical bifurcations exist. The study is carried out for different inclination angles in order to characterize the effect of inclination on the stability of the system. The analysis shows that, at all inclinations, a GH point and BT point exist. The subcritical and supercritical bifurcations are confirmed by numerical simulation of the time-dependent, nonlinear ODEs for the selected points in the operating parameter space using MATLAB ODE solver. The identification of these points is important because the stability characteristics of the system for finite (though small) perturbations are dependent on them. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the study of aerosol {{hygroscopic}} growth during Sierra Nevada Lidar AerOsol Profiling Experiment (SLOPE I) campaign by using the synergy of active and passive remote sensors at Granada valley station (IISTA-CEAMA station) and in-situ instrumentation at a mountain station (Sierra Nevada station, SNS), located ~  20  km away from IISTA-CEAMA and about 1  km above this station. To this end, a methodology based on the combination of calibrated water vapour mixing ratio (r) profiles, retrieved from an EARLINET multiwavelength Raman lidar (RL), and continuous temperature profiles from a microwave radiometer (MWR) for obtaining relative humidity (RH) profiles with high temporal resolution is used. This methodology is validated against an approach using radiosounding (RS) data at the EARLINET IISTA-CEAMA station, achieving differences in hygroscopic growth parameter (γ) lower than 5  % between the methodology based on RS and that based on remote sensing. During SLOPE I the remote sensing methodology used for aerosol hygroscopic growth studies has been checked using Mie calculations with in-situ measurements at SNS. For SLOPE I case with remote sensing instrumentation, an increase in particle backscatter coefficient at 355 and 532 nm is observed from 1. 5 to 2. 4  km a. s. l. in the relative humidity range of 78 – 98  %, but also a decrease on Ångström exponent (AE) and particle linear depolarization ratio (PLDR). This fact indicates that particles become larger and more spherical as relative humidity increases, what is strongly related to aerosol hygroscopic growth. In addition, atmospheric stability is checked ensuring well-mixed layers. <b>Vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> wind <b>analysis</b> is performed by means of a co-located Doppler lidar system at IISTA-CEAMA station, in order to evaluate the <b>horizontal</b> <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> dynamics of the air masses.

Some believe that the buildings of up to about ten storeys height need to be provided with shear wall. This project was carried out to study the suitability of reinforced concrete structures to be designed as braced or unbraced. The analysis was done on two series of identical model buildings with five, ten and 15 storeys each. Both series were subjected to the same <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> loads.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the role {{which may be}} played by legal norms (rules and principles) in seeking to achieve coherence in EU foreign policy. The premise is not that legal norms are the best way (or a better way) to achieve coherence, but rather the intention {{is to examine the}} extent to which the Treaties and Court of Justice have developed norms which are relevant to the struggle for coherence and to explore the role they might play, as well as their limits. We need first to explore what coherence means, and whether it is a concept which has any specifically legal content at all (section II). In thinking about coherence, lawyers have often started with the distinction that derives from political science literature between <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> coherence. This <b>analysis</b> is also based on that framework, addressing vertical coherence in section III <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> coherence in section IV. However, in order to understand the specifically legal dimension of coherence a different conceptualization is superimposed on this basic distinction, which addresses the fact that there are different dimensions to coherence as a concept and that these are regulated by different rules and principles. The conceptualization offered here is of three different levels of coherence: the first is consistency, seen in terms of conflict resolution and requiring rules of hierarchy; the second is the effective allocation of tasks between actors and instruments, avoiding both gaps and problematic duplication and requiring rules of delimitation; the third is synergy between norms, actors and instruments, requiring principles of cooperation and complementarity...|$|R
