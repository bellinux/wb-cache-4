5|$|Ho's Viet Minh {{seized power}} {{and set up}} a {{provisional}} government in the wake of Japan's withdrawal from Vietnam. This move <b>violated</b> <b>a</b> prior agreement between the member parties of the Viet Nam Cach Mang Dong Minh Hoi (Vietnamese Revolutionary League), which included the VNQDD as well as the Vietminh, and Ho was pressured to broaden his government's appeal by including the VNQDD (now led by Nguyễn Tường Tam). The Vietminh announced that they would abolish the mandarin governance system and hold national elections with universal suffrage in two hold. The VNQDD objected to this, fearing that the communists would perpetrate electoral fraud.|$|E
5|$|In Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier, a {{case that}} started in Missouri's Eastern District went before the United States Supreme Court in 1988, it was held that public school curricular student {{newspapers}} are subject to {{a lower level of}} First Amendment protection. Another First Amendment case in public schools came up in 1998, when E.D. Mo. heard Beussink v. Woodland R-IV School District. Judge Rodney W. Sippel ruled that the school <b>violated</b> <b>a</b> student's rights by sanctioning him for material he posted on his website. This case has been widely cited in higher courts.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, an ICSID {{tribunal}} {{awarded a}} judgment of $1.8 billion for Occidental Petroleum {{against the government}} of Ecuador. Additionally, Ecuador had to pay $589 million in backdated compound interest {{and half of the}} costs of the tribunal, making its total penalty around $2.4 billion. The South American country annulled a contract with the oil firm {{on the grounds that it}} <b>violated</b> <b>a</b> clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. The tribunal agreed the violation took place but judged that the annulment was not fair and equitable treatment to the company.|$|E
40|$|We present {{empirical}} evidence on acquirer firms that have violated or {{are about to}} <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> loan covenant within four quarters of undergoing an acquisition. We find that firms that <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> covenant within the four quarters before the acquisition announcement have the highest announcement period abnormal returns, while firms that <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> covenant within the four quarters after the acquisition announcement but not within the four quarters before it have the sharpest decline in abnormal returns after the acquisition announcement. Also, firms that violate or are about to <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> loan covenant within four quarters have a significantly lower mean target firm deal size than those that have not violated covenants within those time periods. Such results indicate that when firms violate or are about to <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> loan covenant, corporate governance shifts in power cause creditors to enforce stricter rules on management’s actions, {{making sure that the}} acquisitions that management pursues adds to firm value...|$|R

5|$|Some {{accounts}} of Nostradamus's life state {{that he was}} afraid of being persecuted for heresy by the Inquisition, but neither prophecy nor astrology fell in this bracket, and he would have been in danger only if he had practised magic to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for Anti-Catholic views. His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had <b>violated</b> <b>a</b> recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.|$|E
5|$|The case {{concerned}} the censorship of two articles in The Spectrum, the student newspaper of Hazelwood East High School in St. Louis County, Missouri, 1983.

5|$|In late January 1626 the Tatars invaded again. With an army {{estimated}} at between 15,000 and 20,000, they raided and pillaged territories {{as far north}} as the Podole Voivodeship, passing Ternopil and Terebovlia, while some advanced units reached the cities of Lutsk, Volodymyr-Volynskyi and Lviv. In response, Koniecpolski gathered some 13,000 troops and moved to intercept the Tatars, but they refused to engage. Eventually Koniecpolski defeated the rear guard of the main Tatar army, which crossed the borders with much treasure and slaves. Later that year, fearing a repeat invasion, Koniecpolski <b>violated</b> <b>a</b> Sejm resolution in recruiting and fielding an army of 8,000 against an expected Tatar second wave. During this time, Koniecpolski was aided in a number of battles by a highly capable officer, Bohdan Khmelnytsky; Khmelnytsky would also score a major victory over the Tatars later that year, after Koniecpolski had departed north to a new battlefield near the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|El Greco did {{not plan}} to settle {{permanently}} in Toledo, since his final aim was to win the favor of Philip and make his mark in his court. Indeed, he did manage to secure two important commissions from the monarch: Allegory of the Holy League and Martyrdom of St. Maurice. However, the king {{did not like the}}se works and placed the St Maurice altarpiece in the chapter-house rather than the intended chapel. He gave no further commissions to El Greco. The exact reasons for the king's dissatisfaction remain unclear. Some scholars have suggested that Philip did not like the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene; some others that El Greco's works <b>violated</b> <b>a</b> basic rule of the Counter-Reformation, namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style. Philip took a close interest in his artistic commissions, and had very decided tastes; a long sought-after sculpted Crucifixion by Benvenuto Cellini also failed to please when it arrived, and was likewise exiled to a less prominent place. Philip's next experiment, with Federico Zuccari was even less successful. In any case, Philip's dissatisfaction ended any hopes of royal patronage El Greco may have had.|$|E

5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, {{the ranking}} Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{sent a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have <b>violated</b> <b>a</b> federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E

40|$|Culturally {{counterintuitive}} {{concepts are}} ideas that <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> {{small number of}} justifiable expectations raised by shared beliefs {{of a group of}} people. Previous studies have shown that ideas that <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> small number of expectations are better remembered by people than ideas that conform to their expectations or ideas that <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> large number of people’s expectations. However, as counterintuitive ideas become embedded in a group’s belief-system they lose their memorability advantages and must change to regain those advantages.
