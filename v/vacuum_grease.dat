A vacuum apparatus was developed for testing contamination of mirrors. Offgases from heated test materials are deposited on a refrigerated mirror, half of which is UV irradiated. Reflectance is measured between 1100 and 25, 000 A. Thermofit RNF- 100, insulated wire TRT- 24 - 19 -V- 93, and Eccofoam FS and FPH gave heavier deposits on the nonirradiated mirror.

40|$|Abstract: PFPE (Perfluoropolyether) {{is a clear}} colorless {{fluorinated}} {{synthetic oil}} that is nonreactive, nonflammable, safe in chemical and oxygen service, and is long lasting. PFPE grease is made by mixing different types of non-soap thickeners with the PFPE base oil. This paper highlights the unique properties (physical and chemical) of the PFPE {{as well as its}} unique application in areas where other lubricants are deficient. This paper includes methods of applying PFPE in oil and grease form, manufacturing of PFPE, and the benefits of using PFPE lubricants. Also, it includes a general overview of a hybrid grease [...] a grease suitable for less severe applications than PFPE yet superior to conventional greases produced by combining fluorinated greases with mineral/synthetic oils.

50|$|The {{lower edge}} of a vacuum bell jar forms a flange of heavy glass, ground smooth on the bottom for better contact. The base of the jar is equally heavy and flattened. A smear of <b>vacuum</b> <b>grease</b> is usually applied between them. As the vacuum forms inside, it creates a {{considerable}} compression force, {{so there is no}} need to clamp the seal. For this reason, a bell jar cannot be used to contain pressures above atmospheric, only below.|$|E
50|$|As {{well as a}} lubricant, <b>vacuum</b> <b>grease</b> is {{also used}} as a sealant for joints in vacuum systems. This is usually limited to soft vacuums, as ultra high vacuum or high {{temperatures}} may give problems with the grease outgassing. Grease is most commonly used with glass vacuum systems. All metal systems usually use knife-edge seals in soft metals instead. Where O ring seals are used, these should not be greased (in static seals at least) as it can cause the O rings to become permanently distorted when compressed.|$|E
5000|$|Stopcocks used in {{laboratory}} glassware are typically forms of conically tapered plug valves. When fused with the glassware, the valve bodies {{are made of}} glass. Otherwise, they can be made of an inert plastic such as Teflon. The plugs can be made of a similar plastic or glass. When the plug is made of glass, the handle and plug are fused together in one piece out of glass. When glass is used for both the stopcock body and the plug, the contacting surfaces between them are special ground glass surfaces (see Laboratory glassware) often with stopcock grease in between. Special glass stopcocks are made for vacuum applications, such as in use with <b>vacuum</b> manifolds. Stopcock <b>grease</b> is always used in high vacuum applications to make the stopcock air-tight. Also if the plug valve is [...] "locked" [...] from being in the open or closed position for an extended amount of time lubricant can be added through the greaser with the valve in service.|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{setup for}} temperature and magnetic field sensing {{consisted of a}} microscope (IX- 71, Olympus) coupled with a diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSS, Coherent) and a Ti-sapphire laser (3900 S, Newport) operating at 532 nm and 808 nm, respectively, as detailed in [11]. The 532 nm light was first reflected by a long-pass dichroic mirror (545 dcxr, Chroma) and then combined with the 808 nm light at the second short-pass dichroic mirror (725 dcspxr, Chroma). They were then focused onto the samples on a glass coverslip via a 100 × oil-immersion objective, which also served to collect FND fluorescence for detection. A three-dimensional confocal fluorescence tracking technique was implemented to ensure long-term observation of the same particle under investigation. To obtain the ODMR spectra, samples were excited with microwaves delivered via a thin gold wire (25 μm in diameter) connected to a microwave amplifier (5183, Ophir) and then a frequency synthesizer (PTS 3200, Programmed Test Sources). The wire was situated {{in close proximity to}} the glass coverslip, on which the specimen was prepared in a microchannel (∼ 1 mm height, ∼ 2 mm width, and ∼ 8 mm length) constructed with two glass bars, an adhesive frame, and high <b>vacuum</b> silicone <b>grease.</b> Both the microwave and the 532 nm probe laser were run in continuous-wave (CW) mode, and the fluorescence photons (675 ± 37 nm) were detected at each scanning microwave frequency by an avalanche photodiode (SPCM-AQR- 15, Perkin Elmer). Two additional 808 nm laser notch filters were used to reduce the background noise level when collecting FND fluorescence {{in the presence of the}} NIR light. The spatial overlap between the heating and detection laser beams at the samples was examined with an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (IXON, Andor) for their scattered light images. A Gaussmeter (GM- 2, AlphaLab) measured the strength of the magnetic field applied to the samples.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. -A {{technique}} {{was developed to}} study the invasion of cells into mouse kidney cortex {{in the presence of}} crude rat liver histone at a medium concentration of 100 iLg. /ml. A marked increase in the invasiveness of normal cells occurred in the presence of histone. Possible explanations of this phenomenon are discussed. The invasiveness was compared with that of cells previously transformed with polyoma virus. HiSTONES, those basic proteins associated with the DNA of eukaryotic cells, have been shown to induce morphological transformation of BHK 21 cells in monolayer culture (Latner and Longstaff, 1971). This transformation involved the acqaisition by ti-le histone treated cultures of some characteristics associated With malignancy, such as the appearance of giant multinucleate cells, a breakdown in contact iiihibition and a tendency for the cells to form aggregates and multilayers. A further characteristic of malignant cells is their ability to invade normal tissue in vitro (Yarnell and Ambrose, 1969 a) and we report here the effect of histones on the invasiveness of four cell lines in culture. Histone preparation MATERIALS AND METHODS Chromatin was isolated from the livers of adult rats (Scott-Russ strain) according to the method of Bonner et al. (1968), omitting centrifugation through dense sucrose solution. Histone was extracted from the isolated chromatin by blending with 0 - 25 N HCI. The insoluble material was centrifuged off and the extraction procedure repeated. The supernatants were pooled and histone was precipitated from the acid extract by adding 9 volumes of acetone. The precipitate was washed with acetone, air dried and finally vacuum dried. Tissue culture method 8 The technique adopted to study invasion in vitro involved the use of modified Trowell organ culture flasks. The apparatus (Fig. 1) consisted of an open-necked reaction vessel witb. a ground-glass Range and contained a filter-well. The vessel was fitted with a 9 'lass lid with ground-glass flange and two glass taps. In assembling the unit, a thin layer of high <b>vacuum</b> silicone <b>grease</b> was applied to the ground-glass flange joint which was then secured by means of a bull-dog "...|$|R

40|$|The signals {{obtained}} from two wideband conical sensors were compared in the time, fre-quency and time/frequency domains. The signals were generated by pencil-lead breaks {{on the surface}} (out-of-plane) or close to the midplane of the edge (in-plane) of a large (1220 mm by 1525 mm) aluminum alloy plate (thickness of 3. 1 mm). One sensor was coupled to the plate sur-face by <b>vacuum</b> <b>grease</b> at a propagation distance of 254 mm, and the other sensor was coupled with <b>vacuum</b> <b>grease</b> {{to the end of}} a nominal 300 mm or 400 mm long small-diameter waveguide.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the design and}} lab evaluation of a compact medium flow multiple round nozzle-based inertial impactor with variable head for collecting particulate matter (PM). The impactor operates at a flow rate of 175 LPM and consists of two different sets of circular acceleration nozzles designed for PM 2. 5 (particle aerodynamic diameter < 2. 5 µm) and PM 1 (particle aerodynamic diameter < 1 µm), either {{of them could be}} used at a time as per the objective of sampling. High <b>vacuum</b> grade silicone <b>grease</b> is used as an impaction substrate. Lab experiments were performed using a poly-disperse dolomite powder as test aerosol. The nozzle configurations selected were such that the first one provides a 50 % cutpoint at 2. 50 µm (aerodynamic diameter) with a pressure drop of 0. 35 kPa while the second one produces a 50 % cutpoint at 1. 06 µm (aerodynamic diameter) with a pressure drop of 1. 07 kPa. Particle losses through the nozzles were low for particle diameter upto 5. 0 µm. Particle bounce-off and re-entrainment losses were found to be insignificant. Owing to its higher flow rate, it has an advantage of collecting appreciable quantity of particles (and higher number of samples) in a relatively smaller time frame as compared to other low flow rate samplers. The samples can be analyzed to obtain finely time-resolved aerosol composition which can help in {{a better understanding of the}} role of various physico-chemical processes active during different meteorological conditions (extreme dust and foggy events) that affect fate and transport of PM, especially in the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) ...|$|R
