50|$|Ammonium alum {{is not a}} major {{industrial}} chemical or a particularly useful laboratory reagent, but it is inexpensive and nontoxic, which invites many niche applications. It is used in water purification, in <b>vegetable</b> <b>glues,</b> in porcelain cements, in deodorants and in tanning, dyeing and in fireproofing textiles. The pH of the solution resulting from the topical application of ammonium alum with perspiration is typically in the slightly acid range, from 3 to 5.|$|R
6000|$|The {{answer to}} this {{question}} varies very much. It depends on how the doctor is feeling and whether it is long since he had a meal himself. If it is late in the morning and the doctor is ravenously hungry, he says: [...] "Oh, eat plenty, don't be afraid of it; eat meat, <b>vegetables,</b> starch, <b>glue,</b> cement, anything you like." [...] But if the doctor has just had lunch and if his breathing is short-circuited with huckleberry-pie, he says very firmly: [...] "No, I don't want you to eat anything at all: absolutely not a bite; it won't hurt you, a little self-denial in the matter of eating is the best thing in the world." ...|$|R

He {{wrote about the}} ammonia-soda process in the [...] "Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft" [...] in 1874, of {{the analysis of the}} water of the Bronislaw Spring in [...] "Wiener Akademische Sitzungsberichte" [...] in 1861, of <b>vegetable</b> <b>glue</b> made of water-soluble grain “Wiener Akademische Sitzungsberichte” in 1861, about the reactions of rubber with protein “Wiener Akademische Sitzungsberichte” 1862, of the structure of acetone [...] "Wiener Akademische Sitzungsberichte” in 1873 and about hydrocarbons in “Dingler's Polytechnic Journal” in 1873. His articles concerning agriculture were also published in the magazine called [...] "Rolnik" [...] in Lemberg between 1872 and 1873.|$|E
40|$|Our skin {{is under}} {{constant}} environmental stress resulting from personal care (soap, cosmetics, clothes), home (plants, wood, <b>vegetables),</b> leisure (<b>glues,</b> photodevelopers, paints) and work. Although {{the skin is}} an efficient barrier and body protector a cutaneous disorder may be induced by many substances or conditions. The causes of skin injury can be classified {{in one of the}} following categories: chemical, mechanical, physical and biological. Within these categories chemical injuries constitute an important part. Toxic reactions to the skin from environmentally encountered substances may include ulcerations, pigmentary abnormalities, folliculitis with the development of acne-type lesions and neoplasms, but the skin disorder that most frequently occurs is contact dermatitis. Contact dermatitis is a common non-contagious inflammatory skin reaction elicited by an external factor. The group of contact dermatitis reactions includes allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis (acute/cumulative), phototoxic contact dermatitis and photoallergic contact dermatitis, and the immediate type of contact dermatitis (e. g. urticaria). This thesis will be limited to allergic and irritant contact dermatitis...|$|R
