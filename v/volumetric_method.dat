Although proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) has been used with success to quantify vertebral MAT in humans, it is difficult to employ in laboratory animals. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides MAT assessment in the vertebral skeleton in conjunction with μCT-based marrow density measurements. A <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> to identify, quantify, and localize MAT in rodent bone has been recently developed, requiring osmium staining of bones and μCT imaging, followed by advanced image analysis of osmium-bound lipid volume (in mm3) relative to bone volume. This technique provides reproducible quantification and visualization of MAT, enabling the ability to consistently quantify changes in MAT with diet, exercise, and agents that constrain precursor lineage allocation. Although the osmium method is quantitatively precise, osmium is toxic and cannot be compared across batched experiments. Recently, researchers developed and validated a 9.4T MRI scanner technique that allows localization and volumetric (3D) quantification that can be compared across experiments.|$|E

40|$|Background. The current {{method for}} {{assessing}} progressive disease (PD) in glioblastoma is {{according to the}} Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. Bevacizumab-treated patients may show pseudo-response on postcontrast T 1 -weighted (T 1 w) MRI, and a more infiltrative non-enhancing growth pattern on T 2 w/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. We investigated whether the RANO criteria remain the method of choice for assessing bevacizumab-treated recurrent glioblastoma when compared with various <b>volumetric</b> <b>methods.</b> Methods. Patients with assessable MRI data from the BELOB trial (n = 148) were included. Patients were treated with bevacizumab, lomustine, or both. At first and second radiological follow-up (6 and 12 wk), PD was determined using the 2 D RANO criteria and various <b>volumetric</b> <b>methods</b> based on enhancing tumor only and enhancing plus non-enhancing tumor. Differences in overall survival (OS) between PD and non-PD patients were assessed with the log-rank test and a Cox model. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95 % CIs were determined. Results. For all patients together, all methods (except subtraction of non-enhancing from enhancing volume at first follow-up) showed significant differences in OS between PD and non-PD patients (P <. 001). The largest risk increase for death in case of PD at both first and second follow-up was found with the RANO criteria: HR = 2. 81 (95 % CI, 1. 92 - 4. 10) and HR = 2. 80 (95 % CI, 1. 75 - 4. 49), respectively. In the bevacizumab-treated patients, all methods assessed showed significant differences in OS between PD and non-PD patients. There {{were no significant differences}} between methods. Conclusions.

We compared a widely used visual rating scale with a <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> to study longitudinal white matter changes. METHODS: WMH were assessed with the visual Scheltens scale and a <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> in 100 elderly subjects aged 70 – 81 years for whom repetitive MR images were available with an interval of 33 (SD, 1. 4) months. Reliability was determined by intraclass correlation coefficients.

RESULTS: Reliability of the visual rating scale was good, whereas reliability of the volumetric mea-surement was excellent.

Longitudinal evaluation of WMH assessments showed regression in 26 % of the subjects when analyzed with the visual rating scale against 12 % of the subjects when using volumetric measurements.

Twenty-eight participants with a transtibial amputation > 1 year participated in the study. Two observers measured stump volume twice, two weeks apart, using both Sitzia's method and the water displacement <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> (criterion standard test). The mean differences and upper and lower limits of agreement between the water displacement <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> and Sitzia's method, between the first and second assessment, and between both assessors were calculated. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were derived from random-effects two-way analysis of variance. Inter-observer agreements of both methods were high and ranged from 86 - 96 %. Intra-observer agreement ranged between 57 % and 71 %. In both methods the inter- and intra-observer differences were not significant.
