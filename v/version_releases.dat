Initially MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access {{not only the}} operating system, but application software and user data as well. Progressive <b>version</b> <b>releases</b> delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats, along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures. Ultimately it was the key product in Microsoft's growth from a programming languages company to a diverse software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI. It is a flexible operating system, and consumes negligible installation space.|$|E
