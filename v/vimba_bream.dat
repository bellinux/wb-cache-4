50|$|Vimba vimba, called {{also the}} <b>vimba</b> <b>bream,</b> vimba,zanthe, or zarte, is a European fish {{species in the}} Cyprinidae family. It largely lives in the sea but makes an annual {{migration}} up-river each year to breed.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>vimba</b> <b>bream</b> is a semi-anadromous fish, which migrates from {{brackish}} water to rivers for spawning. Permanently fresh-water populations exist as well. In the Baltic Sea {{the species is}} distributed up to 62°-63° N in Sweden and Finland.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vimba</b> <b>bream</b> was at {{one time}} {{classified}} as a bream as {{it also has a}} long anal fin, but has now been placed in a different genus. Its body is not as deep as that of the bream. It also resembles the asp but its mouth is small and behind the snout whereas the asp has a large mouth with the lower jaw protruding. This species grows to about 25 to 35 cm with a weight of up to 2 kg. The scales are small and there are about sixty of them along the lateral line. This fish is a deep bluish-green on the dorsal surface and silvery along the flanks. The eyes are yellow and the pectoral and pelvic fins have reddish-yellow bases. The colouring becomes more vivid in the breeding season and males may have the operculum, base of the fins and the belly turn orange.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vimba</b> <b>breams</b> move {{in small}} shoals along the sea coast, feeding on {{invertebrates}} which they pick from the seabed, and the eggs of other fish. They leave {{the sea in}} May or June, swimming upriver to spawn in fast-moving tributaries with stony or gravelly bases and little vegetation. The males prepares several areas of riverbed on which the females deposit batches of eggs. In Lithuania, there is a festival each year along {{the shore of the}} Neman River to celebrate the arrival of the fish.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of seasonal {{variations on the}} chemical composition and composition of fatty acids in five commercially important freshwater fish species from the Danube: white <b>bream,</b> <b>bream,</b> <b>vimba,</b> zope, and Prussian carp, during May, July and September was determined. Changes in the chemical composition of meat of all examined species had the same tendencies. Water and protein content in the meat decreased, while fat content increased. The most frequent fatty acids in the meat of all the examined fish were the following: 18 : 1 n- 9 (oleic), 16 : 0 (palmitic), 16 : 1 (palmitoleic), 18 : 2 n- 6 (linoleic), 20 : 1 (eicosenoic), 20 : 5 n- 3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 20 : 4 n- 6 arachidonic acid and 22 : 6 n- 3 docosahexaeonic acid (DHA). The content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) ranged from 25. 03 % to 32. 43 % and displayed a tendency to increase during the observed period. The total content of the n- 6 group in the meat of Prussian carp was higher than in other species, which was probably a consequence of specific diet. The total content of n- 3 fatty acids in the meat of white <b>bream,</b> <b>bream,</b> <b>vimba</b> and zope was the highest in May, and it declined during July-September. We can conclude that the meat of white <b>bream</b> and <b>vimba</b> contains high nutritional values in terms of EPA and DHA content. The n- 3 /n- 6 ratio was also very favourable: 0. 9 to 2. 0 in the meat of white <b>bream,</b> <b>bream,</b> <b>vimba</b> and zope, with a clear downward tendency in the observed period...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} focused on {{artificial}} stripping of <b>vimba</b> <b>bream</b> (Vimba vimba) which were raised in experimental ponds in VÚRH JU Vodňany. The aim of this project was to induce breeding of <b>vimba</b> <b>bream,</b> which was raised in controled conditions. We tried various hormonal preparations (CPE and Dagin) for estrualization and diferent water levels and flows in tanks...|$|E
40|$|Using of {{recirculation}} systems for rearing of fish is {{common practice in}} Western Europe countries. Benefits of this systems are utilized in recovering programs of endangered species of fish. In this work we had paid attention on suitability of RAS for rearing Nase, <b>Vimba</b> <b>bream</b> and Barbel. In the first part two six-month experiments were conducted. The five-month-old nase and <b>vimba</b> <b>bream</b> had been trained on pellet feed and acclimated to four different temperatures. The WT fluctuated in parallel with ambient outside conditions {{at an average of}} approximately 4 °C for the inflow system and approximately 15, 18 and 21 °C in closed, {{recirculation systems}}. The total length and weight were measured at two-week intervals and SGRw, FCR and survival were monitored. We observed a positive effect of higher water temperatures on their growth rate of each species. Both groups (WT 21 °C) had the most rapid growth and highest SGRw. Growth rate and SGRw were lowest for each species in group with the ambient temperature conditions. Lower temperature at the level of 18 °C gave good results in comparison to rearing in cold water. Individual weight was 3. 25 and 4. 13 times higher for nase and <b>vimba</b> <b>bream,</b> respectively. The temperature 15 °C was chosen with regard to the functioning of the biofilter and in this experiment, it proved to be a minimal temperature suitable for rearing of river fish species in RAS. The economic costs to maintain this temperature is low, but the effect of production considered this level of WT as very less effective in several aspects. To conclude this part, we found intensive winter rearing of nase and <b>vimba</b> <b>bream</b> is an effective way to prepare fish for spring restocking. In the second part we have tested suitability of <b>Vimba</b> <b>bream</b> as a trainer fish for adaptation of pikeperch for commercial pellet diet. One of the basic problems in pikeperch culture in RAS is adapting early life stages to pelleted feed (PF). Our work compares four different ways of adapting 6 -week-old pikeperch fingerlings to feeding on a commercial diet. The methods were designated, A - use of trainer fish and direct application of PF; B - use of trainer fish and gradual addition of PF with natural food (NF, chironomid larvae); C - direct application of PF only; D - gradual addition of PF with NF. The growth trial experiment (including adaptation to PF) lasted 14 days by which time all experimental groups were accepting PF. Pikeperch fingerlings in group A grew significantly faster and PF was more readily accepted compared to other groups. Other characteristics observed (total weight increment, FCR) also support the use of trainer fish and direct application of PF for pikeperch in their adaptation to intensive culture. The aim of the final study were to compare the effect of anaesthetics MS 222, clove oil, 2 - phenoxyethanol and Propiscin on haematological and blood biochemical profiles in <b>vimba</b> <b>bream.</b> The haematological and blood biochemical profiles of <b>vimba</b> <b>bream</b> anaesthetized with MS 222 (100 mg/l), clove oil (33 mg/l), 2 - phenoxyethanol (0. 4 ml/l), Propiscin (1. 0 ml/l) and non-anaesthetized control group were tested. Each tested group was divided into two subgroups. The first subgroup was sampled immediately after 10 -min anaesthesia. Second subgroup was sampled 24 h after 10 -min anaesthesia. The 10 -min of exposure to the anaesthetics had no effect on the haematological profile of <b>vimba</b> <b>bream.</b> The effect of anaesthetics on biochemical indices of blood plasma was demonstrated. The exposure of the anaesthetics 2 -phenoxyethanol and Propiscin influenced levels of glucose, ammonia and the activity of aspartate aminotransferase compared with the control group. The level of triacylglycerols and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase was affected to exposure of MS 222. Based on the results only clove oil had no effect on the haematological and blood biochemical profiles. Other anaesthetics tested more or less affect value of blood biochemical profiles...|$|E
40|$|The feeding {{experiment}} was performed with fry of <b>vimba</b> <b>bream</b> (Vimba vimba) {{during the first}} 24 days {{from the beginning of}} exogenous nutrition. Six diets were used: algae (Chlorella vulgaris), starter fodder BioOptimal 0, 8 mm by Biomar company ? for cyprinids, live nauplii of Artemia salina, combination of alga and starter fodder BioOptimal, combination of alga and nauplii of Artemia salina, combination of starter fodder BioOptimal and nauplii of Artemia salina. Individual weight, total lenght, survival rate of larvae, specific growth rate (SGR) and conditions of the fry (condition coefficient according to Fulton ? FWC) were observed during the experiment. The results were compared statistically using the method of one ? way analysis of variance (ANOVA ? = 0, 05; Microsoft Excel) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the pathogenicity of Posthodiplostomum cuticola and Rossicotrema donicum digenean infestations within freshwater fish populations, in the Gorgova – Uzlina, Dunavat – Dranov and Razim – Sinoie natural complexes. The so-called “Black spot disease” {{caused by the}} metacercarial infestation was diagnosed in 5 out of 11  studied freshwater fish species: rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus), silver carp (Hypophtalmichthys molitrix), zarte (Vimba <b>vimba),</b> <b>bream</b> (Abramis brama) and European perch (Perca fluviatilis). The metacercariae were found mostly {{on the surface of}} the body (on fins, scales and skin), but also in the mouth, gills, eye sockets and even within the muscle, underneath the skin. Additionally, prevalence of the disease was estimated in rudd and silver carp during a 6 -year study period. It resulted a maximum prevalence of 33. 44 % in the silver carp caught in Dunavat – Dranov (during the 5 th year of the study) and a minimum prevalence of 22. 81 % in the rudd caught in Gorgova – Uzlina (during the 6 th year of the study) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} floods on the ichthyofauna of Štěpánovský stream (left-hand {{affluent}} of Sázava River, aver. summer flow rate 0. 2 m 3 s- 1) was studied using diet analysis of kingfisher A. atthis preying exclusively on local fish community. The first local flood event (2 August 2001; flow rate 100 m 3 s- 1) caused drastic {{shift in the}} ichthyofauna composition from original fish community dominated by brown trout S. trutta, brook trout S. fontinalis and bullhead C. gobio to fish community dominated by bleak A. alburnus, roach R. rutilus, chub L. cephalus and gudgeon G. gobio. The second flood event (all Czech Republic floods in August 2002; flow rate 4 m 3 s- 1) was surprisingly much less destructive to fish fauna. Consequently, the stream played also the role of refuge for many new fish species including juveniles of nase C. nasus, <b>vimba</b> <b>bream</b> V. vimba, barbel B. barbus, asp A. aspius and sunbleak L. delineatus, from highly flooded Sázava River...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} and analyzes original data, {{extracted from}} historical documents and scientific surveys, related to Russian fisheries {{in the southeastern}} part of the Gulf of Finland and its inflowing rivers during the 15 - early 20 (th) centuries. The data allow tracing key trends in fisheries development and in the abundance of major commercial species. In particular, results showed that, over time, the main fishing areas moved from the middle part of rivers downstream towards and onto the coastal sea. Changes in fishing patterns were closely interrelated with changes in the abundance of exploited fish. Anadromous species, such as Atlantic sturgeon, Atlantic salmon, brown trout, whitefish, <b>vimba</b> <b>bream,</b> smelt, lamprey, and catadromous eel {{were the most important}} commercial fish in the area because they were abundant, had high commercial value and were easily available for fishing in rivers. Due to intensive exploitation and other human-induced factors, populations of most of these species had declined notably by the early 20 (th) century and have now lost commercial significance. The last sturgeon was caught in 1996, and today only smelt and lamprey support small commercial fisheries. According to historical sources, catches of freshwater species such as roach, ide, pike, perch, ruffe and burbot regularly occurred, in some areas exceeding half of the total catch, but they were not as important as migrating fish and no clear trends in abundance are apparent. Of documented marine catch, Baltic herring appeared in the 16 (th) century, but did not become commercially significant until the 19 (th) century. From then until now herring have been the dominant catch...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two hundred years many {{wetlands}} and streams in Sweden have been lowered to provide land for agriculture and forestry. Some of the coastal wetlands and streams probably served as spawning sites for certain species of fish in the Baltic Sea, but the present situation is not well known. As standardized methods to monitor fish in running waters are carried out during late summer or autumn, {{there is a need}} for methods to sample spring-spawning fish in these streams. The aim of this study was to survey the lower kilometer stretch of Hammerstaån in Stockholm, to investigate the extent to which the stream is used by spring-spawning fish. Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate a new type of survey fishing gill net called strömöversiktsnät (SÖN). This was done by comparing the catch of fish by SÖN with that of fyke nets. The comparison of the types of gear included number of fish caught, on a catch per unit effort (CPUE) basis, number of species and the size distributions. The study included 14 days with one gill net and one fyke net at two sites, in total 28 net-days. The inventory yielded in total seventeen species among which only trout (Salmo trutta), perch (Perca fluvitalis), roach (Rutilus rutilus), burbot (Lota lota), eel (Anguilla anguilla) and pike (Esox lucius) were previously known to occur. Six spawning species, smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), <b>vimba</b> <b>bream</b> (Vimba vimba), perch (Perca fluvitalis), roach (Rutilus rutilus), bream (Abramis brama) and white bream (Blicka bjoerkna) were caught in more than 60 individuals, which was set as a limit for comparisons of size distributions. There was no significant difference in CPUE between SÖN and fyke nets. Also length distribution did not differ between SÖN and fyke nets except for the species perch and white bream were the nets caught significant smaller perch and bigger white bream than the fyke nets. The results show that investigations with SÖN or fyke nets during springtime can be of great importance to increase our knowledge about spring-spawning fish in Swedish streams and the coastal areas of the Baltic Sea...|$|E
