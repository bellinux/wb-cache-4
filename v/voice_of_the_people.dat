25|$|Calypso music {{developed}} {{together with}} Carnival. The chantuelle, who {{spoke for the}} band, evolved into the calypsonian (and other characters, such as the Midnight Robber).

25|$|On 1 April 1911, Porfirio Díaz {{claimed that}} he had heard the <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Mexico, {{replaced}} his cabinet, and agreed to restitution of the lands of the dispossessed. Madero did not believe this statement and instead demanded the resignation of President Díaz and Vice-President Ramón Corral. Madero then attended a meeting with the other revolutionary leaders– they agreed to a fourteen-point plan which called for pay for revolutionary soldiers; the release of political prisoners; and the right of the revolutionaries to name several members of cabinet. Madero was moderate, however. He believed that the revolutionaries should proceed cautiously so as to minimize bloodshed and should strike a deal with Díaz if possible. In May, Madero wanted a ceasefire, but his fellow revolutionaries Pascual Orozco and Francisco Villa disagreed and went ahead with an attack on Ciudad Juárez. The revolutionaries won this battle decisively and on 21 May 1911, the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez was signed.|$|E

[...] Baldwin's view was shared by the Australian High Commissioner in London, Stanley Bruce, who was a former Australian prime minister. On the same day that Hardinge wrote to the King, Bruce met Hardinge and then wrote to Baldwin, expressing horror at the idea of a marriage between the King and Simpson.|$|E
500|$|Starting on 8 December 1880 at Paardekraal, a farm to the {{south-west}} of Pretoria, 10,000 Boers congregated—the largest recorded {{meeting of}} white people in South Africa up to that time. [...] "I stand here before you", Kruger declared, [...] "called by the people. In the <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> I have heard the voice of God, the King of Nations, and I obey!" [...] He announced the fulfilment of the decision taken at Wonderfontein the previous year to restore the South African Republic government and volksraad, which as the Vice-President of the last independent administration he considered his responsibility. To help him in this he turned to Jorissen and Bok, who respectively became State Attorney and State Secretary, and Pretorius and Joubert, who the reconstituted volksraad elected to an executive triumvirate along with Kruger. The assembly approved a proclamation announcing {{the restoration of the}} South African Republic.|$|E
500|$|By 1989, the Peace Candle {{had become}} so {{dilapidated}} that it was hardly able to sustain the winter weather. Strong winds in November had shaken the structure {{so much that the}} wax dripping fixtures atop the candle had fallen off. On November 16, 1989, Mayor Sal Panto Jr. announced on WEST's <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> show that the Peace Candle would not go up another year because the support structure was too weak and the Easton Area Christmas Committee was not receiving enough donations to pay for repairs. The committee was now receiving an average of $3,000 a year in donations, which was used to maintain the existing candle. Panto said, [...] "The sad reality is, this is the last year." [...] However, new fundraising efforts were started to raise $20,000 to build a new Peace Candle. Local businesses and unions volunteered their time and materials to work on it, with the Lehigh Valley Carpenters Union working up to 100 hours a week for about five weeks to have the candle ready for the 1990 holiday season.|$|E

500|$|There {{has been}} broad {{agreement}} among historians that McKinley's election {{was at the}} time of a transition between two political eras, dubbed the Third and Fourth Party Systems. Kenneth F. Warren emphasizes the national commitment to a pro-business, industrial, and modernizing program, represented by McKinley. Historian Daniel P. Klinghard argued that McKinley's personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency—rather than simply follow the party platform—by representing himself as the <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> Republican Karl Rove exalted McKinley as the model for a sweeping political realignment behind George W. Bush in the 2000s,—a realignment that did not happen. [...] Some political scientists, such as David Mayhew, questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment, thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves credit for it. Historian Michael J. Korzi argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern, powerful president, this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
500|$|Mangalooru Samachara, {{the first}} ever {{newspaper}} in Kannada, was brought out by Rev. Hermann Friedrich Mögling of the Basel mission in 1843. The first ever Kannada to English dictionary was published in Mangalore by Ferdinand Kittel in 1894. Major national English language newspapers such as Times of India, The Hindu, The New Indian Express, Deccan Herald and Daijiworld [...] publish localised Mangalore editions. The Madipu, Mogaveera, Samparka (Contact) and Saphala (Fulfillment) are well-known Tulu periodicals in Mangalore.

500|$|Moscoso {{was named}} the PA {{candidate}} again in the May 2, 1999 general election. Her main opponent this time was Martín Torrijos, Omar Torrijos' son, named to represent the PRD after {{the failure of a}} constitutional referendum that would have allowed Pérez Balladares to run for a second term. Torrijos was selected in part to try to win back left-leaning voters after the privatizations and union restrictions instituted by Pérez Balladares. Moscoso ran on a populist platform, beginning many of her speeches with the Latin phrase [...] "Vox populi, vox Dei" [...] ("the <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> is the voice of God"), previously used by Arias to begin his own speeches. She pledged to support education, reduce poverty, and slow the pace of privatization. While Torrijos ran in large part on his father's memory—including using the campaign slogan [...] "Omar lives"—Moscoso evoked that of her dead husband, leading Panamanians to joke that the election was a race between [...] "two corpses". Torrijos allies also criticized Moscoso for her lack of government experience or college degree. However, unlike in 1994, it was now the PRD that was hampered by the scandals of the previous administration, and Moscoso defeated Torrijos with 45% of the vote to 37%.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1600s, the average Paraguayan despised the Jesuits. [...] Some {{agitated}} {{for the government}} to take action against them, and at the very least the idea of extending further [...] "privileges" [...] was out of the question. [...] A series of intrigues took place from 1640-1650 with pro-Jesuit governor Gregorio de Hinestrosa vying against the anti-Jesuit Bishop Bernardino de Cárdenas, a Franciscan. [...] Cárdenas was exiled to Corrientes, but upon the end of Hinestrosa's governorship returned to Asunción. [...] The new governor Diego de Escobar y Osorio attempted to remain neutral in the conflict between the Jesuits and the settlers who were now backed by the returned Cárdenas, and successfully avoided bloodshed for a time, but in 1649 Osorio died. [...] The cabildo, seizing on the Decree of 1537, promptly elected Cárdenas the new governor, and with his support expelled the Jesuits from their college in Asunción. [...] They wrote in explanation of their actions that the Jesuits were destroying the province, and it was the [...] "natural right" [...] of people to defend themselves against aggression. [...] Governor-Bishop Cárdenas, in similar proto-democratic language, said [...] "the <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> is the voice of God." [...] The authorities were displeased, and the Jesuits, with the government's permission, sent in an army of mission Indians to depose Cárdenas. [...] Cárdenas and the Paraguayan militia decided to resist, and in a battle on October 5, 1649, the Jesuit army of roughly 700 Indians won a complete victory. [...] The Paraguayans were scattered, Cárdenas and his closest supporters were arrested, and the citizens of Asunción were subjected to the humiliation of an occupying army of Indians patrolling their streets and enforcing the new governor's rule. [...] This wound never healed. [...] By 1721, hatred of the Jesuits was even more intense {{than it was in the}} early 1600s.|$|E
