All ministers, including the Prime Minister, are (theoretically) equal. These meetings are chaired by the prime minister. Behind the closed doors of the Trêveszaal, ministers can freely debate proposed decisions and express their opinion on any aspect of cabinet policy. Once a decision is made by the council, all individual members are bound by it and are obliged to support it publicly. If {{a member of the}} cabinet does not agree with a particular decision he will have to step down. Generally much effort is put into reaching relative consensus on any decision. A process of <b>voting</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> does exist, but is hardly ever used.|$|E
50|$|The {{policy of}} a cabinet is coordinated by the Council of Ministers, {{in which all}} ministers, {{including}} ministers without portfolio, take part. The Council initiates laws and policy. State secretaries do not attend the Council of Ministers unless invited, and even then they have no voting rights in the Council. The Council meets every Friday in the Trêveszaal (the Room of Treaties) in the Binnenhof. Meetings are chaired by the Prime Minister, or an acting Prime Minister if necessary. The Council makes decisions in a collegial manner; all ministers, including the Prime Minister, are (theoretically) equal. Behind the closed doors of the Trêveszaal, ministers can freely debate proposed decisions and express their opinion on any aspect of cabinet policy. Once a decision is made by the Council, all individual members are bound by it and are obliged to support it publicly. A member of Cabinet who is not prepared to publicly support a decision of the Council is obliged to step down. Typically, {{a good deal of}} effort is put into reaching relative consensus on any decision. A process of <b>voting</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> does exist, but is hardly ever used.|$|E
40|$|At {{the summit}} in Laeken in December 2001 the European Council opened {{the debate on}} the reform of the {{supranational}} structures through its "Declaration on the Future of the European Union" and proposed a wide-ranging agenda. The European Convention, with the mandate of the European Council, has been forming proposals for a more democratic, transparent and efficient European Union and presented a draft of a Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe on 20 th of June 2003. On these fundaments the Intergovernmental Conference finally came to a compromise in summer 2004 after wrestling especially with the problem of qualified majority <b>voting</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council.</b> On 29 th of October 2004 the Heads of State and Governments of the 25 Member States signed the Treaty. After the French and Dutch citizens refused their approval of the Treaty in referendums the future of the draft Constitution remains uncertain. The volume contains articles from high-ranking experts from politics and academia of different Member States about the basic principles of the actual constitutional law of the European Union and its need of reform through a Constitution for Europe. By analysing the rules to govern a Europe of 25 and in time 28 and more Member States the publication intends to make a contribution to the emerging "Ius Publicum Europaeum". [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{rational}} {{explanation for the}} notorious inefficient farm support policies within the EU with an optimization model of legislative behavior and legislative institutions. It is argued that inefficient agricultural policies can be rationally explained if {{it is assumed that}} legislative decision making is determined by informal norms derived in the shadow of formal institutional rules. First, maximization of political support implies that different institutional actors do prefer different levels of subsidization for the different national farm sectors. Second, according to the applied specific decision norm legislators' preferred policy positions are aggregated to a specific Common Agricultural Policy. In the formal model informal norms correspond to a specific organization of political exchange, where on a macro level legislators exchange political rights to control policies in specific policy domains, and on a micro level within a policy domain network political control rights are exchanged over specific policy dimensions. Beside the importance of the "principle of ministry government", that is political control rights over agricultural policies are generally obtained by actors that are politically strongly related to the farm sector, the model emphasizes the impact (1) of external effects of political exchange and (2) of the principle of financial solidarity on the efficiency of CAP. Since the foundation of the EU norms have been changed from less efficient norms, i. e. the Luxembourg Compromise corresponding to Weingast's norm of a universal coalition, to more efficient norms reflecting qualified majority <b>voting</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council.</b> Observed changes of norms are interpreted as legislators choosing {{the rules of the game}} maximizing their expected benefits, where the enlargement of the EU is identified as a main factor forcing legislators uniquely to choose new norms...|$|E

As Clan Honor could {{potentially}} drag the entire Empire into civil war, the Great Ones can intervene and forbid any fighting between Clans or Houses, even {{going so far as to}} use magical powers to enforce their will. All Clans nominate a Warchief, who commands the military forces of a Clan. The Lords of the Five Families can also be elected Warlord, the supreme military commander of Tsuranuanni. The Warlord is second-in-command only to the Emperor, but the Warlord is usually more powerful due to the Light of Heaven rarely engaging in political or military matters.|$|R

Whereas relative voting power analysis disregards the important distinction between strong and weak decision rules, spatial models are not able to explain the un-equalness of rules. In this paper, we clarify the differences between both approaches by providing an analytical tool to measure absolute and relative power. We introduce our inclusiveness concept which outlines the notion of absolute power. Moreover, we argue that the combination of both aspects, absolute and relative power, gives an insight into the choice of rules. To generalize our findings we present the concept of entities and inter-institutional sets of winning coalitions which are the cornerstones of the game-theoretical measurement of absolute and relative power in political systems. We then present two appropriate indices measuring both aspects of power. Finally we apply both indices to the variety of European legislative settings with regard to different policy domains...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyDumping is to unfairly sell goods {{at a lower price}} (at foreign market) as compared to their normal value at domestic market of the manufacturing country, thus causing material injury to the local industry of the importing country. Other researchers have explored the global (WTO Agreement) and the European Union’s (EU) Anti-Dumping law mostly with a commercial perspective. At doctoral level EU-China, EU-Japan and EU-Korea trade relations with reference to the application of protective measures have been studied. This dissertation is, however, the very first aimed to examine the application of EU Anti-Dumping law relating to Pakistan. This is a complete health check of EU-Pakistan trade relations with reference to the application of Anti-dumping duties on Pakistan. This study is a combination of doctrinal research and empirical research, whereby it critically evaluates the Commission’s investigation and the judgements of the EU Courts related to Pakistan and thus establish their consistency or inconsistency; it also studies <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> patterns <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> and <b>the</b> impact of AD duties on Pakistani imports. It is a qualitative exploratory study based upon an inductive approach. Contradictions are found in the calculations of normal value and export price, constructed normal value, the comparison of normal value and export price, the calculation of dumping margin, and the calculation of injury. Suggestions are made as {{to the extent to which}} Unions’ anti-dumping rules need to be reviewed to moderate their tilt that unequivocally favours Union manufacturers. Moreover, this dissertation identifies many provisions of the basic regulation, which being too vague offers multiple interpretations, which are thus recommended to be amended. In the empirical part of this research the voting style of EU member states for or against the adoption of AD measures against Pakistan has been studied. Thereafter, the content analysis of stated reasons for specific voting styles reveals that the member states vote on the basis of the findings and conclusions of investigation as done by the Commission, thus trade partner loyalty is not the reason for their voting. Furthermore, application of the ADDs is found to be reason of import decline from Pakistan to the EU...|$|R
