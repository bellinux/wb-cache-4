500|$|The {{cover was}} controversial; {{editions of the}} album sold at Circuit City came housed in a {{cardboard}} sleeve featuring an alternate cover, while Walmart and Kmart refused to stock the album at all. A pastor in Memphis, Tennessee threatened {{to go on a}} hunger strike unless the album was pulled from shelves. Manson described these actions as attempts at censorship: [...] "The irony is that my point of the photo on the album was to show people that the crucifixion of Christ is, indeed, a violent image. My jaw is missing as a symbol of this <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> censorship. This doesn't piss me off as much as it pleases me, because those offended by my album cover have successfully proven my point."

500|$|In the film's {{period as}} a {{developing}} project under several studios, {{different versions of}} the screenplay were drafted by numerous screenwriters, beginning with Steve Oedekerk. Other screenwriters involved included David Hayter, Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer, Jeffrey Boam, Thompson Evans, and Chris Hauty. When Universal and DreamWorks re-partnered in 2007, they [...] hired Hawk Ostby and Mark Fergus. In 2009, Ostby and Fergus were replaced by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Damon Lindelof. Kurtzman and Orci analyzed American Western films including The Searchers. Orci said, [...] "The first draft was <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> jokey and broad and then it went very serious. You kind of swing {{back and forth between the}} two extremes and the tone until you find the exact right point where a Western and a sci-fi movie can really shake hands without it seeming unnatural." [...] "Imagine you're watching Unforgiven and then Aliens land," [...] Orci explained.|$|E

500|$|Six weeks later, in May 2010, {{she asked}} Swivel {{to work on}} the entire project. Concerning his working {{relationship}} with Beyoncé, he commented, [...] "There was no 'We're doing this today.' It was a <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> open project, where whatever she felt like recording at that time was what we'd work on. It was based on how she felt, her mood, and also her listening to the demos that writers would give us." [...] With Swivel, she experimented with horns, drums, guitars and percussion instruments. Mostly inspired by the Fela! sessions, Swivel began to formulate beats using their own recordings and those from Fela! The project was moved to KMA Studios for {{a week and a half}} because Roc the Mic was not large enough. There they began recording [...] "I Care", [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] "Rather Die Young", and completed [...] "Party". They recorded the songs [...] "Schoolin' Life", [...] "1+1" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] at Jungle City Studios in New York.|$|E
500|$|Craig {{spoke about}} the Battle of Hogwarts to Art Insights Magazine, saying that [...] "the great {{challenge}} is the destruction of Hogwarts. The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, {{the entrance of the}} Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E
500|$|They met up in January 2001 in London {{to record}} the song. He went into a studio with only three tracks for the mix, and was {{impressed}} {{that there were many}} technicians and programmers that probably had been using a hundred. However, the singer was protecting the idea of the raw version, and said: [...] "This is how we wanted to be". They added two changes to the song and then {{spent the rest of the}} day recording Björk's vocals. They wanted to have only one take that really worked so that they did not have to edit different takes. They recorded 20 takes, and used the fifth or sixth, and because of that, the producer thought that [...] "this track is very intimate and personal because of the way the vocals were recorded". The way the song was recorded was [...] "kind of rough" [...] according to Knak; [...] "It's also very close to the mic; all these things that you wouldn't normally keep. In that sense, it is <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of,</b> almost naked. In the structure and in the feeling because of the lyrics".|$|E

500|$|The film {{takes place}} {{simultaneously}} with {{the events of}} The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2, the latter of which is set {{six months after the}} events of Iron Man, Clark Gregg, who appeared in Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, reprised the role in Thor. About his role in Thor he stated, [...] "Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [...] a <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> small role in Iron Man. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and [...] to put him more into the universe of it." [...] After signing on to appear as Clint Barton / Hawkeye in The Avengers, Jeremy Renner made a cameo appearance as the character during a scene in Thor. Branagh said that they [...] "were always going to have a guy in a basket above the action where Thor breaks in the S.H.I.E.L.D. camp", and that he was thrilled when the producers told him they wanted to use Renner's Hawkeye for that role. The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Loki, watching as Erik Selvig and Nick Fury discuss the Tesseract. The scene was directed by Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers. Stellan Skarsgård, who played Selvig, said the scene was not included when he first read the screenplay for Thor, and that he was sent pages for the scene after agreeing to appear in The Avengers.|$|E
