Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Today there are many academic software programs available to help students grasp the concepts taught to them in the classroom. Most of the software however, is intended either to be used outside of the classroom, or to teach a subject without the classroom or instructor entirely. This thesis presents a design and prototype for a pedagogical tool which is intended {{to be used in the}} classroom by the instructor to help demonstrate each concept to be conveyed. A prevailing problem in the Industrial Engineering domain is how to provide manufacturing students, studying production control, the needed factory experience without having to build and maintain an extremely expensive, and possibly dangerous, classroom factory facility. In an attempt to solve this problem, the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Factory</b> Environment model was designed and implemented. The model includes those elements necessary to emulate a real factory for educational purposes and are implemented in three main components: the factory operators (i. e. the instructor and students), the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Factory</b> Database, and the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Factory</b> Machine Emulator.
