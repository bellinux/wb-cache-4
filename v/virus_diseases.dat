5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and <b>virus</b> <b>diseases,</b> which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To provide clinicians with {{practical}} considerations for {{care of children}} with Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> in resource-rich settings. Data Sources: Review of the published medical literature, World Health Organization and government documents, and expert opinion. Data Synthesis: There are limited data regarding Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> in children; however, reported case-fatality proportions in children are high. Ebola virus may affect immune regulation and endothelial function differently in children than adults. Considerations for care of children with Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> are presented. Conclusions: Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> is a severe multisystem disease with high mortality in children and adults. Hospitals and clinicians must prepare to provide care for patients with Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> before such patients present for care, with particular attention to rigorous infection control to limit secondary cases.

500|$|Fungi, {{bacteria}} and viruses attack cacti, {{the first two}} particularly when plants are over-watered. Fusarium rot can gain entry through a wound and cause rotting accompanied by red-violet mold. [...] "Helminosporium rot" [...] is caused by Bipolaris cactivora (syn. Helminosporium cactivorum); Phytophthora species also cause similar rotting in cacti. Fungicides may be of limited value in combating these diseases. Several viruses {{have been found in}} cacti, including cactus virus X. These appear to cause only limited visible symptoms, such as chlorotic (pale green) spots and mosaic effects (streaks and patches of paler color). However, in an Agave species, cactus virus X has been shown to reduce growth, particularly when the roots are dry. There are no treatments for <b>virus</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|E
500|$|Such {{disasters}} {{occurred when}} human intervention caused ecological changes by {{the introduction of}} crops to new vectors and viruses. Cacao is native to South America and was introduced to West Africa in the late 19th century. In 1936, swollen root disease had been transmitted to plantations by mealybugs from indigenous trees. New habitats can trigger outbreaks of plant <b>virus</b> <b>diseases.</b> Before 1970, the rice yellow mottle virus was only found in the Kisumu district of Kenya, but following the irrigation of large areas of East Africa and extensive rice cultivation, the virus spread throughout East Africa. Human activity [...] introduced plant viruses to native crops. The citrus tristeza virus (CTV) was introduced to South America from Africa between 1926 and 1930. At the same time, the aphid Toxoptera citricidus was carried from Asia to South America and this accelerated the transmission of the virus. By 1950, more than six million citrus trees had been killed by the virus in São Paulo, Brazil. CTV and citrus trees probably coevolved for centuries in their original countries. The dispersal of CTV to other regions and its interaction with new citrus varieties resulted in devastating outbreaks of plant diseases. Because of the problems caused by the introduction– by humans– of plant viruses, many countries have strict importation controls on any materials that can harbour dangerous plant viruses or their insect vectors.|$|E
