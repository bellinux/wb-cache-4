40|$|<b>Vulvovaginal</b> and {{invasive}} <b>candidiasis</b> {{are frequent}} conditions in immunosuppressed individuals caused by Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida spp. Fluconazole and Amphotericin B {{are the main}} drugs used to fight the infection. However, resistance to fluconazole and other azole antifungal drugs is an important clinical problem that encourages the search for new therapeutic alternatives. In this work, we evaluate the antifungal activity of the biphosphinic cyclopalladate C 7 a in the in vitro and in vivo model. Our results showed fungicidal activity, with low values of minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimum fungicidal concentrations, even for fluconazole and/or miconazole resistant Candida isolates. Fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the compound was able to inhibit the formation of hyphae/pseudohyphae and, moreover, promoted morphological alterations in cellular organelles and structures, such as disruption of cell wall, apparent mitochondrial swelling, chromatin marginalization into the nuclei and increased numbers of electron-lucent vacuoles. C 7 a significantly decreased the biofilm formation and reduced the viability of yeast cells in mature biofilms when tested against a virulent C. albicans strain. In vivo assays demonstrated a significant decrease of fungal burden in local (vaginal canal) and disseminated (kidneys) infection. In addition, we observed {{a significant increase in}} the survival of the systemically infected animals treated with C 7 a.

40|$|Abstract Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) on the in vitro growth characteristics and in vivo pathogenicity of Candida albicans in a murine model in the absence of a photosensitizer. Background data: C. albicans is an opportunistic commensal organism that causes a wide variety of diseases in human beings, ranging from superficial infections to life-threatening invasive candidiasis. The incidence of C. albicans infection is increasing, because of the greater frequency of acquired immunodeficiency conditions. A high recurrence rate has been reported for <b>vulvovaginal</b> and oral <b>candidiasis,</b> despite the best available treatments. Therefore, the search for new treatment modalities seems quite rational. Methods: Candida culture plates were exposed to common clinical energies of LLLI: 3, 5, 10, and 20 J at 685 nm (BTL Laser 5000, Medicinos Projektai, Czech Republic, Prague, max power output 50 mW) and 3, 5, 10, 30, and 50 J at 830 nm (BTL Laser 5000, Medicinos Projektai, Czech Republic, Prague, max power output 400 mW). Results: Following LLLI with energies > 10 J at both 685 and 830 nm wavelengths, statistically significant effects were observed in vitro on the turbidimetric growth kinetics of C. albicans and in vivo on the survival rate of infected mice (p value </= 0. 05). Therefore, this energy could be considered a threshold for clinical investigation. Conclusions: Translating our data into the clinical setting, it can be proposed that a direct laser-based approach without using a photosensitizing dye can significantly reduce the pathogenicity of Candida albicans. It can also be concluded that laser light at specific wavelengths could be a possible promising novel treatment for superficial and mucocutaneous C. albicans infections...|$|R

Once in their life around 75% of women will suffer from <b>vulvovaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (VVC) and about 90% of these infections are caused by C. albicans. It however may also affect {{a number of other}} regions. For example, higher prevalence of colonization of C. albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to unpierced matched individuals. To infect host tissue, the usual unicellular yeast-like form of C. albicans reacts to environmental cues and switches into an invasive, multicellular filamentous form, a phenomenon called dimorphism. In addition, an overgrowth infection is considered superinfection, usually applied when an infection become opportunistic and very resistant to antifungals. It then becomes suppressed by antibiotics. The infection is prolonged when the original sensitive strain is replaced by the antibiotic-resistant strain.|$|E

The aim of our {{study was to determine}} possible risk factors for recurrent <b>vulvovaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> in non-pregnant females within the reproductive age. Methods. The design of our study was of a case-control type. Case and control patients were selected from the gynecological patients at six primary care facilities in Serbia and in Montenegro. The data on the patients' health condition, concomitant therapy and diseases were taken from their records, and the data on habits were obtained by unstructured interview. For potential risk factors crude odds ratios were calculated, and then adjusted by logistic regression. Results. A total of fifty-one patients had four or more episodes of <b>vulvovaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> during the last year (cases), and 132 patients with one to three episodes of <b>vulvovaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> were sampled as controls, matched by age.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Vulvovaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> is {{the most}} common mycosis, however, the {{available}} information about antifungal susceptibilities of these yeasts is limited. AIM: To compare the gold standard fungal culture with a new molecular identification method and report the incidence of yeast species in vulvovaginitis candidosa. METHOD: The authors studied 370 yeasts isolated from <b>vulvovaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> and identified them by phenotypic and molecular methods. RESULTS: The most common species was Candida albicans (85 %), followed by Candida glabrata, and other Candida species. CONCLUSION: At present there are no recommendations for the evaluation of antifungal susceptibility of pathogenic fungal species occurring in <b>vulvovaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> and the natural antifungal resistance of the different species is known only. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight identification can be used to differentiate the fluconazole resistant Candida dubliniensis and the sensitive Candida albicans strains...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vulvovaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> affects {{approximately}} 20 % {{of women}} annually, {{but it is}} not well characterized epidemiologically. Of 1027 respondents to two mailed cross-sectional surveys at a large university, 37. 5 % reported a prior clinical diagnosis of <b>vulvovaginal</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> The frequency of first diagnosis increased rapidly after age 17, with an estimated 54. 7 % of women experiencing the condition by age 25. In a proportional hazards model of age at first diagnosis, <b>vulvovaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> was associated with initiation of sexual activity (rate ratio [RR] = 2. 9; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 2, 3. 8), oral contraceptive use (RR = 1. 7; CI = 1. 4, 2. 2), and White (RR = 3. 1; CI = 1. 7, 5. 7) and Black (RR = 5. 9; CI = 3. 0, 11. 5) race vs Asian...|$|E
