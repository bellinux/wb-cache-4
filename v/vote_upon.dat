25|$|Not {{long after}} the {{conclusion}} of this battle, a new one ensued, this time concerning {{the removal of the}} university from Northwest Arkansas. It began with the introduction of a bill in the state House of Representatives, by a representative from Pope County, to break away the Colleges of Agriculture and Engineering and place them in Russellville. As part of the attempt, the proponents from Pope County had gained the support of individuals from Pulaski County, in exchange for assisting later with any attempts to move the school or parts of it to Little Rock. Both the university and Fayetteville fought the move, and the bill was successfully beaten back in a vote of 52 to 37. Despite the setback, new bills were submitted to time a statewide referendum on the matter with the holding of the 1924 Democrat primary. Proponents of the move {{went so far as to}} establish the Arkansas University Removal Association to lobby for a more successful result. Among the chief defenders of the university was Vol Walker and former governor Brough, and after hours and days of speeches for and against the move, the issue was silenced when the state Senate voted to indefinitely postpone any <b>vote</b> <b>upon</b> the bill urging the school's removal.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} of the Community of Christ is sometimes referred to by the titles of Prophet or Prophet-President. The {{president of}} the church acts as a prophet when bringing occasional inspired counsel or inspired documents to the church. These are usually brief passages of text which bring encouragement, counsel and direction to the church. When an inspired document is presented to the World Conference by the {{president of the}} church, an elaborate review process takes place. Each quorum of the church and several caucuses review the document and <b>vote</b> <b>upon</b> it. The quorums typically vote heavily in favor of the documents and sometimes unanimously. Debate is allowed, however, and the body has been known to refer the inspired document back to the president for further reflection or for clarification. When the document comes to the floor of the World Conference for debate, the president retires from the room to allow for more impartial consideration. The World Conference may vote to include the document as a new section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which is regarded as scripture by the denomination. If the delegates at the World Conference do approve an inspired document, it is the custom of the church to then have a courtesy vote, which is opened to all non-delegates attending the conference. This is the only time non-delegates are permitted to vote on World Conference business. Through this action, the president of the church can be assured that a large representation of the church membership supports the inspired document.|$|E

2500|$|The phone vote {{determines the}} first semi-finalist that wins this stages, and occurs {{after all the}} acts in a semi-final have performed, whereupon a special phone line is opened for a short time, which the public can use {{to vote on the}} act that they thought was the best; the phone number used, shown after their performance, is the same for all semi-finalists, with the {{exception}} of the final two digits, which differs between each semi-finalist in terms of the order of their appearance. Once the lines have closed and the votes have been counted, the act with the highest number of public votes is automatically placed in the final.

60|$|I {{will explain}} that Dr. Lecher was {{not making a}} twelve-hour speech for pastime, but for an {{important}} purpose. It was the Government's intention to push the Ausgleich through its preliminary stages in this one sitting (for which it was the Order of the Day), and then by vote refer it to a select committee. It was the Majority's scheme--as charged by the Opposition--to drown debate upon the bill by pure noise--drown it out and stop it. The debate being thus ended, the <b>vote</b> <b>upon</b> the reference would follow--with victory for the Government. But into the Government's calculations had not entered {{the possibility of a}} single-barrelled speech which should occupy the entire time-limit of the setting, and also get itself delivered {{in spite of all the}} noise. Goliath was not expecting David. But David was there; and during twelve hours he tranquilly pulled statistical, historical, and argumentative pebbles out of his scrip and slung them at the giant; and when he was done he was victor, and the day was saved.|$|E
60|$|The crucial {{difficulty}} was the Irish representation at Westminster. In {{the first}} bill of 1886, the Irish members {{were to come}} no more to the imperial parliament, except {{for one or two}} special purposes. The two alternatives to the policy of exclusion were either inclusion of the Irish members for all purposes, or else their inclusion for imperial purposes only. In his speech at Swansea in 1887, Mr. Gladstone favoured provisional inclusion, without prejudice to a return to the earlier plan of exclusion if that should be recommended by subsequent experience.(302) In the bill now introduced (Feb. 13, 1893), eighty representatives from Ireland were to have seats at Westminster, but they were not to <b>vote</b> <b>upon</b> motions or bills expressly confined to England or Scotland, and there were other limitations. This plan was soon found to be wholly intolerable to the House of Commons. Exclusion having failed, and inclusion of reduced numbers for limited purposes having failed, the only course left open was what was called omnes omnia, or rather the inclusion of eighty Irish members, with power of voting on all purposes.|$|E
60|$|It will be {{perceived}} Judge Trumbull shows that Senator Bigler, upon {{the floor of}} the Senate, had declared there had been a conference among the senators, in which conference it was determined to have an enabling act passed for the people of Kansas to form a constitution under, and in this conference it was agreed among them that it was best not to have a provision for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people after it should be formed. He then brings forward to show, and showing, as he deemed, that Judge Douglas reported the bill back to the Senate with that clause stricken out. He then shows that there was a new clause inserted into the bill, which would in its nature prevent a reference of the constitution back for a vote of the people,--if, indeed, upon a mere silence in the law, it could be assumed that they had the right to <b>vote</b> <b>upon</b> it. These are the general statements that he has made.|$|E

60|$|I suppose {{almost every}} one knows that, in this controversy, {{whatever}} {{has been said}} has had reference {{to the question of}} negro slavery. We have not been in a controversy about {{the right of the people}} to govern themselves in the ordinary matters of domestic concern in the States and Territories. Mr. Buchanan, in one of his late messages (I think when he sent up the Lecompton Constitution) urged that the main point to which the public attention had been directed was not in regard to the great variety of small domestic matters, but was directed to the question of negro slavery; and he asserts that if the people had had a fair chance to vote on that question there was no reasonable ground of objection in regard to minor questions. Now, while I think that the people had not had given, or offered, them a fair chance upon that slavery question, still, if there had been a fair submission to a <b>vote</b> <b>upon</b> that main question, the President's proposition would have been true to the utmost. Hence, when hereafter I speak of popular sovereignty, I wish to be understood as applying what I say to the question of slavery only, not to other minor domestic matters of a Territory or a State.|$|E
