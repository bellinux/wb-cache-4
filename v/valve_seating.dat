5000|$|The {{most common}} {{problem with the}} CVH is the {{tendency}} to drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat,</b> which most often happens in vin number P engines, due to the steel PM <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> inserts in the aluminum head. (the 2000-2004 Ford Focus with the 2.0L CVH/SPI SOHC engine and also seen in 1991-2002 Ford Escorts). These engines usually drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> with no warning, even if the engine has been well maintained. In most cases, a seat drops on the number 4 cylinder, with the next most common being the number 2 cylinder (this peculiarity {{may have something to}} do with the engines secondary harmonics) [...] With the factory <b>valve</b> <b>seats,</b> the typical life of the 2.0L SPI in a Focus is about 100 to 120k miles, but it can happen as early as 70k miles. When the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> drops out of the cylinder head, it falls into the cylinder and damages the piston and cylinder head.

Over their lifetime the valve Stellite seatings are rehabilitated by being ground down to create a smooth surface.

If these valves were actuated as a variable function of crankshaft angle, {{significant improvements in}} fuel economy could be achieved.

40|$|The {{following}} {{information is}} {{a summary of}} a Part 21 Report from Engine Systems, Inc. (ESI) concerning a condition reportable under 10 CFR 21. ESI reports that they received notification about foreign material found within a refurbished cylinder head supplied to the Cooper Nuclear Station by ESI. Specifically, Cooper discovered two hand tools (picks) within the intake port on the cylinder head. The tools were discovered by Cooper after installation of the head onto the diesel engine and while attempting to adjust the intake valve backlash. ESI supplied the refurbished cylinder head for a Cooper-Bessemer KSV engine to Cooper Nuclear Station (Part Number 13 -KSV- 1 1 - 6, Serial Number 6 K 2201) in August 2010. The refurbishment activity was performed at the Cameron Compression (OEM) facility in Casper, Wyoming. The most likely scenario is that the cylinder head was oriented with the inlet port facing up during installation of the valve spring keeper seals. After installation of the seals, the tools were placed {{on top of the}} cylinder head. It is presumed the tools fell into the inlet port and settled in the intake <b>valve</b> <b>seating</b> area. The tools are small in size (approximately 5 inches long with a 5 / 8 inch handle) and were not visible from the exterior of the head.

40|$|This Thesis is {{concerned}} with the modelling, analysis and control of novel mechatronic valve actuators for automotive systems, specifically, the control of the mechanical valves to intake and exhaust gases in Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). Scientific studies have shown that significant benefits in terms of engine efficiency and emissions can be obtained through the adoption of variable valve actuation. Current engine technology are based on the use of a mechanical driven camshaft, which is a no flexible device due to its strongly coupling to crankshaft position. Thus, {{it is not possible to}} adjust or adapt in real time the valve features according to the engine working conditions. Hence, there is the need of designing innovative mechanisms to actuate the engine valves. In so doing, traditional mechanical cam systems can be removed and a train of single actuated valves is incorporated into the ICE, leading to the development of camless engine technology. Electro-Mechanical Valve Actuators (EMVA) have been considered as one of the most promising technological solutions to develop this novel engine technology. To achieve all the potential benefits of the EMVA systems, two crucial control problems have to be tackled and solved efficiently: the control of the first lift manoeuvre, known as First Catching Control (FCC) problem, and the control of the <b>valve</b> <b>seating</b> velocity, known as Soft Landing Control (SLC) problem. The thesis shows that the analysis and control of the EMVA device can be successfully addressed in the framework of non-smooth dynamical system and nonlinear control theory, furthermore, the tuning of non linear controllers can be successfully done by using closed loop bifurcation diagram analysis. In particular, a non-smooth mathematical model is proposed, estimated and validated experimentally. A novel Key-on controller is proposed to solve the FCC control problem, while a combined feedforward-sliding mode controller is proposed to solve the SLC control problem. The proposed control approaches have been tested numerically and validated on an experimental setup, leading to successful results...|$|E
40|$|The minimum {{resistance}} of expiratory Heidbrink-type valves has been assessed by determining the pressure decrease across the valves at a flow rate of 30 litre min" 1. The average resistance of 70 valves currently in clinical use was 318 Pa at that flow rate and about 44 % had resistances {{greater than the}} limit of 294 Pa previously suggested. The resistances obtained in new valves were either similar or fractionally greater. Valves being introduced as parts of scavenging systems appeared, on the whole, to have lower resistances. One-way valves of the Heidbrink pattern are used frequently in semi-closed anaesthetic circuits, in circle systems and in the "manual " circuits attached to ventilators. Proportional adjustment of the spring resistance allows the elimination of gas to be con-trolled by the anaesthetist; low settings are recom-mended for spontaneous breathing and higher set-tings are needed for intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Whilst the detailed construction varies with each manufacturer, the design consists essentially of a circular disc resting on the <b>valve</b> <b>seating</b> against which it is held by a closely coiled helical spring. A pin fixed to the disc runs in a guide. The knurled screw allows the pressure applied by the spring to be varied (fig. 1). The work of breathing in anaesthetic circuits has been reduced considerably {{by the use of}} large-bore tubing, by decreasing the number of bends and by using valves of low resistance (Cooper, 1961). The main source of resistance lies with the expiratory valve. Mushin and Mapleson (1954) described the properties of such valves and showed marked differ-ences between six of the Heidbrink type. Sykes (1959) and Mehta and his colleagues (1977) found also variations in the resistances of valves in clinical use.

30|$|The {{experimental}} setup so assembled {{was successful}} in creating a system by which {{the performance of the}} jet pump was characterized at different angles of placement and depth. To enable this, unique fixture is designed. The stress of the work is on experimental setup for performance evaluation of a jet pump where in practical field it is difficult to make such an analysis. The success of work lies in creating a system of arrangement through which influence of varying angle of placement and depth is evaluated. The range of variation of flow at vertical position to horizontal position changed the discharge flow rate from 0.308 to 0.252  l/s which is order of 22 % increase. The efficiency was a maximum of 46 % when jet pump was placed vertically. It dropped to 42 % at 45 ° when placed at greater depth. When there was 15 % decrease in discharge pressure, there was around 10 % decrease in the flow rate. The above variations are calculated at constant operating injection flow rates. The facility so generated can be used for future research work on various aspects of jet pump by experimentation. This study presents two interesting outcomes as a result of testing the influence of angle of placement and depth over jet pump: at constant depth jet pump works better at vertical position but when it is under the influence of both depth and angle of placement, incline position is better once flow is commenced. It is also being an experimental experience that jet pump performance is a function of <b>valve</b> <b>seating</b> design and active pressure control is expected to work better than the gravity and buoyancy settled valve. At shallow depth, jet pump is expected to perform better and the maximum limit for immersion will be checked against vapour pressure for the working fluid. The experimental aspect of the setup developed is expected to be extensible used for future work and create snow ball effect in terms of the arrangement for varying angle of the placement and depth. The authors propose that further research can be carried out by varying the angle of placement and depth for the following parameters: different nozzle angles, different chambers shapes, varying diameters, area ratio and positive and negative suction heads (Hammoud 2006).|$|E
