30|$|One of the {{possible}} complications of proximal femoral <b>varisation</b> is AVN of the femoral head. There has been discussion as to whether excessive <b>varisation</b> may lead to AVN [24]. A study comparing two different techniques for femoral <b>varisation</b> (end-to-side and end-to-end), {{which resulted in a}} post-operative angle of around 100 ° in both cases, reported an 5.5 – 6  % AVN rate [30]. We did not find any signs of AVN in our collective during the whole radiologic follow-up.|$|E
30|$|This {{approach}} maintains good hip abduction {{and reduces}} soft-tissue surgery. Moderate <b>varisation</b> in VDRO {{in combination with}} pelvic osteotomy leads to good mid-term results with stable, pain-free hips, even in patients with severe spastic quadriplegia.|$|E
30|$|Hip {{reconstructive}} surgery in cerebral palsy (CP) patients necessitates either femoral varus derotational osteotomy (VDRO) or pelvic osteotomy, or both. The {{purpose of this}} study is to review the results of a moderate <b>varisation</b> [planned neck shaft angle (NSA) of 130 °] in combination with pelvic osteotomy for a consecutive series of patients.|$|E
30|$|<b>Varisation</b> {{osteotomy}} of {{the proximal}} femur {{was performed in}} four children {{in the control group}} and in 18 in the study group. In the control group, one child had WS diagnosed before the osteotomy and the other three did not have WS. In the study group, three children had no WS preoperatively and developed WS directly following surgery. Of the remaining 15 children, six had WS diagnosed before the osteotomy and nine had no WS (Table  3).|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} shown that the neck shaft angle (NSA) {{increases}} over time after a VDRO. Therefore, some authors suggest that children with higher GMFCS levels may require a higher amount of <b>varisation</b> with extensive soft-tissue release to maintain hip stability, accepting the possible higher risk of avascular necrosis (AVN) [15, 16]. Regarding the amount of VDRO, no consensus exists on how much correction of the proximal femur should be executed. One of the rare recommendations by Miller et al. [15] suggests a correction to a post-operative NSA down to 100 ° in non-walking patients and 120 ° in walking patients, mostly in conjunction with an extensive release of the adductors.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hip {{reconstructive}} surgery in cerebral palsy (CP) patients necessitates either femoral varus derotational osteotomy (VDRO) or pelvic osteotomy, or both. The {{purpose of this}} study is to review the results of a moderate <b>varisation</b> [planned neck shaft angle (NSA) of 130 °] in combination with pelvic osteotomy for a consecutive series of patients. METHODS: Patients with CP who had been treated at our institution for hip dysplasia, subluxation or dislocation with VDRO in combination with pelvic osteotomy between 2005 and 2010 were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty patients with a mean follow-up of 5. 4  years were included. The mean age at the time of operation was 8. 9  years. The majority were non-ambulant children [GMFCS I-III: n =  11 (27. 5...|$|E
40|$|Valgus tibial {{malalignment}} may be {{the result}} of bony deformity, previous lateral meniscectomy, or lateral plateau fractures. The correction of such a problem is usually addressed through a tibial osteotomy, which affects the alignment both in flexion and extension. Two surgical options are available: medial closing wedge and lateral opening wedge. When planning a <b>varisation</b> osteotomy, it should be considered that the normal joint line is in 3 degrees of varus. Increasing this obliquity beyond 10 to 15 degrees ends up with increased loads on the patellofemoral joint and medial subluxation of the femur on the tibia. The aim of the present study was to discuss actual indications and contraindications for a varus-producing high tibial osteotomy and describe surgical steps of both medial closing wedge and lateral opening wedge techniques. In addition, the available literature has been searched to report functional outcomes and complications...|$|E
30|$|According to the literature, even in {{combined}} VDRO and pelvic osteotomy, {{releases of}} the adductors {{are carried out}} in up to 80  % of patients [15, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. It is known that soft-tissue corrections have a less predictable outcome than bony procedures, e.g. an extensive adductor release may fail due to scarring. We, therefore, only perform adductor release if abduction does not reach at least 20 ° {{at the end of}} surgery when the shortening of the femur has already lead to some relative lengthening of the muscles, even though our results are comparable to other series, in which a greater amount of <b>varisation</b> was performed and adductor release was carried out in 70 – 100  % [15, 21, 28, 29]. Miller et al., for example, performed an adductor release {{at the beginning of the}} surgery if the abduction did not exceed 45 ° [15] and McNerney et al. performed adductor lengthening to obtain abduction of 60 ° [19].|$|E
30|$|As valgus HTO {{leads to}} an {{increase}} in the pressure in the lateral compartment, the subsequent question was whether HTO results in structural changes in the lateral tibiofemoral osteochondral unit and lateral meniscus, and whether these changes depend in the extent of correction; reflective of the pressure in the lateral compartment. Importantly, the pressure increase in the lateral compartment following standard correction valgus HTO (with 4.5 ° tibial valgus) did not lead to mid-term morphological alterations in the lateral tibiofemoral compartment. In contrast, the higher increase in pressure following valgus overcorrection (with 9.5 ° tibial valgus) induced adaptive subchondral bone changes, reflected by an increased specific bone surface (BS/BV) in the subarticular spongiosa compared with unloading by <b>varisation.</b> Also, in the lateral menisci, a {{decrease in the number of}} cells in the red–red (peripheral) zone of the middle third was noted, however without structural changes (such as meniscal lesions). The lateral meniscus (Beaufils et al. 2006) is of specific importance, since the peak contact stress and maximum shear stress in the cartilage increased 200 % more after a lateral than a medial meniscectomy under axial femoral compressive loads (Pena et al. 2006). Altogether, these results show that for the clinical situation, opening wedge HTO is a safe surgical procedure for the lateral tibial osteochondral unit and the lateral meniscus.|$|E
40|$|This study {{reviewed}} the subjective, clinical and radiological outcome of 71 patients (84 feet) treated by scarf osteotomy for hallux valgus deformity at our institution from 1995 to 1998 {{with an average}} follow-up time of 22 months (range, 17 to 48 months). At the time of follow-up, 39 % of the patients were very satisfied, 50 % were satisfied and 11 % were not satisfied. The mean AOFAS score raised significantly from 43 points (14 - 68) preoperatively to 82 points (39 to 100) at follow-up (p &lt; 0. 001). The radiological angles including M 1 -M 2, M 1 -P 1, M 1 -M 5 and DMAA improved significantly (p &lt; 0. 001). Among the 16 complications recorded, seven (8 %) were minor and nine (11 %) required an additional procedure. The scarf osteotomy of the first metatarsal coupled with a lateral soft-tissue release and, in three-quarters of our cases, with a basal closing wedge <b>varisation</b> osteotomy of the first phalanx, resulted in overall high satisfaction rate as well as significant clinical and radiological improvements in our series. Nevertheless, the range of motion of the first MP joint remained low: 30 degrees to 74 degrees in 52 patients (62 %) and &lt; 30 degrees in four patients (5 %). Furthermore, the mobility of the first ray {{as well as the}} consequences of the procedure in the sagittal plane need to be assessed more accurately, and this may be achieved by incorporating measurement of the plantar pressures in the forefoot area into the global rating system...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Femoral {{osteotomy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely performed reconstructive operations in pediatric orthopedic surgery. Many implants for fixation have been used, but so far there is no literature about the application and outcome of the LCP 140 ° Pediatric Hip Plate for proximal femoral valgisation in children. METHODS: Data of patients with a valgisation of the proximal femur using the LCP 140 ° Pediatric Hip Plate between February 2011 and July 2012 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: We included 10 patients (11 hips) with a mean follow-up of 15. 3  ±  6. 3  months (range 5. 6 - 23  months). The mean age was 9. 6  ±  1. 2  years (range 7. 3 - 11. 8  years) with a mean hospital stay of 5. 2  ±  1. 7  days (range 3 - 9  days). Callus formation was observed in all cases at 6  weeks postoperative control and consolidation was shown after a mean time of 14. 1  ±  2. 3  weeks (range 12. 1 - 19. 1  weeks). There was no delayed union or any case of non-union in our series. The stability of the operative reduction including the corrected neck-shaft angle (mean 19 ° ±  7. 9 °; range 10. 5 °- 38. 5 °) was maintained during the follow-up period. No cases of recurrence (<b>varisation)</b> or complications requiring further treatment or revision were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the 140 ° LCP Pediatric Hip Plate was shown to be safe and applicable in the clinical setting with good results. We therefore consider this device to be valuable for the correction of pathologic varus conditions of the proximal femur in children...|$|E
40|$|Purpose <b>Varisation</b> distal femoral {{osteotomy}} is a well-described {{treatment for}} lateral compartment arthrosis in the young, active patient. This treatment may potentially alter {{the length of}} the lower limb. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the change in leg length following lateral opening wedge distal femoral osteotomy using a blade plate. Methods Between 1998 and 2011, 29 lateral opening wedge distal femoral osteotomies were performed for symptomatic genu valgum with signs of lateral compartment arthrosis or patello-femoral symptoms. The mean age was 44. 4 years (± 11. 3). Average follow-up was 80. 2 months (± 50. 6). Results The mean osteotomy opening was 8. 3 ° (± 2. 3). The femoro-tibial mechanical axis (mFTA) was improved significantly, from 187. 8 ° (± 3. 5) to 180. 4 ° (± 2. 6) postoperatively (p < 0. 001). The pre-operative leg length discrepancy was 0. 7 cm, compared to 0. 6 cm postoperatively, which was not significant (n. s.). There were five revisions to arthroplasty for disease progression at meantime of 166. 6 months post-operatively. The probability of survival at 60 months was 91. 4 % (95 % CI 74. 9 - 100 %) with end-point of revision to total knee arthroplasty and 87. 6 % (95 % CI 74. 1 - 100 %) of revision for complications. Conclusions Lateral opening wedge distal femoral osteotomy, performed for symptomatic genu valgum, has no effect on leg length. This technique allows good correction of the axis of the lower limb; however, the complication rate is not insignificant (14 %). Complications occurred mainly in post-traumatic cases and may be avoidable with attention to technique and optimum rehabilitation. The procedure should be reserved for young, active patients with significant symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tuberculosis (TB) of hip {{constitutes}} nearly 15 % of {{all cases}} of osteoarticular tuberculosis. We report a retrospective {{study carried out on}} 43 children with hip TB. Materials and Methods: Forty-three children of TB hip treated between 1971 and 2000 were analysed. Twenty-four children of the early series were treated with streptomycin (S), isoniazid (H) and PAS (Pa) for 18 months (3 HPaS, 15 HPa), while 19 children in the later series were treated with isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R) and ethambutol (E) or pyrazinamide (Z) for 12 months [(12 RHE(Z) ]. Five out of 18 children with radiologically normal appearing type hip TB were treated with chemotherapy alone and 38 children were subjected to surgery; simple synovectomy alone in 31 hips, joint debridement in six hips, and proximal femoral <b>varisation</b> osteotomy in one. After surgery hips were immobilized in cast for one to three months according to the severity of the disease and patients pain tolerance, and then were mobilized under leg traction in bed gradually till pain subsided completely. Results: TB of hip healed with minimum sequelae in all children. In 18 Type one hip TB, normal hip (synovial form) anatomy was maintained, and in 25 patients with advanced lesions some defect in the femoral head and acetabulum was noticed, though painless good hip motion was maintained. Excellent to good results were obtained in 31 children (73. 1 %), fair in eight (18. 6 %), and poor in four (9. 3 %). In four patients with poor results, there was some residual morphological defect in the hip. None developed ankylosis of hip. Conclusion: We achieved good outcome with minimum sequelae in this series. The management goal should be aimed not only to heal the disease but also to maintain a painless mobile hip and anatomical cephalocotyloid relationship until maturity, and retard the development of secondary osteoarthritis...|$|E
30|$|According to Reimers, nine hips were centred, 35 subluxated and 13 dislocated at {{the time}} of operation. For all nine centred hips (nine patients), dysplastic {{acetabular}} roof changes were documented. Six of these nine patients were walkers. The other three centred hips were operated in conjunction with a combined procedure of the contralateral hip which showed a subluxation or dislocation. In total, 57 pelvic osteotomies in combination with VDRO were performed. Seventeen patients (42.5  %) were treated with a bilateral pelvic and femoral osteotomy, and 23 patients (57.5  %) had a combined pelvic osteotomy and VDRO only on one side. Thirty-four Dega osteotomies were performed in hips with a more posterior instability. In four hips with a planned Dega osteotomy for posterior instability, the inner table of the ilium was perforated while levering down the acetabular roof, resulting in a more Pemberton type osteotomy. Altogether, 19 Pemberton osteotomies were performed: seven hips showed an isolated anterior and 12 hips a multi-directional instability. The mean pre-operative NSA was 152.3 ° (range 142 °– 160 °), as measured in standardised positioning on fluoroscopy intra-operatively. The average planned <b>varisation</b> was 16.9 ° (range 10 °– 30 °), resulting in an average planned post-operative NSA of 135.3 ° (range 126 °– 147 °). An average external rotation of 20.9 ° (range 5 °– 30 °) and shortening of 18.0  mm (range 0 – 35  mm) was executed. For osteotomy fixation, an AO blade plate was used in 38 hips (66.7  %) and an LCP paediatric hip plate in 19 hips (33.3  %). At the time of index surgery, additional soft-tissue release was performed in 13 hips (22.8  %): nine adductor tenotomies and in four hips, a release of the abductors (two patients with bilateral anterior hip dislocation).|$|E
40|$|ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE OF HIP FRACTURE FIXATION AND PREVENTION IN OLDAGE - PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES ASSESSING THE OSTEOPOROTICFEMORAL HEAD During {{the last}} decades, a {{tremendous}} increase in osteoporosis related hip fractures has been noticed. It {{is expected that}} this evolution will continue due to the expanding life expectancy and dueto the active aging of our population. From a clinical perspective, theconsequences of fragility hip fractures are devastating: they lead to ahigh morbidity and mortality and include a high risk for secondary fractures. From an economic perspective, they lead to an associated increasein health care related costs. These findings point to important gaps in our current knowledge and define major research priorities. First of all, there is the clinical requirement to implement integrated referral pathways that will improve secondary fracture prevention. While {{it is clear that}} surgeons play a pivotal role in managing fracture patients, few research initiatives attempted to optimize post-fracture osteoporosis management by a surgeon-driven team. Secondly, there is an urgent need for interventional research to develop strategies that enhance fixation stability in the osteoporotic proximal femur. Despite an evolution in the surgical techniques to treat fragility hip fractures, failures offixation do still occur. Cut-out {{is one of the most}} devastating complications and consists of a perforation of the cephalic implant through the femoral head followed by a secondary <b>varisation</b> of the femoral head. Besides surgeon related causes like incomplete fracture reduction and suboptimal implant positioning, it was found that cut-out is strongly related to the bone quality of the femoral head. The aim of the current doctoral research program was to address both priorities. In a first part (Chapter I and II), the development and the testing of an integrated secondary fracture prevention program was addressed. Ina second part (Chapter III, IV and V), the development and biomechanical testing of a new surgical technique to improve implant fixation in theosteoporotic femoral head was addressed. In chapter I, a review of the literature and meta-analysis was performed on the impact of care pathways for fragility hip fracture treatment on one-year mortality. There was a significant effect of care pathways on one-year mortality forthe seven included non-randomized controlled studies. None of the included studies reported recurrent fracture rate and only poor information about the administration of anti-osteoporotic medication could be found. Most of the studies focused on peri-operative interventions and were aimed at short-term results. In chapter II, a traumatologic-geriatric fracture prevention program was set up. This care pathway was developed in a close collaboration between surgeons and geriatricians and included three key interventions. Primarily, calcium and vitamin D was administered to all included patients. Secondly, the patients were referred to the Center for Metabolic Bone Diseases (CMBD) for the evaluation and the treatment of the underlying osteoporosis. Finally, information about the fracture prevention program was provided to the patient, her / his general practitioner and family. A retrospective study wasperformed to evaluate the process and outcome parameters. This study showed a clear impact on the process outcomes with a high uptake of calcium and vitamin D by the fracture patients, a high compliance with the referral to the CMBD and a sensibilisation of all included patients and health care professionals involved. Nevertheless, no impact of the program could be shown on the long-term mortality nor on the recurrent fracture rate. In the remaining chapters, three biomechanical studieson implant augmentation of the proximal femur were addressed. The principle of implant augmentation is based on an increase of the implant to bone interface by the addition of bone cement. In our studies this was done through the cannulated and perforated helical blades of the Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation. In chapter III, a first biomechanical evaluation of bone-cement augmented Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation blades was performed on a polyurethane foam model mimicking osteoporotic bone. The test results clearly showed a better performance ofthe augmented implants compared to the non augmented ones. Secondly, augmentation even had a bigger influence on constructs with suboptimal implant positioning. In chapter IV, the same biomechanical tests were performed on osteoporotic human cadaveric femoral heads. In this study, the augmented specimens performed biomechanically better than the non-augmented ones as well. Furthermore, the study showed that the effect of augmentation was reduced with increasing bone quality, suggesting that augmentation is primarily useful in the most osteoporotic bones. When performing the augmentation procedures, it became clear that a more heterogeneous cement distribution around the implant was achieved in cadaveric bones compared to the foam models. This last finding was further explored in chapter V. In this third biomechanical study, different localisations and amounts of bone cement around the implant were tested, again on a foam model mimicking osteoporotic bone. The testing results clearly showed that both the localisation and the amount of cement do have an influence on implant purchase. Furthermore, the study showed that any configuration and amount of bone-cement used, led to a biomechanical stability of the construct comparable to the stability of a non-augmented cadaveric benchmark which was set as a reference point. Finally, biomechanically more superior localisations of cement could be identified and were localised cranial to the blade and at the blade tip. To conclude, both clinical and biomechanical studies could prove their impact on osteoporotic hip fracture treatment. Concerning fracture prevention, the clinical study on the traumatologic-geriatric post-fracture program led to a sensibilisation of health care professionals and patients for this growing problem. However, larger studies with a longer follow-up are needed to evaluate the effect of the program on outcome parameters like long-term mortality and recurrent fracture rate. Concerning fracture fixation in osteoporotic femoral heads, the augmentation studies showed a clear benefit of cement augmentation on implant purchase. Due to these favourable results, the principle of implant augmentationopens a lot of opportunities for further research. In addition, the biomechanical studies are a perfect illustration of experimental research being brought to clinical practice, as the first clinical studies on implant augmentation of the osteoporotic femoral head are running. The promising results of both our clinical and biomechanical studies might ameliorate the outcomes of this frail patient population suffering from osteoporotic hip fractures. nrpages: 194 status: publishe...|$|E
