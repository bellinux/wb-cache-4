40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{prompted}} by observations of disparities between the observed fall-off in irradiance for off-axis points and {{that accounted for}} by the cosinefourth and <b>vignetting</b> <b>effects.</b> A closer examination of the image formation process for real lenses revealed that even an the absence of vignetting a point light source does not uniformly illuminate the aperture, an effect known as pupil aberration. For example, we found the variation for a 16 " lens to be as large as 31 % for a field angle of 10 ". In this paper, we critically evaluate the roles of cosine-fourth and <b>vignetting</b> <b>effects</b> and demonstrate the significance of the pupil aberration on the fall-off in irradiance away from image center. The pupil aberration effect strongly depends on the aperture size and shape and this dependence has been demonstrated through two sets of experiments with three real lenses. The effect of pupil aberration is thus a third important cause of fall in irradiance away from the image center in addition to the familiar cosine-fourth and <b>vignetting</b> <b>effects,</b> that {{must be taken into account}} in applications that rely heavily on photometric variation such as shape from shading and mosaicing. 1...|$|R
40|$|Images {{acquired}} using {{optical microscopes}} are inherently subject to <b>vignetting</b> <b>effects</b> due to imperfect illumination and image acquisition. However, such <b>vignetting</b> <b>effects</b> hamper accurate extraction of quantitative information from biological images, leading to less effective image segmentation and increased {{noise in the}} measurements. Here, we describe a rapid and effective method for vignetting correction, which generates an estimate for a correction function from the background fluorescence without the need to acquire additional calibration images. We validate the usefulness of this algorithm using artificially distorted images as a gold standard for assessing {{the accuracy of the}} applied correction and then demonstrate that this correction method enables the reliable detection of biologically relevant variation in cell populations. A simple user interface called FlattifY was developed and integrated into the image analysis platform YeastQuant to facilitate easy application of vignetting correction {{to a wide range of}} images...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{approach}} that significantly enhances the capabilities of traditional image mosaicking. The key observation is that as a camera moves, it senses each scene point multiple times. We rigidly attach to the camera an optical filter with spatially varying properties, so that multiple measurements are obtained for each scene point under different optical settings. Fusing the data captured in the multiple images yields an image mosaic that includes additional information about the scene. We refer to this approach as generalized mosaicing. In this paper we show that this approach can significantly extend the optical dynamic range of any given imaging system by exploiting <b>vignetting</b> <b>effects.</b> We derive the optimal vignetting configuration and implement it using an external filter with spatially varying transmittance. We also derive efficient scene sampling conditions as well as ways to self calibrate the <b>vignetting</b> <b>effects.</b> Maximum likelihood is used for image registration and fusion. In an experiment we mounted such a filter on a standard 8 -bit video camera, to obtain an image panorama with dynamic range comparable to imaging with a 16 -bit camera...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{agriculture}} cultures by aerial {{remote sensing}} present high potential of application. Despite of that potential, some problems {{still have been}} detected. One {{of them is the}} <b>vignetting</b> <b>effect.</b> This phenomenon introduces error in DN as far away as geometric image center the target is, according to the cos 4 Theta law. To study this effect it was adopted the procedure that computes Equation - Equação. If these values increase with the distances from images geometric center then the <b>vignetting</b> <b>effect</b> increases proportionally. The study was carried out analyzing the DN of white plate targets in aerial images in two dates 02 / 11 / 2001 and 11 / 04 / 2002. The white plate targets were distributed in the field and could be seen around the images geometric center, in different distances. In the aerial images the DN from the plates were extracted according to the cos 4 Theta law and compared to several distances in conformity to Equation - Equação. The results showed that the effect was observed in the first (02 / 11 / 2001) images, but not in later (11 / 04 / 2002) images. That difference {{can be explained by the}} different atmospheric haze and sensor-illumination source geometry. On the other hand when the experiment was performed at ground level the <b>vignetting</b> <b>effect</b> was identified. Therefore the effect exists and can be modeled...|$|E
40|$|The {{effective}} probe {{volume of}} laser diffraction particle sizing instruments depends on many instrument parameters.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{estimating}} the optical center of a camera given only a single image with vignetting.

For a given image pixel, the SCTG is the image gradient along the tangential direction of the circle centered at the currently estimated optical center and passing through the pixel. We show that for natural images with vignetting, the distribution of SCTGs is generally symmetric if the optical center is estimated accurately, but is skewed otherwise. By minimizing the asymmetry of the SCTG distribution with nonlinear optimization, our method is able to obtain reliable estimates of the optical center. Experiments on simulated and real vignetting images demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique. 1...|$|E
