40|$|Abstract. In key-insulated cryptography, {{there are}} many private keys with {{different}} indexes and a single, fixed public key. When the trust model includes multiple Certification Authorities (CAs), {{it can be used}} to shorten the <b>verification</b> <b>path</b> and mitigate the damage caused by the compromise of a CA’s private key. Existing work requires that the total number of CAs be fixed and that a trusted keystore store all private keys. This paper presents a hierarchical key-insulated signature scheme, called HKI, which converts existing key-insulated methods to a hierarchical scheme. Our scheme allows the system to repeatedly generate a new private key for a new CA and also provides two important features, namely a shortened <b>verification</b> <b>path</b> and mitigated damage. By basing our approach on a general key-insulated scheme, we have made it possible to take advantage of any future improvements in computation complexity, key length, or robustness in current key-insulated methods. ...|$|E

In this paper, {{we present}} a path {{sensitive}} type system for resource usage <b>verification.</b> <b>Path</b> sensitivity is essential to model resource usage in C programs correctly and accurately. So far, most of methods to analyze this kind of property in the path sensitive way have been proposed as whole program analyses or unsound analyses. Our main contributions are as follows. First, we formalize a sound analysis for path sensitive resource usage properties in C like languages. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, it is the first sound and modular analysis for this problem. We provide the complete proof for the soundness of the type system and algorithm. Second, our analysis is modular, and we provide an inference algorithm to generate function summaries automatically. We believe that our approach suggests new insights into the design of modular analyses. ...|$|E

Thus, we can extract efficiently verifiable nested certificate paths instead of classical certificate paths. NPKI is a dynamic system and involves several authorities in order to add a new user to the system. This uses the authorities' idle time {{to the benefit of}} the verifiers.

Proving that a false path is valid or not is a difficult problem because of the inherent computational cost, and because in practice false paths are not specified one full path at a time.

For instance the SDC format (Synopsys Design Constraint) specifies false path exceptions using a “–from –through –to ” syntax that applies on sets of pins, often using wildcards to denote these sets. This represents many (usually hundreds to thousands) actual full paths. This paper proposes a method to verify generalized false paths in a very efficient manner.
