Environmental burdens associated with these materials are analyzed in terms of embodied energy and environmental impacts {{that are relevant to}} Sri Lanka, such as global warming (GWP), acidification (ACP) and nutrient enrichment (NEP). Processes carried out in Sri Lanka and long distance sea transports are considered for the analyses. Economic analysis is based on market prices and affordability of materials. Social concerns that are taken into consideration are thermal comfort, good interior (aesthetics), ability to construct fast, strength and durability, and are analyzed based on the data collected through the questionnaires and also, interviews with the stakeholders of the buildings such as engineers, architects, contractors and users.

5000|$|Sultan's use of {{industrial}} materials {{in this way}} is striking and innovative, and Vivien Raynor has made this point in the New York Times stating that [...] "Donald Sultan is descended from the Process artists of the late 1960's in that he makes art out of materials that are {{very much a part of}} contemporary life. Yet even as his coeval, Julian Schnabel, has cornered plates as a medium, Sultan seems to have been the first to work in tar, combining it with spackle and latex on a ground consisting of <b>vinyl</b> <b>tiles</b> attached to Masonite." [...] It is through the use of these industrial materials, as well as through the deconstruction of his subjects into basic forms, that Sultan's paintings are enriching and elevating the still-life tradition. He is exploring the medium further through techniques of gouging, sanding, and buffing to create flatness, depth, gloss, and texture. The paintings are made of the same materials as the building in which the viewer stands; the architecture participates in the paintings. Weighty and structured, they are minimal and expressionist at the same time, while his images contradict their common association with fragility. [...] "Sultan pushes the boundaries of painting as he virtually sculpts the painting into pictures that are minimal but opulently rich," [...] notes columnist R. Couri Hay, a former editor of Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine in his 2011 profile of Sultan for the Hamptons Magazine. The process of making these painting, suggests the New York Times, is technically so complex and, consequently, so painstakingly slow, that finishing [...] "a single painting can take up to a month, so that Mr. Sultan's annual output is 12 to 18 paintings." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{external}} walls are orange face brick laid in English bond with projecting headers creating a repetitive pattern and texture-the {{lower part of}} the walls are without projecting bricks and are painted. Projecting bricks form large Christograms on the side walls of the tower - [...] "ihs" [...] on the east and [...] "xp" [...] on the west. The east and west walls of the body of the church are divided into six bays by full height recesses containing copper rainwater downpipes with detailed copper heads and straps. The bays each have a fixed, steel framed glazing to full height above a double-leaf, glazed, timber framed door. An architrave of projecting headers defines the openings. Beyond the southern-most bay the chancel is lit by fixed, steel framed glazing with deep reveals. The vestries project beneath these windows. The rear wall is windowless and has a field of projecting headers with a large central cross formed by projecting bricks. The vestry walls do not have projecting bricks and are rendered and painted.The church entrance is a simple, open, painted concrete portico. Above the portico the north elevation of the tower is treated to suggest an open bible with raised, white cement rendered letters two feet high on dark grey textured concrete pages reading:GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE.

40|$|Butyl benzyl {{phthalate}} (BBP), an aryl {{alkyl ester}} of 1, 2 -benzene dicarboxylic acid, is extensively used in <b>vinyl</b> <b>tiles</b> {{and as a}} plasticizer in PVC in many commonly used products. BBP, which readily leaches from these products, {{is one of the}} most important environmental contaminants, and the increased awareness of its adverse effects on human health has led to a dramatic increase in research aimed at removing BBP from the environment via bioremediation. This review highlights recent progress in the degradation of BBP by pure and mixed bacterial cultures, fungi, and in sludge, sediment, and wastewater. Sonochemical degradation, a unique abiotic remediation technique, and photocatalytic degradation are also discussed.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} the abatement process on homes in Portland, Oregon through the analysis of asbestos surveys conducted by The City of Portland. It evaluates the levels of hazardous materials that are left in homes after the abatement process which can be disbursed into the air and soil during demolition and thus create significant health hazards for demolition crews and surrounding residents. The research methods employed for this paper include the analysis of asbestos surveys on homes provided by The Rebuilding Center of Portland (The Rebuilding Center) to see what materials contained asbestos. The surveys were used to compile data on the number of homes deconstructed that were found to have additional asbestos after abatement. This data was examined for trends. The results show that 52 % of homes examined by The Rebuilding Center had additional asbestos found after abatement. This was commonly found in materials like flooring and <b>vinyl</b> <b>tiles</b> which can be hard to find during surveys if they are hidden underneath other materials such as carpet. Both material surveys and abatement procedures are required for all homes that are to be demolished in Portland, but many hazardous materials remain after this process, making demolition unsafe. This paper contends that deconstruction is a much safer alternative since no debris is created and hazardous materials can be disposed of properly when found. These findings contributed to new regulations in Portland, Oregon that require deconstruction rather than demolition for homes built before the year 1916...|$|E

40|$|Restoring all {{facility}} operations {{after the}} 2001 Amerithrax attacks took years to complete, highlighting {{the need to}} reduce remediation time. Some of the most time intensive tasks were environmental sampling and sample analyses. Composite sampling allows disparate samples to be combined, with only a single analysis needed, making it a promising method to reduce response times. We developed a statistical experimental design to test three different composite sampling methods: 1) single medium single pass composite (SM-SPC) : a single cellulose sponge samples multiple coupons with a single pass across each coupon; 2) single medium multi-pass composite: a single cellulose sponge samples multiple coupons with multiple passes across each coupon (SM-MPC); and 3) multi-medium post-sample composite (MM-MPC) : a single cellulose sponge samples a single surface, and then multiple sponges are combined during sample extraction. Five spore concentrations of Bacillus atrophaeus Nakamura spores were tested; concentrations ranged from 5 to 100 CFU/coupon (0. 00775 to 0. 155 CFU/cm 2). Study variables included four clean surface materials (stainless steel, <b>vinyl</b> <b>tile,</b> ceramic tile, and painted dry wallboard) and three grime coated/dirty materials (stainless steel, <b>vinyl</b> <b>tile,</b> and ceramic tile). Analysis of variance for the clean study showed two significant factors: composite method (p< 0. 0001) and coupon material (p = 0. 0006). Recovery efficiency (RE) was higher overall using the MM-MPC method compared to the SM-SPC and SM-MPC methods. RE with the MM-MPC method for concentrations tested (10 to 100 CFU/coupon) was similar for ceramic tile, dry wall, and stainless steel for clean materials. RE was lowest for <b>vinyl</b> <b>tile</b> with both composite methods. Statistical tests for the dirty study showed RE was significantly higher for vinyl and stainless steel materials, but lower for ceramic tile. These results suggest post-sample compositing {{can be used to}} reduce sample analysis time when responding to a Bacillus anthracis contamination event of clean or dirty surfaces...|$|R
