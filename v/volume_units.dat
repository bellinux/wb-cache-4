A volume of liquid that was approximately that of an apothecaries' ounce of water was called a fluid ounce, and was divided into fluid drachms and sometimes also fluid scruples.

5|$|The apothecaries' {{system or}} apothecaries' weights and {{measures}} is a historical system of mass and <b>volume</b> <b>units</b> that were used by physicians and apothecaries for medical recipes, and also sometimes by scientists. The English version {{of the system is}} closely related to the English troy system of weights, the pound and grain being exactly the same in both. It divides a pound into 12 ounces, an ounce into 8 drachms, and a drachm into 3 scruples or 60 grains. This exact form of the system was used in the United Kingdom; in some of its former colonies it survived well into the 20th century. The apothecaries' system of measures is a similar system of <b>volume</b> <b>units</b> based on the fluid ounce.
