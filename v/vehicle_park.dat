5|$|At night, Reshef {{moved with}} his {{remaining}} forces {{north along the}} canal bank. Bypassing the 16th Brigade's positions, the Israelis soon found themselves {{in the center of}} a huge administrative area and <b>vehicle</b> <b>park.</b> Reshef's brigade had stumbled into the command and supply bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. The base was located near the canal on the assumption that it was the safest location from Israeli attacks, which was expected to come from the east, where the defenses were the strongest, not from the south, where they were the weakest. Both sides immediately opened fire, inadvertently leading to the destruction of supply trucks and SAM launchers. The Egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of the 21st Division; a battalion of the 14th Brigade and a battalion (less one company) of the 18th Brigade. The tanks repelled the Israelis, who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming opposing forces.|$|E

25|$|From January 1945, it {{fought in}} the Vistula–Oder Offensive. In February, the 32nd Artillery Regiment was {{equipped}} with twenty 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3) and twelve 122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30), practically full strength by the 1942–1943 tables of equipment and organization, but the regiment's <b>vehicle</b> <b>park</b> was very diverse, incorporating 29 Lend-Lease Studebaker US6 2½-ton 6x6 trucks, a 1½-ton Lend-Lease Chevrolet G506 truck, five Soviet-made trucks, four captured German trucks, and six Soviet tractors. Towards {{the end of the}} war, despite a chronic shortage of riflemen, the division's artillery remained at full strength. The division {{fought in the}} Berlin Offensive in April. From 6 to 11 May, the 31st fought in the Prague Offensive, during which the army advanced south into Czechoslovakia from Bunzlau, reaching the Labe River northeast of Prague {{by the end of the}} operation.

500|$|Bledsoe's Beach, {{located on}} Lake James near its {{intersection}} with Jimmerson Lake, became a popular nightspot during the 20th century. The resort eventually included a dance hall, a cocktail lounge, a hotel, a pier and swimming area, a golf course, and a recreational <b>vehicle</b> <b>park.</b> [...] Beginning in the 1960s, Bledsoe's Beach {{was also the}} summer home of the Hoosier Basketball Camp, which was originally directed by Indiana University basketball coach Branch McCracken. In 1938 advertisements for Bledsoe's Beach proclaimed [...] "dancing every Saturday Night". [...] Ten years later, advertisements were proclaiming dancing every night except Monday. [...] During the early 1960s, Bledsoe's Beach was described as [...] "the Midwest's Favorite Fun Spot", with live music and record hops featuring disc jockeys from radio station WOWO, {{one of the most}} powerful radio stations in the Midwest. [...] In 2011 the property was sold at auction. [...] A restaurant opened on the site in 2013 with lake views and dock space for customers arriving by boat.|$|E
500|$|The {{services}} are in Northamptonshire, England {{close to the}} village of Watford about [...] to the south east of Rugby and about [...] to the north west of London. They are situated between junctions 16 and 17 of the M1 with a single site for each direction on the motorway linked by a footbridge. The name comes from the nearby Watford Gap, the narrowest and lowest point in the limestone ridge that crosses England diagonally from the Cotswolds to Lincoln Edge. [...] In Roman Britain, Iter II, later named Watling Street, crossed the gap; Thomas Telford considered the route unsuitable for coach traffic due to the presence of quicksand. Today, this is reflected in the modern road network by the A5 suddenly turning left towards Kilsby near the services. Similarly, the Grand Union Canal (which runs immediately behind the northbound <b>vehicle</b> <b>park)</b> avoided the gap by the Crick Tunnel. Consequently, the Roman Road at Watford Gap was largely untouched by previous engineering works when the M1 was constructed, and the engineers were able to build over it.|$|E

2500|$|Auxiliary Field 4 {{is named}} Peel Field for 2nd Lt. Garland O. Peel Jr., {{who died in}} the {{take-off}} crash of a Martin B-12AM of the 387th School Squadron, 2 January 1942, when he suffered engine failure. He was a gunnery school instructor at Eglin. Peel Field was utilized for the filming of scenes for the 1944 film Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. [...] Wartime temporary housing for NCOs located here was razed in the 1960s. In the early 1960s, while in a moribund state, one of the runways was used as an unofficial auto drag strip by local civilians. The ramp of the non-flight-rated facility now serves as a <b>vehicle</b> <b>park</b> for aircraft and armor after being expended as targets on the Eglin ranges.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the site}} was {{originally}} used as a military training ground, the fields belonging to Brands Farm were first used as a circuit {{by a group of}} Gravesend cyclists led by Ron Argent, with the permission of the local farmer and landowner, Harry White. Using the natural contours of the land, many cyclists from around London practised, raced and ran time trials on the dirt roads carved out by farm machinery. The first actual race on the circuit was held in 1926, over [...] between cyclists and cross-country runners. Within a few years, motorcyclists were using the circuit, laying out a three-quarter-mile anti-clockwise track in the valley. They also saw the advantage of competing in a natural arena just a few hundred yards from the A20, and with the passage of time, a kidney-shaped circuit came into use. The first motorcycle races were [...] "very informal" [...] with much of the organisation being done on the spot. Initially the racing was on a straight strip approximately where Cooper Straight came to be when the track was tarmacked. Brands Hatch remained in operation during the 1930s, but after being used as a military <b>vehicle</b> <b>park</b> and being subject to many bombing raids during World War II, it needed much work before it could become a professional racing circuit.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the command}} of Lieutenant-Colonel Bruce Harvey, the 225th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, landing with the brigade were to {{establish}} their Main Dressing Station (MDS) at Le Bas de Ranville. Leaving England at 23:45 5 June, the aircraft carrying the field ambulance troops crossed the French coast at from 01:00 the unit started landing in Normandy. Unlike other units involved that night by 02:30 most of the unit had arrived at their rendezvous, which was under German mortar fire. Following {{at the rear of}} the 12th (Yorkshire) Parachute Battalion, they arrived at Le Bas de Ranville. The MDS was established in a Chateau called Chateau de Guernon-Ranville by 04:00 and within half an hour the first of the brigades casualties arrived. During the morning the RACS, commander captured a German supply vehicle and located a <b>vehicle</b> <b>park,</b> which was used to supplement the unit jeeps in bringing in casualties. [...] The fluid situation on the battlefield prevented some casualties from being evacuated to the MDS, and they were treated where they were by the units medics, until it was safe to move them. During the day the field ambulance was under almost constant, sniper and artillery fire, but by 21:00 contact was made with the 3rd Infantry Division, and within an hour sixty casualties were evacuated to the beachhead. Another 280 remaining wounded were being treated at the MDS. [...] Fighting in the area continued through the night and by 05:00 7 June 380 wounded had been dealt with at the MDS. In the first forty hours of the landings, the unit's surgeons had performed forty-three operations.|$|E
