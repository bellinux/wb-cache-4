The concert took place in Milan and was released on DVD in 2006. <b>Video</b> <b>projections</b> during live concerts combine images that were produced before, such as video clips and still photography, with shots from the stage showing the real time stage performance and the audience.

25|$|In 1992, Reynolds and {{her husband}} Richard Hamlett bought the Paddlewheel Hotel & Casino at auction for $2.2 million. The {{purchase}} was made in anticipation of spending $15 million on renovations, which included plans for establishing {{a home for the}} Hollywood Motion Picture Museum. The Paddlewheel Hotel & Casino reopened in 1993, renamed The Debbie Reynolds Hotel & Casino. In 1994, Fisher designed the hotel and casino's 500-seat showroom, where Reynolds performed her nightclub act, songs from her career of over 50 years in the entertainment industry. The showroom also serves as a complete television production studio. In addition to the showroom, Fisher also conceived and designed the Hollywood Motion Picture Museum. When Reynolds struggled with the financing to complete the project, she decided to take the company public in order to raise funds. When the museum celebrated its opening the following year, {{it was one of the}} first sites in the United States to exhibit high-definition <b>video</b> <b>projection.</b>|$|E

25|$|Psychic TV {{made its}} debut in 1982 at an event {{organised}} by P-Orridge, David Dawson, and Roger Ely, called The Final Academy. It was a 4-day multimedia celebratory rally held in Manchester and at the Ritzy Cinema in Brixton, South London. It brought performers and audience together with literature, performance, film and music. PTV, Cabaret Voltaire, 23 Skidoo, Z'EV, John Giorno, William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Terry Wilson, Jeff Nuttall, and The Last Few Days participated to honour the cut-up techniques and theories of William S. Burroughs, Ian Sommerville, Antony Balch and Gysin. <b>Video</b> <b>projection</b> and early sampling were used here, as well as whispered utterances by P-Orridge reprocessed as a soundtrack to Gysin's Dreammachine by the Hafler Trio. In the mid-eighties, Psychic TV aimed to release a live album on the 23rd of each month for 23 months {{in recognition of the}} 23 enigma. The group didn't reach its goal but still managed fourteen albums in eighteen months, thus earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. Following the culmination of Psychic TV but before embarking on Thee Majesty, P-Orridge and several Psychic TV musicians formed Splinter Test, a name adopted from one of P-Orridge's essays on sampling.|$|E

500|$|The film {{contains}} {{live performances}} of twenty one songs {{along with a}} new song, [...] "God Made You Beautiful", written by Australian singer-songwriter Sia Furler. Several short excerpts of the performances found on the concert film are also featured in Life Is But a Dream itself. The film opens with Beyoncé appearing {{in front of a}} large screen with her silhouette being seen. As the music of [...] "End of Time" [...] starts, she performs a choreography with her female dancers and French duo Les Twins on stage further singing the song's lyrics. [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] follows with a similarly choreographed performance and for the third song [...] "Baby Boy", the singer dances with her background dancers in front of a holographic background performing a Dutty Wine dance at the end. [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Diva" [...] are featured as the fourth and fifth song respectively. [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] is preceded by a <b>video</b> <b>projection</b> with a voice-over by Beyoncé talking about female sexuality.

500|$|The stage used {{multimedia}} projection {{and technology}} conceived by Moment Factory and Cirque du Soleil. After Madonna's entrance, {{the ground and}} stage floor revealed animated Vogue magazine covers featuring the singer. The effect was achieved by projection mapping, which turns an object (often irregularly-shaped) into a surface for <b>video</b> <b>projection.</b> Although projection mapping {{had been used to}} introduce the Nokia Lumia and project images of NBA players on the Hudson River in 2011, it had never been used on such a large scale. Moment Factory partner and executive producer Eric Fournier said that since the studio had been associated with technology-dependent shows, preparing for and accommodating the requirements of the Super Bowl were easy. When Moment Factory began the halftime-show preparations, Madonna's team had already selected the songs, and the studio developed visual effects complementing the songs' choreography. According to Moment Factory creative director Sakchin Bessette, using video projections was the most efficient method for the visual effects, as this required moving less equipment to the field than other methods. Fournier said, [...] "It all came from the decision at the beginning to make a show out of it, not just a performance. Madonna's a perfectionist, and she wanted to do something extraordinary, so that was the objective of everybody." ...|$|E

The show continued with another video interlude featuring a spoof of paranormal-themed shows, [...] "The Onyx Zone", with the master of ceremonies doing a Rod Serling impression and introducing [...] "The Shadow Room". Spears reappeared sitting on a swing to perform [...] "Shadow". During the performance, Spears was lifted into the air above an M-shaped blue ribbon, with performers twirling in the fabric. The performance ended with Spears leaving the stage while the dancers performed to a ballet interlude in flesh colored costumes. The next section began with a <b>video</b> <b>projection</b> of two guards watching Spears in her room through security cameras. Spears appeared on a smaller stage wearing a white robe and performed [...] "Touch of My Hand" [...] in a transparent bathtub. During the performance, she took the robe off to reveal a nude body suit with crystals that resembled her [...] "Toxic" [...] music video outfit. She left the stage briefly to a wardrobe change and reappeared on the mini platform where she descended to the main stage on a pole, wearing pink lingerie and performed [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] on a bed {{with one of her}} male dancers.

She took the stage again in a barge (wearing a black, silver, and gray rock star style jacket and green pants) along with four female dancers to perform [...] "I Love Rock 'n' Roll". The barge was lifted by wires, but pyrotechnics below it made it seem as if it was lifted by fire. When it was above the B-stage, Spears jumped to it with bungee cords. There was a skit in which her dancers chased her, before Spears loses the rock star jacket revealing a glittery red and purple halter top for a performance of [...] "What It's Like To Be Me" [...] in the small stage.

[...] "Love on Top" [...] and an abbreviated version of Destiny's Child's [...] "Survivor" [...] followed; Beyoncé dedicated the latter song {{to the members of the}} aforementioned girl group, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. Beyoncé was taken back to the main stage being transferred with the same wire. [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] was the first song performed on the main stage with a new brassy arrangement, different from Beyoncé's other live performances of the song. During [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", she integrated a snippet from the song [...] "Movin' on Up". Images of pyramids, animated lions and elephants and a portrait of the singer wearing a Nefertiti-style crown were displayed on the screen before the performance of [...] "Grown Woman", keeping in line with the song's African influence. During the performance, the singer and her dancers wore African-inspired costumes. A montage was shown with the song [...] "I Was Here" [...] being played in the background showing footage of the singer with Barack Obama, taking part in charity work, during a vacation with Jay-Z and excerpts of her 2013 performance at the Super Bowl.
