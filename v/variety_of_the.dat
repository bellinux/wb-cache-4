5|$|As few Susan B. Anthony dollars circulated, many remain {{available}} in uncirculated condition and are worth little above face value.

5|$|During {{the early}} part of the 18thcentury, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting.

Because of this influence, the red and white <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919. This high-yielding variety is resistant to fiji and mosaic viruses, and produces more sucrose than other varieties. Its derivatives significantly increased sugar cane production in the Philippines. Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and swine breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (a hybrid of the Hereford, Nellore and native cattle), Berkjala (a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Berkshire and local Jala-Jala pig, resistant to hog cholera) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.|$|E

5|$|The Danube {{crested newt}} was {{described}} as a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern crested newt (Triturus cristatus) by C. Kiritzescu in 1903. Later, it was considered a subspecies until genetic analysis supported its recognition as a separate species in the crested newt species complex.

5|$|In 1858, the Mint {{tried to}} {{alleviate}} the breakage problem using {{a new version of}} the cent with a shallower relief.

The two varieties are about equally common, and were probably struck side by side for some period as the Mint used up older dies. Efforts to conserve dies were the probable cause of another variety, the 1858/7, as 1857-dated dies were overstruck to allow them to be used in the new year.|$|E

5|$|In the 1913 season, Kilner scored 1,586 runs at {{an average}} of 34.47, which {{remained}} his highest seasonal aggregate of runs and placed him third in the Yorkshire batting averages. He also took 18 wickets at 25.22. At the end of May and beginning of June, Kilner took part in century partnerships in four consecutive matches, culminating in his maiden first-class century against Leicestershire. During his innings of 104, he hit 18 fours and shared a partnership of 184 in under two hours with his close friend Major Booth, rescuing Yorkshire from 58 for five and taking the score to 300. Throughout the season, he played several valuable innings when Yorkshire were under pressure. His batting was always adventurous and attacking although he often made uncertain starts to his innings and showed impatience. The strength and <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yorkshire bowling attack meant his left-arm spin was not often required. Even so, Yorkshire dropped to second in the Championship.|$|E
5|$|Khubeza, a local <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mallow plant, {{became an}} {{important}} food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food could not reach the city, Jerusalemites {{went out to the}} fields to pick khubeza leaves, which are high in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day. Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants.|$|E
5|$|Legends {{of female}} vampire-like beings who can detach {{parts of their}} upper body occur in the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia. There are two main vampire-like creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog Mandurugo ("blood-sucker") and the Visayan manananggal ("self-segmenter"). The mandurugo is a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aswang that {{takes the form of}} an {{attractive}} girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, thread-like tongue by night. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck fetuses off pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the heart and the liver) and the phlegm of sick people. The manananggal is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat-like wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim.|$|E

5|$|Major General Charles Richard Fox {{proposed}} {{during the}} exhibition that a bronze cast {{should be made}} of the statue to serve as a memorial to the exhibition, marking one end of the site of the Crystal Palace with a statue of Prince Albert at the other end. A campaign got underway two years later, in May 1853, with a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great and the good signing a brochure promoting a scheme to erect the statue somewhere in London. Its supporters included the Duke of Sutherland, Lord Lansdowne, the Earl of Shaftesbury, the sculptor John Henry Foley, the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, the ceramic manufacturer William Taylor Copeland and the Conservative MP (and future Prime Minister) Benjamin Disraeli. The Times was strongly in favour of the project due to the influence of its foreign affairs reporter Henry Reeve, who had known Marochetti since as early as 1839. The Royal Family also {{let it be known that}} they were supporters, with Queen Victoria donating £200 and Prince Albert £100.|$|E
5|$|Since 1788, English {{has been}} spoken in Oceania, and Australian English has {{developed}} as a first language {{of the vast majority}} of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, its standard accent being General Australian. The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language. Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African English and the English of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely to British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in the government is rather than are). New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E

5|$|The Sanskrit name of Tulsidas can be transliterated in two ways. Using the {{original}} Sanskrit, {{the name is}} written as Tulasīdāsa. Using the Hunterian transliteration system, it is written as Tulsidas or Tulsīdās reflecting the vernacular pronunciation (since the written Indian languages maintain the vestigial letters that are no longer pronounced). The lost vowels are {{an aspect of the}} Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages and can vary between regions. The name is a compound of two Sanskrit words: Tulasī, which is an Indian <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basil plant considered auspicious by Vaishnavas (devotees of god Vishnu and his avatars like Rama), and Dāsa, which means slave or servant and by extension, devotee. Tulsidas, which means a servant of the plant Tulsi.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecosystem}} of Dal is ecologically rich in macrophytes, submerged macrophytes, floating macrophytes and phytoplankton. Macrophyte flora {{recorded in}} the lake's aquatic and marshland environment consists of 117 species, belonging to 69 genera and 42 families. The lake is noted in particular for its Nelumbo nucifera (lotus flowers) which bloom in July and August. The prolific growth of Ceratophyllum demersum in the eutrophic zones has been reported, with Myriophyllum spicatum and Potemogetton lucens cited as dominant species. Other macrophytes discerned in different zones of the lake include Typho angustata, Phragmites australis, Myriophyllum, Sparganium evectum and Myriophyllum verticillatum, which contribute {{to the production of}} macrophites. The rooted <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floating leaf type consists of Neelambium nucifera, Nymphaea alba, N.Tertagonia, N.Candida, Nymphoides peltatum, Salvinia natans, Hydrocharis dubia, Nymphaea sp. and Potamogeton natans, all of which occupy 29.2% of the lake. Phytoplanktons include Navicula radiosa, Nitzschia accicularis, Fragilaria crotonensis, Diatoma elongatum, Scenedesmus bijuga, Pediastrum duplex, Tetraedron minimum, Microcystis aeruginosa and Merismopedia elegans.|$|E
5|$|The main {{language}} of Strathclyde {{and elsewhere in}} the Hen Ogledd in the opening years of the High Middle Ages was Cumbric, a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British language akin to Old Welsh. Some time after 1018 and before 1054, the kingdom appears to have been conquered by the Scots, most probably during the reign of Máel Coluim mac Cináeda who died in 1034. At this time the territory of Strathclyde extended as far south as the River Derwent. In 1054, the English king Edward the Confessor dispatched Earl Siward of Northumbria against the Scots, then ruled by Mac Beth. By the 1070s, if not earlier in the reign of Máel Coluim mac Donnchada, it appears that the Scots again controlled Strathclyde, although William Rufus annexed the southern portion in 1092. The territory was granted by Alexander I to his brother David, later King David I, in 1107.|$|E
