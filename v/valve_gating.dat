40|$|Secondary lymphatic valves are {{essential}} for minimizing backflow of lymph and are presumed to gate passively according to the instantaneous trans-valve pressure gradient. We hypothesized that <b>valve</b> <b>gating</b> is also modulated by vessel distention, which could alter leaflet stiffness and coaptation. To test this hypothesis, we devised protocols to measure the small pressure gradients required to open or close lymphatic valves and determine if the gradients varied {{as a function of}} vessel diameter. Lymphatic vessels were isolated from rat mesentery, cannulated, and pressurized using a servo-control system. Detection of valve leaflet position simultaneously with diameter and intraluminal pressure changes in two-valve segments revealed the detailed temporal relationships between these parameters during the lymphatic contraction cycle. The timing of valve movements was similar to that of cardiac valves, but only when lymphatic vessel afterload was elevated. The pressure gradients required to open or close a valve were determined in one-valve segments during slow, ramp-wise pressure elevation, either from the input or output side of the valve. Tests were conducted over a wide range of baseline pressures (and thus diameters) in passive vessels as well as in vessels with two levels of imposed tone. Surprisingly, the pressure gradient required for valve closure varied > 20 -fold (0. 1 – 2. 2 cmH 2 O) as a passive vessel progressively distended. Similarly, the pressure gradient required for valve opening varied sixfold with vessel distention. Finally, our functional evidence supports the concept that lymphatic muscle tone exerts an indirect effect on <b>valve</b> <b>gating...</b>|$|E

The objective of this project is to study the effect of ball <b>valve,</b> brass <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> and brass stop cock valve to flow rate using AE technique. A test rig consists of the circumferential galvanized steel pipe, ball <b>valve,</b> <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> and stop cock valve to run the experiments. The fluid used was water throughout the experiments. The pressure of water was controlled by a valve. The source of AE signal was from the valve and it was captured using AE sensor {{with the help of}} Acoustic Emission Detector 2. 1. 3 software. For all valve conditions, the value of hits, count and RMS (average, maximum and minimum) were recorded and analyzed. All the value recorded were compared among the ball <b>valve,</b> <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> and stop cock valve. The results were gained from 10 marked points each for all type of valve. The result showed that there was no AE activity on the pipe without valve, the AE activities are greater for high pressure or full close valve. In addition from the RMS against distance graft, RMS value increased when pressure is increased. From the flow rate against RMS graf show that flow rate will decrease when RMS is increased...|$|R

It is a deemed to be {{an important part of the}} debate on climate change because they represent a significant portion of greenhouse gas emission.

This paper presented a study which focusing on fugitive emission by valve, which will be solved using GAMS to optimize the selection of valve and achieve the objective.

5000|$|A <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> {{also known}} as a sluice valve, is a valve which opens by lifting a round or {{rectangular}} gate/wedge out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar, so <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are often used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. The gate faces can be parallel, but are most commonly wedge-shaped. <b>Gate</b> <b>valves</b> are primarily used to permit or prevent the flow of liquids, but typical <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> shouldn't be used for regulating flow, unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Because of their ability to cut through liquids, <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are often used in the petroleum industry. For extremely thick fluids, a specialty valve often known as a knife <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is used to cut through the liquid. [...] On opening the <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> the flow path is enlarged in a highly nonlinear manner with respect to percent of opening. This means that flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Also, a partially open gate tends to vibrate from the fluid flow. Most of the flow change occurs near shutoff with a relatively high fluid velocity causing gate and seat wear and eventual leakage if used to regulate flow. Typical <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are designed to be fully opened or closed. [...] When fully open, the typical <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low friction loss.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Injection pressure, an {{important}} factor in filling process, should be minimized to enhance injection molding quality. Injection pressure can be controlled by <b>valve</b> <b>gate</b> open timing. In this work, we decided the <b>valve</b> <b>gate</b> open timing to minimize the injection pressure. To solve this design problem, we integrated MAPS- 3 D (Mold Analysis and Plastic Solution- 3 Dimension), a commercial injection molding CAE tool, to PIAnO (Process Integration, Automation and Optimization), a commercial PIDO (Process Integration, and Design Optimization) tool using the file parsing method. In order to reduce computational cost, we performed an approximate optimization using meta-models that replaced expensive computer simulations. At first, we carried out DOE (Design of Experiments) using OLHD (Optimal Latin Hypercube Design) available in PIAnO. Then, we built Kriging models using the simulation results at the sampling points. Finally, we used micro GA (Genetic Algorithm) available in PIAnO. Using the proposed design approach, the injection pressure has been reduced by 13. 7 % compared to the initial one. This design result clearly shows the validity of the proposed design approach...|$|R

40|$|The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, {{is funding}} the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in {{performing}} research investigating {{the performance of}} <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> subjected to pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. Pressure locking and thermal binding are phenomena that make a closed <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> difficult to open. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause {{the pressure of the}} fluid in the bonnet (and, in most <b>gate</b> <b>valves,</b> between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the disc assembly. Thermal binding can occur when thermal expansion/contraction effects cause the disc to be squeezed between the valve body seats. If the loads associated with pressure locking or thermal binding are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The authors tested a flexible-wedge <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> and a double-disc <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> under pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. The results show that these valves are susceptible to pressure locking; however, they are not significantly affected by thermal binding. For the flexible-wedge <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> pressure locking loads (in terms of stem thrust) were higher than corresponding hydrostatic opening loads by a factor of 1. 1 to 1. 5. For the parallel disc <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> pressure locking loads were higher by a factor of 2. 05 to 2. 4.
