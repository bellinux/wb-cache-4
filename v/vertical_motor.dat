We aimed to analyze whether changes in cerebellar NF-κB pathway in hypertension associated with metabolic syndrome (MS) may affect locomotor activity of MS rats. Furthermore, the age-dependent changes were inves-tigated as well. Male Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY, 9 weeks old), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 9 weeks old), and rats with MS aged 9 and 12 weeks were analyzed. Blood pressure was measure by tail-cuff plethysmography. Locomotor activity was tested by the open field method. Protein expression of NF-κB (p 65 subunit), inducible NOS (iNOS) and NOS activity were determined in the cerebellum. In SHR, despite no changes in NOS activity, increased NF-κB (p 65) expression was associ-ated with increased of both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>motor</b> activities. Similarly, in young MS rats, increased NF-κB (p 65) expression led to increased horizontal motor activity despite decreased NOS activity.

40|$|LectureVertical motor/pump {{systems that}} run {{close to the}} motor reed {{frequency}} may experience significantly high vibration levels, which can damage the motor {{as well as the}} entire pump system. These damages can result in costly repairs of the motor/pump, therefore accurate prediction of motor reed frequency will enable a more cost- and performance-effective pump base design and will extend system life. A recent trend has shown that end users are requesting more accurate prediction of motor reed frequency (+/- 10 %), enabling better pump base design with less potential for base rework. This study describes the utilization of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) as a tool in the prediction of <b>vertical</b> <b>motor</b> reed frequency and its correlation with extensive bump test results. Preliminary analysis first identified parameters that affect motor reed frequency. It was then followed by sensitivity studies, which further examined the impact of each parameter. One of the critical parameters is the stator core modulus. Because of its laminated structure, the core modulus is not uniform, which has a significant effect on motor reed frequency. The critical parameters were calibrated against existing test data using design of experiments. Lastly, they were used to verify future motor performance.

CGS 21680 dose-dependently (0. 1 - 2. 5 mg/kg i. p.) decreased horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>motor</b> activities. The depressant effect of CGS 21680 (0. 5 mg/kg i. p.) was maintained in mice pretreated by the adenosine receptor antagonist 8 -(p-sulfophenyl) -theophylline (10 - 30 mg/kg i. p.), which poorly penetrates the blood-brain barrier, but was completely lost in adenosine A(2 A) receptor knockout mice. Thus, the adenosine A(2 A) receptor is critically involved in motor activity. SCH 58261 (1 - 10 mg/kg i. p.) increased locomotion and rearing {{with a quick}} onset, but for a shorter period in mice habituated to the environment than in mice unfamiliar to it. ZM 241385 (7. 5 - 60 mg/kg i. p.) stimulated horizontal and vertical activities with a slow onset at the two highest tested doses, similarly in naive and in habituated mice. The increase in locomotion elicited by ZM 241385 (15 - 30 mg/kg i. p. and 10 - 20 nM i. c. v.) was retained in mice treated by CGS 21680 (0. 5 mg/kg i. p.) but that elicited by SCH 58261 (1 - 3 - 10 mg/kg i. p. and 10 - 20 nM i. c. v.) partially subsided. In conclusion, both 'striatal-like'/'SCH 58261 -sensitive' adenosine A(2 A) receptors and 'ZM 241385 -sensitive'/'atypical' CGS 21680 binding sites may mediate CGS 21680 -induced motor effects. Moreover, our results suggest that 'atypical' CGS 21680 binding sites could be adenosine A(2 A) receptors with a peculiar pharmacological profile.

40|$|In {{the general}} {{introductory}} {{part of this}} thesis (Chapters and 2) a review of some pertinent literature related to sleep-waking states and opioid peptides is offered. A global view of the neurochemical mechanisms and theories of functions of sleep, {{as well as the}} physiological and possible clinical consequences of total or selective REM sleep deprivation is given in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, which is concerned with the role of endogenous opioid peptides, particular attention is paid to the possible modulatory role of endogenously released opioid peptides in the regulation of some behavioural states in physiological and pathological conditions. It is generally known that exogenously administered opiates and opioid peptides can alter sleep pattern and decrease REM sleep. A possible interaction between sleep-waking states and endogenous opioid system is suggested by the report that the episodic release of plasma humoral endorphins during sleep is associated with the REM sleep phase (Chapter 1, section 1. 1. 7). In addition, the concentrations of opioid peptides in some brain nuclei of the rat which are known to be important in sleep-waking regulation, are highest in the dark (active) phase, during which wakefulness is high and lowest in the light (rest) phase, when the propensity to sleep is at its highest (Chapter section 1. 3. 2). Thus in order to clarify the effect of endogenously released opioid peptides in the regulation of sleep-waking pattern, we studied the effects of phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of enkephalinase A on sleep-waking states (Chapter 3). Several clinical studies suggest that the sleep-waking cycle may modulate the occurence of some types of epileptic phenomena in human subjects (Chapter 1, section 1. 5. 2, iii). In addition, some studies indicate a similarity between enkephalin induced epileptic Therefore, phenomena and we studied petit the mal epilepsy effects of (Chapter 4 discussion). different sleep stages on enkephalin-induced epileptic phenomena using electrophysiological parameters (Chapter 4). These initial studies (Chapters 3 and 4) suggested an interaction between sleep-waking states and endogenous opioid system. The observation that REM sleep deprivation (REMSD) reduced the pain threshold to noxious electrical stimulation (Chapter 1 section 1. 5. 2 d i) was an indication of the importance of REM sleep in the regulation of nociception. Therefore in Chapters 5 and 6, the experiments were designed to explore a direct effect of REMSD on the analgesic effects of morphine, an enkephalinase inhibitor phosphoramdion and cold-water-swim. The profound antagonistic effect of REMSD on opiate/opioid peptide induced analgesia stimulated further interest to investigate the relationship between REMSD and other opiate/opioid peptide modulated behavioural phenomena. Therefore the following opioid modulated behaviours were investigated: akinetic-cataleptic syndrome, spontaneous <b>vertical</b> <b>motor</b> activity, convulsions, (Chapters 7 - 9). (Chapter 10) grooming, wet-dog-shakes and morphine withdrawal symptoms Additional experiments with nitrous oxide were performed since it is known that this anaesthetic agent can stimulate the release of endogenous enkephalins and induce opiate-like withdrawal symptoms (Chapter 2, section 2. 5. 2, iv). Finally, the possible clinical consequences of our findings are described in the relevant chapters...|$|E

The present study was therefore designed to compare the behavioral and neurochemical effects of cocaine (5 mg/kg, i. p.) and morphine (0. 5 mg/kg, s. c.) in RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh rats. To this aim, we measured motor activity and DA output in the nucleus accumbens as determined by brain microdialysis. The number of counts corresponding to horizontal, <b>vertical,</b> and total <b>motor</b> activities accumulated in basal conditions during the 60 -min acclimation period was significantly larger in RHA/Verh than in RLA/Verh rats. Moreover, horizontal, <b>vertical,</b> and total <b>motor</b> activities throughout the 120 -min observation period that followed the administration of vehicle tended to be larger in RHA/Verh rats, although {{the difference between the}} two lines was not statistically significant. In RHA/Verh rats, locomotion, rearing, and total motor activity were significantly more intense after acute cocaine and morphine challenges than after vehicle administration, whereas no significant differences in motor activity were observed between control and cocaine-or morphine-treated RLA/Verh rats. No line-related differences were detected in the basal DA output, but the effect of cocaine on DA release was more robust in RHA/Verh rats. Likewise, the effect of morphine was more pronounced in RHA/Verh than in RLA/Verh rats.
