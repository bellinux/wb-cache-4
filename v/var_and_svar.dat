Four instruments in use are vector auto regressive (VAR), structural vector auto regressive (SVAR), vector error correction model (VECM), and structural vector error correction (SVEC). VAR and VECM are employed to estimate and construct models and, subsequently, predict the future values of an object. SVAR and SVEC serve to analyze innovative structures of a model. <b>VAR</b> <b>and</b> <b>SVAR</b> can be implemented only to stationary data whilst VECM and SVEC {{can be applied to}} non-stationary inputs. The identification and estimation of the model in this research are specifically designed by R software.

Despite {{the support for}} a VARMA model for monetary policy analysis, the traditional <b>VAR</b> <b>and</b> <b>SVAR</b> models have predominantly {{been used in the}} literature mainly due to difficulties associated with the identification and estimation of such a model. Using the scalar component model (SCM) proposed by Athanasopoulos and Vahid (2008 a), this paper first identifies a VARMA model and then constructs a SVARMA model for Canadian monetary policy. We included the SVAR model in our study for a comparison purpose. Relative to this model, the impulse responses generated by the SVARMA model appear to be consistent with those predicted by various economic theoretical models, and solves the economic puzzles found commonly in the empirical literature on monetary policy. The successful construction and implementation of the SVARMA model for Canadian monetary policy analysis along with its promising impulse responses, indicate the suitability of this framework for small open economies...|$|E

The results from the VAR model revealed that agriculture contributed about 58 % to GDP while industry contributed about 32 % to GDP in Nigeria. The study further revealed from the SVAR models that agriculture and industry contributed to the structural innovations of GDP in Nigeria but more contribution resulting from agriculture. The work therefore recommended that special incentive should be given to farmer and infrastructural facilities should be provided.

It provides a set of methods for measuring operational risks under {{a certain degree of}} vagueness and impreciseness, as encountered in real-life data. It shows how possibility theory and indeterminate uncertainty-encompassing degrees of belief can be applied in analysing the risk function, and describes the parametric g-and-h distribution associated with extreme value theory as an interesting candidate in this regard. The book offers a complete assessment of fuzzy methods for determining both value at risk (VaR) and subjective value at risk (SVaR), together with a stability estimation of <b>VaR</b> <b>and</b> <b>SVaR.</b> Based on the simulation studies and case studies reported on here, the possibilistic quantification of risk performs consistently better than the probabilistic model. Risk is evaluated by integrating two fuzzy techniques: the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and the fuzzy extension of techniques for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution. Because of its specialized content, it is primarily intended for postgraduates and researchers with a basic knowledge of algebra and calculus, and can be used as reference guide for research-level courses on fuzzy sets, possibility theory and mathematical finance. The book also offers a useful source of information for banking and finance professionals investigating different risk-related aspects...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study whether price level or {{inflation}} targeting would be appropriate monetary policy regimes for Japan. A necessary condition for such regimes is that the rate of interest remain a positive tool of monetary policy. Using <b>VAR</b> <b>and</b> <b>SVAR</b> approaches, we investigate whether changes in the real ex ante and the nominal interest rate are able to stimulate an economy with a low inflation rate or deflation. Both with perfect foresight and using backward-looking schemes to predict the future price level, monetary policy remains potent even with declining inflation rates. This is confirmed by the stability of the estimated system throughout the examination period. A tax on currency, or ’Gesell money’ would be a possible alternative for Japan in order to lower the zero interest rate floor. We also find that monetary expansion in terms of broad money, broadly defined liquidity and M 2 +CDs, can bring Japan back to positive inflation rates. This must be supported by a higher interest rate differential between components of broad and narrow money. Moreover, expansion of direct funding in terms of corporate bonds could be beneficial for output growth while the non-performing loans problem in the economy is being tackled. Importantly, these results indicate that monetary policy alone is not able to pull Japan out of deflation and that fiscal measures need to be implemented in unison with monetary policy. disinflation, deflation, price level targeting, inflation targeting...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach - This paper examines the effects of trade and financial openness and oil price, the most important trading partners' GDP growth {{as well as for}} external dynamics of economic growth. To this end, this paper employs a Structural <b>VAR</b> (<b>SVAR)</b> <b>and</b> a nonlinear Markov-Switching VAR model. We examine the nonlinearity to let the effects of the external dynamics vary with the level of economic growth. Findings - The results suggest the external dynamics considered in this paper - namely trade and financial openness, oil prices and growth rate of Germany - initially explain 29 % of economic growth in Turkey, according to the linear estimation method. In the long run, this percentage climbs to 51 %. The nonlinear analysis shows that the magnitude of the effect of the external dynamics in recession periods is almost twice as high as in expansion. Research limitations/Implications - This paper provides first attempt of the nonlinear analysis of the growth - external dynamics for Turkey, future research effort is required to substantiate our findings. Originality/value - The originality of this paper lies in the finding that the effects of external dynamics on economic growth differs according to the growth stage as the economy is in the expansion period or recession period...|$|R

40|$|Over the years, many economies {{around the}} world have evolved in line with {{globalization}} and liberalization processes and have witnessed widespread changes in their conduct of monetary policy and the choice of monetary policy regimes. These processes have opened up new avenues and increased opportunities for financial market developments with greater financial integration and strong capital flows. The changing economic and financial environments have made modelling monetary policy and the identification of monetary policy shocks very challenging, particularly in small emerging open economies. To date, not much research work has been carried out on these economies, and this thesis attempts to fill this gap by addressing the problems associated with modelling monetary policy and the complexities involved in estimating monetary policy shocks and impulse response functions. In this thesis, we investigate the monetary transmission mechanism of the Malaysian economy, which provides an interesting case study {{to examine the effects of}} monetary policy on the real sectors of the economy under different exchange rate regimes. Malaysia adopted a managed float exchange rate regime prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and subsequently a pegged (to US dollar) exchange rate regime following the crisis. The specific aims of this research are: (i) To establish the necessary identification conditions to uncover Malaysian monetary policy shocks; (ii) To examine whether or not the identified model can resolve economic puzzles commonly found in monetary policy empirical literature; (iii) To evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policies on price levels and economic activities during the pre- and post- 1997 Asian financial crisis periods; and (iv) To assess the strength of various monetary transmission channels such as interest rates, monetary aggregates, credits, asset prices and exchange rates in propagating monetary policy shocks under different exchange rate regimes. To achieve the above aims, we employ three different modelling strategies: (i) the vector autoregressive (VAR); (ii) the structural vector autoregressive (SVAR); and (iii) the vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models. The traditional VAR approach is used as a first step to conduct some preliminary analysis, and to develop and analyze the effects of Malaysian monetary policy. Subsequently, the SVAR models are used to address issues concerning the contemporaneous relationships between Malaysian macroeconomic variables and policy instruments. We establish identification restrictions that are broadly consistent with economic theory and stylized facts that are evident in prior empirical research findings. One of the important characteristics of our identified SVAR model is the set of foreign block exogeneity restrictions which we impose to reflect the fact that small open economies do not influence large economies. Further, under the managed and pegged exchange rate systems, we uncover the importance of various monetary channels through which monetary policy shocks affect the Malaysian economy. The VARMA models are found to be superior to the VAR-type models for forecasting economic and financial variables. However, VARMA models are rarely used in empirical studies of monetary policy analysis. We are among the first to apply this methodology to investigate the responses of Malaysian variables to various monetary shocks and to assess whether they are consistent with prior theoretical expectations and stylized facts. The attractiveness of the VARMA model is that its impulse response functions reveal the expected monetary policy effects on the Malaysian economy, particularly in the postcrisis period under the pegged exchange rate system. On the other hand, the <b>VAR</b> <b>and</b> <b>SVAR</b> models fail to generate reliable impulse responses in some cases. The overall results suggest that the crisis, and a subsequent major shift in the exchange rate regime, have affected the Malaysian monetary transmission mechanism. Malaysian domestic variables are more sensitive and volatile to both domestic and foreign monetary shocks under the managed float exchange rate system than under the fixed exchange rate system. Hence, it is apparent that the stringent capital control measures undertaken by the government in the post-crisis period have insulated the Malaysian economy to some extent against foreign shocks and have provided the desired monetary autonomy. Considering some disparities in the effects of monetary policy on the Malaysian economy during the pre- and post-crisis periods, it is essential that policy makers understand how the economic transformation, the openness of the economy and the growing integration with external economies affects the nature of the monetary transmission mechanism. In our investigations, we uncover how various transmission channels work and we believe the outcome of our study can help the Malaysian Central Bank to steer the economy in the right direction, so that monetary policy can still remain an effective policy measure in achieving sustainable economic growth and price stability. In addition, the methodologies used in this thesis and the empirical findings will also enhance future research on similar small emerging open economies in devising appropriate monetary policy strategies under different policy regimes...|$|E
