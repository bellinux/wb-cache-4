40|$|Background: Because of {{the higher}} density and {{viscosity}} of xenon/oxygen mixtures in comparison to nitrogen/oxygen, increases of the pulmonary resistance have been reported. We have investigated the relevance of these findings to practical anaesthesia. Methods: 14 pigs {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either xenon/oxygen or nitrogen/oxygen mixtures (75 / 25) under condition of normo-, hypo- and hyperventilation. Airway pressures were measured in the ventilator system and endobronchially by an inserted measuring catheter. Results: <b>Ventilator</b> <b>pressures</b> were significantly higher in xenon ventilated animals as compared with nitrogen/oxygen ventilation. Endobronchial pressures were equal or significantly lower in xenon ventilated animals. Discussion: Ventilation with xenon/oxygen mixtures leads to a markable pressure decrease along endotracheal tubes. High <b>ventilator</b> system <b>pressures</b> do not correspond with high endobronchial pressures. In clinical xenon anaesthesia high <b>ventilator</b> <b>pressures</b> can be accepted...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} analysis of 632 infants with hyaline membrane disease admitted to this regional intensive care nursery between 1 July 1974 and 31 December 1982 showed that 387 (61 %) received mechanical ventilation. The <b>ventilator</b> <b>pressures</b> {{at the time}} the first air leak was detected were available from the records of 120 of 154 (78 %) of the infants who sustained pulmonary air leak. There was a significant downward trend in both peak and end expiratory pressure used during the study period. The downward trend in peak pressure persisted when inborn and outborn infants, boys and girls, and infants more than 27, and 23 to 27 weeks' gestation were examined separately. Despite these trends there was no reduction in the incidence of pulmonary air leak in any group. These data do not support the hypothesis, implicit in the term barotrauma, that a reduction in <b>ventilator</b> <b>pressures</b> decreases the risk of air leak...|$|R

To evaluate patient–ventilator interaction, the obtained neural inspiration and ventilator pressurization timings were used to calculate trigger and cycle-off errors of each breath.

30|$|Asynchrony {{was also}} {{analyzed}} using a standardized automated method {{over the same}} period, to prevent interobserver variability and to avoid observer subjectivity [19]. Inspiratory and expiratory timings were fully automatically detected on <b>ventilator</b> <b>pressure</b> and Edi signals based on predetermined thresholds (0.5  μV for Edi amplitude). Asynchrony was quantified using the NeuroSync index, a global index considering both inspiratory and cycling-off errors.

Tidal volume was also significantly reduced (mean 20 %) despite a significant increase (mean 22 %) in peak <b>ventilator</b> <b>pressure.</b> These changes in mechanics must be recognised to avoid alveolar hypoventilation, with a consequent decrease in gas exchange during surgery...|$|E
30|$|However, {{this new}} {{approach}} is only limited to ventilators capable of measuring EAdi. Furthermore, it mandates {{the insertion of}} an esophageal catheter which may be a disadvantage especially in the pediatric context. Transcutaneous recording of the electromyographic signals of the diaphragm (dEMG) may {{be considered as a}} suitable alternative [17 – 19]. Although at this moment no correlation studies between dEMG and EADi have been performed, this non-invasive, easy-to-perform technique provides reproducible electromyographic signals of the diaphragm [17]. We therefore tested the hypothesis that it would be feasible to automatically detect, quantify and display patient–ventilator interactions using a modified NeuroSync index (dEMG-phase scale) in mechanically ventilated children when analyzing dEMG together with <b>ventilator</b> <b>pressure</b> and flow versus time waveform.|$|E
30|$|From the {{measures}} performed on pressure rise duration, {{it was shown}} that long pressure rise durations led to more synchronous cycles with a restrictive lung mechanics whereas short durations better suit the obstructive lung mechanics. Such a feature could explain why some ventilators do not synchronize properly; indeed, a too tight range for the pressure rise durations (as observed in the Monnal T 50 and the SomnoVENT autoST with the restrictive mechanics) does not allow to have the value required for the considered lung mechanics. Consequently, comparing the minimum, median and maximum pressure rise durations for each ventilator allows to quickly assess {{the effect of this}} setting on the synchronization between the breathing cycles and the <b>ventilator</b> <b>pressure</b> cycles.|$|E

40|$|Meconium {{aspiration}} syndrome (MAS) is {{a complex}} respiratory disease of the term and near-term neonate. Inhalation of meconium causes airway obstruction, atelectasis, epithelial injury, surfactant inhibition, and pulmonary hypertension, the chief clinical manifestations of which are hypoxaemia and poor lung compliance. Supplemental oxygen is the mainstay of therapy for MAS, with around one-third of infants requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. For those ventilated, high <b>ventilator</b> <b>pressures,</b> {{as well as a}} relatively long inspiratory time and slow ventilator rate, may be necessary to achieve adequate oxygenation. High-frequency ventilation may offer a benefit in infants with refractory hypoxaemia and/or gas trapping. Inhaled nitric oxide is effective in those with pulmonary hypertension, and other adjunctive therapies, including surfactant administration and lung lavage, should be considered in selected cases. With judicious use of available modes of ventilation and adjunctive therapies, infants with even the most severe MAS can usually be supported through the disease, with an acceptably low risk of short- and long-term morbidities...|$|R

30|$|The use of noninvasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) strongly increased {{during the}} last twenty years, and became a common technique for managing acute and chronic respiratory failures. In response to a growing market, manufacturers propose yearly (if not more often) new ventilators with {{an increasing number of}} ventilatory modes and settings. Our objective is to help the physicians to improve the synchronization between the <b>ventilator</b> <b>pressure</b> cycles and patient breathing cycles, a key feature to optimize comfort and reduce the work of breathing [1]. The number of parameters available in a modern ventilator is indeed significantly greater than in those produced one or two decades ago. Unfortunately, the terminology used to designate these ventilator settings remains not unified and the same abbreviation can sometimes correspond to different quantities, as clearly pointed out long time ago [2]. Such disparities make a comparison between the different ventilators difficult to establish.|$|E
30|$|So far, use {{of these}} methods has been {{restricted}} to research purposes {{mainly because of the}} lack of ability to provide the clinician with real-time feedback of the level of PVA. In order to truly understand the clinical relevance of PVA in mechanically ventilated children, there needs to be a system that provides such feedback on both the occurrence and type of PVA. Recent advances have been made in the development of tools to automatically identify PVA [2, 12 – 15]. Such real-time automatic analyses are needed for clinical trials investigating the efficacy of interventions targeted at reducing PVA and on patient outcome. Sinderby et al. [16] developed an automated, objective and standardized neural index to quantify patient–ventilator interaction (NeuroSync) based on the measurements of EAdi and <b>ventilator</b> <b>pressure</b> waveforms. Determining patient–ventilator interaction by this method had a higher inter-rater reliability and proved to be more sensitive than manual analysis.|$|E

30|$|As {{previously}} described [12, 16, 17], for each recording, Edi and <b>ventilator</b> <b>pressure</b> curves were analyzed in a breath-by-breath manner over a continuous 5 -min period exempt of artifacts linked to agitation or patient care. Timings {{of the beginning}} and the end of inspiration and expiration phases on the Edi and the ventilatory pressure signals were semiautomatically identified: Main timings were automatically identified, and a visual inspection was performed breath by breath, permitting to validate and/or adjust the timing cursors if necessary. All analyses were performed by two independent investigators. By comparing the ventilator and Edi timings, PVA was identified, including wasted efforts (clear effort observed on Edi with no ventilator assist), auto-triggered breath (ventilator assist delivered in the absence of Edi increase), double triggering (two rapidly successive assists following a single effort), and inspiratory trigger and cycling-off errors. As the response of the ventilator for triggering or cycling off could be frequently either retarded or premature [12], we reported both types of asynchrony.|$|E

The effects were more marked at a ventilator rate of 30 breaths per minute than at 60 bpm and more during continuous insufflation than when gas was insufflated only during expiration.
