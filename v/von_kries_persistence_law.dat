40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{conditions}} under which the <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> model of colour constancy is exact,an investigation motivated by the fact that in practice the model has been shown to work well {{for a wide range of}} imaging devices [1]despite the fact that existing theory [2]predicts that it should perform poorly. We present a modified theory which reconciles this apparent contradiction and which is based on the observation that <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> adaptation treats sensor responses independently of one another. Starting from this point we show how to recover,for a single sensor, set of surfaces,and reference illuminant,the set of <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> illuminants:all lights for which <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> adaptation is a perfect model of illumination change. To help us in this task we use a linear model of surface reflectance, but importantly,we use a local model:that is,a model derived by examining reflectance only in the region to which the sensor of interest is sensitive. Adopting such a model and treating sensors independently of one another we show that our new theory accurately predicts the good practical performance of the <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> model...|$|R
40|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Kries</b> {{adaptation}} {{has long}} been considered a reasonable vehicle for color constancy. Since the color constancy performance attainable via the <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> rule strongly depends on the spectral response characteristics of the human cones, we consider the possibility of enhancing <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> performance by constructing new &quot;sensors &quot; as linear combinations of the fixed cone sensitivity functions. We show that if surface refiectances are well-modeled by 3 basis functions and illuminants by 2 basis functions then there exists a set of new sensors for which <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> adaptation can yield perfect color constancy. These new sensors can (like the cones) be described as long-, medium-, and short-wave sensitive; however, both the new long- and medium-wave sensors have sharpened sensitivities—their support is more concentrated. The new short-wave sensor remains relatively unchanged. A similar sharpening of cone sensitivities has previously been observed in test and field spectral sensitivities measured for the human eye. We present simulation results demonstrating improved <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> performance using the new sensors even when the restrictions on the illumination and reflectance are relaxed. ...|$|R

40|$|Chromatic {{adaptation}} transforms generally rely on {{a variant}} of the <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> transformation method to account for changes in the LMS cone signals that occur when changing from one illuminant to another. <b>Von</b> <b>Kries</b> adaptation—also {{often referred to as the}} coefficient rule method or the diagonal transformation method—adjusts the 3 color channels by independent scale factors. Since there generally are only 3 known quantities available, namely the ratio of the cone signals of the two adapting illuminants, a crucial aspect of the <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> method is that it requires only 3 parameters to be specified. A 9 -parameter, 3 x 3 matrix transformation would be more accurate, but it is generally not possible to determine the extra parameters. This paper presents a novel method of predicting the effect a change of illumination has on the cone signals, while still relying on only 3 parameters. To begin, we create a large set of 3 x 3 matrices representing illuminant changes based on a sizable database of typical illuminant spectra and surface spectral reflectances. Representing these 3 x 3 matrices as points in a 9 dimensional space, we then apply principal components analysis to find a 3 -dimensional basis which best approximates the original matrix space. To model an illumination change, a 3 x 3 matrix is constructed using a weighted combination of the 3 basis matrices. The relative weights can be calculated based on the 3 standard cone ratios obtained from the illuminant pair. Tests show that the new method yields better results than <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> adaptation with or without sensor sharpening...|$|R

40|$|The {{physiologist}} and neo-Kantian philosopher Johannes <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> (1853 - 1928) {{wrote one}} of the most philosophically important works on the foun-dation of probability after P. S. Laplace and before the First World War, his Principien der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung (1886, repr. 1927). In this book, <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> developed a highly original interpretation of probability, which maintains it to be both logical and objectively physical. After pre-senting his approach I shall pursue the influence it had on Ludwig Wittgen-stein and Friedrich Waismann. 2 It seems that von Kries’s approach had more potential than recognized in his time and that putting Waismann’s and Wittgenstein’s early work in a <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> perspective is able to shed light on the notion of an elementary proposition. 1. Von Kries’s logico-objective approach to probability As a neo-Kantian, <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> is very much opposed to any form of psy-chologism that he saw as prevalent in the usual conception of probability of his time. In order to eliminate any subjective elements from the notion of probability, he sets out to develop a physically objectivist account as a basis for a logical interpretation. He argues that probability must be based in some way or other on physical, objective features of reality and not on some de-gree of subjective certainty. The required foundation is to be introduced by way of the concept of “objective or physical possibility ” (Kries 1886, 87; cp. 1888, 180 - 2). At first glance, this seems to be a self-contradictory pro-cedure, because the term “possibility ” appears to admit only of a subjective sense, relative to our state of knowledge. To say that something is “possi-ble ” seems to imply that we are “uncertain ” of it under the known circum-stances. In order {{to make room for the}} idea of an objective possibility, <b>von</b> <b>Kries</b> introduces a distinction which is to play an important role not only in his probability theory but in his whole conception of logic, causality and sci-ence. It is the distinction between “nomological ” and “ontological ” determi-nations of reality and the two different kinds of empirical knowledge arisin...|$|R
