5|$|The second inactivated polio <b>virus</b> <b>vaccine</b> was {{developed}} in 1952 by Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh, and announced to the world on 12 April 1955. The Salk vaccine, or inactivated poliovirus vaccine, is based on poliovirus grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (vero cell line), which is chemically inactivated with formalin. After two doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (given by injection), 90 {{percent or more of}} individuals develop protective antibody to all three serotypes of poliovirus, and at least 99 percent are immune to poliovirus following three doses.|$|E
5|$|Vaccination is a {{cheap and}} {{effective}} way of preventing infections by viruses. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before {{the discovery of the}} actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella. Smallpox infections have been eradicated. Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans, and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, or viral proteins (antigens). Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, which do not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity. Such viruses are called attenuated. Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity (who are described as immunocompromised), because in these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines. These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine. Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. The yellow fever <b>virus</b> <b>vaccine,</b> a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.|$|E

Furthermore, pandemic vaccines against highly virulent strains such as the H 5 N 1 virus can only be generated by reverse genetics techniques. Other technologic breakthroughs should result in effective adjuvants for use with killed and live vaccines, increasing the number of available doses. Finally, universal influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> seem to be within reach. These new strategies will be successful if they are supported by regulatory agencies and if a robust market for influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> against interpandemic and pandemic threats is made and sustained. Influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> were first developed in the 1940 s and consisted of partially purified preparations of influenza viruses grown in embryonated eggs. Because of substantial contamination by egg-derived components, these killed (formaldehyde-treated) vaccines were highly pyrogenic and lacking in efficacy. A major breakthrough came with the development of the zonal ultracentrifuge in the 1960 s (invented by Norman G. Anderson) (1). This technology, which originated from uses for military purposes, revolutionized the purification process and industrial production of many <b>viruses</b> for <b>vaccines.</b> To this day, it remains the basis for the manufacturing process of our influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Current influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> consist of 3 components: an H 1 N 1 (hemagglutinin [HA] subtype 1; neuraminidase [NA] subtype 1), an H 3 N 2 influenza A virus, and an influenza B virus.

25|$|For a time, the {{black-footed ferret}} was {{harvested}} for the fur trade, with the American Fur Company having received 86 ferret skins from Pratt, Chouteau, and Company of St. Louis {{in the late}} 1830s. During {{the early years of}} predator control, black-footed ferret carcasses were likely discarded, as their fur was of low value. This likely continued after the passing of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, for fear of reprisals. The large drop in black-footed ferret numbers began during the 1800s through to the 1900s, as prairie dog numbers declined because of control programs and the conversion of prairies to croplands. Sylvatic plague, a disease caused by Yersinia pestis introduced into North America, also contributed to the prairie dog die-off, though ferret numbers declined proportionately more than their prey, thus indicating other factors may have been responsible. Plague was first detected in South Dakota in a coyote in 2004, and then in ~50,000 acres of prairie dogs on Pine Ridge Reservation in 2005. Thereafter 7,000 acres of prairie dog colonies were treated with insecticide (DeltaDust) and 1,000 acres of black-footed ferret habitat were prophylactically dusted in Conata Basin in 2006–2007. Nevertheless, plague was proven in ferrets in May 2008. Since then each year 12,000 acres of their Conata Basin habitat is dusted and about 50–150 ferrets are immunized with plague vaccine. Inbreeding depression may have also contributed, as studies on black-footed ferrets from Meeteetse, Wyoming revealed low levels of genetic variation. Canine distemper devastated the Meeteetse ferret population in 1985. A live <b>virus</b> <b>vaccine</b> originally made for domestic ferrets killed large numbers of black-footed ferrets, thus indicating that the species is especially susceptible to distemper.|$|E

40|$|Approaches {{to improve}} the {{efficacy}} of the current (killed) influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> include the generation of cold-adapted and genetically engineered influenza viruses containing specific attenuat-ing mutations. It is hoped that these genetically altered viruses, in which the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from circulating strains have been incorporated by reassortment, can be used as safe live influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> to induce a long-lasting protective immune response in humans. In addition, genetically engineered influenza viruses may provide a means for expressing foreign antigens. Immunization of mice with recombinant influenza and vaccinia viruses expressing specific antigens of Plasmodium yoelii resulted in a dramatic protective immune response against malaria in this model. Mice immunized with recombinant influenza viruses expressing human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV) epitopes generated long-lasting HIV-specific serum antibodies and secretory IgA in the secretory nasal, vaginal, and intestinal mucosa.

40|$|ABSTRACT New vaccine {{technologies}} are being investigated {{for their ability}} to elicit broadly cross-protective immunity against a range of influenza viruses. We compared the efficacies of two intranasally delivered nonreplicating influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> (H 1 and H 5 S-FLU) that are based on the suppression of the hemagglutinin signal sequence, with the corresponding H 1 N 1 and H 5 N 1 cold-adapted (ca) live attenuated influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> in mice and ferrets. Administration of two doses of H 1 or H 5 S-FLU vaccines protected mice and ferrets from lethal challenge with homologous, heterologous, and heterosubtypic influenza viruses, and two doses of S-FLU and ca vaccines yielded comparable effects. Importantly, when ferrets immunized with one dose of H 1 S-FLU or ca vaccine were challenged with the homologous H 1 N 1 virus, the challenge virus failed to transmit to naive ferrets by the airborne route. S-FLU technology can be rapidly applied to any emerging influenza virus, and the promising preclinical data support further evaluation in humans. IMPORTANCE Influenza viruses continue to represent a global public health threat, and cross-protective vaccines are needed to prevent seasonal and pandemic influenza. Currently licensed influenza vaccines are based on immunity to the hemagglutinin protein that is highly variable. However, T cell responses directed against highly conserved viral proteins contribute to clearance of the virus and confer broadly cross-reactive and protective immune responses against a range of influenza viruses. In this study, two nonreplicating pseudotyped influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> were compared with their corresponding live attenuated influ-enza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines,</b> and both elicited robust protection against homologous and heterosubtypic challenge in mice and ferrets...|$|R
