His {{certificate}} of election reads: [...] Philip Maini's mathematical and computational modelling of spatiotemporal processes in biology and medicine {{has led to}} significant scientific advances in both. His work on biological pattern formation has led to detailed understanding of the roles of noise, domain growth and gradients in pattern generation. He has generalised the concept of gradient information and has proposed an experimentally consistent resolution of the chemotactic wave paradox. He has developed multiscale models for wound healing and for <b>vascular</b> <b>tumour</b> growth. He has thereby elucidated the underlying mechanisms by which particular growth factors reduce scar formation and has provided detailed insight into the design of combination cancer therapy.|$|E

It is the third most common liver tumor in children, the most common benign vascular tumor of the liver in infancy, and the most common symptomatic liver tumor during the first 6 months of life.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{formulate}} and explore {{a mathematical model}} to study continuous infusion of a <b>vascular</b> <b>tumour</b> with isolated and combined blood-borne chemother-apies. The mathematical model comprises a system of non-linear partial dieren-tial equations that describe {{the evolution of the}} healthy (host) cells, the tumour cells and the tumour vasculature, coupled with distribution of a generic angio-genic stimulant (TAF) and blood-borne oxygen. A novel aspect of our model is the presence of blood-borne chemotherapeutic drugs which target dierent aspects of tumour growth (cf. proliferating cells, the angiogenic stimulant or the tumour vas-culature). We run exhaustive numerical simulations in order to compare <b>vascular</b> <b>tumour</b> growth before and following therapy. Our results suggest that continuous exposure to anti-proliferative drug will result in the <b>vascular</b> <b>tumour</b> being cleared, becoming growth-arrested or growing at a reduced rate, the outcome depending on the drug's potency and its rate of uptake. When the angiogenic stimulant or the tumour vasculature are targeted by the therapy, tumour elimination can not occur: at best vascular growth is retarded and the tumour reverts to an avascular form. Application of a combined treatment that destroys the vasculature and the TAF, yields results that resemble those achieved following successful treatment with anti-TAF or anti-vascular therapy. In contrast, combining anti-proliferative therapy with anti-TAF or anti-vascular therapy can eliminate the <b>vascular</b> <b>tumour.</b> In con-clusion, our results suggest that tumour growth and the time of tumour clearance are highly sensitive to the specic combinations of anti-proliferative, anti-TAF and anti-vascular drugs.

40|$|A tissue-isolated {{preparation}} of the P 22 rat carcinosarcoma was used to investigate the <b>tumour</b> <b>vascular</b> response to angiotensin II (ATII). In particular, {{the relative importance of}} systemic and local tumour factors was assessed by comparing <b>tumour</b> <b>vascular</b> resistance during systemic administration of ATII and during administration directly into the tumour-supplying artery.

The response was biphasic with an initial peak in resistance followed by a lower plateau phase. Systemic administration of ATII was more effective in increasing <b>tumour</b> <b>vascular</b> resistance than direct administration. This suggests that systemic administration is not causing any reopening of previously collapsed tumour blood vessels. Further evidence for this is that hypervolaemia caused no reduction in <b>tumour</b> <b>vascular</b> resistance {{and that there was no}} difference in oxygen extraction by tumours between groups treated with systemically and directly administered ATII.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy and reliability of duplex Doppler ultrasound (US) and computerized tomography (CT) in staging patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Sixty-six patients were evaluated pre-operatively with duplex Doppler ultrasound and CT. The results were compared with the surgical and histopathological findings. T stage was determined correctly with duplex Doppler US and CT in 56 and 50 cases respectively. In 4 patients with nodal disease duplex Doppler US was correct in 2 patients, 1 was false positive. With CT, 3 patients were staged correctly and 3 were false positive. Of the 14 patients with <b>vascular</b> <b>tumour</b> thrombi, 13 were staged correctly with duplex Doppler US and 12 with CT scan. False positive <b>vascular</b> <b>tumour</b> invasion was seen only with CT in 4 cases. Based on these results we conclude that duplex Doppler US is at least as accurate as CT scanning in the staging of RCC.

40|$|Background: Angiogenesis is {{the process}} of new blood vessel formation, and is {{regulated}} by angiogenic growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Angiosarcomas are rare, aggressive <b>vascular</b> <b>tumours.</b> Studies were performed to investigate the expression of angiogenic growth factors in angiosarcoma, and to assess vascular targeted agents for the treatment of angiosarcoma. Methods: In vitro studies compared two human cutaneous angiosarcoma cell lines (ASM and ISO-HAS) with human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HuDMECs). The cell lines were compared in functional assays, including cell viability, cell differentiaiton and cell migration assays, and protein expression profiled using antibody arrays. Cell responses to vascular targeted agents were compared, including response to bevacizumab an anti-VEGF antibody, axitinib a VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, selumetinib a MEK inhibitor, and DMXAA a vascular disrupting agent. Immunohistochemistry studies measured the expression of angiogenic growth factors in angiosarcoma tumour specimens using benign vascular lesions for comparison, and assessed canine angiosarcoma as a model of human angiosarcoma. Results: ASM and ISO-HAS demonstrated accelerated growth kinetics, chaotic tubule formation, and increased cell migration compared to HuDMECs. ASM and ISO-HAS expressed significantly increased VEGF compared to HuDMECs. Only minor responses were observed to VEGF targeted agents in functional assays despite western blot studies that showed target inhibition of VEGFR 2 phosphorylation,. Striking responses were seen however to selumetinib and DMXAA. Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated benign and malignant <b>vascular</b> <b>tumours</b> expressed a range of pro-angiogenic growth factors, however analysis did not distinguish malignant from benign <b>vascular</b> <b>tumours.</b> The morphology of canine angiosarcoma was similar to human angiosarcoma. VEGF and VEGFR 2 expression was significantly increased in canine angiosarcoma compared to benign vascular lesions. Conclusion: These studies predict limited in vivo angiosarcoma tumour response to VEGF targeted agents. Selumetinib and DMXAA are suggested for further study. Canine angiosarcomas represent a potential model of human angiosarcoma to be explored in future studies. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} {{the distribution of}} factor VIII related antigen, CD 31, CD 34 and CD 36 in normal and malignant human vascular tissues using a panel of well characterised monoclonal antibodies. METHODS: Frozen and fixed material {{from a wide range}} of normal tissues and routinely processed material from 43 benign and malignant <b>vascular</b> <b>tumours</b> were examined. Single immunocytochemical labelling was performed using the APAAP technique. Double staining involved the sequential use of APAAP with the peroxidase method. RESULTS: Human vascular endothelium was antigenically heterogeneous. One of the most restricted markers was factor VIII related antigen, despite its having been widely used in diagnostic pathology as a marker of vascular endothelium and of the tumours which arise from it. Three antibodies against factor VIII related antigen, CD 31 (JC 70) and CD 34 (QBend 10) were identified as immunostaining routinely processed, formalin fixed, paraffin wax sections. Each antibody gave different staining when tested on a range of <b>vascular</b> <b>tumours,</b> both benign and malignant. CONCLUSIONS: A small panel of three reagents (factor VIII related antigen, CD 31 (JC 70) and CD 34 (QBend 10)) should be used by diagnostic pathologists who want to show the presence of cells of endothelial origin in routine material...|$|R
