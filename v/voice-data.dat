40|$|Abstract — Future {{wireless}} networks {{will support}} the growing demands of heterogeneous and delay sensitive applications. In this paper, a users ’ satisfaction factor (USF) is defined to quantify quality of service (QoS) for different types of services such as voice, data, and multimedia, {{as well as for}} different delay constraints. This USF not only predicts the final delivered QoS during transmission, but also take advantages of the fact that different packets can be decoded at different time in the receivers. Based on this USF, four types of scheduling schemes considering tradeoffs between system performance and individual fairness are proposed. These schemes explore the time, channel, and multiuser diversity to guarantee quality of service and enhance the network performance. From the simulation results, the proposed scheduling schemes achieve different tradeoffs between individual fairness and high system performance for the heterogeneous and delay sensitive applications, compared with the weighted roundrobin and the modified proportional fairness scheduling schemes.

We present a new algorithm to control the resource utilization and to optimize the voice codec selection during SIP call setup {{on behalf of the}} traffic condition estimated on the network path. The most suitable methodologies and the tools that perform realtime evaluation of the available bandwidth on a network path have been integrated with our proposed algorithm: this selects the best codec for a VoIP call in function of the instantaneous available bandwidth on the path. The algorithm does not require any explicit feedback from the network, and this makes it easily deployable over the Internet. We have also performed intensive tests on real network scenarios with a software prototype, verifying the algorithm efficiency with different network topologies and traffic patterns between two SIP PBXs. The promising results obtained during the experimental validation of the algorithm are now the basis for the extension towards a larger set of multimedia services and the integration of our methodology with existing PBX appliances.

A key concept of dimensioning radio resources in such networks is represented by sharing resources between different users and different services. In this paper we {{address the problem of}} voice and data traffic models according to different resources allocations strategies: CP (Complete Partitioning) and PP (Partial Partitioning) and define specific parameters in each case. The proposed traffic model depend in each case on the resources allocation strategy: for voice traffic it is based on both cases, CP and PP, on Erlang law meanwhile for data traffic we build different models depending the scheme used for resources allocation. For CP scheme we propose two models: the model based on Erlang law and those based on modified Engset law.

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{to the analysis of}} Markovian queueing networks is developed and applied to traffic problems of <b>voice-data</b> integration networks and trunked mobile radio networks. This approach is shown to be computationally much less complex for large systems compared to previous work. In the integrated networks we consider, two classes of users share the system facilities. If all the servers are busy, the first class of users are queued, but the second class of users are blocked and cleared from the system. The performance objective of such an integrated network is to trade the time delay performance of the first class of users against the blockage performance of the second class of users to keep the grade of service as high as possible for both classes of traffic. The key-state approach introduced in this thesis is what makes the analysis of the corresponding Markovian queueing network model of these integrated networks computationally less complex than that of previous work. The performance of integrated networks is investigated under several control strategies and new exact closed-form expressions are obtained for the equilibrium probabilities of the corresponding Markovian models. The results are extended to a more general Markovian process where a bulk of arrivals and departures are allowed. The key-state approach is expected to become a standard tool for analyzing large queueing networks such as will arise when Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) become widely deployed in the next five years...|$|E

However, the current wireless networks, which are by and large wireless extensions of the circuit -switched voice networks, are being replaced by emerging wireless networking technologies that are intrinsically designed to support packet data and multimedia services. This will lead to novel networked applications and services, which in turn will require wireless terminals capable of exploiting these services. What shape will these next-generation wireless terminals take? The answer, based on the much talked about notion of "convergence," {{would appear to be}} a marriage of the laptop or PC with a wireless phone in the same package, leading to terminals such as the Nokia 9000 [1] or Bell Laboratories' wireless handset [2].

40|$|The Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA) {{protocol}} and its variants {{have been considered}} as possible access schemes for communication media for indoor communications, terrestrial communications and satellite communications. Most recently, PRMA (and its variants) has been considered for applications such as beyond third generation and/or fourth generation communication systems, cooperative communication, and multimedia communication in dynamic environments. In this dissertation, equilibrium behavior of general voice and/or data systems employing PRMA are studied along with means for control of this behavior. The main objective is to determine conditions guaranteeing a unique equilibrium for these systems, as multistability can result in an unacceptable user experience. Systems considered include voice systems, voice and data systems, and voice systems with high propagation delay (these are studied both for an error-free channel and a random error channel). Also, various control schemes are introduced and their effect on these system is analyzed at equilibrium. Control schemes considered include a price based control, state estimation-based control, and control using multiple transmission power and capture. For each type of control, {{the effect of the}} control on the equilibrium structure of the system is studied, {{in the spirit of the}} methodology of bifurcation control. In bifurcation control, the number and nature of steady state solutions of a system are managed by appropriate design of system control laws. Several sufficient conditions for uniqueness of operating points of the PRMA systems under the studied control schemes is determined. Numerical analysis of the equilibrium equations of the systems is provided to support the analytical studies. The equilibrium behavior of voice systems and <b>voice-data</b> systems employing frame-based PRMA is also studied. Effects of price based control on these systems is analyzed. Further, the price based control studied in conjunction with the PRMA systems is extended to a finite buffer finite user slotted ALOHA system, and the equilibrium behavior of the system is studied using a tagged user approach. Among the contributions of the dissertation are analytical sufficient conditions guaranteeing a unique equilibrium point for the various classes of systems studied, control law designs that result in improved system capacity, and extensive numerical studies including comparisons with two previously proposed approaches. Analysis is also given proving the Markovian nature of the system's stochastic dynamics (under some basic assumptions) and the existence of a unique stationary probability law...|$|E
40|$|Fiber to the Premise (FTTP) {{exhibits}} {{characteristics of}} a natural monopoly industry. However, service level competition is possible in FTTP and {{can be achieved by}} a structural separation between network ownership and service provisioning (henceforth, referred to as a wholesale-retail split). A wholesale-retail split interferes with the ability of a network owner to price discriminate. While a vertically integrated entity can sell seven different economic goods (voice service, broadband data service, video service, <b>voice-data</b> bundle, voice-video bundle, data-video bundle and triple-play bundle), a dark fiber wholesaler can sell only one good (dark fiber access). A ‘lit’ wholesaler may be able sell the same number of goods as a vertically integrated entity. Significant economies of scope ensure that the marginal cost of provisioning the bundle is much lower than the sum of the marginal costs of provisioning the individual services). If almost all homes have a positive willingness to pay for data service, the bulk of the extractable economic surplus resides in the triple-play bundle. Since the wholesale-retail split does not interferes with the ‘dark fiber’ wholesaler’s ability to extract economic surplus from the triple-play bundle, the inability to price discriminate does not interfere with ability of a dark fiber wholesaler to extract economic surplus vis-à-vis a vertically integrated entity (or a ‘lit’ wholesaler) and the difference between the profits of a profit maximizing wholesaler and a profit maximizing vertically integrated entity) are modest, at best. In such markets, municipalities or communities that build out FTTP and choose to be wholesalers (i) can realize sustainable prices, (ii) are likely to create greater welfare (due to innovation spurred by retail competition) and (iii) are just as likely to recover costs (vis-à-vis vertically integrated entities). Therefore, contrary to the assertions of some current providers, {{it is not necessary to}} vertically integrate and exclude service level competitors in order to generate sufficient revenue to cover an investment in FTTP infrastructure. However, in markets, where a large proportion of homes have a zero willingness to pay for data service (and therefore, desire only video service), the profit maximizing ‘dark fiber’ wholesaler can be worse off due to its inability to set a video price independently of the bundle price – resulting in a lower optimal bundle price (vis-à-vis a vertically integrated entity) and lower profits. Interestingly, the welfare maximizing ‘dark fiber’ wholesaler can still create almost the same amount of welfare as a vertically integrated entity, though the distribution of welfare among consumer groups is markedly different. Further, in the presence of a strong (cable) incumbent, the ability to price discriminate gives the vertically integrated entity (or the ‘lit’ wholesaler) marginally greater ability to compete with the cable incumbent, thereby driving down prices and resulting in (marginally) lower profits for the incumbent (vis-à-vis an incumbent that competes with a ‘dark fiber’ wholesaler). However, if a large proportion of homes have zero willingness to pay for data services, not only is the ‘dark fiber’ wholesaler worse off (vis-à-vis a vertically integrated entity), but the lower bundle price set by the ‘dark fiber’ wholesaler makes the incumbent worse off as well (vis-à-vis the incumbent competing against a vertically integrated entity) resulting in bundle consumers enjoying a significantly larger consumer surplus. Finally, a municipal FTTP entrant that seeks to maximize welfare and competes with a profit maximizing (cable) incumbent not only creates welfare for its subscribers, but also enhances the consumer surplus experienced by the subscribers of the (cable) incumbent. For our model parameters, consumer surplus can almost double and service penetration can increase by as much as 60 % due to such municipal entry - indicating that welfare maximizing municipal entry ensures that almost every home ends up being served...|$|E
