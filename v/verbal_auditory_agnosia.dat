40|$|We report 2 {{pediatric}} {{patients who}} presented initially with seizures followed by subacute language regression {{characterized by a}} <b>verbal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia.</b> These previously normal children had no evidence of expressive aphasia during their symptomatic periods. Further, in both cases, auditory agnosia was associated with sleep-activated electroencephalographic (EEG) epileptiform activity, consistent with Landau-Kleffner syndrome. However, both cases are unique since the episodic auditory agnosia and sleep-activated EEG epileptiform activity rapidly responded to combination therapy with pulse benzodiazepine and corticosteroids. Fur-ther, in each case, recurrences were characterized by similar symptoms, EEG findings, and beneficial responses to the pulse ben-zodiazepine and corticosteroid therapy. These observations suggest that pulse combination high-dose corticosteroid and benzodiazepine therapy may be especially effective in Landau-Kleffner syndrome...|$|E

50|$|In childhood, <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{can also}} be caused by Landau-Kleffner syndrome, also called {{acquired}} epileptic aphasia. It is often the first symptom of this disease. A review of 45 cases suggested a relationship between prognosis and age of onset with poorer prognosis for those with earlier onset. In extremely rare cases, <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{has been known to}} present as a symptom of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{retrospectively}} analyze the electroclinical features, etiology, treatment, and prognosis of 29 patients with Landau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS) with a long-term follow-up. MethodsInclusion criteria were a diagnosis of LKS with: (1) acquired aphasia or verbal auditory aphasia; (2) with or without focal seizures, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absences, or atonic seizures. ResultsMean follow-up was 12 years. All cases except six had seizures. Before the onset of aphasia, developmental language and behavioral disturbances were present in 19 and 14 patients, respectively. All patients had <b>verbal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia.</b> Aphasia was severe in 24 patients and moderate in five. Nonlinguistic cognitive dysfunctions were moderate in 14 patients. Behavioral disturbances were found in 16 patients. During the continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep phase, the spike-wave index was > 85 % in 15, 50 – 85 % in eight, and 30 – 50 % in four. In two patients, the EEG recording showed occasional bilateral spikes, without continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep. In this phase, the awake EEG recording showed more frequent interictal abnormalities, predominantly in the temporal regions. Eight patients recovered language completely, but the remaining patients continue to have language deficits of different degrees. ConclusionLandau–Kleffner syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by acquired verbal auditory aphasia and seizures in most of the patients associated with continuous or almost continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow wave sleep. The most commonly used treatments were clobazam, ethosuximide, sulthiame. High-dose steroids were also administered. Adequate and early management may avoid language and cognitive deterioration...|$|E
50|$|After Wernicke, came Kussmaul in 1877 who {{attempted}} to explain why <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia,</b> also known as word deafness, occurs. Contrary to Wernicke's explanations, Kussmaul believed <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{was the result of}} major destruction to the first left temporal gyrus. Kussmaul also posited about the origins of alexia (acquired dyslexia) also known as word blindness. He believed that word blindness was the result of lesions to the left angular and supramarginal gyri.|$|R
50|$|Cortical {{deafness}} {{is a rare}} form of {{sensorineural hearing}} loss caused by damage to the primary auditory cortex. Cortical deafness is an auditory disorder where the patient is unable to hear sounds but has no apparent damage to the anatomy of the ear (see auditory system), which {{can be thought of}} as the combination of <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> and <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia.</b> Patients with cortical deafness cannot hear any sounds, that is, they are not aware of sounds including non-speech, voices, and speech sounds. Although patients appear and feel completely deaf, they can still exhibit some reflex responses such as turning their head towards a loud sound.|$|R
50|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> can be {{referred}} to as a pure aphasia because it has a high degree of specificity. Despite an inability to comprehend speech, patients with <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> typically retain the ability to hear, speak, read and write. This specificity suggests that there is a separation between speech perception, non-speech auditory processing, and central language processing. In support of this theory, there are cases in which speech and non-speech processing impairments have responded differentially to treatment. For example, some therapies have improved writing comprehension in patients over time, while speech remained critically impaired in those same patients.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> (AVA), {{also known}} as pure word deafness, is the {{inability}} to comprehend speech. Individuals with this disorder lose the ability to understand language, repeat words, and write from dictation. However, spontaneous speaking, reading, and writing are preserved. Individuals who exhibit pure word deafness are also still able to recognize non-verbal sounds. [...] Sometimes, this agnosia is preceded by cortical deafness; however, {{this is not always}} the case. Researchers have documented that in most patients exhibiting <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia,</b> the discrimination of consonants is more difficult than that of vowels, but as with most neurological disorders, there is variation among patients.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> - Comprehension {{of speech}} is lost but hearing, speaking, reading, and writing ability is retained. This {{is caused by}} damage to the {{posterior}} superior temporal lobes, again not allowing the brain to process auditory input correctly.|$|R
2500|$|Speech <b>agnosia,</b> or <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia,</b> {{refers to}} [...] "an {{inability}} to comprehend spoken words despite intact hearing, speech production and reading ability". Patients {{report that they}} do indeed hear sounds being produced, but that the sounds are fundamentally unrecognizable/untranslatable.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} aspect of cortical deafness that is often overlooked is that patients feel deaf. They are aware of their inability to hear environmental sounds, non-speech and speech sounds. Patients with <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> can be unaware of their deficit, and insist {{that they are not}} deaf. <b>Verbal</b> deafness and <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> are disorders of a selective, perceptive and associative nature whereas cortical deafness relies on the anatomic and functional disconnection of the auditory cortex from acoustic impulses.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>verbal</b> and nonverbal <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia,</b> {{there are cases}} of <b>auditory</b> apperceptive <b>agnosia</b> where patients are unable to recognize music {{in the absence of}} sensory, intellectual, and verbal impairments. In these cases there may be a melodic or a memory basis established in the brain and damage to those areas lead to music agnosia. Agnosia occurs because of failure to re-encode melodic information properly. This associated with right-sided lesions interrupting the melodic route in the brain.|$|R
5000|$|Phonagnosia (from Ancient Greek φωνή phone, [...] "voice" [...] and γνῶσις gnosis, [...] "knowledge") {{is a type}} of agnosia, or loss of knowledge, that {{involves}} a disturbance in the recognition of familiar voices and the impairment of voice discrimination abilities in which the affected individual does not suffer from comprehension deficits. Phonagnosia is an <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia,</b> an acquired <b>auditory</b> processing disorder resulting from brain damage, other auditory agnosias include cortical deafness and <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> also known as pure word deafness.|$|R
50|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> is the {{inability}} to distinguish phonemes. In some patients with unilateral <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia,</b> {{there is evidence that}} the ability to acoustically process speech signals is affected at the prephonemic level, preventing the conversion of these signals into phonemes. There are two predominate hypotheses that address what happens within the language center of the brain in people that have AVA. One of the hypotheses is that an early stage of auditory analysis is impaired. The fact that AVA patients have the ability to read shows that both the semantic system and the speech output lexicon are intact. The second hypotheses suggests that there is either a complete or partial disconnection of the auditory input lexicon from the semantic system. This would suggest that entries in the lexicon can still be activated but they cannot go on to cause subsequent semantic activation. In relation to these two different hypotheses, researchers in one study differentiated between two different types of AVA. According to this study, one form of AVA is a deficit at the prephonemic level and is related to {{the inability}} to comprehend rapid changes in sound. This form of AVA is associated with bilateral temporal lobe lesions. The second type of AVA that the study discusses is a deficit in linguistic discrimination that does not adhere to a prephonemic patter. This form is associated with left unilateral temporal lobe lesions and may even be considered a form of Wernicke's aphasia. Often individuals diagnosed with <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> are also incapable of discriminating between non-verbal sounds as well as speech. The underlying problem seems to be temporal in that understanding speech requires the discrimination between specific sounds which are closely spaced in time. Note that this is not unique to speech; studies using non-speech sounds closely spaced in time (dog bark, phone ring, lightning, etc.) have shown that those with <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> are unable to discriminate between those sounds in the majority of cases, though a few putative examples of speech-specific impairment have been documented in the literature.|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} that {{cortical}} deafness could {{be a part of}} a spectrum of an overall cortical hearing disorder. In some cases, patients with cortical deafness have had recovery of some hearing function, resulting in partial auditory deficits such as <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia.</b> This syndrome might be difficult to distinguish from a bilateral temporal lesion such as described above.|$|R
50|$|Agnosia is the {{inability}} to recognize certain objects, persons or sounds. Agnosia is typically caused by damage to the brain (most commonly in the occipital or parietal lobes) or from a neurological disorder. Treatments {{vary depending on the}} location and cause of the damage. Recovery is possible depending on the severity of the disorder and the severity of the damage to the brain. Many more specific types of agnosia diagnoses exist, including: associative visual <b>agnosia,</b> astereognosis, <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia,</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia,</b> prosopagnosia, simultanagnosia, topographical disorientation, visual agnosia etc.|$|R
50|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{is caused}} by {{bilateral}} damage to the posterior superior temporal lobes or disruption of connections between these areas. It {{is often associated with}} lesions to the left posterior superior temporal lobe, but no such unilateral case has yet been documented without damage to the white matter tract connecting superior temporal lobes bilaterally or bilateral damage to the superior temporal lobe. In cases where unilateral damage to the left superior temporal lobe has been documented, patients exhibited problems processing both speech and non-speech sounds (in other words, not typical of <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia).</b> These facts, in combination with the existence of cases of damage to these white matter tracts without detectable cortical damage, in combination with cases of pure word deafness resulting enlargement of the III ventricle alone suggest that the disorder results from damage to the left-right superior temporal circuit rather than the superior temporal area on one hemisphere or the other.|$|R
50|$|Eleanor M. Saffran (May 16, 1938 - November 23, 2002) was a {{researcher}} {{in the field}} of Cognitive Neuropsychology.

In papers published between 1976 and 1982, Dr. Saffran spelled out the methodological tenets of “cognitive neuropsychology” exemplified in her studies of aphasia, alexia (acquired dyslexia), <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia,</b> and short-term memory impairment.|$|R
50|$|Patient J.P., who {{suffered}} a stroke in the left medial/temporal gyrus, resulting in <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> - the inability to comprehend spoken words, but maintaining {{the ability to read}} and write, and with no effects to hearing ability. J.P. showed normal perceptual priming, but his conceptual priming ability for spoken words was, expectedly, impaired. Another patient, N.G., {{who suffered}} from prosopanomia (the inability to retrieve proper names) following damage to his left temporal lobe, was unable to spontaneously provide names of persons or cities, but was able to successfully complete a word-fragment completion exercise following priming with these names. This demonstrated intact perceptual priming abilities.|$|R
5000|$|This {{specific}} {{group of}} symptoms distinguishes {{those who have}} expressive aphasia from individuals {{with other types of}} aphasia. There are several distinct [...] "types" [...] of aphasia, and each type is characterized by a different set of language deficits. Although those who have expressive aphasia tend to retain good spoken language comprehension, other types of aphasia can render patients completely unable to understand any language at all, unable to understand any spoken language (<b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia),</b> whereas still other types preserve language comprehension, but with deficits. People with expressive aphasia may struggle less with reading and writing (see alexia) than those with other types of aphasia. Although individuals with expressive aphasia tend to have a good ability to self-monitor their language output (they [...] "hear what they say" [...] and make corrections), other types of aphasics can seem entirely unaware of their language deficits.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, {{children}} with LKS develop normally, but then lose their language skills. While many affected individuals have clinical seizures, some only have electrographic seizures, including electrographic status epilepticus of sleep (ESES). The first {{indication of the}} language problem is usually <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia.</b> This is demonstrated in patients in multiple ways including the inability to recognize familiar noises and the impairment {{of the ability to}} lateralize or localize sound. In addition, receptive language is often critically impaired, however in some patients, impairment in expressive language is the most profound. In a study of 77 cases of Landau-Kleffner syndrome, 6 were found to have this type of aphasia. Because this syndrome appears during such a critical period of language acquisition in a child's life, speech production may be affected just as severely as language comprehension. [...] The onset of LKS is typically between 18 months and 13 years, the most predominant time of emergence being between 3 and 7 years.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} and functional anatomy underlying {{the early stages}} of speech perception are still not well understood. <b>Auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> is a deficit of auditory object processing defined as a disability to recognize spoken languages and/or nonverbal environmental sounds and music despite adequate hearing while spontaneous speech, reading and writing are preserved.

40|$|There is an {{unprecedented}} increase of rare low-incident severe disabilities in today 2 ̆ 7 s classroom.

5000|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{is a form}} of agnosia that {{manifests itself}} {{primarily}} in the inability to recognize or differentiate between sounds.

50|$|Sign {{language}} {{therapy has}} been identified {{as one of the top}} five most common treatments for <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia.</b> This type of therapy is most useful because, unlike other treatment methods, it does not rely on fixing the damaged areas of the brain. This is particularly important with AVA cases because it has been so hard to identify the causes of the agnosia in the first place, much less treat those areas directly. Sign language therapy, then, allows the person to cope and work around the disability, much in the same way it helps deaf people. In the beginning of therapy, most will work on identifying key objects and establishing an initial core vocabulary of signs. After this, the patient graduates to expand the vocabulary to intangible items or items that are not in view or present. Later, the patient learns single signs and then sentences consisting of two or more signs. In different cases, the sentences are first written down and then the patient is asked to sign them and speak them simultaneously. Because different AVA patients vary in the level of speech or comprehension they have, sign language therapy learning order and techniques are very specific to the individual's needs.|$|R
