Researchers in Brazil looked into the best composition of organic compost using various combinations of Crotalaria juncea and Napier grass. [...] The objective was to find the mixture between Crotalaria juncea and Napier grass that would yield the highest <b>vegetable</b> <b>seedling</b> production. More specifically, the <b>vegetable</b> <b>seedling</b> production of lettuce, beetroot, and tomatoes was measured by observing the shoot height, fresh mass production in shoots and dry matter, and leaf number. [...] The various compounds that were observed include, 100% Crotalaria juncea, 66% Crotalaria juncea with 33% Napier, 33% Crotalaria juncea with 66% Napier, 100% of Napier, 33% Crotalaria juncea with 66% Napier where 5% of the mass is cattle manure, Crotalaria juncea 33% with 66% Napier which includes 100 liters of 5% dilute Agrobio (biofertilizer), and finally, 100% Napier which also includes 100 liters of 5% dilute Abrobio. [...] The compost with 66% Crotalaria juncea and 33% Napier grass was superior to other combinations since this particular combination yielded the greatest production of lettuce, beet, and tomato seedlings.|$|E

30|$|The {{conveying}} {{monitoring module}} comprises a seedling storage monitoring module, a seedling taking monitoring module, and a cup-type circulating conveying monitoring module. The monitoring module includes a pressure sensor {{and a lack}} of seedling indicator light. A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on the slot-wheeled seedling storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted <b>vegetable</b> <b>seedling</b> tray waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to drive the sprocket wheel of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of the seedling plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket conveyor belt, the position of the seedling tray conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and the seedling tray is moved from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling tray conveyor belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of the seedling tray and the push rod mechanism. When it is detected that the seedling tray enters the conveyor belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of seedling was obtained by detecting the pressure change of the seedling pushing mechanism by pressure sensor. The potted <b>vegetable</b> <b>seedling</b> is taken out from the seedling tray and conveyed to the conveying mechanism. The CCD camera is arranged above the conveying track of the cup to monitor the leakage and load status of the potted <b>vegetable</b> <b>seedling</b> in the cups and to obtain the conveying information.|$|E

Our results showed that application of L-S 60 significantly altered the structure of the bacterial community associated with the cucumber seedling; presence of beneficial rhizosphere species such as Bacillus, Rhodanobacter, Paenibacillus, Pseudomonas, Nonomuraea, and Agrobacterium was higher upon L-S 60 treatment than in the control group.

The results showed that the presence in the substrate of some complex populations made by heterotrophic bacteria favors full degradation of the pulp and lignin contained in the substrate and pots composition.
