His ability {{to take advantage of}} the knowledge gained, coupled with practical experience he developed over the year has given him head start to develop a breakthrough “numerical pattern analysis”. These ideas later developed into the 'Ⓥ Numbers Formula', which eventually took the form of the Four Pillars of VISIBER Studies: <b>Ⓥ</b> <b>Numbers</b> Behavioral Studies, <b>Ⓥ</b> <b>Numbers</b> Nameology, <b>Ⓥ</b> <b>Numbers</b> Environmental Studies, and <b>Ⓥ</b> <b>Numbers</b> Symbology. <b>Ⓥ</b> <b>Numbers</b> Formula was then granted registered trademarks and various industrial patents both in Malaysia, as well as around the globe. With his adventurous and entrepreneurial spirit, the knowledge was systematized, rearranged, repackaged, and given a brand name.|$|R

5000|$|The {{number of}} modes in an optical fiber distinguishes {{multi-mode}} optical fiber from single-mode optical fiber. To determine the number {{of modes in}} a step-index fiber, the <b>V</b> <b>number</b> needs to be determined: [...] where [...] is the wavenumber, [...] is the fiber's core radius, and [...] and [...] are the refractive indices of the core and cladding, respectively. Fiber with a V-parameter of less than 2.405 only supports the fundamental mode (a hybrid mode), and is therefore a single-mode fiber whereas fiber with a higher V-parameter has multiple modes.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} part of the physical exam is also assessment of the cranial nerves. Due to the unconscious status of the patient, {{only a limited number of}} the nerves can be assessed. These include the cranial nerves number 2 (CN II), number 3 (CN III), number 5 (CN <b>V),</b> <b>number</b> 7 (CN VII), and cranial nerves 9 and 10 (CN IX, CN X). Gag reflex helps assess cranial nerves 9 and 10. Pupil reaction to light is important because it shows an intact retina, and cranial nerve number 2 (CN II); if pupils are reactive to light, then that also indicates that the cranial nerve number 3 (CN III) (or at least its parasympathetic fibers) are intact. Corneal reflex assess the integrity of cranial nerve number 7 (CN VII), and cranial nerve number 5 (CN V). Cranial nerve number 5 (CN V), and its ophthalmic branch (V1) are responsible for the afferent arm of the reflex, and the cranial nerve number 7 (CN VII) also known a facial nerve, is responsible for the efferent arm, causing contraction of the muscle orbicularis oculi resulting in closing of the eyes.|$|E

In the Spanish translation, by the author, published in the monthly magazine Brisas, that Villalonga directed and where he wrote to some extent, from the number XVIII (October 1935) to XXV (May 1936), the current tenth chapter was added «Ravings of woman Obdúlia». The 3rd Catalan edition incorporated chapter III «Thirty years ago». The 2nd Spanish edition, by J. Vidal Alcover, published in the magazine Papeles de Son Armadans, volume IV, numbers 10 to 12 (from January to March) and volume <b>V</b> <b>number</b> 13 (April) of 1957, included for the first time chapter II «The first moments», chapter X «That 20th of January», chapter XIX «That's how history is written» and chapter XXIII «At Carme Street». Finally, the 4th Catalan edition (1965) and the complete works edition of 1963 premiered chapter XVIII, «Aina Cohen visits woman Obdúlia». All in all, from the first to the last edition, the work increases in seven the number of chapters.|$|E

Marcuse's (1988) results for weakly guiding cylindrical fibers with fluorescent sources uniformly distributed in the cladding are confirmed for the bulk distribution case.

A new independent variable for the bulk distribution is found, and it is shown that the power efficiency does not always increase with the <b>V</b> <b>number...</b>|$|E
