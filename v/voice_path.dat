In the 1ESS switch, the cores were made of a magnetically remanent alloy, so the relay could latch magnetically instead of latching electrically. This [...] "Ferreed" [...] method reduced power consumption and allowed both contacts to be used for <b>voice</b> <b>path.</b> The coils were wired for coincident current selection similar to a magnetic core memory, so operating the contacts for one crosspoint would release the other crosspoints in its row and column.|$|E

50|$|The {{generations of}} {{telephone}} switches {{before the advent}} of electronic switching in the 1950s used purely electro-mechanical relay systems and analog <b>voice</b> <b>paths.</b> These early machines typically utilized the step-by-step technique.

50|$|In {{traditional}} GSM networks, a call {{between two}} Mobile Stations (MS) involve a dual encoding/decoding process. Speech signals are first encoded in the originating MS, converted to G.711 {{in the local}} transcoder, converted back to a GSM codec in the remote transcoder and finally converted back to speech at the terminating MS. In this configuration the two transcoders are operating in tandem introducing a voice quality degradation. It is possible to eliminate this problem by removing the two transcoding operations in the <b>voice</b> <b>path</b> if the two MS are using the same codec.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} methodologies that allow a mobile handset to be {{integrated}} into a VoIP network. One implementation turns the mobile device into a standard SIP client, which then uses a data network to send and receive SIP messaging, and to send and receive RTP for the <b>voice</b> <b>path.</b> This methodology of turning a mobile handset into a standard SIP client requires that the mobile handset support, at minimum, high speed IP communications. In this application, standard VoIP protocols (typically SIP) are used over any broadband IP-capable wireless network connection such as EVDO rev A (which is symmetrical high speed — both high speed up and down), HSPA, Wi-Fi or WiMAX.|$|E
50|$|Design of {{infinity}} transmitters has varied, according to developments in telephone systems. In some instances, the bug is activated after the target answers and hangs up their phone. In countries {{where there is}} a delay between connection and the first ring, the bug can be activated before the target phone rings, so that the infinity transmitter essentially 'answers' the call. In more advanced systems, the transmitter can be placed in a parallel telephone line to prevent the victim's phone line remaining engaged.As modern telephone lines no longer establish a <b>voice</b> <b>path</b> until the call is answered a variant of this now exists that uses CND, or caller ID.Usually an unusual sequence of non printing characters is used and thus will not show up on a display device.Sometimes the caller ID device itself has the bug but it can be nearly anywhere.In much the same manner a cellphone can be configured for silence on ring and auto answer and hidden, frequently placed inside something that has power available to maintain the battery.This allows the infinity transmitter to be hidden inside an automobile or other location where a land line is not an option.|$|E
5000|$|Also used, was the {{overhead}} paging feature, {{built into the}} ROLM Redwood systems. An employee at the service desk would announce [...] "Produce you have a call on 630" [...] and then the employee in produce would simply go to any phone in the entire store and dial 630 to retrieve a call. Around 1986 this was highly advanced as most grocery stores still relied on analog 1A2 phone systems with a separate intercom handset that only had one or two <b>voice</b> <b>paths.</b> In addition to {{the overhead}} paging and parking capabilities of the phone system, employees could directly dial to each telephone in the store via an intercom extension such as 604 or 627, etc. For example, general merchandise would be extension 627. The store manager could dial 627 to directly dial general merchandise without having to overhead page across the entire store.|$|R
5000|$|In about 1978 the {{development}} of the automatic call distributors began, with the MACD (medium ACD) being released first at Frontier Airlines, followed by small and very small systems in short succession. By 1980, the 580 PBX and ACD development effort had effectively bankrupted Wescom with many vendors having placed the company on credit hold. Rockwell Intl purchased Wescom in 1980 solving Wescom's cash problems and embarking the company onto the common carrier market, creating the SCX product line. SCX provided the early backbone for the early MCI network after the break-up of AT&T. Rockwell already had a successful ACD business with the [...] "Galaxy" [...] system through their Collins Radio arm. Rockwell's interest in the 580 product line centered on its 100% non-blocking network frame that connected the <b>voice</b> <b>paths</b> within the system. The network frame actually had additional switching capability that would later be utilized to process digital connections.|$|R

In particular, this implementation evaluates the use of the on-board switching capability of the satellite as a viable alternative for providing the multipoint connectivity normally provided by terrestrial audio bridge equipment The system that was implemented provides full mesh, full-duplex audio conferencing, with end-to-end <b>voice</b> <b>paths</b> between all participants requiring only a single hop (i. e. 250 msec. delay). Moreover, it addresses the lack of spontaneity in current systems by allowing a user to easily start a conference from any standard telephone handset connected to an ACTS earth station, and quickly add new members to the conference at any time using the 'hook flash' capability. No prior scheduling of resources is required and there is no central point of control, thereby providing the user with the spontaneity desired in audio conference control...|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{operation}} of IMTS was very advanced for its time, considering that integrated circuits were not commonly available. The most common IMTS phone, the Motorola TLD-1100 series, used two circuit boards about 8 inches square, {{to perform the}} channel scanning and digit decoding process, and all logic was performed with discrete transistors. In a given city, one IMTS base station channel was [...] "marked idle" [...] by the transmission of a steady 2000 Hz [...] "idle" [...] tone. Mobiles would scan the available frequencies and lock on to the channel transmitting the idle tone. When a call was placed to a mobile, the idle tone would change to 1800 Hz [...] "channel seize" [...] tone (the idle tone would appear on another frequency, if available), and the 7 digit mobile number (three digits of the NPA and the last four digits of subscriber number, the NXX was not sent) would be sent out as rotary dial pulses, switching between 2000 and 1800 Hz to represent digits. Any mobile recognizing that the call was for someone else would resume scanning for mark idle tone, while the called mobile would then transmit 2150 Hz [...] "guard" [...] tone back to the base station. This would also initiate ringing at the mobile, and when the mobile subscriber picked up the phone, 1633 Hz [...] "connect" [...] tone would {{be sent back to}} the base station to indicate answer supervision and the <b>voice</b> <b>path</b> would be cut through. When the mobile hung up, a burst of alternating 1336 [...] "disconnect" [...] and 1800 Hz [...] "seize" [...] tones would be sent to allow the base station to service another call.|$|E
40|$|Some future {{telephone}} {{services will}} require that ongoing calls be interrupted briefly {{so that one}} of the parties can receive data transmitted over the <b>voice</b> <b>path.</b> For example, the new service Caller ID on Call Waiting (CIDCW) will allow sub-scribers who are off-hook and engaged in conversation to receive data indicating the name and telephone number of a new caller, but the data transmission will produce a break of approximately 1 s. The question arises, then, as to what method should be used to interrupt calls to transmit data. In an automatic form of CIDCW, data would be sent without user control once there is a new call, producing an unexpected break in ongoing conversations. In a user-controlled form, users would hear a tone when there is a new call and initiate the data transmission by pressing a button. A study was conducted to examine how subjects would react to breaks in their telephone conversations and to determine which form of CIDCW was more favorable. Subjects acting as CIDCW subscribers liked both forms of the service, but they preferred the automatic form, which was also rated as more acceptable and easier to use. Furthermore, compared with the user-controlled form, auto-matic CIDCW resulted in quick, error-free performance. Subjects acting as the far-end party also favored the automatic form, provided that they heard silence during the interruptions rather than a tone. Generally the automatic approach was found to be the better way to introduce a 1 -s break into telephone calls...|$|E

40|$|Abstmet-This paper {{addresses}} the static and centralized routing of voice and data traffic in burst switched networks. Since voice and data have markedly different traffic characteristics and performance require-ments, their interaction in a unified switching and transmission struc-ture greatly impacts their performance. Voice {{performance in a}} burst switched network is primarily measured by end-to-end freeze-out while figures-of-merit for data include end-to-end delay and stability that may be jeopardized due to the interaction with the higher priority voice traf-fic. We assume that our routing allows random bifurcation in <b>voice</b> and data <b>paths</b> and preemptive priorities for voice requirements. We first study routing of voice only, by using a multicommodity flow model with linearized link losses and average network loss as a min-imization objective. Solving the resulting linear program, we observe that optimal routing strategies prefer to freeze a requirement {{at an early stage}} of its path rather than those requirements that are close to their destinations. We then study the voicehata interaction at the link level using an available fluid-flow model, and translate the combined link performance as a maximum flow constraint on a link. This constraint may have undesirable effects on the voice, such as introducing routes with flow absorbing loops, and unfair freezing of some requirements. We include all conflicting multiple objectives and constraints in a linear programming formulation and show bow parameters can be tuned to produce desirable <b>voice</b> and data <b>paths.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} software and computational capabilities in voice endpoints, switches, and networks creates {{an opportunity for}} embedding advanced applications in <b>voice</b> communication <b>paths.</b> Particularly in an enterprise environment, such applications can alter the traditional behavior of voice communications from simply connecting two or more people to software-assisted connection establishment and enhanced on-call features. In this paper, we claim that embedding context-aware applications in communication paths can greatly increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and convenience of enterprise communications and thus the productivity of enterprise users. We identify the challenges associated with embedding context-aware applications in communication paths and exemplify our central claim by presenting a context-aware voice communications application CallerID++. CallerID++ aims at improving the aged concept of caller ID {{as the basis for}} a callee’s decision to accept or reject an incoming call. Through a call acceptance negotiation between caller and callee prior to call establishment, CallerID++ allows the callee to assess the importance of an incoming call relative to the callee’s current activity. CallerID++ thus helps minimizing unwanted interruptions without rejecting important calls. 1...|$|R
