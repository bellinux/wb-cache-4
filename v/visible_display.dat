50|$|Horizontal scan rate, or {{horizontal}} frequency, usually {{expressed in}} kilohertz, is the frequency {{at which a}} CRT moves the electron beam {{from the left side}} of the display to the right and back, and therefore describes the number of horizontal lines displayed per second. CRT timings include some horizontal scans before the <b>visible</b> <b>display,</b> after it, and during the travel from bottom to top (known as vertical back porch, vertical front porch, and vertical sync width, respectively, and collectively known as vertical blank time), so the horizontal scan rate does not directly correlate to <b>visible</b> <b>display</b> lines, unless the unseen lines are also known, but it can still be used to approximate the display lines, as the total blank time is usually a small but significant portion of the total lines.|$|E

5000|$|The holotype is {{composed}} of a single partially complete adult specimen with wings folded. The body itself is very fragmentary with {{only a portion of}} the thorax preserved. The visible pronotum is 1.2 mm long and sub-triangular in shape while the mesonotum is 3 mm in length. Both the pronotum and mesonotum host a number of long hairs. [...] Due to the paired and overlapping nature of the folded wings, much of the hindwing details are obscured and not observable. The hindwings are an estimated 16.5 mm long and 10 mm wide, with little to no vein detail visible. The hindwing margins that are <b>visible</b> <b>display</b> the distinct undulation that is seen on the forewings. Subtriangular in shape, the forewings are 12.3 mm wide and 21.5 mm long with a uniformly broad coastal space. The hind and outer margins of the forewings are distinctly undulate and entire wing margin is hairy. The veins are notably covered with dense hairs with the hair length increasing towards the wing bases. The radius vein, Rs, in the forewings has ten primary branches, which further branch as they approach the wing margin.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic {{surveying}} instruments {{such as a}} total station allows the observer to measure the position of each diameter measurement {{and the length of}} the trunk section between each measurement. With most of the instruments, the diameter is determined by measuring the angle of azimuth between the opposite sides of the trunk. Laser-measured distances to the sides of the trunk representing the ends of the diameter and the included angle are used with the law of cosines to calculate the diameter. The Criterion RD 1000 has a special feature that allows the diameter to be measured through a <b>visible</b> <b>display.</b> These length and diameter values then can be used to determine the volume of the individual section. [...] Another technique is available for those who possess instruments that will measure horizontal angles. The following diagram shows how to measure diameter remotely using a laser rangefinder to shoot the distance {{to the middle of the}} trunk and a transit or compass or another device to measure the horizontal angle created by the diameter. Note that in this method, the measurer shoots to the middle of the trunk instead of either edge. Also, the full diameter does not have to be visible from the point of measurement. It is a common misconception that closer distances lead to errors because the measurer can’t see the full diameter. However, if the trunk is round, closeness is not a factor. In the diagram d = diameter, D = distance from measurer to middle of the tree, a = angle from the middle to the edge of the trunk. A variation of this method is to measure the complete angle taken up by the image of the trunk and divide it by 2 to get angle a.|$|E

5000|$|The {{method of}} {{measuring}} screen size by its diagonal was {{inherited from the}} method used for {{the first generation of}} CRT television, when picture tubes with circular faces were in common use. Being circular, the external diameter of the bulb was used to describe their size. Since these circular tubes were used to display rectangular images, the diagonal measurement of the visible rectangle was smaller than the diameter of the tube due to the thickness of the glass surrounding the phosphor screen (which was hidden from the viewer by the casing and bezel). This method continued even when cathode ray tubes were manufactured as rounded rectangles; it had the advantage of being a single number specifying the size, and was not confusing when the aspect ratio was universally 4:3. In the US, when virtually all TV tubes were 4:3, the size of the screen was given as the true screen diagonal with a V following it (this was a requirement in the US market but not elsewhere). In virtually all other markets, the size of the outer diameter of the tube was given. What was a 27V in the US could be a 28" [...] elsewhere. However the V terminology was frequently dropped in US advertising referring to a 27V as a 27". This was not misleading for the consumer as the seller had to give the actual screen size by law. Flat panel displays by contrast use the actual diagonal of their <b>visible</b> <b>display</b> size, thus the size is the actual size presented to the viewer in all markets. This means that a similarly specified size of display will be larger as a flat panel display compared with a cathode ray tube display.|$|E

The first pass of the technique generates an image of the desired graphics model using conventional rendering. The second pass projects that image as a texture onto a model of the display surface, then re-renders the textured display surface model from the viewpoint of each display device. The algorithm scales with the complexity of the display surface, and is constant with respect to the complexity of the graphics model. 1. # Introduction Along with ongoing increases in rendering power comes renewed hope for widefield -of-view and high-resolution displays for an increased sense of immersion and improved visualization.
