5|$|In {{the cases}} of Lake-effect snow and polar lows, the {{convective}} systems form over warm water bodies when cold air sweeps over their surface and leads {{to an increase in}} moisture and significant <b>vertical</b> <b>motion.</b> This <b>vertical</b> <b>motion</b> leads to the development of showers and thunderstorms in areas of cyclonic flow on the backside of extratropical cyclones.|$|E

50|$|Equivalent {{potential}} temperature, {{commonly referred}} to as theta-e , is a quantity that is conserved during changes to an air parcel's pressure (that is, during <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> in the atmosphere), even if water vapor condenses during that pressure change. It is therefore more conserved than the ordinary potential temperature, which remains constant only for unsaturated <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> (pressure changes).|$|R
5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary <b>vertical</b> <b>motion</b> is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to {{pose a threat to}} both people and property.|$|E
5|$|Constant {{pressure}} charts normally contain plotted {{values of}} temperature, humidity, wind, and the vertical height {{above sea level}} of the pressure surface. They {{have a variety of}} uses. In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward <b>vertical</b> <b>motion)</b> and cold advection (coincident with downward <b>vertical</b> <b>motion)</b> is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface {{can be used as a}} rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced vertical wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.|$|E
5|$|The {{major cause}} of rain {{production}} is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward <b>vertical</b> <b>motion)</b> such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall {{along the sides of}} mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.|$|E

5|$|When swimming, baleen whales rely {{on their}} {{flippers}} for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Flipper movement is continuous. While doing this, baleen whales use their tail fluke to propel themselves forward through <b>vertical</b> <b>motion</b> while using their flippers for steering, much like an otter. Some species leap out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Because of their great size, right whales are not flexible or agile like dolphins, and none can move their neck because of the fused cervical vertebrae; this sacrifices speed for stability in the water. The hind legs are enclosed inside the body, and {{are thought to be}} vestigial organs. However, a 2014 study suggests that the pelvic bone serves as support for whale genitalia.|$|E
25|$|In summary, the balanced-flow speeds apply well to air columns {{that can}} be {{regarded}} as homogeneous (constant density, no <b>vertical</b> <b>motion)</b> or, at most, stably stratified (non-constant density, yet no <b>vertical</b> <b>motion).</b>|$|E

During one 40 -min period of measurement, significant energy concentration was observed at the frequency of dominant surface waves in the vertical and cross wind spectra. Cross spectra between the surface elevation and <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> in the flow indicate that the surface lags the <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> by about 55 ° at the frequency of dominant waves...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{observations}} that vigorous convective {{elements in the}} atmosphere act as obstacles to the environmental flow, it is shown that hydrodynamic pressures exist near the strong updraft. After utilizing this result, a simple model of quasi-steady-state cumulonimbus is proposed. It is then found that vertical shear in unidirectional envrionmental flow leads to enhanced <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> on {{the perimeter of the}} updraft. These intensified <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> would allow the updraft to be less adversely affected by the shearing forces and may explain the persistence or growth of such storms...|$|R

It appears in light of Voyager IR measurements as well as previously obtained radio data that these large-scale <b>vertical</b> <b>motions,</b> which have not undergone significant changes over the course of 8 years, extend from the 0. 1 - to the 45 -bar levels; this span corresponds to a height of the order of 250 km. The latitudinal structures are believed to be primarily caused by horizontal variations of absorber abundances...|$|R
40|$|Field {{observations}} on ground motions from recent earthquakes imply that current knowledge is limited {{with regard to}} relating <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>motions</b> at liquefiable sites. This paper describes a study {{with the purpose of}} clarifying this emerging issue to some extent. A series of numerical analyses is carried out on a liquefiable soil deposit with a verified, fully coupled, nonlinear procedure. It is shown that the transformation of <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> in the deposit differs considerably from the transformation of horizontal motions. Both the amplitude and frequency content of the horizontal motions are strongly dependent on the shaking level or the associated nonlinear soil behavior. The transfer function for <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> is however likely to be independent of the intensity of input motions; no reduction in the amplitude occurs even in the case of strong shaking. The results are shown to be in consistence with the laboratory {{observations on}} shaking table tests and recent field observations that less nonlinearity exists for <b>vertical</b> <b>motions.</b> It is also shown that the possibility exists for using information on spectral ratios between the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> surface <b>motions</b> to quickly identify in situ soil behavior and liquefaction that are not readily covered by conventional field or laboratory experimentation procedures. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The swing jaw closes, i.e., it moves towards the fixed jaw when the pitman moves upward and opens during the downward motion of the pitman.

40|$|Leisure boats {{market has}} {{constantly}} grown during the latest years entailing an increasing need of design tools, dealing with technical problems like seakeeping of planing boats, whose complexity still present a high challenge for designers. The present paper describes a methodology for the calculation in time {{domain of the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> of a planing boat in head waves, capable of predicting the non-linear <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> of the boat in both regular / irregular head waves. The formulation makes recourse to a ‘strip-theory’ approach to get the 3 D hydrodynamic forces as a linear superposition of the sectional forces. The determination of the 2 D planing forces is based on ‘momentum theory’ using Wagner’s wedge-theory to model the sectional characteristics, while non-linear Froude-Krylov forces are directly evaluated accounting the relative motions at each cross-section. Moreover, from the time-series of the <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> an overall passenger comfort index and slamming pressures are evaluated. A validation of the code is presented against the model-test results available in literature...|$|R

During the first 3 days, the kinetic energy inside the volume increased. The computations indicate that the increase was caused by lateral advection of kinetic energy into the volume plus a small internal conversion of potential to kinetic energy. The kinetic energy decreased during the last 3 days, as the circulation became indirect. Visual agreement between the <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> and the observed weather was good. 1...|$|R

The impulse is reflected back {{from the end of the}} basin, generating interference. Repeated reflections produce standing waves with one or more nodes, or points, that experience no <b>vertical</b> <b>motion.</b> The frequency of the oscillation is determined by the size of the basin, its depth and contours, and the water temperature.|$|E

The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done {{on one side of}} the paper, and the paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.|$|E
25|$|The eye has acuity {{limits for}} {{detecting}} motion. Forward motion {{is limited by}} the subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT), and horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>motion</b> acuity are limited by lateral motion thresholds. The lateral motion limit is generally below the looming motion limit, and for an object of a given size, lateral motion becomes the more insightful of the two, once the observer moves sufficiently far away from the path of travel. Below these thresholds subjective constancy is experienced in accordance with the Stevens' power law and Weber–Fechner law.|$|E

A special attention is given to the alternation of stability and instability within the family of periodic <b>vertical</b> <b>motions,</b> whenever their amplitude is varied in a continuous monotone manner.

40|$|In situ {{measurements}} of local <b>vertical</b> neutral particle <b>motions</b> {{have been made}} using the Neutral Atmosphere Temperature Instrument (NATE) on Atmosphere Explorer-C from observations of the direction of flow of neutral particles into the antechamber of the sensor (mass spectrometer). Values ranging from a few to more than 80 meters per second have been observed. The data show <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> greater than a few meters per second to be present most of the time, the magnitude being a function of many factors including magnetic activity, location, and magnetic storm history. In a specific case, it is concluded that the observed <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> and kinetic temperature are evidence of a travelling disturbance originating as a gravity wave in the auroral zone...|$|R
40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis of the physical causes of atmospheric <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> is conducted using a generalized omega equation and a one-year simulation with the OpenIFS atmospheric model. Using hourly output from the model, the <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> associated with vorticity advection, thermal advection, friction, diabatic heating, and an imbalance term are diagnosed. The results show the general dominance of vorticity advection and thermal advection in extratropical latitudes in winter, the increasing importance of diabatic heating towards the tropics, and the significant role of friction in the lowest troposphere. As this study uses notably higher temporal resolution data than previous studies which applied the generalized omega equation, our results reveal that the imbalance term {{is larger than the}} earlier results suggested. Moreover, for the first time, we also explicitly demonstrate the seasonal and geographical contrasts in the statistics of <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> as calculated with the generalized omega equation. Furthermore, as our analysis covers a full year, significantly longer than any other previous studies, statistically reliable quantitative estimates of the relative importance of the different forcing terms in different locations and seasons can be made. One such important finding is a clear increase in the relative importance of diabatic heating for midtropospheric <b>vertical</b> <b>motions</b> in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes from the winter to the summer, particularly over the continents. We also find that, in general, the same processes are important in areas of both rising and sinking motion, although there are some quantitative differences...|$|R
