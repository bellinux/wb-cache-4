40|$|Abstract- Input-series-output-parallel dc–dc {{converters}} are {{suited for}} high-input voltage and low output voltage applications. This letter presents a decentralized inverse-droop control for this configuration. Each module is self-contained and no central controller is needed; thus, improving the system modularity, reliability, and flexibility. With the proposed inverse-droop control, the output voltage reference rises as the load becomes heavy. Even though the input voltages {{are not used}} in the inverse-droop loop, the power sharing including input voltage sharing and output current sharing can still be well achieved. Besides, the output <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>characteristic</b> is not affected by the variation of input voltage. The operation principle is introduced, and stability of the strategy is also revealed based on small signal modeling. Finally, the experiment is conducted to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} control strategy. Index Terms—Input-series and output-parallel (ISOP), input voltage sharing (IVS), inverse- droop, output current sharing (OCS). I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} performance of a three-phase ac generator with an inset, neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) permanent-magnet (PM) rotor. Such a rotor construction gives rise to an inverse saliency effect (i. e., the direct-axis synchronous reactance {{is less than the}} quadrature-axis synchronous reactance). This feature results in an improvement in the <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>characteristics</b> when the generator supplies an isolated, unity-power-factor load. By solving the equations derived from the two-axis theory, it is found that there exists, in general, two values of load current at which zero <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> is obtained. The relationship between armature resistance, inverse saliency ratio, and the operating speed to give zero <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> is investigated. The finite-element method (FEM) is used for computing the pertinent generator parameters for performance evaluation, namely the no-load voltage and the synchronous reactances. Flux plots are presented to confirm the origin of inverse saliency in the inset PM rotor. The theoretical analysis is validated by experiments carried out on a 2. 5 -kVA prototype generator.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and performance of}} a permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) supplying an isolated load at constant speed is presented. The two-axis model is used for computation of the load characteristics of the PMSG and to study voltage compensation using shunt-connected capacitance. For a more comprehensive study, a time-stepping, coupled field-circuit analysis is developed using a two-dimensional finite element package. The time-stepping finite element analysis is applied to study the steady-state and transient performance of the PMSG when supplying an isolated resistive load. With appropriate modification of the external circuit model, the steady-state performance of a PMSG which supplies a bridge rectifier load is also studied. <b>Voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>characteristics,</b> waveforms and harmonics are investigated.

40|$|Abstract—The {{inherent}} {{variability of}} wind power injections becomes {{particularly important for}} wind farms connected to weaker networks, as voltage deviations become more significant and <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> more challenging. Through sensitivity analysis and continuation methods, this paper examines the impact of wind injection on transformer tap operation in sub-transmission networks. The results of a tap operation simulation show that <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> at wind injection nodes increases tap change operations.

40|$|The {{criteria}} of optimal <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> in the electrical distribution network (EDN) with {{a source of}} dispersed generation (SDG) were formulated, if they belong to either one or different owners, {{taking into account the}} peculiarities of <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> by means of the SDG and the OLTC system of the transformer. It was found out that under the conditions of economic unprofitability of <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation,</b> in accordance with the above criteria, the owners should take up coordinated work – the general objective function of <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> to improve the effectiveness of regulation and achieve cost-effectiveness. The {{criteria of}} optimal <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> if EDN and SDG belong to one owner were formulated.
