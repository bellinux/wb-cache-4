5000|$|Theresimima ampellophaga, the <b>vine</b> bud <b>moth,</b> is a moth of the Zygaenidae family. It {{is found}} from Algeria, Spain and {{southern}} France {{through most of}} southern Europe to the northern coast of the Black Sea. In the north, it ranges up to Hungary and Slovakia and in the east, the range extends to {{the southern part of}} European Russia, the western Caucasus and Transcaucasia, through Turkey, Lebanon and Syria to Israel.|$|R
50|$|Both {{physical}} and chemical recommendations are made {{for control of the}} ivy gourd. It is very difficult to control this plant physically except by bagging fruits. Hand-harvesting normally does not kill the plant, but rather breaks the vine blankets into smaller pieces and the plant is able to re-establish when it touches the ground. These methods can make the infestation worse and further the need for more rigorous control methods. Picking the fruit and placing them in plastic bags can help decrease the seed bank present with the soil. When using chemical controls, that ivy gourd responded well to a thin-lined bark application of 100% Garlon 4 (triclopyr), leaving plants in place so as not to translocate the herbicide or spread the pest. It is applied multiple times until the vine dies. In Hawaii, several species of insect have been introduced with the purpose of being a biocontrol. Two weevils, Acythopeus burkhartorum and A. cocciniae, were introduced by the Department of Agriculture to Oahu and Hawaii. African <b>vine</b> <b>moths</b> were also released onto Oahu and Maui. On the island of Maui, the A. cocciniae apparently is established and damaging leaves. The larvae feed on the plant and the adults chew holes in the leaves. The moth has yet to appear successful in its purpose.|$|R

40|$|The {{operational}} {{availability of}} information about Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) (Denis et Schiffermüller) and crop phenology of vine (Vitis vinifera L.) should enhance the effectiveness of IPM activities, especially in the crucial pre-flowering phase, when the oviposition of the anthophagous generation, sometimes responsible of significant damages in Sardinia, takes place. On the ground of this, phenological models referred to <b>vine</b> and <b>moth</b> should be important tools for spatial extension of field observations. This evidence justify the work described in this paper and founded on {{the analysis of the}} relationship between phenological phases of vine and onset of attack of Lobesia botrana. This analysis was carried out by means of (i) a simulation model of the insect biological cycle and (ii) a simulation model of the grapevine phenology referred to the two varieties Cabernet Sauvignon e Chardonnay. Both models were applied to the Alghero (SS- Sardinia) time series 1951 - 2006 of temperature data. Results are discussed and possible future improvements of the method are analyzed...|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 16th century this {{industry}} was booming. The Thirty Years' War then caused recession and decline. Prices of beer, tea and coffee dropped, causing profit margins on wine to shrink. After 1815, the left bank was Prussian and the economic situation improved. The 1839 German customs union led to strong competition. Many farmers found themselves a day job, and grew wine as a secondary occupation. New sources of income were the sparkling wine industry and wine bars serving tourists attracted by the Rhine romanticism. After 1870 the railways brought new problems: cheaper and better foreign competition and the advent of vine insects of America and France (powdery mildew, phylloxera, downy mildew and <b>vine</b> <b>moth).</b> The deeper cause of the decline were the changed socio-economic conditions. Until the 19th century, there were few other opportunities for paid employment in the Rhine Valley, so many workers migrated to areas where the emerging manufacturing industries were creating new employment opportunities. The economic situation on the left bank improved after the Second World War. Until then, the only industries on the left bank were viticulture and tourism. In the 1960s, 92% of the slopes was consolidated into larger vineyards. Nevertheless, the wine industry declined further, due to lack of profits. In 1950 the Mittelrhein region boasted 1448 ha of vines under cultivation document of the winegrower's association Middle Rhine. In 1989 it still had 681 ha (−53%). From 1989 to 2009 the total area of viticulture in the Middle Rhine region shrunk by another spiraling −19% to 438 ha.|$|E
40|$|Pheromone traps were {{deployed}} in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County (Hungary) between 1982 and 1988, in 1990 and also between 1993 and 2013. These traps attracted 8 Microlepidoptera species: Phyllonorycter blancardella, P. corylifoliella, Anarsia lineatella, Eupoecilia ambiguella, Lobesia botrana, Grapholita funebrana, G. molesta and Cydia pomonella. We examined the trapping data {{of these species}} {{in the context of}} lunar phases and polarized moonlight. Catches of the European <b>Vine</b> <b>Moth</b> (Lobesia botrana) and the Codling Moth (Cydia pomonella) were higher in the First Quarter, whereas catches of Peach Twig Borer (Anarsia lineatella), <b>Vine</b> <b>Moth</b> (Eupoecilia ambiguella), Plum Fruit Moth (Grapholita funebrana) and Oriental Fruit Moth (Grapholita molesta) were larger in the Last Quarter. Catches of the other two species, the Spotted Tentiform Leafminer (Phyllonorycter blancardella) and Hawthorn Red Midget Moth (P. corylifoliella), were higher in both the First and Last Quarters. When using pheromone traps, insects do not fly to a light source, so moonlight does not modify either the catching distance or flight activity. However, at high levels of polarized moonlight, pheromone trap catches will increase, {{as in the case of}} light-trap catches. The results are comprehensible when one considers that the target species can fly both during the daytime and also at night...|$|E
40|$|The INTERFRUTA {{project is}} {{financed by the}} European Commission Interreg III-B Programme and was {{developed}} for the islands of “Madeira”, “Tenerife” and “Terceira”, {{for the improvement of}} fruit and vineyard production in these three Atlantic regions. The project goal is a better knowledge of the phytossanitary problems that affect apples, bananas, chestnut and vineyards, applying methods that will contribute to solutions based on the survey of key pests, diseases and beneficial organisms. In the three fruit crops and vineyards analyzed, the methodology used was mainly direct observation of predefined parts of each plant (such as leaves and flowers) on which pests might be expected to occur. The key pest C. capitata was monitored as adults using sexual lures in a net of traps around the island of “Terceira” up to 200 meters altitude. The beneficial insect survey was conducted using the beating technique. For diseases, a direct sampling was carried out by the observation of 10 % of the plants in each orchard or vineyard plot looking for visible symptoms. In apples and vineyards, flowers and branches were collected and tested for microorganisms using serologic and molecular techniques (Elisa and PCR). In banana plantations, the most damaging pests were banana weevil, thrips and a fungi complex that causes symptoms similar to Fusarium wilt. In chestnut, the pest that causes the most severe damage, affecting around 40 % of the nuts produced, is the Chestnut tortrix, but there were some difficulties in identifying which of the three known species was present in the Azores islands. In vineyards, diseases that are most frequent and important include grapevine downy mildew, powdery mildew and Botrytis. Invertebrate pests included grape leafhoppers, thrips and eriophyid mites. The European <b>vine</b> <b>moth</b> was also surveyed but none were found and is still not present. In apple orchards the most important problems were thrips, mites, oriental fruit moth and codling moth. Anarsia lineatella Zeller, the peach twig borer, was not detected and new Eriophyid species have been recorded {{for the first time in}} the Azores as a result of the surveys. With the information collected it was possible to create a phytossanitary diagnostic database for the Macaronesian islands (PROFITOMAC) on the project internet pages (www. interfruta. uac. pt), to help users to identify problems that affect the studied cultures...|$|E
40|$|The <b>vine</b> bud <b>moth,</b> Theresimima ampellophaga is {{considered}} as a pest species of the grapevine Vitis vinifera in Bulgaria. Delta sticky traps baited with the main synthetic sex pheromone compound, (2 R) -butyl (7 Z) -tetradecenoate, of Th. ampellophaga were used for detection and seasonal monitoring of this species in vineyards at four sites in Bulgaria – Lozitsa village (Municipality Nikopol) (northern Bulgaria) and Gornoslav village (Municipality Asenovgrad) in 2015 and 2016, and Plovdiv town and Krumovo village (Municipality Rodopi) (southern Bulgaria) in 2015. Catches of Th. ampellophaga males were recorded only in the villages of Lozitsa and Gornoslav. These are new distributional records for this species in Bulgaria. At these two sites, only one generation of Th. ampellophaga was established in 2015. In 2016, one generation of this species was recorded in Lozitsa and two generations – in Gornoslav. The flight period of the moths {{of the first generation}} was from the end of May (Gornoslav) – middle of June (Lozitsa) to the second half of July at both sites. The moths of the second generation in Gornoslav occur at the second half of August...|$|R
40|$|Vineyards {{worldwide}} occupy over 7 {{million hectares}} and are typically virtual monocultures, with high and costly inputs {{of water and}} agro-chemicals. Understanding and enhancing ecosystem services can reduce inputs and their costs and help satisfy market demands for evidence of more sustainable practices. In this New Zealand work, low-growing, endemic plant species were evaluated for their potential benefits as Service Providing Units (SPUs) or Ecosystem Service Providers (ESPs). The services provided were weed suppression, conservation of beneficial invertebrates, soil moisture retention and microbial activity. The potential Ecosystem Dis-services (EDS) from the selected plant species by hosting the larvae of a key <b>vine</b> <b>moth</b> pest, the light-brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana), was also quantified. Questionnaires were used to evaluate winegrowers’ perceptions {{of the value of}} and problems associated with such endemic plant species in their vineyards. Growth and survival rates of the 14 plant species, in eight families, were evaluated, with Leptinella dioica (Asteraceae) and Acaena inermis ‘purpurea’ (Rosaceae) having the highest growth rates in terms of area covered and the highest survival rate after 12 months. All 14 plant species suppressed weeds, with Leptinella squalida, Geranium sessiliforum (Geraniaceae), Hebe chathamica (Plantaginaceae), Scleranthus uniflorus (Caryophyllaceae) and L. dioica, each reducing weed cover by > 95 %. Plant species also differed in the diversity of arthropods that they supported, with the Shannon Wiener diversity index (H′) for these taxa ranging from 0 to 1. 3. G. sessiliforum and Muehlenbeckia axillaris (Polygonaceae) had the highest invertebrate diversity. Density of spiders was correlated with arthropod diversity and G. sessiliflorum and H. chathamica had the highest densities of these arthropods. Several plant species associated with higher soil moisture content than in control plots. The best performing species in this context were A. inermis ‘purpurea’ and Lobelia angulata (Lobeliaceae). Soil beneath all plant species had a higher microbial activity than in control plots, with L. dioica being highest in this respect. Survival proportion to the adult stage of the moth pest, E. postvittana, on all plant species was poor (< 0. 3). When judged by a ranking combining multiple criteria, the most promising plant species were (in decreasing order) G. sessiliflorum, A. inermis ‘purpurea’, H. chathamica, M. axillaris, L. dioica, L. angulata, L. squalida and S. uniflorus. Winegrowers surveyed said that they probably would deploy endemic plants around their vines. This research demonstrates that enhancing plant diversity in vineyards can deliver SPUs, harbour ESPs and therefore deliver ES. The data also shows that growers are willing to follow these protocols, with appropriate advice founded on sound research...|$|E
