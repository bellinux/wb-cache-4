25|$|Despite {{having a}} Romanian network to assist him, Cătărău {{was still working}} for Russian interests. Beyond his {{involvement}} with Okhrana, he was possibly affiliated with the far right of Russian nationalism. Allegations thus surfaced {{that he was a}} sworn member of the Black Hundreds or the Chamber of the Archangel Michael, both being private militias created by Bessarabian landowner Vladimir Purishkevich. This account was backed by Zamfir Arbore, who recalled that he and Stelian Popescu of Universul newspaper had visited Cătărău in Bucharest. At the time, much was made of Cătărău's possible connection with nationalist leader Aleksei Aleksandrovich Bobrinsky. A rumor had it that the Russian diplomats made efforts to obscure the relationship, whereas Arbore openly alleged having seen Bobrinsky's <b>visiting</b> <b>card</b> in Cătărău's apartment. Another suspected Russian contact, cited by Romanian sources, was allegedly a Dolgorukov prince.|$|E

2500|$|Queensberry then {{publicly}} insulted Wilde by leaving, at the latter's club, a <b>visiting</b> <b>card</b> {{on which}} he had written: [...] "For Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic)".

Holland suggests that this wording ("posing ...") would have been easier to defend in court.|$|E
2500|$|Regulation of {{the medical}} {{profession}} also {{took place in the}} United States {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century, preventing quacks from using the title of Doctor. However, medical usage of the title was far from exclusive, with it being acknowledged that other doctorate holders could use the title and that dentists and veterinarians frequently did. The Etiquette of To-day, published in 1913, recommended addressing letters to physicians [...] "(full name), M.D." [...] and those to other people holding doctorates [...] "Dr. (full name)", although both were [...] "Dr." [...] in the salutation and only physicians were explicitly said to include their title on their <b>visiting</b> <b>card.</b> By the 1920s there were a great variety of doctorates in the US, many of them taking entrants directly from high school, and ranging from the Doctor of Chiropractic (DC), which (at the time) required only two or three years of college-level education, up to the PhD. All doctoral degree holders, with the exception of the JD, were customarily addressed as [...] "Doctor", but the title was also regularly used, without doctoral degrees, by pharmacists, ministers of religion, teachers and chiropodists, and sometimes by other professions such as beauty practitioners, patent medicine manufacturers, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Alexander Gardner (1821–1882) {{was born}} in Paisley, Scotland. He became an {{apprentice}} silversmith jeweller {{at the age of}} fourteen. Soon, Gardner found out that his interests and talents lay in finance and journalism. When he was twenty-one he left the jeweler's shop for a job on the Glasgow Sentinel as a reporter. [...] After only a year of reporting he was appointed editor of the Sentinel. A love of chemistry soon led him to experiment with photography. Deeply disturbed by the exploitation of the working class, and {{in the spirit of the}} early cooperative movements in Scotland, Gardner organized a utopian venture in the US called the [...] "Clydesdale Joint Stock Agricultural and Commercial Company" [...] in Iowa, however by 1853 many at the Iowa colony were sick and dying of tuberculosis (then called [...] "consumption") and the Clydesdale company was dissolved. In 1856, Alex, his brother James and seven others, including Alex's wife, Margaret (b.1824-d.?), his son Lawrence (b.1848-d.?), his daughter Eliza (b.1850-d.?) and his mother Jane, immigrated to the United States. Colleague James Gibson may have been one of the party. Alex sought out the renown Mathew Brady for employment, who hired him to manage the Washington D.C. Gallery. Gardner's business acumen and expertise at wet-plate collodion photography and particularly the [...] "Imperial Print", a 17 by 21 inch enlargement, brought Brady enormous success. The developed plates, which had typically been used as positives to create individual portraits called ambrotypes, were now being widely used as negatives, which employed the use of sensitized papers, making possible the production of unlimited copies of stereocards, album cards, and the increasingly popular [...] "carte-de-visite", or <b>visiting</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Irish {{healthcare}} {{system is a}} complex mix of public and private. The system is predominantly tax-financed (in 2013, 77 per cent of healthcare financing came from general taxation revenues); however, private health insurance and out-of-pocket payments are also used to finance significant amounts of healthcare expenditure. There {{are a number of}} different eligibility categories for public healthcare services in Ireland. Those in Category I (full medical cardholders) are entitled to free public health services but pay a co-charge for prescription items. Those in Category II are entitled to subsidised public hospital services and prescription medicines, but pay the full cost of other services including General Practitioner (GP) care. In October 2005, the GP <b>visit</b> <b>card</b> was introduced; GP visit cardholders have the same entitlements to free GP care as Category I individuals, but the same entitlements to all other public health services (including prescription medicines) as Category II individuals.
