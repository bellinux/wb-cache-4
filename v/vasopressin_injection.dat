40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect on vasopressin release of the intracerebroventricular injection of tachykinins in rats. The selective neurokinin (NK) - 3 receptor agonists [MePhe 7]neurokinin B and [Asp 5, 6 MePhe 8]substance P(5 - 11) evoked vasopressin release. Also eledoisin, physalaemin and kassinin, which show good affinity for central NK- 3 receptors, released vasopressin. On the other hand, neurokinin A, substance P and the selective NK- 1 agonist [Pro 9,Met(O 2) 11]substance P were devoid of activity. At doses releasing <b>vasopressin,</b> central <b>injection</b> of NK- 3 selective agonists and of the natural tachykinins never produced hypotension.

40|$|A {{bidirectional}} {{relationship between}} the immune and neuroendocrine systems is now widely accepted. Since {{it is well known}} that the thymus plays an important role in the regulation of the immune function, we decided to explore whether a lack of the thymic function may influence hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Eight-week-old female mice of both strains, nude and control BALB/c, were used to study: (a) the in vivo response of the HPA axis to several stress stimuli acting at either the hypothalamic (insulin administration and ether vapor inhalation), pituitary (CRH and <b>vasopressin</b> <b>injections)</b> or adrenal (ACTH treatment) level and (b) the in vitro response of hypothalamic fragments to high KCl (48 mM) stimulation. The results indicate that: (1) basal plasma ACTH and vasopressin levels were significantly (p < 0. 05) higher in nude than in control BALB/c mice, whereas basal plasma corticosterone concentrations were similar in both strains of mice; (2) although no significant strain-related difference in the stress-induced ACTH secretion in plasma was found, hypothalamic stimuli were able to induce a significantly (p < 0. 05) higher secretion of glucocorticoid in plasma in nude than in control BALB/c mice; (3) the pattern of in vitro hypothalamic CRH release was similar in both strains of animals; however, basal AVP output and that stimulated by 48 mM KCl were significantly (p < 0. 05) higher in nude than in control hypothalamic fragments, and (4) whereas hypothalamic CRH, pituitary ACTH and adrenal glucocorticoid contents were similar in both strains, hypothalamic AVP content was significantly (p < 0. 05) higher in athymic than in control mice. In summary, our results indicate that nude mice have an increased vasopressinergic function which could contribute to a normal HPA axis activity; thus, adult athymic mice of BALB/c origin could compensate, due to their increased vasopressinergic function, for a robust glucocorticoid release to protect themselves immediately after aggression. It remains to be determined whether this enhanced vasopressinergic function is a result of an early adrenal insufficiency due to congenital deficiency of thymic factors known to stimulate HPA axis function...|$|R

40|$|The A 1 noradrenergic neurones {{are known}} to project from the caudal ventrolateral medulla to the vasopressin-secreting neuroendocrine cells in the hypothalamus. They {{therefore}} represent a possible central pathway from the medulla to the hypothalamus for baroreceptor-initiated secretion of vasopressin. We tested this hypothesis in the anaesthetized rabbit. Muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyric-acid-receptor agonist, was injected into the caudal ventrolateral medulla to inhibit the A 1 noradrenergic neurones. Secretion of vasopressin, measured by radioimmunoassay, was initiated either by arterial haemorrhage or by constriction of the inferior vena cava. After injection of vehicle into the caudal ventrolateral medulla, or after injection of muscimol into nearby control areas, both haemorrhage and constriction of the inferior vena cava produced the expected elevation in plasma <b>vasopressin.</b> After <b>injection</b> of muscimol into the caudal ventrolateral medulla, secretion of vasopressin in response to haemorrhage and to constriction of the inferior vena cava, was completely abolished.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study we demonstrated that indomethacin potentiated the hydro-osmotic action of vasopressin in vivo. It was hypothesized that this action of indomethacin was due to its ability to suppress renal medullary prostaglandin synthesis, since in vitro {{studies have suggested that}} prostaglandins interfere with the ability of vasopressin to stimulate production of its intracellular mediator, cyclic AMP. In the present study this hypothesis was tested in vivo. Anesthetized rats undergoing a water diuresis were studied. In a control group, bolus injections of 200 muU of vasopressin caused a rise in urinary osmolality (Uosm) from 124 +/- 6 to 253 +/- 20 mosmol/kg H 2 O (P less than 0. 005). In a group treated with 2 mg/kg of indomethacin the same dose of vasopressin caused a significantly greater (P less than 0. 001) rise in Uosm from 124 +/- 7 to 428 +/- 19 mosmol/kg H 2 O. Medullary tissue cyclic AMP rose from 9. 4 +/- 0. 9 to 13. 4 +/- 1. 7 (P less than 0. 05) pmol/mg tissue protein after vasopressin administration in animals receiving no indomethacin, while in indomethacin-treated animals there was a significantly greater rise (P less than 0. 001) in medullary cyclic AMP from 10. 4 +/- 0. 9 to 21. 6 +/- 2. 1 pmol/mg tissue protein in response to the <b>vasopressin</b> <b>injections.</b> In neither control animals nor indomethacin-treated animals were there significant changes in renal hemodynamics, as measured by clearance techniques. Indomethacin, when given alone, had no effect on Uosm or medullary tissue cyclic AMP. Indomethacin did, however, reduce medullary prostaglandin E content from 84. 7 +/- 15. 0 to 15. 6 +/- 4. 3 pg/mg tissue. This study has shown that indomethacin, in a dose which suppresses medullary prostaglandin content, potentiates the ability of vasopressin to increase the tissue content of its intracellular mediator, cyclic AMP. Indomethacin caused no demonstrable inhibition of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. Therefore, it seems likely that indomethacin enhanced the ability of vasopressin to increase medullary cyclic AMP levels by causing an increased production rather than decreased destruction of the nucleotide. We conclude that this action of indomethacin contributes to its ability to potentiate the hydro-osmotic action of vasopressin in vivo. A corollary to this conclusion is that endogenous medullary prostaglandin E's may be significant physiological modulators of the renal response to vasopressin...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with lysine vasopressin's (LVP's) behavioural activity. Chapter One describes vasopressin's synthesis, secretion, metabolism, pressor, antidiuretic and putative corticotrophic functions with emphasis on behaviourally significant aspects. Chapter Two reviews behavioural data showing that manipulations of endogenous vasopressin levels alter subsequent avoidance performance. Although these data have predominantly been interpreted in favour of vasopressin altering memory formation (consolidation) results reported from an experiment combining response prevention trials and <b>vasopressin</b> <b>injections</b> failed to support the consolidation hypotheis. Chapter Three reviews the response prevention literature and confirms the feasibility of using prevention trials with automated shuttle box training (Experiment One). LVP (1 µg/rat) injected immediately after training increased subsequent extinction responding (Experiment Two). Experiment Three showed that LVP (1 µg/rat) increased responding when injected immediately after prevention trials but decreased extinction responding when injected after 30 minutes of post training retention in the home cage or 30 extinction trials. LVP injections 30 minutes after training and immediately after prevention trials increased suppression of concurrent lever press responding 24 hours later (Experiment Four). Manipulating the training-injection interval after automated training yielded maximal response reductions with a 60 minute interval (Experiment Five) with indications of a negative dose response curve for higher (2 - 4 µg/rat) doses (Experiment Six). Manual shuttle box tests showed that with a 30 minute training-injection interval subsequent extinction responding varied as an inverted "U" shaped function of the LVP dose (Experiment Seven). Opposite effects of 0. 11 µg/rat and 2. 97 µg/rat were confirmed with higher training shock levels (Experiment Nine). A further experiment (Experiment Eight) revealed a complex interaction between dose and injection interval. Extinction responding was also reduced by some doses of DG-LVP (Experiment Ten). Post training manipulation of cholinergic activity did not alter LVP's response reducing effects in well trained rats (Experiment Eleven) although some cholinergic involvement was indicated (Experiment Fourteen) in the response increasing effects of LVP (1 µg/rat) injected 30 minutes after training in poor avoidance learners (Experiments Twelve and Thirteen). Tests on the suitability of appetitive responding for exploring vasopressin's behavioural effects showed that both a variable interval (60 seconds) schedule and differential reinforcement of low response rates (DRL) schedule were sensitive to high LVP doses (3 - 4 µg/rat). The implications of these data for our understanding of vasopressin's behavioural effects are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Background. Compounds {{that block}} uterine {{oxytocin}} and vasopressin V 1 a receptors have a therapeutic potential in preterm labor and primary dysmenorrhoea. The orally active vasopressin V 1 a receptor antagonist, SR 49059, inhibits {{the effect of}} vasopressin on human uterine activity in vivo, but the influence on the response to oxytocin is unknown. Methods. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, four-dose comparison, the inhibitory effect of SR 49059 on oxytocin- and vasopressin-induced uterine contractions in humans was investigated. Sixteen healthy female subjects, who had previously undergone sterilization with tubal ligation, participated in intrauterine pressure recordings {{at one of the}} first 3 days of bleeding of two menstrual cycles. Intravenous bolus injections of 10 pmol/kg body weight of vasopressin (Period 1) and of 50 pmol/kg body weight of oxytocin (Period 2) were given 1 h before and 1, 2 and 4 h after oral administration of 0 (placebo), 25, 75 or 200 mg of SR 49059. The area between the recording curve and zero level of intrauterine pressure (AUC) was calculated. Vital signs as well as urine and plasma safety parameters were measured. The plasma concentrations of oxytocin, vasopressin and the study drug were also estimated. Results. The plasma concentrations of SR 49059 appeared to be dose related, with mean maximal values of 62. 0, 163. 7 and 468. 0 ng/ml in the 25, 75 and 200 mg dose groups, respectively, in Period 1 with vasopressin and 34. 4, 116. 7 and 418. 0 ng/mL, respectively, in Period 2 with oxytocin. Tmax was observed at about 1 h. The cumulative AUC over 50 min after <b>vasopressin</b> <b>injection</b> per se was significantly higher than that after oxytocin in spite of a five times lower dose and lower plasma concentrations. Pretreatment by SR 49059 caused a dose-related reduction in AUCs for vasopressin, whereas no such effect was seen for oxytocin.

The much higher potency of vasopressin compared with oxytocin on uterine activity in non-pregnant women at menstruation was confirmed.

40|$|Diversos estudos anatômicos e funcionais têm demonstrado que o núcleo paraventricular do hipotálamo (PVH) constitui um centro de integração neuroendócrina. O PVH está intimamente relacionado com a regulação da atividade simpática e com a secreção de vasopressina. A injeção intracerebroventricular de angiotensina II, carbacol e salina hipertônica promovem um aumento da pressão {{arterial}} devido a ativação do simpático e/ou secreção de vasopressina. Ademais, foi demonstrado que a desconexão hipotalâmica (DH) caudal ao PVH, realizada por meio de um corte no encéfalo na região do hipotálamo com uma microfaca em forma de baioneta, promoveu uma redução da pressão arterial basal sugerindo que as fibras interrompidas por esta DH, provavelmente oriundas do PVH, fariam parte da circuitaria neural responsável pela manutenção tônica da pressão arterial. Portanto, os objetivos do nosso trabalho foram determinar em ratos não anestesiados os efeitos da DH caudal ao PVH (DH-C) sobre: a) a resposta pressora induzida pela injeção intracerebroventricular de angiotensina II (ANG II), carbacol e salina hipertônica (NaCl 2 M), b) o barorreflexo e quimiorreflexo; c) a excreção urinária após 24 h de privação hídrica. Ratos Holtzman (280 - 320 g) foram submetidos à DH-fictícia ou a DH-C aguda (1 dia) ou crônica (15 dias) que foram realizadas utilizando uma microfaca em forma de baioneta. A microfaca (raio = 2 mm, altura = 3 mm), adaptada no estereotáxico, foi posicionada 1, 5 mm caudal ao bregma que foi introduzida no cérebro até a superfície interna do esfenóide e submetida a movimentos giratórios de 90 à esquerda e 90 à direita. Para a DH-fictícia não se realizou a rotação da microfaca. Após a DH, foi implantada uma cânula no ventrículo lateral (VL). Após a cânula no VL (grupo agudo) ou 14 dias após a DH (grupo crônico) foram inseridos cateteres na veia e artéria femoral para o registro da pressão arterial e infusão de drogas, respectivamente. Animais submetidos à DH-C aguda não tiveram alteração na pressão arterial média (PAM) basal, mas tiveram aumentos na freqüência cardíaca (FC) basal (423 17 bpm) comparada com a FC basal dos ratos com DH-Fictícia (346 8 bpm). A DH-C crônica não alterou os valores basais de PAM e FC. O barorreflexo também não foi alterado pela DH-C aguda ou crônica. Com relação ao quimiorreflexo, embora o pico de resposta pressora e bradicardia induzidos pela ativação do quimiorreflexo não tenham sido alterados pela DH-C aguda ou crônica, a duração da resposta pressora foi reduzida nos ratos com DH-C crônica (182 s) comparada com a observada nos ratos com DH-fictícia (283 s). A resposta pressora induzida pela injeção intracerebroventricular (ICV) de salina hipertônica foi reduzida pela DH-C aguda ou crônica (73 e 212 mmHg vs. DH-Fictícia : 194 e 365 mmHg, respectivamente). A DH-C aguda e crônica também reduziu a resposta pressora induzida pela injeção icv de carbacol (123 e 213 mmHg vs. DH-Fictícia: 324 e 354 mmHg, respectivamente) e ANG II (123 e 122 mmHg vs. DH-Fictícia: 232 e 222 mmHg, respectivamente). Nos experimentos com privação hídrica, observamos uma maior excreção de potássio em ratos com DH-C aguda (DH-C: 1278248 Eq/ 24 h vs DH-Fictícia: 68287 Eq/ 24 h) ou crônica (DH-C: 1480281 Eq/ 24 h vs DH-Fictícia: 78775 Eq/ 24 h), respectivamente. Nos ratos com DH-C crônica o volume urinário excretado em 24 h de privação hídrica foi maior do que aquele observado nos ratos com DH-Fictícia (DH-C: 192 ml vs DH-Fictícia: 90, 4 ml), enquanto que o volume urinário excretado em 24 h de privação hídrica nos ratos com DH-C aguda não foi diferente dos ratos com DH-Fictícia. A excreção de sódio observada após a privação hídrica não foi diferente entre os grupos experimentais aguda ou cronicamente. Os animais com DH-C tiveram polidipsia a partir do 6 - 8 dia da DH-C, a qual perdurou até o último dia analisado (14 ou 17 dia). Nossos resultados demonstram que as respostas pressoras induzidas pelas injeções centrais de ANG II, carbacol e salina hipertônica, mas não o baro e quimiorreflexo, dependem de vias neurais interrompidas pela DH-C. Possivelmente a menor resposta pressora às injeções centrais dessas substâncias em ratos DH-C seja decorrente de uma menor ativação do sistema nervoso simpático e/ou secreção de vasopressina. É possível também que a menor secreção de vasopressina nos ratos DH-C seja responsável pela polidipsia observada nestes animais. Several anatomical {{and functional}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) constitutes a neuroendocrine center. The PVN is intimately related to the regulation of the sympathetic nerve activity and <b>vasopressin</b> secretion. Intracerebroventricular <b>injections</b> of angiotensin II (ANG II), carbachol and hypertonic saline induce an increase in arterial pressure by sympathetic activation and/or vasopressin secretion. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that hypothalamic disconnection (HD) caudal to PVN, performed by way of a knife-cut into the hypothalamus using a microknife of bayonet shape, produced a decrease in basal arterial pressure, suggesting that the fibers interrupted by this HD, probably from PVN, are part of a neural circuitry responsible for tonic maintenance of the arterial pressure. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine, in conscious rats, the effects of HD caudal to PVN (HD-C) on: a) the pressor response induced by intracerebroventricular injection of ANG II, carbachol and hypertonic saline, b) on the baroreflex and chemoreflex, c) on urinary excretion after 24 h of water deprivation. Male Holtzman rats (280 - 320 g) were submitted to sham-HD or acute (1 day) or chronic (15 days) HD caudal to PVN (HD-C) performed with a microknife of bayonet shape (radius = 1 mm, height = 2 mm) stereotaxically placed, positioned 1. 5 mm caudal to the bregma, lowered along the midline down to the inner surface of the sphenoid and the cut as achieved by rotating it 90 left e 90 right. In sham-HD no rotation was performed. After the HD, a cannula was implanted into the lateral ventricle. Femoral vein and arterial catheters were introduced after the surgery to implant the cannula into LV (acute group) or 14 days after HD (chronic group). Rats submitted to acute HD-C did not have changes in basal mean arterial pressure (MAP), but had an increase in basal heart rate (HR), (423 17 bpm) compared to sham HD rats (346 8 bpm). Chronic HD did not change basal levels of MAP or HR. Baroreflex was also not changed by acute or chronic HD-C. In regard to chemoreflex, although the peak of the pressor and the bradycardic response to chemoreflex activation were not changed by acute or chronic HD-C, the duration of the pressor response was reduced in rats submitted to chronic HD-C (182 s) compared to sham-HD (283 s). The pressor response induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of hypertonic saline was reduced by acute or chronic HD-C (73 and 212 mmHg vs. sham-HD: 194 and 365 mmHg, respectively). The acute or chronic HD-C also reduced the pressor response induced by icv injection of carbachol (123 and 213 mmHg vs. sham-HD: 324 and 354 mmHg, respectively) and ANG II (123 and 122 mmHg vs. sham-HD: 232 and 222 mmHg, respectively). In the 24 h water deprivation experiments, we observed a higher potassium excretion in rats with acute HD-C (DH-C: 1278248 Eq/ 24 h vs sham-HD: 68287 Eq/ 24 h) or chronic (DH-C: 1480281 Eq/ 24 h vs sham-HD: 78775 Eq/ 24 h), respectively. In chronic HD-C rats the urine volume excreted in 24 h of water deprivation was greater than the one observed in sham-HD rats (DH-C: 192 ml vs sham-HD: 90, 4 ml), while the urinary volume excreted in 24 h of water deprivation in rats submitted to acute HD-C were not different from sham-HD rats. HD-C animals had polidipsia from the 6 th 8 th day after the HD-C, which was maintained until {{the last day of the}} experiment (14 or 17 th day). These results suggest that the pressor responses induced by central injections of ANG II, carbachol and hypertonic saline, but not the baro and chemoreflex, depend on the neural pathways injured by HD-C. It is possible that the lesser pressor responses induced by central injections of these substances in HD-C rats are due to a lesser activation of sympathetic activity and/or vasopressin secretion. It is also possible that the lesser vasopressin secretion in HD-C rats is responsible for the polidipsia observed in these animals...|$|R
