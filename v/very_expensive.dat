5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise <b>very</b> <b>expensive.</b> Nike-X thus relied on a few <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E

5|$|Central Independent Television had {{confidence}} in the project, so rather than the show being shot at their studios in Nottingham as planned, they granted Richmond a £2 million budget. This enabled it to be shot on 16 mm film, rather than the regular, less expensive videotape, and on location, making it <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> compared with most children's television. These high production costs almost led to its cancellation {{at the end of}} the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.|$|E
5|$|In Byzantium, the {{elementary}} school teacher occupied a low social position and taught mainly from simple fairy tale books (Aesop's Fables were often used). However, the grammarian and rhetorician, teachers responsible for the following two phases of education, were more respected. These used classical Greek texts like Homer's Iliad or Odyssey and {{much of their time}} was taken with detailed word-for-word explication. Books were rare and <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> and likely only possessed by teachers who dictated passages to students.|$|E

5000|$|Space {{partitioning}} {{is particularly}} important in computer graphics, especially heavily used in ray tracing, where it is frequently used to organize the objects in a virtual scene.

5|$|Italian silk cloth was <b>very</b> <b>expensive,</b> as much {{a result}} {{of the cost of the}} raw {{material}} as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable to keep up with the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials. These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X {{had been}} {{defined in the}} early 1960s as a system to defend US cities and {{industrial}} centers against a heavy Soviet attack during the 1970s. By 1965 the growing fleets of ICBMs in the inventories of both the US and USSR were making the cost of such a system <b>very</b> <b>expensive.</b> NIE 11-8-63, published 18 October 1963, estimated the Soviets would have 400–700 ICBMs deployed by 1969, and their deployment eventually reached 1,601 launchers, limited by the SALT agreements.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{a report}} {{on the quality of the}} walls around 1460 noted that on the north and east sides of Southampton, the walls were still too thin to block a cannon shot or for a man to stand on them; a wood and earth wall-walk had been built behind the walls, but this was proving <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> to maintain. This {{contemporary}} assessment of the weakness of the eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation – in places it was only 0.76 m (2.49 feet) thick, compared to a typical thickness in other English town walls of around 1 m (3.28 feet).|$|E

5|$|The most {{competitive}} undergraduate programs are Medicine with a 0.5% acceptance rate, Architecture and Urbanism with 0.6%, and Communication with 2%. Such high competitivity leads many {{students to take}} preparatory courses during or after the last regular high school year called cursinhos in Portuguese, generally privately offered or managed by some association or organization. Many private cursinhos have special classes focused on highly competitive programs like medicine, making them <b>very</b> <b>expensive.</b> It is common to find students admitted in Medicine, Engineering and other programs {{after several years of}} preparatory courses.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are <b>very</b> <b>expensive,</b> resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} work on Southampton's defences {{resulted in}} considerable improvements: {{by the late}} 14th century, the town was completely encircled by 2km (1.25 miles) of stone walls. Some existing buildings, including a dovecote, were reinforced and pressed into service {{as part of the}} defences. South Gate was built to protect the southern quays, with a wide archway, complete with parapets and machicolations. The building work proved <b>very</b> <b>expensive,</b> however, and despite the mayor and bailiffs enforcing contributions and assistance from the citizens, Parliament had to be asked several times in the 1370s to assist by remitting arrears of taxes owed by Southampton.|$|E
