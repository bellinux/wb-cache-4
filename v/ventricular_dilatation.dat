50|$|Septic shock may {{be defined}} as sepsis-induced low blood {{pressure}} that persists despite treatment with intravenous fluids.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} if the influence of digitalis on survival depends on the severity of cardiac dysfunction in heart failure (HF). Methods and resultsDoppler echocardiogram (DE) parameters were analyzed in 84 Wistar control (C) and 80 Wistar rats treated with 0. 1 mg/ 100 g/day of digitoxin (D) five days after coronary occlusion. The DE variables correlated with the survival of the animals were: myocardial infarction size, left chamber dimensions, fractional area change and E/A ratio. The animals were observed for up to 280 days. Mortality was worsened in rats in the D group with a myocardial infarction (MI) < 37 % and with better DE predictors of survival. Digitoxin was found to prolong survival in rats with an MIâ‰¥ 37 % and worse DE predictors. ConclusionFor the first time our study has shown experimentally that the action of digitalis glycosides can positively or negatively influence survival during treatment of HF. It prolongs survival of those in advanced state and compromises survival when there is less severity of the disease. In fact, the greater benefits occur when digitoxin was used in heightened <b>ventricular</b> <b>dilatations</b> and worse <b>ventricular</b> performance...|$|R

5000|$|The {{second heart}} sound (A2) tends to become {{decreased}} and softer as the aortic stenosis becomes more severe. This {{is a result}} of the increasing calcification of the valve preventing it from [...] "snapping" [...] shut and producing a sharp, loud sound.

50|$|Communicating hydrocephalus, {{also known}} as non-obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by {{impaired}} cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption {{in the absence of}} any CSF-flow obstruction between the ventricles and subarachnoid space.

Various neurologic conditions may result in communicating hydrocephalus, including subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage, meningitis and congenital absence of arachnoid villi.

50|$|Individuals with {{mitral valve}} prolapse, {{particularly}} those without symptoms, often require no treatment. Those with {{mitral valve prolapse}} and symptoms of dysautonomia (palpitations, chest pain) may benefit from beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol). Patients with prior stroke and/or atrial fibrillation may require blood thinners, such as aspirin or warfarin. In rare instances when mitral valve prolapse is associated with severe mitral regurgitation, mitral valve repair or surgical replacement may be necessary.

40|$|Abstract. Aging is {{associated}} with left <b>ventricular</b> hypertrophy, <b>dilatation,</b> and fibrosis of the heart. The Fischer 344 /Brown Norway F 1 (F 344 /BNF 1) rat is recommended for age-related studies by the National Institutes on Aging because this hybrid rat lives longer and has a lower rate of pathological conditions than inbred rats. However, {{little is known about}} age-associated changes in cardiac and aortic function and structure in this model. This study evaluated age-related cardiac changes in male F 344 /BNF 1 rats using ECHO, gross, and microscopic examinations. Rats aged 6 -, 30 -, and 36 -mo were anesthetized and two-dimensional ECHO measurements, two-dimensional guided M-mode, Doppler M-mode, and other recordings from parasternal long- and short-axis views were obtained using a Phillips 5500 ECHO system with a 12 megahertz transducer. Hearts and aortas from sacrificed rats were evaluated grossly and microscopically. The ECHO studies revealed persistent cardiac arrhythmias (chiefly PVCs) in 72 % (13 / 18) of 36 -mo rats, 10 % (1 / 10) of 30 -mo rats, and none in 6 -mo rats (0 / 16). Gross and microscopic studies showed left <b>ventricular</b> (LV) <b>dilatation,</b> borderline to mild hypertrophy, and areas of fibrosis that were common in 36 -mo rats, less evident in 30 -mo rats, and absent in 6 -mo rats.
