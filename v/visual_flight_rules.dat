5|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> on {{the river}} {{corridors}} by Manhattan {{have been subject to}} considerable debate since the 2006 New York City plane crash, in which New York Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle crashed into an apartment building while flying using <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> on the East River. This was the first aircraft collision over the Hudson River since 1976.|$|E
5|$|After a {{telephone}} discussion with a Casper weather briefer, Reid {{decided to take}} off despite the worsening conditions at the airport, {{and to try to}} escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward. He decided to file a <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) flight plan, and depart under VFR, to be better able to cope with the heavy weather in his immediate takeoff path and the vicinity of the airport.|$|E
5|$|Aviation {{interests}} {{have their own}} set of weather maps. One type of map shows where VFR (<b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules)</b> are in effect and where IFR (instrument flight rules) are in effect. Weather depiction plots show ceiling height (level where {{at least half the}} sky is covered with clouds) in hundreds of feet, present weather, and cloud cover. Icing maps depict areas where icing can be a hazard for flying. Aviation-related maps also show areas of turbulence.|$|E
50|$|For {{the pilots}} flying in {{accordance}} with <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> (VFR), it is significant to perform correct decision making for the weather as they have {{to stay within the}} specific VFR weather requirements. The pilot must make a ‘go’ or ‘no-go’ decision as to if he or she will embark on a flight and if they will continue on the flight when the weather deteriorates.|$|R
50|$|LifeLine {{helicopters}} fly {{throughout the}} State of Indiana. LifeLine's fleet consists of one MBB/Kawasaki BK 117 and five Eurocopter EC 145 twin-engine helicopters {{with an average}} cruise speed of 150 miles per hour. Every aircraft is equipped with Garmin GNS530 Nav/Com/GPS systems, TAWS/TCAS, weather radar, night vision goggles, and satellite phone capabilities. LifeLine is also an instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> (IFR) program which expands their response capabilities by enabling them to complete missions in weather conditions below <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> (VFR) minimums.|$|R
5000|$|The airport resides at an {{elevation}} of 3714 ft above mean sea level. It has one runway with a paved surface measuring 800 x 30 m. The runway is unlit and cannot accept <b>visual</b> night <b>flight</b> <b>rules,</b> nor instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|R
5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help {{determine whether or not}} various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, can be performed to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{indication}} that the aircraft's Ballistic Recovery Systems emergency parachute, designed to bring the small plane down safely, was deployed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane circled the Statue of Liberty before flying north up the East River and disappeared from radar near the Queensboro Bridge. The FAA confirmed that the plane was flying under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) and had attracted no special attention from air traffic controllers or NORAD before the crash. The aircraft took a hard U-shaped turn before it hit the building.|$|E
5|$|Flight 706 had {{departed}} Los Angeles just after 6pm, on route to Seattle, with scheduled stopovers in Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; Lewiston, Idaho; Pasco, Washington and Yakima, Washington. The F-4 Phantom was arriving at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro near Irvine from Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada. The F-4 pilot and all 49 {{passengers and crew}} aboard the civilian airliner died in the collision over the San Gabriel Mountains, near Duarte. Only the Radar Intercept Officer of the F-4 survived. The crash of RW 706 prompted the US Armed Forces to agree to both {{reduce the number of}} military aircraft operating under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> in civilian air corridors, and to require military aircraft to contact civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E
5000|$|Sabre AHP {{was built}} in 1976 to {{accommodate}} UH-1 [...] "Huey" [...] helicopters. In 1998, the U.S. Army conducted {{a study of the}} heliport at the direction of the U.S. Congress. $19.5 million was appropriated for improvements including widening the landing area to accommodate UH-60 [...] "Blackhawk" [...] helicopters. The Lane Construction Corp. was selected in 2000 to construct a new 1357 m concrete runway and a 1240 m parallel taxiway, along with three connecting taxiways, a <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> helipad and runway lighting.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was conducted using a piloted, motion-base simulator to determine wake vortex hazard criteria for {{two classes of}} jet transport aircraft. A light business jet and a large multiengine jet transport were represented respectively. The hazard boundaries were determined {{in terms of the}} maximum bank angle due to the vortex encounter. Upsets as small as 7 deg in bank angle were considered to be hazardous at breakout altitude (200 ft (61. 0 m)) for Instrument <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> (IFR) and at 50 ft (15. 2 m) for <b>Visual</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> (VFR) for both aircraft classes. Proximity to the ground was the primary reason for a hazardous rating. This was reflected in the reduction in the maximum bank angle at the hazard boundary and in more consistent ratings as altitude was decreased...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric {{analysis of the}} sense and avoid capability for an electrooptical system on unmanned aircraft. Our sensor analysis is based on simulated encounters from a new U. S. airspace encounter model that provides a comprehensive distribution of typical <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> (VFR) aircraft behavior and encounter geometries. We assess the exchange between the sensor field-of-view shape and detection range with the probability of intruder detection prior to near miss. This assessment also includes a trade-off analysis between field-of-view azimuth angle and probability of detection with fixed tracking technology (i. e. pixel array sensor and tracking algorithm). Initial results suggest that current standards are suitable for detecting larger aircraft but may not be ideal for small aircraft such as ultralights. I...|$|R
5|$|The game {{is set in}} a {{reproduction}} of 11,000 square miles of the San Francisco Bay Area. The player may land at or takeoff from the area's 46 airports. Weather conditions such as rain, wind and fog are simulated. Players share the game's airspace with up to 600 artificially intelligent (AI) planes, which fly and respond to the player in real-time. Real-time air traffic control (ATC) directs the player and the AI planes to prevent collisions. The player interacts with the ATC and with other planes by constructing radio messages with a menu. Three cockpit views are available: IFR (instrument flight rules), which allows the player to monitor and interact with all flight instruments; VFR (<b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules),</b> which features a larger windshield area but fewer flight instruments; and Virtual Cockpit View, which allows free look but features no interactive flight instruments. External camera angles are also available, and the player may ride as a passenger in any AI plane.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation was}} carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, precursor to the NTSB). It emerged that pilot Roger Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training, although had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules,</b> which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where he is going. However, {{on the night of the}} accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon, and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.|$|E
25|$|TH-57B: 45 {{commercial}} Bell 206B-3 helicopters {{purchased by}} the US Navy in 1989 as replacements for the TH-57A for primary training under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{results are}} {{reported}} of acoustic measurements {{made on the}} 747 aircraft during visual approach monitor evaluation approaches. This display is designed to improve approach and landing precision under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> conditions. The purpose of the acoustic portion of the test was to measure, evaluate, and identify the noise levels during various types of aircraft approaches. Six noise measurement sites were positioned on the centerline of the approach ground track. The six noise measurement stations on the approach ground track were positioned between approximately 1 and 6 nautical miles from runway threshold. The 1 -nautical mile point {{was chosen as the}} beginning of the ground track because it is specified as the approach measurement point in the FAA noise certification requirements. The 6 -nautical mile point was chosen for its proximity {{to the point where the}} approach is initiated...|$|R

25|$|Investigators {{concluded}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} non-instrument rated pilot's decision to operate under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).|$|E
25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{concluded}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} pilot's decision to continue operating under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), combined with his lack of experience in the aircraft type.|$|E
25|$|Before {{receiving}} a permit a student pilot may only practice dual instruction with an instructor. With a permit, a student pilot may fly solo {{under the supervision}} of a flight instructor and for purposes of flight training only. Only domestic day flying under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) is allowed under this permit and no passengers may be carried.|$|E
40|$|A {{team was}} {{chartered}} by the Alaskan Region Flight Standards Division, {{in the late}} winter of 2009, to study {{the last six years}} of Fatal and Serious Injury (FSI) accidents in Alaska and make recommendations {{to reduce the number of}} FSI’s. The study period chosen was Calendar Year 2004 through the end of Calendar Year 2009. During that period, there were 649 accidents, of which 97 were FSI accidents. The team's review determined that only 33 accidents, or 5 percent of the total accidents, were not survivable as equipped. Based on the autopsy results, 40 % of those deaths could have been prevented by enhanced aircraft crashworthiness. This equates to 45 peoples lives being saved, even without improvements in accident prevention. The leading cause of FSI accidents was stall/spin with 29 accidents, followed by Controlled Flight into Terrain with 23 occurrences. Next was <b>Visual</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> (VFR) <b>flight</b> into Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) with 19 FSI accidents. Many of the stall/spin accidents were the result of low level turning maneuvers, commonly referred to in Alaska as Moose Stalls. Eighteen of the FSI accidents involved an off-field takeoff or landing and 23 involved a willful violation of the regulations...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} almost fifteen years of {{political}} controversy surrounding changes to the rules and procedures by which aircraft conduct their flight within regional Australia. Decisions based on a predominately heuristic (rule of thumb) approach to design have had many adverse consequences for {{the integrity of the}} proximity warning function. A sound mathematical model is required to establish this function on a mature engineering foundation. To achieve this, the proximity warning function has been investigated as a hybrid-system. This approach recognises the dual nature of the design: that aircraft dynamics give rise to continuous mathematical models while the communication protocols controlling proximity require discrete mathematical approaches. The blending of each aspect has yielded a deeper insight into the operational limitations and failure modes of this function. The presentation of the thesis follows a design thread through the function. It begins with a description of existing standards and implementations. Risk models are then developed. The pilot interface is recognised as a primary design constraint. Mathematical models are then developed to describe the topology of flow, proximity dynamics, and the scheduling constraints associated with visual, voice, and data-link communications required by the proximity warning function. These analyses show that many aspects of design can be bounded by analytical formulae that bring new robustness to the design and resolve some of the misconceptions arising from the often inaccurate perceptions of present airspace operations. Failure modes, unaccounted for in existing designs are found to actually aggravate failure in the very situations in which the airspace design should be robust and should act to prevent collisions. In particular, there are divergences of performance between the demands required by the system design and the ability of the pilot to deliver such performances. In some cases, these failures may be traced to policy decisions such as service between Instrument <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> and <b>Visual</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> category aircraft. On the basis of the conclusions of this research, a formal engineering review of the proximity warning function is required to assure the containment of the likelihood of mid-air collision for all future operations...|$|R
25|$|The VFR-Over-the-Top (VFR OTT) rating {{allows the}} holder to fly above and between cloud, without visual {{reference}} to the ground under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> during the daytime. Pilots are required to takeoff from an aerodrome in normal VMC and VFR and land at the destination aerodrome under VFR. The cruise flight in between may be flown under VFR OTT flight rules.|$|E
25|$|The flight {{took off}} from Macaé at 17:19 local time. At the time, it was {{operating}} under instrument flight rules (IFR) with an {{estimated time of arrival}} at 18:02. After taking off from Macaé, the crew stated their intention to cancel their IFR flight plan and added that they wanted to continue the flight under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR). This cancellation was approved by an air traffic controller.|$|E
25|$|As {{parachuting}} is {{an aviation}} activity under the <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules,</b> {{it is generally}} illegal to jump in or through clouds, according to the relevant rules governing the airspace, such as FAR105 in the US or Faldskærmsbestemmelser (Parachuting Ordinances) in Denmark. Jumpers and pilots of the dropping aircraft similarly bear responsibility of following the other VFR elements, in particular ensuring that the air traffic {{at the moment of}} jump does not create a hazard.|$|E
50|$|The crew {{cancelled}} the aircraft's flight plan, {{which had}} specified operating under Instrument <b>Flight</b> <b>Rules,</b> and descended visually (under <b>Visual</b> <b>Flight</b> Rules); the aircraft hit {{a hill and}} was destroyed by the impact and subsequent fire.|$|R
50|$|In {{aviation}} training, a view-limiting device simulates instrument {{meteorological conditions}} (IMC) by restricting a pilot's field of view only to the instrument panel. They are worn by pilots who are working toward an instrument rating, which allows a pilot to fly into conditions that are less than favorable for <b>visual</b> <b>flight.</b> They are also used by instrument-rated pilots for practicing instrument flight to maintain currency for acting as pilot in command under instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{subjects}} taught in pilot training include: {{tactics of the}} branches of aviation, general aviation tactics, meteorology, air navigation, air traffic control, radio communications and culture in general, along with approximately 250 hours of flight. During the first year, the training is theoretical. During the second year, Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft are used for flight instruction. During the third the cadets are trained Aermacchi SF260EU for aerobatics, and later on Pilatus PC-7 for advanced flight tactics, including combat. Within each of these stages, the cadets are trained in aerial acrobatics, stage tactical instrument <b>flight,</b> <b>visual</b> flying <b>rules</b> (VFR), radio operations, among others, which increase in complexity as the cadets' training progresses. The first female aviator to graduate as a pilot {{in the history of}} FAM, Andrea Cruz, became a cadet at the Military Aviation School in 2007.|$|R
25|$|During normal {{operations}} (approximately 83% of the time), domestic aircraft use Runways 01L/01R for departure, overseas international flights use Runways 28L/28R, and arriving aircraft use Runways 28L/28R, {{taking advantage}} of the prevailing WNW wind coming through the San Bruno Gap. This configuration is known as the West Plan, and accommodates arrivals at a rate of 60 aircraft per hour. Under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules,</b> aircraft may safely land side-by-side essentially simultaneously on 28L/28R while maintaining visual separation.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that Kennedy fell victim to spatial disorientation while descending over water at night and consequently {{lost control of the}} aircraft. Kennedy did not hold an instrument rating and was therefore only certified to fly under <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules.</b> However, {{at the time of the}} accident the weather and light conditions were such that all basic landmarks were obscured, making visual flight challenging, although legally still permissible.|$|E
25|$|The time of {{departure}} for the accident flight was from Sorong to Kaimana at 12:45 P.M and estimated arrival at 13:54 P.M with the Second in Command (SIC) as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) as Pilot Monitoring (PM). The aircraft dispatch release from Sorong indicated that the flight was planned under the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). The destination, Kaimana, had no published instrument approach procedure. Terminal area operations, including approach and landing, were required to be conducted under the <b>Visual</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Rules</b> (VFR).|$|E
40|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>rules</b> are the {{overarching}} constraints {{that govern the}} operation of equipment on the International Space Station (ISS) and the Space Shuttle. There are thousands of <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> for ISS, all documented in Microsoft Word. Monitoring of <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> is currently done manually by flight controllers who are highly trained in understanding and interpreting <b>flight</b> <b>rules.</b> In this paper we describe a system that allows <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> to be expressed in a computer-understandable language and that then generates an automated monitoring system that connects to the ISS telemetry stream. For testing purposes we represented and monitored Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> for ISS smoke detectors. We describe how this <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> is represented in an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format that captures relationships between different pieces of raw telemetry. We describe a drag-and-drop editing environment that allows for easy authoring and debugging of the XML. We then describe how this XML file is translated into a monitoring capability that automatically executes the appropriate functions to validate or invalidate the <b>flight</b> <b>rule.</b> Finally, we show examples from actual ISS telemetry of the real-time monitoring of this specific <b>flight</b> <b>rule.</b> A <b>flight</b> controller interface has been designed using {{the next generation of}} mission control tools to allow easy configuration, manipulation and supervision of <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> monitoring.

50|$|At 13:53, {{after first}} being cleared to descend to 3700 ft over the bay, the Proteus crew {{contacted}} {{air traffic control}} again and cancelled their flight plan to operate under instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rules,</b> switching to <b>visual</b> <b>flight</b> rules; they then put the 1900D into a descent from 2500 ft to 2000 ft while making a 360° turn around the ship. At 13:56 the pilot of the Cessna contacted the flight information service at Quiberon as he passed Larmor-Baden and informed them of his intent to descend from 3000 ft to 1500 ft. At 13:57 the Proteus crew announced to the Lorient approach controller that they had {{reached the end of}} their 360° turn and asked to take a direct course for Lorient. After receiving confirmation of this request at 13:58, the two aircraft collided. Both aircraft immediately fell to the water, killing all 14 passengers and crew on board the Beechcraft, as well as the sole occupant of the Cessna.|$|R
