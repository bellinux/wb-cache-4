50|$|Additional {{sources of}} income for the lord {{included}} charges for use of his mill, bakery or wine-press, or {{for the right to}} hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland, as well as court revenues and single payments on each change of tenant. On {{the other side of the}} account, manorial administration involved significant expenses, perhaps a reason why smaller manors tended to rely less on <b>villein</b> <b>tenure.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Villeinage became {{progressively}} {{less common}} through the Middle Ages, particularly after the Black Death reduced the rural population {{and increased the}} bargaining power of workers. Furthermore, the lords of many manors were willing (for payment) to manumit their villeins. It had largely died out in England by 1500 as a personal status, but land held by <b>villein</b> <b>tenure</b> (unless enfranchised) continued to be held by what was henceforth known as a copyhold tenancy, which was not abolished until 1925. Villeinage continued in France until 1789.|$|E
40|$|Between {{the fourteenth}} and sixteenth centuries the terms on which {{customary}} land {{was held in}} England were transformed from hereditary <b>villein</b> <b>tenure</b> into copyholds and leaseholds. Historians have been uncertain about the precise nature, pace and geography of this transformation, and, indeed, the variety and fluidity of tenurial forms has caused some bewilderment. This article argues that the original <b>villein</b> <b>tenure</b> was displaced by one of four broad categories of customary tenure, a process which began immediately after the Black Death of 1348 – 49, i. e. much earlier than previously assumed. These rapidly emerging tenures were more dignified and attractive than <b>villein</b> <b>tenure,</b> due to the removal of servile language from their conveyances, the growing practice of issuing of a ‘copy’ of the land transfer as proof of title, {{and the development of}} monetarized rent packages. The preference for life tenures in western and central England, and for heritable tenures in the south east and east, is already clearly identifiable by c. 1400, and the reasons for these emerging regional patterns are analysed...|$|E
