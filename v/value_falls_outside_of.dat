This method is {{also called the}} successive principle.The method involves placing uncertainties on all labor and cost estimations, {{on top of an}} estimation of the probable value. Minimum and maximum values indicate the range of uncertainty, also called the uncertainty analysis. The probability that the mean <b>value</b> <b>falls</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the range min and max must not be more than one percent.The time schedule estimation is based on assumptions, official or unofficial, e.g. on who will carry out a task, how the weather is or access to resources. The uncertainty is further dealt with in the parts which are most significant for the project's total uncertainty.Since there are many unknown factors in a project the range between min and max will be significant. The project's completion date and total costs will not be a mean value, but a probability assessment..." ...|$|E

Due to ‘numerical diffusion’—the combined effects of ‘cross-wind diffusion ’ and ‘artificial dispersion’—a numerical solution {{based on a}} first-order (upwind) treatment will smear out the sharp front. The use of higher-order schemes, e. g. QUICK (quadratic upwinding) reduces the smearing but can introduce non-physical oscillations in the solution. A common approach to reduce numerical diffusion without oscillations {{is to use a}} scheme that blends low-order and high-order approximations of the advective transport. Typically, the blending is based on a parameter that measures the local monotonicity in the predicted scalar field. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed for use in scalar transport problems where physical bounds CLowCCHigh on the scalar are known a priori. For this class of problems, the proposed scheme switches from a QUICK approximation to an upwind approximation whenever the predicted upwind nodal <b>value</b> <b>falls</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the physical range [CLow,CHigh]. On two-dimensional steady-state and one-dimensional transient test problems predictions obtained with the proposed scheme are essentially indistinguishable from those obtained with monotonic flux-limiter schemes. An analysis of the modified equation explains the observed performance of first- and second-order time-stepping schemes in predicting the advective {{transport of}} a step.

40|$|Theory {{development}} {{is essential for}} the generation and support of research ideas. Traditional Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) has been the modus operandi for testing research questions across many branches of science since the early 20 th century. The focus of a statistical test under the NHST framework considers the rejection or acceptance of a null hypothesis based on a conditional probability of the data given that the null hypothesis is true (i. e. a p-value). This approach provides no direct support for a specific theory, which often takes the form of an alternative hypothesis. Furthermore, rejection of a null hypothesis based on a p-value provides no information on the magnitude of a difference and is affected by sample size, alpha level, and effect size. Such dependency on p-values can lead to misunderstanding and misinterpretation of results and conclusions. Therefore, the limitations of NHST warrant the investigation and development of new, more rigorous approaches to theory testing. ^ A quantitative approach, called 2 ̆ 2 Testing Theory-Based Quantitative Predictions 2 ̆ 2 (TTQP), has been proposed using effect size indices and confidence intervals to directly test predictions posited by theory (Velicer et al, 2008). Effect size indices provide information regarding the magnitude and direction of an effect while confidence intervals provide a means of 2 ̆ 2 testing 2 ̆ 2 specific predictions. This approach is an iterative process, allowing the researcher to tailor the theory as empirical data is collected. The use of the TTQP approach contributes to the movement away from NHST and the reliance on p-values, while promoting a stronger and more informative method. A quantitative orientation represents an essential change in thinking about theory testing by emphasizing the numeric strength of a measure, leading researchers away from a simple binary accept/reject framework. Predictions are made relative to the specific measure/variable, but the use of effect sizes allows for comparison across studies and across theories. Therefore, the TTQP approach actually provides more information than traditional NHST. ^ The TTQP approach involves several steps. First, verbal descriptions of the expected values are designated a priori. These predictions are theory-based and guided by previous empirical findings (e. g. 2 ̆ 2 small effect 2 ̆ 2). Second, verbal predictions are translated into quantitative values based on traditional guidelines or empirical results (e. g. 2 ̆ 20. 012 ̆ 2). Then, observed effect size estimates with surrounding confidence intervals are generated from sample data. If a confidence interval contains the predicted value, the prediction is confirmed. If the predicted <b>value</b> <b>falls</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the confidence interval, the prediction is not confirmed and explanations for failed predictions are examined. ^ The current study replicated findings from Velicer et al. (2008) and extended previous research by generating predictions for new health behaviors: diet and sun exposure. Secondary analyses were performed on cross-sectional data from a multiple health risk behavioral intervention. Predictions for each behavior varied slightly depending {{on the nature of the}} behavior and represented the major constructs of the Transtheoretical Model: decisional balance, self-efficacy, and processes of behavior change. Effect size indices were represented as ω 2 and 99...|$|E

The monitoring of fetal arrhythmias during the prenatal and intrapartum periods will be discussed {{with reference to the}} following case history. l Case history The patient is a 31 years old gravida V, para III, with a history of incompetant cervix, diagnosed in the 16 th week of pregnancy and treated by cer-clage. An uncomplicated pregnancy ensued until a fetal arrhythmia resulted in the referral to oür unit during the 36 th week of pregnancy. On admission, a satisfactory fetal heart rate tracing was not obtainable with the three non-invasive methods attempted. (ÜOPPLER ultrasound, phono-cardiography, abdominal ECG) (Fig. 1). Auscultation revealed a fetal rhythm of alternating bigeminy and trigeminy. l. 1 Antepartum monitoring To obtain a tracing of the fetal arrhythmia, an electronical modification in the program of the HEWLETT PACKARD 8020 A cardiotocograph was necessitated. This modification was carried out äs follows: the HP 8020 A has certain electronical components which monitor the input values and then eliminate <b>values</b> which <b>fall</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the pre-programmed parameters (description to follow).

40|$|In some senses, landscapes are our heritage. They are touchstones of identity, {{defining}} {{who we are}} as a nation, as iwi and hapu and as communities. However, landscapes {{have become}} a battlefield as they are subjected to rapid and widespread change. Reaction to these changes is being vocalised in the streets, the media, in courtrooms and at a variety of recent conferences in New Zealand. A fundamental cause of the conflict is that formal methods of attributing significance to landscape, particularly as codified in legislation, have not kept abreast of emerging recognition of its rich and complex meanings. Additionally, decision-making processes relating to new developments tend to rely on expert assessments, largely overlooking the distinctive cultural heritage that arises from the close interactions between people and their landscapes. To achieve better management of the multiple interests in landscape, it is necessary to move beyond 'silo' thinking and to be inclusive <b>of</b> <b>values</b> that currently <b>fall</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> standardised assessment methods. &# 13; &# 13; Using the Cultural Values Model, this article suggests that conflict arises {{because of the lack of}} recognition of the range of values that may be implicit in any particular landscape. The model suggests that landscapes can be understood in an integrated way through consideration of forms, relationships and practices; the dynamic interactions between these; and the dimension of time. Aspects of landscape that are considered to be 'valuable' by experts or communities may arise from all or any of these components. Conflict in the landscape arises where certain components are ignored or given primacy over others. While conflict cannot be entirely avoided, the model offers a more integrated understanding of landscape values as a whole and thus the ability to anticipate where and why conflicts may arise...|$|R
