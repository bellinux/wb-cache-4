40|$|Injection rate of a {{gaseous fuel}} {{injector}} {{was calculated by}} measuring the needle valve lift history. In our lab, a gaseous fuel injection rate meter using 1 -dimensional pipe flow was developed. In the present study, the measurement accuracy of the injection rate meter was examined by comparing the theoretical injection rate estimated from the needle valve lift history. The needle valve lift was measured using an optical method. A small beam cut plate {{is attached to the}} needle valve of the gaseous fuel injector. A laser beam passes through the beam cut plate, and the variation of the beam intensity was measured with a photo sensor. From the beam intensity, the needle valve lift history was estimated. One-dimensional, compressible, inviscid, adiabatic flow was assumed, and the instantaneous mass flow rate through the needle <b>valve</b> <b>sheet,</b> the injector sack, and the injection hole was estimated. The estimated injection rate was compared with that obtained with the gaseous fuel injection rate meter. The estimated and measured injection rates agree relatively well even at transient duration. It is shown that the injection rate meter has high reliability and accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{magnetoresistance}} of IrMn based spin <b>valve</b> <b>sheet</b> films {{has been}} measured {{as a function}} of applied field orientation and temperature. Analysis of these angular resolved results allows the separation of the magnetic response of each ferromagnetic layer in the structure. Specifically, the data are fitted to a model of magnetoresistive response that accounts for giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effects between the two layers and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effects within each layer. Both the pinned and free ferromagnetic layers are assumed to be single domains. Additionally, the free layer is assumed to follow the applied field, while the pinned layer follows the vector sum of the applied field and the pinning field. From the fitting results, several parameters are separated quantitatively, including the resistance change associated with GMR and AMR effects, the misalignment angle for the pinned layer, the angular excursion of the pinned layer under external field, the average current direction and the thermal coefficient of resistance. This analysis can support the design of spin valve readers, especially when extended to the determination of the canting angle of the pinned direction for patterned devices. Index Terms—AMR, angular dependent measurement, anisotropy magnetoresistance, canting angle, giant magnetoresis-tance (GMR), IrMn, magnetic recording heads, memory device, spin valve. I...|$|E
40|$|Certain ceramic-like {{phosphor}} materials exhibit bright fluorescence with {{a pronounced}} temperature dependence over a range which spans the cryogenic to 1700 C, {{depending on the}} specific phosphor. To measure temperature, a surface, for instance a turbine blade, is coated with the material. An optical system, sometimes including optical fibers, conveys stimulating light and collects the emission for analysis. Either emission intensity or decay time may indicate temperature. Previously fielded tests have involved surfaces such as blades, vanes, pistons, in-take <b>valves,</b> <b>sheets</b> of galvanneal steel, etc. The fluorescent coatings may be applied to small parts via sputtering methods or to large areas by mixture with inorganic binders. Presented here are results characterizing fluorescence rise times {{as a means of}} determining temperature from ambient to 700 C for Y{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }:Eu...|$|R
50|$|By {{placing the}} control grid {{closer to the}} filament/cathode {{relative}} to the anode, a greater amplification results. This degree of amplification is referred to in <b>valve</b> data <b>sheets</b> as the amplification factor. It also results in higher transconductance, which {{is a measure of}} the anode current change versus grid voltage change. The noise figure of a valve is inversely proportional to its transconductance; higher transconductance generally means lower noise figure. Lower noise can be very important when designing a radio or television receiver.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the orientation of the crystalline matter the valves were studied in polarized light and in an X-ray diffractometer. The results indicate that the crystals are extremely well orientated with the optical axes perpendicular to the shell surface. All the sections studied in the transmission electron microscope show that the ostracod valve is built of small crystal units enclosed by organic membranes. The diameter of the crystal units generally is about 2 /<. The crystal units generally show no preferred morpho-logical orientation. Besides the calcite the ostracod valve consists of organic matter in form of a matrix. Organic sheets form a part of the matrix and lie parallel or subparallel to the <b>valve</b> surface. The <b>sheets</b> do not extend the full length of the valve, but continue only for a shorter distance. The morphology of'the pore canals is investigated in the scannin...|$|R
40|$|The 34 {{chapters}} of the 2 nd edition of How to Gain Gain give a detailed insight into a collection (54) {{of the most common}} gain producing, constant current generating possibilities, and electronic noise creation of triodes for audio pre-amplifier purposes. These chapters also offer complete sets of formulae to calculate gain, frequency and phase responses, and signal-to-noise ratios of certain building blocks built-up with this type of vacuum valve (tube). In all cases detailed derivations of the gain formulae are also presented. All what is needed are the data <b>sheet</b> <b>valve</b> characteristic figures of the triode's mutual conductance, the gain factor and the internal plate (anode) resistance. To calculate frequency and phase responses of gain stages the different data sheet based input and output capacitances have {{to be taken into account}} too. To calculate transfer functions and signal-to-noise ratios for any kind of triode driven gain stage, including all its bias setting, frequency, phase, and electronic noise influencing components, example Mathcad 11 worksheets as an essential simulation tool for each chapter allow easy follow-up and application of the respective formulae.
