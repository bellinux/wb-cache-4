Five days of rainfall caused severe flooding and mudslides, affecting about 3,252 families. Rivers and creeks swelled up, forcing communities to evacuate. In the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>country</b> to flooding, about 500 houses were damaged by the floods' onslaught, of which 400 were completely destroyed. The cities that were the worst affected by the flooding were Cayes, Cantaloupe, Camp Perrin, Chantal, Maniche, Holy louis of the South and Torbeck. The main road to the country's capital, Port-au-Prince, was blocked, in addition to other roads throughout the country. The Haitian Civil Protection Office initially attributed 18deaths to Noel in the country; two additional deaths were reported, one due to flooding and another due to being crushed by a tree. In total, 73deaths were reported in the country, while 17 others remained missing as of December 17. In addition, 7,500 in Haiti were displaced by the storm, and 104 were injued.|$|E

50|$|Bangladesh, with {{an area of}} 144,000 km2, {{features}} a flood plain landscape and several river systems throughout the country. This landscape provides the major natural resources of water, land, fisheries, forests, and wildlife. The country currently faces several environmental issues which threaten these resources, including groundwater metal contamination, increased groundwater salinity, cyclones and flooding, and sedimentation and changing patterns of stream flow due to watershed mismanagement. Some of these, such as the changing patterns of stream flow and presence of lead in groundwater, can be directly correlated with human activity and industrial processes, while others, such as cyclones and flooding are naturally occurring issues. Many of these issues are further exacerbated by climate change, which causes increased occurrence of storms and cyclones and rising sea levels. According to the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, Bangladesh is the 43rd most <b>vulnerable</b> <b>country</b> {{to the effects of}} climate change, and the 37th least prepared country to address these effects. There has been some government actions taken to address these issues.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we endogenize {{the timing}} of policymaking in a simple two-country model of {{strategic}} environmental policy. We consider a timing game in which two policymakers non-cooperatively decide their preferred sequence of moves before setting emission tax rates. We show that whether the policymakers implement emission tax policies simultaneously or sequentially crucially depends on the magnitude of environmental damages: When the damages are insignificant, the tax rates are strategic substitutes and the simultaneous-move policymaking emerges in equilibrium. In contrast, when the damages are significant, the tax rates are strategic complements and the sequential-move policymaking emerges. In addition, we extend the model by allowing for differences in the vulnerability to environmental damages between countries. When the differences are large, the unique equilibrium {{of the game is}} the situation where the less <b>vulnerable</b> <b>country</b> acts as a leader. In the case where multiple equilibrium emerges, the risk dominant equilibrium is also that the less <b>vulnerable</b> <b>country</b> leads. ...|$|E
