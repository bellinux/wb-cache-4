40|$|The {{economic}} {{meaning and}} the main points of the category "tax audit", the theoretical principles of the effective integral tax audit system creation with the well-developed infrastructure and provision, also the possibilities of the tax audit application as a mean of the tax compliance improvement and counte-raction to the tax offences are explored in the article. Thus the tax audit according to the author {{is one of the}} forms of the tax control realization at state, public and also in-house levels. He explores it as the integral system with the well-developed infrastructure and provision and the effective instrument of the state control tax system restructuring. One of the variants of restructuring is the duty assignment of separate organizations to carry out the external tax audit at legislative level, which is executed by the auditors (independent accountants), which got the applicable accreditation in the authorized state body, and then to give the proper conclusions to the taxes authorities and to execute all the recommendations according to the amendments of violations of the tax legislation found in the process of the tax audit conducting. For the establishment of a new concept of the tax audit arrangement is offered the following: the regulation of the tax audit at state level and the ordering of response of the subjects, who are controlled, to the results of the non-state tax audit; the legislative fixation of <b>vindictive</b> <b>damages</b> for unreliable auditors’ conclusions and establishment of joint or subsidiary liability of the auditing institutions for an low-grade audit; the introduction of obligatory insurance of auditors’ responsibility; the development of mechanism of quality control of auditors service by the self-controlled professional auditing institutions. In conclusion it is stressed that the development of the domestic tax audit must be based on the reconsideration of theoretical principles and the practical organization of audit in accordance with the modern requirements...|$|E
40|$|Tort law {{provides}} awards of {{punitive damages}} {{for reasons of}} deterrence and retribution. In light of a recent decision by the U. S. Supreme Court in Phillip Morris USA v. Williams, the retributive rationale for punitive damages will inevitably come under heightened scrutiny. The case involves a punitive award of $ 79. 5 million, which is ninety-seven {{times greater than the}} compensatory damages, making it constitutionally suspect for exceeding the single-digit ratio between punitive and ompensatory damages. The Court, though, has never addressed the institutional issue in a case involving serious bodily injury or death, and so Williams poses a number of new questions. How can compensatory damages provide an appropriate baseline for evaluating punitive damages in a case of wrongful death, given that monetary damages provide no compensation to a dead person? What is the appropriate baseline? Any future deterrence provided by a punitive award cannot protect the decedent’s tort right, and so the award must be justified exclusively in terms of retribution. Is retribution inherently subjective and arbitrary, unless constrained by some objective measure such as the single-digit ratio between the punitive and compensatory damages? Or is there some way to translate retribution into dollars? These questions are not limited to wrongful death cases and must be resolved by any court trying to determine whether a punitive award is unconstitutional for exceeding the single-digit ratio. These questions can all be answered once retribution is tied to the inherent limitations of compensatory damages, which yields a method for quantifying this form of punitive damages. Based on government data and methodology for quantifying the social cost of a premature death, this method shows why vindication of the decedent’s tort right in Williams justifies the $ 79. 5 million punitive award. When formulated in this manner, <b>vindictive</b> <b>damages</b> satisfy the requirements of both substantive and procedural due process and provide a baseline for reviewing courts to determine whether any given punitive award, like one based on general deterrence, is excessive in violation of substantive due process. This method fully accounts for the reprehensibility factors that determine the constitutionality of a punitive award, while also explaining why the Court could defensibly rely on procedural due process to reverse and remand Williams back to state court...|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was, however, rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming {{back and forth across}} the harbour entrance in the fog as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore. During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously <b>damaging</b> <b>Vindictives</b> port propeller.|$|R
2500|$|The {{sentence}} was later reduced and, due to ill health, {{he was released}} at 11:35 on 26 September 1955. After his release he settled down at the Uhlandstrasse in Lippstadt, Westphalia. He later wrote an autobiography, Mein Leben (My Life), in 1957. Mein Leben was ghost-written by a committee of former Kriegsmarine officers headed by Admiral Erich Förste with Raeder's role limited to reviewing the chapters and either giving his approval or sending {{it back to the}} committee. Mein Leben was intended to be a sort of [...] "official history" [...] that would rebut the [...] "Nuremberg version" [...] of history, and hence the book devoted a disproportionate amount of space to attacking point by point the verdict of Nuremberg. One of the major changes that the committee imposed on Raeder was to suppress his feud with Dönitz, and instead presented relations between the two admirals as one of friendship, respect and mutual harmony. This was done largely to avoid repeating the situation of the 1920s where dueling memoirs by various Great War admirals blaming each other for the defeat had done considerable damage to the image of the Navy; instead there was to be a [...] "united front" [...] {{on the history of the}} Navy. In addition, there was a tendency in the 1950s to present Wehrmacht leaders as noble and high-minded and thus morally superior to the Allied commanders who had defeated them with the implication that the wrong side had won. Allowing Raeder to pursue his feud with Dönitz in print as he wanted to would have made him look petty, jealous and <b>vindictive,</b> and thus <b>damaged</b> the image of the Wehrmacht leaders as noble and tragic figures. Leaders of veterans' groups made it clear to both Raeder and Dönitz that they wanted a [...] "united front" [...] on history, and neither of them would be welcome at veterans' gatherings if they made their feud public.|$|R
