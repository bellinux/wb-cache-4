40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{examined the}} shape of the attentional gradient in three-dimensional space. Subjects performed a response-compatibility task in which they were instructed torespond to a centrallylocated target and ignore flanking distractors. The irrelevant distractors were presented at combinationsof seven different depths, three different horizontal separations, and three different <b>vertical</b> <b>separations</b> relative to the target. Depth was varied in a stereoscopic display viewed through polarized glasses. Overall, the size of the response-compatibility effectdecreased with increased separation in all three dimensions. Interestingly, the response-compatibility effect was larger for horizontal separationsthan for <b>vertical</b> <b>separations</b> and was larger for crossed disparities than for uncrosseddisparities. The results suggest an elliptical focus of attention, with steeper gradients in the vertical dimensions than in the horizontal dimensions. In addition, the results suggest, along the vertical dimension, a steeper gradient for objects located beyond the focus of attention relativeto that for objects locatedbetween the observer and the focus of attention. Over the past two decades, there has been considerable interest in the dynamics ofvisual attention. An important focus of this body of research has been the relation between the size of the attentional focus and processing efficiency.

25|$|According to the {{official}} accident report, after the first officer made his initial rudder pedal input, he {{made a series of}} alternating full rudder inputs.

If the first officer had stopped making these inputs at any time before the <b>vertical</b> stabilizer <b>separation,</b> the natural stability of the airplane would have returned the sideslip angle to near 0°, and the accident would have been avoided.

In {{addition}} to a spatial deficit, such patients have also been reported to have a non-spatial deficit in temporal processing. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these spatial and temporal deficits might be linked if the right temporal-parietal cortex is important in integrating spatial and temporal attention. In AF, a patient with an acute right temporal-parietal stroke, we replicated previous observations showing that he was biased to judge ipsilesional stimuli as occurring before contralesional stimuli. More importantly, for vertically aligned stimuli, AF more accurately judged the temporal order of successive ipsilesional than contralesional stimuli. Furthermore, his contralesional performance improved with stimuli with larger <b>vertical</b> <b>separations.</b> Taken together, these findings provide additional evidence that right temporal-parietal damage produces a processing refractory period for stimuli in contralesional space that extends in both space and time.
