40|$|Abstract. Accurate 3 D/ 2 D <b>vessel</b> <b>registration</b> is {{complicated}} by issues of image quality, occlusion, and other problems. This study performs a quantitative comparison of 3 D/ 2 D <b>vessel</b> <b>registration</b> in which <b>vessels</b> segmented from preoperative CT or MR are registered with biplane x-ray angiograms by either a) simultaneous two-view registration with advance calculation of the relative pose of the two views, or b) sequential registration with each view. We conclude {{on the basis of}} phantom studies that, {{even in the absence of}} image errors, simultaneous two-view registration is more accurate than sequential registration. In more complex settings, including clinical conditions, the relative accuracy of simultaneous two-view registration is even greater. 1...|$|R
