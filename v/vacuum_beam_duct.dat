Bellows chambers with a comb-type RF-shield to fit the <b>beam</b> <b>duct</b> were also developed in parallel. A specially designed MO-type flange was adopted for a connection flange. The <b>beam</b> <b>ducts</b> and the bellows chambers were installed into the KEK B-factory (KEKB), and the temperatures and vacuum pressures were observed during beam operation.

40|$|In J-PARC linac, at ACS (Annular-Coupled Structure linac) section, highest beam {{loss was}} observed. This beam loss is {{considered}} to be caused mainly by H 0 generated by ionization of H- by residual gas in the <b>beam</b> <b>duct.</b> The H 0 is further changed to H+ when penetrating the <b>beam</b> <b>duct.</b> We have developed a detector system consisting of 8 planes of scintillating fiber hodoscopes. Each hodoscope consists of 16 fibers of 4 x 4 mm 2 square or 4 mm diameter circle cross sections with 64 mm length. The upstream detector (4 planes) is separated from the downstream detector (4 planes) by about 1. 5 m to measure time-of-flight of charged particles.

40|$|At the 2. 5 -GeV {{light source}} of the Photon Factory, a large {{reconstruction}} around the straight sections has been accomplished in 2005. In the area over {{two thirds of the}} storage ring, all the quadrupole magnets and all the <b>beam</b> <b>ducts</b> have been renewed and rearranged to modify the lattice configuration. As a result, four short straight sections of 1. 5 m have been newly created and the lengths of the existing ten straight sections have been extended. The short straight sections are exploited for mini-pole x-ray undulators. A new undulator of VUV-SX is being designed for one of the extended straight sections. Since the successful recommissioning of the ring at October 2005, recovery of the beam lifetime has favorably progressed due to the vacuum scrubbing by the synchrotron radiation.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the vacuum design for the 3 GeV Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) {{considers}} several points of view which relates to the <b>beam</b> effects. The <b>vacuum</b> design of the low outgassing rate and the effective pumping configurations to obtain the lowest average pressure in the electron storage ring is to obtain the longer beam life time and the least of the ion trapping effect and the consequent problem of beam ion instability. The inner structure of the <b>beam</b> <b>ducts</b> provides the lower impedance which reduces {{the problems of the}} collective beam instability and the heating dissipation and damage to the vacuum components. The thin wall of the <b>beam</b> <b>ducts</b> and the bellows are designed for the sextupoles that offers the function of fast orbit feedback correction of the beam. The final performance of the third generation light source with low emittance will rely on the original design of vacuum systems for the electron beam.

40|$|A {{new type}} of HOM-damped cavity has been {{developed}} by collaboration between the Institute for Solid State Physics of the University of Tokyo and the Photon Factory (PF) of KEK. The cavity can absorb the higher-order modes (HOM’s) by silicon carbide (SiC) <b>beam</b> <b>ducts</b> attached {{at both ends of}} the cavity. Four old cavities of the PF ring have been all replaced with the new cavities. Since then, the new cavities have been operating stably, and there is no sign of the instabilities that may come from the HOM’s in the cavities. A maximum beam current of the PF ring is pushed up to around 800 mA with these cavities, whereas the record current achieved with old cavities was around 500 mA. The cavities of the same type are planned to install in Japanese high-brilliance VUV and soft X-ray light source, Super SOR. For this ultra-low emittance ring, we have newly developed a simple HOM damper with rod-shaped coupling antenna and coaxial waveguide. The damper is attached to side port of the cavity and can absorb several HOM’s which can not be damped by the SiC <b>beam</b> <b>duct.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{different}} spallation models {{implemented in the}} particle transport code PHITS on the shielding design of Transmutation Experimental Facility is investigated. For 400 -MeV proton incident on a lead-bismuth eutectic target, an effective dose rate {{at the end of}} a thick radiation shield (3 -m-thick iron and 3 -m-thick concrete) calculated by the Liège intranuclear cascade (INC) model version 4. 6 (INCL 4. 6) coupled with the GEMcode (INCL 4. 6 /GEM) yields about twice as high as the Bertini INC model (Bertini/GEM). A comparison with experimental data for 500 -MeV proton incident on a thick lead target suggest that the prediction accuracy of INCL 4. 6 /GEM would be better than that of Bertini/GEM. In contrast, it is found that the dose rates in <b>beam</b> <b>ducts</b> in front of targets calculated by the INCL 4. 6 /GEMare lower than those by the Bertini/GEM. Since both models underestimate the experimental results for neutron-production doubledifferential cross sections at 180 ◦ for 140 -MeV proton incident on carbon, iron, and gold targets, it is concluded that it is necessary to allow a margin for uncertainty caused by the spallation models, which is a factor of two, in estimating the dose rate induced by neutron streaming through a <b>beam</b> <b>duct...</b>|$|R

40|$|A novel {{rf shield}} {{structure}} for bellows chambers or gate valves in high-current accelerators is proposed. The rf shield has no thin fingers, but nested comb teeth instead at the inner {{surface of the}} <b>beam</b> <b>duct.</b> The comb-type rf shield has a higher thermal strength structurally than the conventional finger-type one.

An abrasion test in a vacuum using a test piece of the comb-type rf shield shows less dust generation compared to the finger type. Another preliminary test transmitting 508  MHz microwaves through a prototype rf shield in the atmosphere found no abnormal heating or arcing.
