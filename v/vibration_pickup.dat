40|$|Abstract − This paper {{addresses}} technical challenges unresolved in the calibration of angular <b>vibration</b> <b>pickups.</b> Primary and/or comparison calibration {{systems for}} angular <b>vibration</b> <b>pickups</b> {{can not be}} realised without the angular vibration exciter and the precision angular accelerometer suitable for the transfer standard. Recent attempts made to tackle these technical challenges and related achievements are introduced in this paper. Several air-bearing supported angular exciters had been machined and tested to improve their background angular vibration levels and instability conditions due to pressurised air flow characteristics A gross level of 0. 01 radian/s 2 -rms has been achieved. A new angular exciter whose rotational shaft the precision ball bearings support was designed and machined. This new model includes very improved performance characteristics, such as the reduction of size and mass, the extended frequency range, the efficiency of generated angular acceleration per unit current, much improvement of background vibration, and very low total harmonic distortion characteristics. Experimental results regarding those improved factors are presented in Section 2. The general features, including angular vibration-related, mechanical and electrical parameters, are summarised The first prototype angular accelerometer made by B&K {{has been used for}} the measurement of angular vibration in this work after it had been calibrated in KRISS, Recent measurement results of the sensitivity of the prototype angular accelerometer are presented in Section 3. The results are used to obtain the fitted model-based frequency response curve used for frequency compensation of measurements. Finally, test results, obtained to examine the transverse sensitivity characteristics, are presented. They reveal several technical issues that shall be resolved in the future...|$|R
5000|$|The {{sound of}} the speaker and cabinet {{is crucial to the}} {{sound of the}} {{electric}} guitar, so much so that it needs to be considered part of the instrument's tone. If the clean signal from a guitar amplifier or pre-amplifier is captured directly (i.e., before it is sent to a speaker cabinet) it will very often be rather brittle and thin, with no [...] "resonant" [...] depth, particularly if the guitar signal is from a string pickup (ie, the type used in a solid-body electric guitar). <b>Vibration</b> <b>pickups,</b> or microphone pickups, as used in many hollow body elctro-acoustic guitars, aren't as strongly affected. The result can sound excessively shrill, scratchy and fizzy, completely different from the smooth tones that listeners hear in recordings or live performances.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — These Vibration {{amplitude}} may {{be measured}} as a displacement, a velocity, or acceleration. Vibration amplitude measurements may either be relative, or absolute. The basic scheme of vibration measurement is outlined first. Descriptions are given of transducers devices which transform physical variables into equivalent electrical signals and of <b>vibration</b> <b>pickups.</b> The increasing demands of higher productivity and economical design {{lead to higher}} operating speeds of machinery and efficient use of materials through lightweight structures. How we can measure vibration or earthquake signal of any device is describe in this system. These trends make the occurrence of resonant conditions more frequent during the operation of machinery and reduce {{the reliability of the}} system. Hence the periodic measurement of vibration characteristics of machinery and structures becomes essential to ensure adequate safety margins. Accelerometers develop a voltage from a piezoelectric crystal that has a mass mounted upon it. When the mass fixed to the crystal vibrates from the motion of the device upon which the sensor is attached, the crystal generates a voltage proportional to the force applied by the mass as it vibrates with the machinery. While no external excitation is required for the sensor to produce its voltage signal, the signal is small (self-generated) and requires a preamplifier...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show the {{feasibility}} of the vibration displacement measurement due to harmonicexcitation by using strain gauge. The measurement method is based on the principle of vibration due to the harmonic motionof the base. The instrument consists of a seismic mass and a spring. Such spring-mass system is considered a mass endedcantilevered beam. The first mode natural frequency of the spring-mass system is equal to 8. 5 Hz. In this paper, the instrumentwas subjected to the harmonic excitation of the base. The relationships between the displacement and the output voltagewere investgated at the frequencies of 12, 15 and 19 Hz, respectively. It has been found that the output voltage from theinstrument is proportional to the displacement of the base measured by the <b>vibration</b> <b>pickup...</b>|$|E
40|$|We used a new {{tactile sensor}} {{to measure the}} elastic {{properties}} of skin in patients with systemic sclerosis or Raynaud’s phenomenon. The sensor consists of a piezoelectric vibrator with <b>vibration</b> <b>pickup</b> to measure frequency changes when the sensor {{is placed on the}} skin. The mean frequency change at the skin surface of the proximal third phalanx in patients with systemic sclerosis was significantly lower than in age- and sex-matched controls. The results in systemic sclerosis patients were statistically correlated to the Modified Rodnan Skin Thickness Score. This technique was also used to measure the therapeutic efficacy of salpogrelate, a new specific serotonin receptor antagonist. A greater mean frequency change was seen after treatment. We conclude that this new tactile sensor is useful for quantitatively measuring skin sclerosis and may help determine the efficacy of therapeutic treatments...|$|E
40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of epicyclic gearboxes through vibration signature analysis, with particular focus on time domain methods {{and the use}} of adaptive filtering techniques for the purpose of signal enhancement, is the central theme of this work. Time domain filtering methods for the purpose of removal of random noise components from periodic, but not necessarily stationary or cyclostationary, signals are developed. Damage identification is accomplished through vibration signature analysis by nonstationary timefrequency methods, belonging to Cohen’s general class of time-frequency distributions, strictly based in the time domain. Although a powerful and commonly used noise reduction technique, synchronous averaging requires alternate sensors in addition to the <b>vibration</b> <b>pickup.</b> For this reason the use of time domain techniques that employ only the vibration data is investigated. Adaptive filters may be used to remove random noise from the nonstationary signals considered. The well-known Least Mean Squares algorithm is employed in an adaptive line enhancer configuration. To counter the much discussed convergence difficulties that are often experienced when the least mean squares algorithm is applied, a new unconditionally convergent algorithm based on the spherical quadratic steepest descent method is presented. The spherical quadratic steepest descent method {{has been shown to be}} unconditionally convergent when applied to a quadratic objective function. Time-frequency methods are succinctly employed to analyse the vibration signals simultaneously in the time and frequency domains. Transients covering a wide frequency range are a clear and definite indication of impacting events as gear teeth mate, and observation of such events on a timefrequency distribution are used to indicate damage to the transmission. The pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution and the Spectrogram, both belonging to Cohen’s general class of time-frequency distributions are comparatively used to the end of damage identification. It is shown that an unconditionally convergent adaptive filtering technique used in conjunction with time-frequency methods can indicate a damaged condition in an epicyclic gearbox, where the non-adaptively filtered data did not present clear indications of damage.

40|$|Some {{unbalance}} either inherent or induced {{is always}} to be expected in automobile wheels. It may be inherent due to imperfect balancing of the wheel {{or it may be}} induced by the uneven wear of the tires. While in motion this unbalance simultaneously sets up two vibrations in the wheel, one a linear vibration normal to the road and the other an angular vibration about the king pin. The frequency of these vibrations depends on the forward speed of the vehicle and when it coincides with the natural frequency of vibration of the wheels the well known phenomenon of resonance occurs. The research reported in this thesis is a systematic investigation of this phenomenon in one front wheel of an automobile with the other three wheels in true balance. Known amounts of unbalance (both static and dynamic) were introduced into the left front wheel and road tests were conducted over a range of speeds covering resonance. <b>Vibration</b> <b>pickups</b> on the wheels recorded both vertical and angular displacement as a function of speed. Response curves have been plotted with the amount and type of unbalance as parameters. Also an attempt has been made to establish some bounds for the amount of unbalance that are noticeable to the passengers while traveling through the range of resonance...|$|R
40|$|The angular {{vibration}} calibration {{system is not}} well established even in most of NMI’s. Moreover, it is not certain that suppliers of angular <b>vibration</b> <b>pickups</b> have well maintained the traceability of their calibration systems, unlike the linear vibration calibration systems well established in the industrial sector. This paper points out several technical issues encountered in setting up the {{angular vibration}} calibration system in KRISS. The first {{was to develop a}} new angular vibration exciter that is not commercialized yet. The angular vibration calibration system can not do without the angular vibration generation apparatus. The multi-layered PCB manufacturing technology is exploited to make the rotating coil designed to generate the Lorenz force. The first prototype model of the angular vibration exciter built up in KRISS is illustrated in this paper. It is shown to meet the requirements of the amplitude stability, the total harmonic distortion, and the hum and noise components, recommended in Clause ISO 16063 - 15. Furthermore, it is shown the measured frequency responses that it can generate angular vibration over the frequency range of 5 Hz to 1 kHz (or more). Main features of the angle prism based interferometer set up in KRISS are addressed. Three uncertainty components are introduced and their evaluated uncertainty contribution is demonstrated. Those results are very useful to judge the measurement capability of the angle prism based interferometer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} of a new configuration of interferometry, Self-mixing Interferometry(SMI). SMI is attractive because it doesn 2 ̆ 7 t require any optical part external to the laser and can be employed in a variety of measurements, ranging from the traditional measurements related to optical path length like displacements, small-amplitude vibrations, velocity; to sensing of weak optical echoes, like return loss and isolation factor measurements; and also to a special feature for the interaction with the medium, measurements of physical parameters, like laser line width, coherence length, and the alfa factor. Because it is also a coherent detection scheme, the SMI operation is close to the quantum limit of received field and the minimum detectable amplitudes of 20 pm/√Hz or better are currently achieved upon operation on diffusive targets, whereas a corner cube allows half-wavelength counting mode or 0. 5 μm resolution on a dynamic range up to 2 m.
