5|$|Some sources {{assert that}} Mickiewicz's mother was descended from a converted, Frankist Jewish family. Others <b>view</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> improbable. Polish {{historian}} Kazimierz Wyka, in his biographic entry in Polski Słownik Biograficzny (1975) writes that this hypothesis, {{based on the}} fact that his mother's maiden name, Majewska, was popular among Frankist Jews, has not been proven. Wyka states that poet's mother was the daughter of a noble (szlachta) family of Starykoń coat of arms, living on an estate at Czombrów in Nowogródek Voivodeship (Navahrudak Voivodeship).|$|E
5|$|The Arabian Peninsula {{was largely}} arid and volcanic, making {{agriculture}} difficult except near oases or springs. The landscape was dotted with towns and cities; {{two of the}} most prominent being Mecca and Medina. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many surrounding tribes. Communal life was essential for survival in the desert conditions, supporting indigenous tribes against the harsh environment and lifestyle. Tribal affiliation, whether based on kinship or alliances, was an important source of social cohesion. Indigenous Arabs were either nomadic or sedentary, the former constantly travelling {{from one place to another}} seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. Nomadic survival also depended on raiding caravans or oases; nomads did not <b>view</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a crime.|$|E

25|$|According to the Torah, {{the tribe}} {{consisted}} of descendants of Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and of Leah. Some Biblical scholars <b>view</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> an etiological myth created in hindsight {{to explain the}} tribe's name and connect {{it to the other}} tribes in the Israelite confederation. With Leah as a matriarch, Biblical scholars regard the tribe as having been believed by the text's authors to {{have been part of the}} original Israelite confederation.|$|E
25|$|In this region, {{bordering}} the Sea of Galilee, was the highly fertile plain of Gennesaret, characterised by Josephus as the ambition of nature, an earthly paradise, {{and with the}} southern portion of the region acting as a natural pass between the highlands of Canaan, several major roads (such as those from Damascus to Tyre and Acre) ran through it. The prosperity this situation brought is seemingly prophesied in the Blessing of Moses, though textual scholars <b>view</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a postdiction, dating the poem to well after the tribe had been established in the land.|$|E

25|$|It has {{traditionally}} been considered less problematic to eat dairy products before meat, {{on the assumption that}} dairy products leave neither fatty residue in the throat, nor fragments between the teeth. Many 20th century Orthodox rabbis say that washing the mouth out between eating dairy and meat is sufficient. Some argue that there should also be recitation of a closing blessing before the meat is eaten, and others <b>view</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> unnecessary. Ashkenazi Jews following kabbalistic traditions, based on the Zohar, additionally ensure that about half an hour passes after consuming dairy produce before eating meat.|$|E
25|$|The {{fate of the}} {{original}} fortifications is unclear. Henry II ordered that all royal castles {{be returned to the}} Crown. He had a policy of destroying adulterine castles, built without royal permission, during Stephen's chaotic reign. Initially, Aumale resisted the call to hand over Scarborough, which he had built on a royal manor, until Henry's forces arrived at York. The wooden castle vanished – William of Newburgh, writing near the time, claimed that the structure had decayed through age and the elements, battered beyond repair on the windswept headland. Later interpretations <b>view</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> implausible and argue that Henry wanted to stamp his mark on Scarborough, by demolishing William's fort and creating a much stronger stone complex.|$|E
25|$|According to the Torah, {{the tribe}} {{consisted}} of descendants of Manasseh, {{a son of}} Joseph, from whom it took its name. Some critics, however, <b>view</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a postdiction, an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the tribe {{to others in the}} Israelite confederation In the Biblical account, Joseph is one of the two children of Rachel and Jacob, a brother to Benjamin, and father to both Ephraim, and his first son, Manasseh; Ephraim received the blessing of the firstborn, although Manasseh was the eldest, because Jacob foresaw that Ephraim's descendants would be greater than his brother's. Here the blessing of the first son was conferred by a grandfather rather than by the father, despite prevailing custom (great patriarchs supersede custom).|$|E

25|$|Although, {{according}} to textual scholars, {{the only source}} texts among those comprising the Torah which mention the shewbread are the Holiness Code and later additions to the priestly source, the antiquity of the practice is shown by its mention in the Books of Samuel which textual scholars generally view as predating the priestly source. In the Books of Samuel, Ahimelek is described as asking for an assurance that David's men were in a ritually pure state, namely {{that they had not}} been involved in sexual activity with women, before handing over the old shewbread; biblical scholars <b>view</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> suggesting that the showbread was originally a sacrificial meal which was viewed as being shared with the deity, hence the need to be ritually pure, and the bread not being burnt but instead consumed.|$|E
25|$|In Portugal, {{the custom}} of giving a child four last names is getting popular, since this way a child can have each of their grandparents' last names. In Portugal and Brazil, some people <b>view</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a sign of snobbery, since {{it used to be}} the noble {{families}} who had a large number of surnames. (For instance, the Emperor Pedro I of Brazil (also known as Pedro IV of Portugal) (1798–1834) had the full name of Pedro de Alcântara Francisco Antônio João Carlos Xavier de Paula Miguel Rafael Joaquim José Gonzaga Pascoal Cipriano Serafim de Bragança e Bourbon, and his son, the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, had the full name of Pedro de Alcântara João Carlos Leopoldo Salvador Bibiano Francisco Xavier de Paula Leocádio Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga de Bragança e Bourbon). For the sake of simplicity, most Portuguese people have two surnames.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1974 Genie {{produced}} a few utterances with internal negatives, although she had specifically practiced {{all but two of}} these early sentences and one of the spontaneous occurrences was a partial imitation, and these sentences grew more common until she completely mastered their use by early 1975. Curtiss did not <b>view</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> linguistic movement, believing that Genie's grammar simply changed to place negations {{in the middle of a}} sentence. By {{the fall of}} 1974 Genie began differentiating between third-person pronouns such as he and she, but still had a high rate of error and did not use these, relative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns. She had used locatives after subject noun phrases for a long time, but only did so after an object phrase in late 1974. At around the same time she had begun to use more than one prepositional phrase in some sentences, and in the spring of 1975 she fully comprehended the preposition between on tests.|$|E

50|$|Laurence Schiffman <b>views</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a {{discussion}} of whether to rescue section of the sifre minim (Hebrew language texts of Jewish Christians) containing the tetragrammata from a house fire.

25|$|A {{potentially}} related issue {{involves the}} reference in the Synoptic Gospels to a three-hour period of darkness {{over the whole}} land {{on the day of}} the crucifixion (according to Luke 23:45 τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος - the sun was darkened). Although some scholars <b>view</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a literary device common among ancient writers rather than a description of an actual event, other writers have attempted to identify a meteorological event or a datable astronomical phenomenon which this could have referred to. It could not have been a solar eclipse, since this could not take place during the crucifixion at Passover, and in any case solar eclipses take minutes, not hours. In 1983, astronomers Humphreys and Waddington noted that the reference to a solar eclipse is missing in some versions of Luke and argued that the solar eclipse was a later faulty scribal amendment of what was actually the lunar eclipse of AD33. This is a claim which historian David Henige describes as 'undefended' and 'indefensible'. Humphreys and a number of scholars have alternatively argued for the sun's darkening to have been caused by a khamsin, i.e. a sand storm, which can occur between mid-March and May in the Middle East and which does typically last for several hours.|$|E

[...] Rosaline's absence is symbolic of his mother's absence and lack of affection for him. [...] Romeo's love for Juliet is similarly hopeless, for she is a Capulet and Romeo pursues his relationship with her; the difference being that Juliet reciprocates. This does not seem likely seeing as his mother died of grief after his banishment, indicating that she probably loved him deeply.|$|E

De humani corporis fabrica (On the Workings of the Human Body), by Andreas Vesalius, gave a new confidence to the role of dissection, observation, and the mechanistic view of anatomy.|$|E
