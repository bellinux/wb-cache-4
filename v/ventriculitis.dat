25|$|Other {{diseases}} of the ventricular system include inflammation of the membranes (meningitis) or of the ventricles (<b>ventriculitis)</b> caused by infection or the introduction of blood following trauma or haemorrhage (cerebral haemorrhage or subarachnoid haemorrhage).|$|E
50|$|Patients {{that have}} had {{invasive}} brain surgery or procedures {{are considered to be}} the most at risk for experiencing <b>ventriculitis.</b> Two procedures, in particular have been studied extensively due to their high rate of <b>ventriculitis</b> contractions post operation. The first group consists of patients {{that have had}} an external ventricular drain implanted to allow physicians to reduce the intracranial pressure they experience. The duration that the drain is implanted varies by necessity, however, the longer the drain is in, the more likely an infection will occur. The second group consists of patients that have an implanted intracranial stent. Both groups of patients have a much higher rate of <b>ventriculitis</b> than the general populace, though there is very little supporting evidence {{due to the lack of}} definition of <b>ventriculitis</b> as frequent misdiagnosis. Nearly 25% of patients with an external ventricular drain experience infection-based meningitis or <b>ventriculitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{definition}} of the condition that is <b>ventriculitis,</b> {{there is still a}} great deal that is not known about this dangerous condition. While other, similar conditions, such as meningitis or encephalitis, have been thoroughly researched, <b>ventriculitis</b> is a very loose grouping of conditions characterized {{by the fact that the}} lining of the ventricles is inflamed. Because no solid definition has been accepted across the medical community, research in the subject has been slow to progress. However, most common research into <b>ventriculitis</b> has been focused on the main points of causation, demographic information, and effectiveness of treatments and prevention methods.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} vary greatly, in part, {{because of}} the underlying or causing infection. While the inflammation can cause a number of effects such as those mentioned previously, the base infection could cause other symptoms that don’t necessarily {{have to do with}} the <b>ventriculitis,</b> itself. One of the challenges doctors face in diagnosing <b>ventriculitis</b> is distinguishing indicative symptoms, in spite of the wide variety of possible presentations of the disease. A great deal of emphasis is being put on research into better and faster ways to diagnose <b>ventriculitis</b> without the delay inherent with microbiological testing of the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ventriculitis</b> is {{commonly}} diagnosed {{using a variety}} of tests or procedures. When a physician suspects that a patient has <b>ventriculitis,</b> the first step is typically to ascertain the presence of the inflammation using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to “take a picture” of the brain. The scans allow physicians to check for “intraventricular debris and pus, abnormal periventricular and subependymal signal intensity, and enhancement of the ventricular lining,” all of which indicate the likelihood of <b>ventriculitis.</b> MRIs have been reported as being highly effective and sensitive in detecting such indicators, even from an early stage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ventriculitis</b> is the {{inflammation}} of the ventricles in the brain. The ventricles are responsible for containing and circulating cerebrospinal fluid throughout the brain. <b>Ventriculitis</b> is caused by infection of the ventricles, leading to swelling and inflammation. This is especially prevalent in patients with external ventricular drains and intraventricular stents. <b>Ventriculitis</b> can cause {{a wide variety of}} short-term symptoms and long-term side effects ranging from headaches and dizziness to unconsciousness and death if not treated early. It is treated with some appropriate combination of antibiotics in order to rid the patient of the underlying infection. Much of the current research involving <b>ventriculitis</b> focuses specifically around defining the disease and what causes it. This will allow for much more advancement in the subject. There is also a lot of attention being paid to possible treatments and prevention methods to help make this disease even less prevalent and dangerous.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ventriculitis</b> {{is caused}} by an {{infection}} of the ventricles, causing an immune response in the lining, which in turn, leads to inflammation. The <b>ventriculitis,</b> is in truth, a complication of the initial infection or abnormality. The underlying infection can {{come in the form}} of a number of different bacteria or viruses. The data seems to point to Staphylococci as the leading bacterial cause of infection leading to <b>ventriculitis</b> being present in about 90% of cases, but generally, what is of more concern is the way the infection entered the ventricles. The brain in its natural state is very protected from infection. The blood-brain barrier serves to keep pathogens from entering the sensitive areas of the brain. However, when those natural defenses are by-passed in the hospital setting, the brain is suddenly exposed to a host of potentially harmful bacteria and viruses.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{key areas}} of {{research}} for <b>ventriculitis</b> is discovering and defining exactly what causes it. There are many bacterial and viral infections that could cause inflammation of the ventricles, but researchers are trying to define which {{are the most common}} pathogens, the risk levels associated with various medical operations and procedures, and why the symptoms vary so much on a case-by-case basis. Answering these questions will allow doctors to not only better understand <b>ventriculitis,</b> but better treat and prevent it as well.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{there is}} very little {{understanding}} as to who is at increased risk for <b>ventriculitis,</b> other than those who have undergone neurosurgery or procedures involving brain exposure. Even then, current clinical practices can’t predict which patients will be afflicted. In order to predict which populations should be focused on, researchers must gather more case information about who is diagnosed with <b>ventriculitis</b> and how they present. In essence, the medical community must compile data of as many details as possible from each case so that more generalized conclusions may be drawn.|$|E
50|$|After {{determining}} whether a patient shows signs of <b>ventriculitis,</b> the doctor may choose to pursue a more specific and useful diagnosis to find {{the cause of the}} <b>ventriculitis.</b> This is done by obtaining a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, most commonly via a procedure called a lumbar puncture or spinal tap. For patients with an implanted external ventricular drain, cerebrospinal fluid can be collected from the drain’s output. After the sample of fluid is obtained, a battery of tests featuring gram staining will be performed to identify any offending pathogen or infection agent. The test will also determine any resistance the pathogen may have to antibiotics. By identifying the viral or bacterial cause of the <b>ventriculitis,</b> doctors are more able to effectively treat the inflammation and infection. This procedure is fairly effective, but is rarely able to isolate anaerobic organisms that may be causing the inflammation, giving cause for further research and procedural development.|$|E
50|$|There {{is great}} deal of variety in the {{symptoms}} associated with <b>ventriculitis.</b> The symptoms vary based {{on a number of}} different factors including severity of inflammation, underlying cause, and the individual patient.|$|E
50|$|Other {{diseases}} of the ventricular system include inflammation of the membranes (meningitis) or of the ventricles (<b>ventriculitis)</b> caused by infection or the introduction of blood following trauma or haemorrhage (cerebral haemorrhage or subarachnoid haemorrhage).|$|E
50|$|Early, cerebritis is seen, and {{multiple}} large cavities {{can be seen}} in the late stage of the disease; abscesses formation, contraction of the cavities, and hydrocephalus due to <b>ventriculitis</b> are observed in the late follow up.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that, though they present with similar symptoms and often occur in tandem, meningitis and <b>ventriculitis</b> are two different diseases, so physicians must be able to distinguish between the two. Meningitis is the inflammation of the protective lining of the central nervous system, called meninges. Because of the similar pathologies and cause of the two types of inflammation, they are difficult to differentiate using chemical testing, but show very different visual effects in both the MRI and CT scans, hence their use as a validation that the patient does, in fact, have <b>ventriculitis</b> and not another, but deceptively similar condition such as meningitis.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, {{it causes}} meningitis, {{but it can}} cause sepsis, <b>ventriculitis,</b> and cerebritis with 80% {{frequent}} multiple brain abscesses in low-birth-weight, immunocompromised neonates; rare cases {{have been reported in}} older children and adults, most of whom have underlying diseases.|$|E
50|$|Patients often {{present with}} headaches, painful cranial pressure, and neck pain {{early in the}} {{progression}} of the disease. Patients with a more advanced infection {{have been known to}} complain of many neurological effects such as dizziness, vertigo, confusion, and slurred speech. Very advanced cases can lead to mental instability, nausea, vomiting, rigors, and temporary loss of consciousness. Many patients with <b>ventriculitis</b> also experience some degree of hydrocephalus, which is the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid due to the inability of the ventricles to reabsorb and correctly circulate the fluid. Brain abscess is another common disorder resulting from the inflammation. If left untreated, <b>ventriculitis</b> can lead to serious inhibition of mental function and even death.|$|E
50|$|Arterial and venous infarctions are {{possible}} because of the bacterial infiltration along the main vessel; exudates within the ventricles and <b>ventriculitis</b> may obstruct the ventricular foramina and result in a multicystis hydrocephalus with consequent long-lasting shunting difficulties, and necrotizing meningeoencephalitis with pneumocephalus has been reported.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{research}} focused around prevention of <b>ventriculitis.</b> It is crucial that any procedure involving exposing the brain is performed with the utmost care, as infections in the brain are very dangerous and potentially deadly. When patients undergo such procedures, they are often monitored closely over the next several days to ensure that there were no infections and any instance of even a small headache is treated very seriously. It is also necessary to monitor the intracranial pressure of the patients often enough to observe significant changes that could indicate the presence of and infection and ensuing <b>ventriculitis.</b> It is important not to measure the pressure too often, however, as it could in fact lead to infection.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of <b>ventriculitis</b> is critical. If left untreated, {{it could}} lead to severe brain damage and even death in some cases. Currently, the only {{commonly}} employed treatments of <b>ventriculitis</b> involve an antibiotic regimen targeting the underlying infection causing the inflammation. Typically, the physician will order the patient be placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics in order to manage the symptoms and control the infection while the cerebrospinal fluid samples are analyzed. When a specific bacterial or viral cause is found, the doctor will change the treatment accordingly. There is some debate as to the most effective antibiotics and the best ways to introduce the drugs (e.g. intravenously, orally, etc.), however it is agreed that drug effectiveness is limited by the difficulty of non-invasively allowing the drugs to enter the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
50|$|The {{progression}} of the disease is also largely dependent {{on the nature of}} the specific case. Depending on the underlying infection, the way it entered the brain, and the type and timing of treatment, the infection may spread or withdraw on the order of months or days. <b>Ventriculitis</b> is a very serious condition and should be treated early to ensure as little lasting damage as possible.|$|E
50|$|Signs of {{gastrointestinal}} disease (Haemorrhagic Enteritis) include diarrhea, anorexia, melena and hematochezia. Anaemia and dehydration {{may develop}} secondary to this haemorrhagic enteritis. Signs of reproductive disease (Egg Drop Syndrome) include low egg production/hatching and the laying of abnormal eggs (size, shape, colour, texture). Adenovirus infection may infect other organs, causing a splenitis, inclusion body hepatitis, bronchitis, pulmonary congestion <b>ventriculitis,</b> pancreatitis, or oedema, {{depending on the}} species of bird infected.|$|E
50|$|Early {{and massive}} tissue {{necrosis}} {{is a specific}} feature of C. koseri brain infection. The early stage of the disease predominates in the white matter, causing cerebritis; the later stage is marked with necrotic cavities in multiple locations. The cavities are initially square in shape and not tense, but when pus forms and collects in these cavities, they tend to become more rounded in shape; a persisting cavity leads to septated <b>ventriculitis</b> that may result in multicyctic hydrocephalus.|$|E
50|$|As the Medical Director of CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda, Warf pioneered a low-cost, {{low-risk}} {{alternative to}} the typical treatment for hydrocephalus. This procedure is known as an ETV/CPC, a combination of endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization, which is now being performed in major children's medical centers throughout North America and internationally. In addition, Warf {{was the first to}} demonstrate neonatal <b>ventriculitis</b> as the single most common cause of infant hydrocephalus {{in that part of the}} world.|$|E
50|$|The EVD is {{a foreign}} body {{inserted}} into the brain, and as such it represents a potential portal for serious infection. Historically, the rate of infections associated with EVDs has been very high, ranging from 5% to >20%. Infections associated with EVDs can progress to become a severe form of brain infection known as <b>ventriculitis.</b> Protocols designed to reduce the rate of EVD infections have been successful, applying infection control 'bundle' approaches to reduce the rate of infection to well less than 1%.|$|E
50|$|So {{little is}} {{currently}} known about how <b>ventriculitis</b> should be defined and those it affects that even less can be known about prevention methods. While treatment is fairly standard for any infection to some degree, prevention {{is a different}} matter. One popular theory {{is the use of}} prophylactic antibiotics, administered during insertion of external ventricular drains or ventricular stents with the hope of preventing infection. The results of these studies have been more or less inconclusive {{due to a lack of}} standardized protocol, showing no significant benefit to using antibiotics as a preventative measure.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{diagnosis}} of nosocomial bacterial <b>ventriculitis</b> {{in patients with}} subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can be challenging. Methods We performed a retrospective study on the diagnostic accuracy of clinical and laboratory characteristics for the {{diagnosis of}} bacterial <b>ventriculitis</b> in 209 consecutive patients with an aneurysmal SAH admitted in a tertiary referral center from 2008 to 2010. Diagnostic value of clinical characteristics and inflammatory indexes in CSF and blood were determined for three diagnostic categories: (1) no suspicion for bacterial ventriculitis; (2) clinical suspicion for bacterial <b>ventriculitis,</b> defined as initiation of empirical antibiotic treatment for <b>ventriculitis,</b> but negative CSF cultures; and (3) CSF culture-positive bacterial <b>ventriculitis.</b> Results Empirical antibiotics for suspected <b>ventriculitis</b> was initiated in 48 of 209 (23 %) patients. CSF cultures were positive in 11 (5 %) patients. Within the group of suspected <b>ventriculitis,</b> only longer duration of CSF drainage and lower CSF red blood cell counts predicted for culture positivity. None of the other clinical features or inflammatory indexes in CSF and blood were associated with culture-proven bacterial <b>ventriculitis.</b> Conclusion Nosocomial bacterial <b>ventriculitis</b> in patients with aneurysmal SAH is often suspected but confirmed by culture in a minority of cases.

40|$|Nosocomial infections {{of central}} nervous system have high mortality, if they are due to Acinetobacter spp., the rate can {{be as high as}} 70 %. Intraventricular {{treatment}} of <b>ventriculitis,</b> caused by Acinetobacter baumannii can be considered as current treatment choice, because of this high mortality. Here in, we report a case of <b>ventriculitis,</b> caused by A. baumannii related to ventriculoperitoneal shunt. We used to treat both with intravenous meropenem, colistin, rifampicin and intraventricular colistin and gentamcin because of persistent <b>ventriculitis</b> after removel of the shunt and multi drug resistant blood flow infection of A. baumannii. The culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) became sterile with intraventricular treatment, but pleocytosis, fever and low glucose level of CSF persisted and chemical <b>ventriculitis</b> was considered to become. We continued the treatment with decreasing the dosage and increasing the interval of drug and were successful both in treatment of the infectious and chemical <b>ventriculitis.</b> The aim {{of this article is to}} report the successful treatment of <b>ventriculitis</b> caused by A. baumannii with intraventricular colistin in the fail of intravenous treatment, despite of reversible chemical <b>ventriculitis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} and outcome of external cerebral ventricular drainage-associated <b>ventriculitis</b> in neurocritical patients {{before and after}} the implementation of a bundle of external cerebral ventricular drainage-associated <b>ventriculitis</b> control measures. Design: Clinical prospective case series. Setting: University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. Patients: Consecutive patients were recruited from the ICU of the hospital. Patient inclusion criteria included presence of external ventricular drainage and ICU stay more than 48 hours. Intervention: The bundle of external cerebral ventricular drainage-associated <b>ventriculitis</b> control measures included 1) reeducation of ICU personnel on issues of infection control related to external cerebral ventricular drainage, 2) meticulous intraventricular catheter handling, 3) cerebrospinal fluid sampling only when clinically necessary, and 4) routine replacement of the drainage catheter on the seventh drainage day if the catheter was still necessary. The bundle was applied after an initial period (preintervention) where standard policy for external cerebral ventricular drainage-associated <b>ventriculitis</b> was established. Measurements: External cerebral ventricular drainage-associated <b>ventriculitis</b> prevalence, external cerebral ventricular drainage-associated <b>ventriculitis</b> events per 1, 000 drainage days (drain-associated infection rate), length of ICU stay, Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months, and risk factors for external cerebral ventricular drainage-associated <b>ventriculitis.</b> Main Results: Eighty-two patients entered the study in the preintervention period and 57 patients during the intervention period. During the preintervention and intervention period, external cerebral ventricular drainage-associated <b>ventriculitis</b> prevalence was 28 % and 10. 5 % (p = 0. 02) and drain-associated infection rate was 18 and 7. 1, respectively (p = 0. 0001); mean (95 % CI) length of ICU stay in patients who presented external cerebral ventricular drainage-associated <b>ventriculitis</b> was 44. 4 days (36. 4 - 52. 4 d), whereas mean (95 % CI) length of ICU stay in patients who did not was 20 days (16. 9 - 23. 2 d) (p < 0. 001). Furthermore, the length of ICU stay was associated with length of drainage (p = 0. 0001). Therefore, the presence of external cerebral ventricular drainage-associated <b>ventriculitis</b> and the length of drainage were the only variables associated with a prolonged ICU stay. Unfavorable outcome in Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months was not associated with the presence of external cerebral ventricular drainage-associated <b>ventriculitis</b> (p = 0. 5). No significant differences were found when Glasgow Outcome Scale was analyzed according to the two study periods.

40|$|Vancomycin {{and a new}} antibiotic, {{daptomycin}} (LY 146032), {{were tested}} in vitro and in vivo against Staphylococcus aureus. In vivo tests were performed with rabbits with kaolin-induced hydrocephalus. Five groups of rabbits were studied: untreated <b>ventriculitis,</b> intraventricular vancomycin only, and <b>ventriculitis</b> treated with intraventricular vancomycin (30 micrograms or 120 micrograms) or daptomycin (7. 5 micrograms). Results {{of this study were}} as follows. (i) S. aureus demonstrated static growth in cerebrospinal fluid in vitro and in <b>ventriculitis</b> at a maximum titer of 10 (5) to 10 (6) CFU/ml. (ii) In vitro time kill curves in cerebrospinal fluid matched those in vivo. (iii) Single-dose intraventricular vancomycin did not lower S. aureus concentrations over 8 h, whereas daptomycin did. (iv) <b>Ventriculitis</b> did not significantly alter the clearance of intraventricular vancomycin. (v) Intraventricular half-lives were approximately 2. 8 h (maximum) for vancomycin and 4. 5 h for daptomycin. (vi) Vancomycin was detectable in the periventricular white matter only in the presence of <b>ventriculitis.</b> Daptomycin was also detectable in the periventricular white matter of rabbits with <b>ventriculitis,</b> but in amounts too small to quantitate.

40|$|Children with {{temporary}} external ventricular drains (EVD) {{are prone}} to nosocomial infections. Diagnosis of bacterial meningi-tis and <b>ventriculitis</b> in these children is challenging due to frequent blood contamination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{and the presence of}} chemical <b>ventriculitis.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} compare diagnostic accuracy of presepsin (sCD 14 -ST), a novel biomarker of bacterial infection in CSF, to predict bacterial infection in comparison to the accuracy of established biomarkers like those demonstrated in biochemical analysis of CSF. We conducted a prospective study with 18 children with suspected bac-terial meningitis or <b>ventriculitis</b> who had 66 episodes of disease. CSF samples were taken from external ventricular drainage. We measured presepsin in CSF, as well as CSF leukocyte count, glucose, and proteins. CSF was also taken to prove bacterial infection with culture methods or with 16 S rRNA gene broad-range PCR (SepsiTest; Molzym, Germany). Infection was clinically con-firmed in 57 (86 %) episodes of suspected meningitis or <b>ventriculitis.</b> Chemical <b>ventriculitis</b> was diagnosed in 9 (14 %) episodes of suspected meningitis or <b>ventriculitis.</b> Diagnostic accuracies presented as area under the curve (AUC) for sCD 14 -ST, leukocytes, and proteins measured in CSF were 0. 877 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 793 to 0. 961), 0. 798 (95 % CI, 0. 677 to 0. 920), and 0. 857 (95 % CI, 0. 749 to 0. 964), respectively. With CSF culture, we detected bacteria in 17 samples, compared to 37 detected with broad-range PCR.
