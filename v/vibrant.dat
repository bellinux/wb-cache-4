5|$|Testaroli {{have been}} celebrated by Lunigiana-born Col. Primo Tomellini with a <b>vibrant</b> and vivid poetry.|$|E
5|$|Belgrade has a {{reputation}} for offering a <b>vibrant</b> nightlife; many clubs that are open until dawn can be found throughout the city. The most recognizable nightlife features of Belgrade are the barges (splav), spread {{along the banks of the}} Sava and Danube Rivers.|$|E
5|$|Lemarchand listed comic {{characters}} Doc Savage and Tintin, {{as well as}} Die Hard protagonist John McClane, as inspirations for the character. Drake's physical prowess {{was modeled}} on that of Savage, and his personality inspired by the <b>vibrant</b> color and globetrotting identity of Tintin.|$|E
5|$|The {{above is}} some of Whitehead's most evocative writing about God, and was {{powerful}} enough to inspire the movement known as process theology, a <b>vibrant</b> theological school of thought that continues to thrive today.|$|E
5|$|The {{culture of}} North Omaha thrived {{throughout}} the 1920s through 1950s, with several creative figures, including Tillie Olsen, Wallace Thurman, Lloyd Hunter, and Anna Mae Winburn {{emerging from the}} <b>vibrant</b> Near North Side.|$|E
5|$|As Chief Minister, Modi favoured {{privatisation}} {{and small}} government, {{which was at}} odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 <b>Vibrant</b> Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth 6.6trillion were signed.|$|E
5|$|As the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei {{began work}} on the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, for which his {{associate}} James Freed served as lead designer. Hoping to create a <b>vibrant</b> community institution {{in what was then}} a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate space frame of interconnected metal rods and spheres.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham has a <b>vibrant</b> {{contemporary}} literary scene, {{with local}} authors including David Lodge, Jim Crace, Jonathan Coe, Joel Lane and Judith Cutler. The city's leading contemporary literary publisher is the Tindal Street Press, whose authors include prize-winning novelists Catherine O'Flynn, Clare Morrall and Austin Clarke.|$|E
5|$|Coastal batik is {{produced}} in several areas of northern Java and Madura. In contrast to inland batik, coastal batiks have <b>vibrant</b> colours and patterns inspired by {{a wide range of}} cultures as a consequence of maritime trading. Recurring motifs include European flower bouquets, Chinese phoenix, and Persian peacocks. Noted coastal batiks are produced in Pekalongan, Cirebon, Lasem, Tuban, and Madura. Pekalongan has the most active batik industry.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{public and}} private affluence. Buildings have {{a wider range of}} purpose, and are {{expected}} to meet increasingly complex demands. For example, the new opera building (designed by Snøhetta) in Oslo reflects an ambition not just to build a <b>vibrant</b> cultural center, but also to create a new architectural icon in the Oslofjord.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Hammond B-3 organ {{became a}} {{critical}} part of the Baltimore jazz scene, led by virtuoso Jimmy Smith. The Left Bank Jazz Society also played a major role locally, hosting concerts and promoting performers. The popularity of jazz, however, declined greatly {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century, with an aging and shrinking audience, though the city continued producing local performers and hosting a <b>vibrant</b> jazz scene.|$|E
5|$|In the Netherlands, a {{particularly}} <b>vibrant</b> artistic culture developed. The work of Hugo van der Goes and Jan van Eyck was particularly influential {{on the development}} of painting in Italy, both technically with the introduction of oil paint and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation (see Renaissance in the Netherlands). Later, the work of Pieter Brueghel the Elder would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.|$|E
5|$|Max Eckhardt's Shiny Brite company {{manufactured}} colorful glass ornaments in {{a variety}} of sizes and shapes through the era. Packed in boxes by the dozen or half dozen, glimpses of the ornaments could be caught through the cellophane windows of the boxes' covers. The reds and greens of the past were supplemented with turquoise, chartreuse, orange, purple, and other <b>vibrant</b> colors.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the growth}} of Portishead's {{population}} {{can be attributed to the}} development of the former docks into a <b>vibrant</b> community. The former deep-water dock, used to supply coal and goods to the power stations, has been fully redeveloped into a modern marina with 250 pontoon berths.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth is {{also home}} to a <b>vibrant</b> music and arts community, {{including}} the Plymouth Center for the Arts, the Driftwood Folk Cafe, and three free summer concert series: The Project Arts Wednesday night series, the L. Knife and Son Thursday night series, and the Plymouth Independent Music Festival.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the removal}} of the Hawara roadblock, the casbah has become a <b>vibrant</b> marketplace. Nablus is home to the Palestine Securities Exchange (PSE) and the al-Quds Financial Index, housed in the al-Qasr {{building}} in the Rafidia suburb of the city. The PSE's first trading session took place on February 19, 1997. In 2007, the capitalization of the PSE topped 3.5 million Jordanian dinars.|$|E
5|$|The only finch in its {{subfamily}} {{to undergo}} a complete molt, the American goldfinch displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration; the male is a <b>vibrant</b> yellow {{in the summer and}} an olive color during the winter, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate.|$|E
5|$|A stylized {{flower of}} a Hippeastrum {{cultivar}} (under its common name of amaryllis) is used internationally {{as a symbol}} for organizations associated with Huntington's disease, a genetic degenerative disease of the nervous system. The widely used logo represents a double image of a head and shoulders as the flower of a growing and <b>vibrant</b> plant. The reduced size of the inner head and shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by Huntington's disease. The leaves represent the protection, purpose, growth {{and development of the}} Huntington's community worldwide in its search for a cure and treatment.|$|E
5|$|Ann Bannon {{was born}} Ann Weldy in Joliet, Illinois, in 1932. She {{grew up in}} nearby Hinsdale {{with her mother and}} stepfather, and had the {{responsibility}} of taking care of four siblings due to the family's financial problems. She took comfort in a <b>vibrant</b> imaginary life during this time and found solace in writing. Growing up, she was surrounded by music, particularly jazz, as her family hosted small recitals for friends and neighbors. One became a character in her books: a perennial bachelor named Jack who slung jokes and witticisms at the audiences.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} populous city of Bangladesh, Dhaka has a <b>vibrant</b> {{cultural}} life. Annual celebrations for Independence Day (26 March), Language Martyrs' Day (21 February) and Victory Day (16 December) are prominently celebrated across the city. Dhaka's people congregate at the Shaheed Minar and the Jatiyo Smriti Soudho to remember the national heroes of the liberation war. These occasions are observed with public ceremonies and rallies in public grounds. Many schools and colleges organise fairs, festivals and concerts in which citizens from all levels of society participate.|$|E
5|$|Ayers Rock's {{treatment}} by Australian radio stations during the 1970s {{was related to}} the popularity of AM. Unlike the US, which had a <b>vibrant</b> FM radio scene, in 1976 Australia only had ABC FM and a few community FM stations which primarily played classical music. Commercial AM stations, playing pop and rock music, dominated the local airwaves. The group established their reputation with live performances, exposure in print media, and word of mouth, with minimal Australian radio promotion.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's <b>vibrant</b> {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|Darren Craig {{directed}} the song's music video, which Candy envisioned as a satire on political and socioeconomic repression {{of women and}} misogyny. In the video, Candy appears {{with a group of}} oppressed women who rise up against a tyrannical man and shoot him with golden rifles. The visual attracted critical attention from media commentators, who discussed the possible inspirations for the women and the setting. Critics positively responded to the music video, complimenting it as <b>vibrant</b> and outrageous.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 13th century Khwarezmia was invaded {{by the early}} Mongol Empire and its ruler Genghis Khan {{destroyed}} the once <b>vibrant</b> cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. However, in 1370 the latter saw a revival as {{the capital of the}} Timurid Empire. The Turko-Mongol ruler Timur forcefully brought artisans and intellectuals from across Asia to Samarkand, transforming it not only into a trade hub but {{also one of the most}} important cities of the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{restricted}} by his experiences as an R sideman, Hendrix moved in 1966 to New York City's Greenwich Village, {{which had a}} <b>vibrant</b> and diverse music scene. There, he was offered a residency at the Cafe Wha? on MacDougal Street and formed his own band that June, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which included future Spirit guitarist Randy California. The Blue Flames played at several clubs in New York and Hendrix began developing his guitar style and material that he would soon use with the Experience. In September, they gave some of their last concerts at the Cafe au Go Go, as John Hammond Jr.'s backing group.|$|E
5|$|Flower was {{intended}} as a spiritual successor to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows a flower petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing <b>vibrant</b> color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Further west, {{the city}} of Chicago became the other major site in the {{development}} of early skyscrapers. In contrast to New York, Chicago emerged as a major metropolis only in the mid-19th century, growing from a village of around fifty inhabitants in 1830, to a city of 30,000 in 1850 and nearly 300,000 by 1870. Chicago became the railroad hub for the American West and the primary trading city for the emerging territories, famous for its commercial culture. It saw itself as different from the cities on the east coast and was immensely proud of its status as a growing, <b>vibrant</b> center.|$|E
5|$|Gaga's {{wardrobe}} {{throughout the}} entire video primarily consists of only one outfit which was designed by Gianni Versace. The dress consists of a S-inspired outfit, with heavy gold jewelry, studs on the leather, and <b>vibrant</b> nail polish and lipstick. Notable in the video {{is the absence of}} back-up dancers, elaborate choreography, or a symbolic plot: components that have all been predominant in Gaga's other music videos. Aside from Gaga herself, Clemons is the only other person to appear in the video.|$|E
5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more <b>vibrant</b> as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Jolin and Isaac Grünewald left Sweden for the <b>vibrant</b> life in Paris and its art community. The Swedish painter, {{graphic artist}} and {{forester}} Carl Palme knew Henri Matisse {{and helped the}} artist to find a suitable location for the new Matisse Academy. An abandoned nunnery in central Paris became the first home for the academy. Together with Grünewald and Leander Engström, Jolin joined the Matisse Academy, where their friends from Stockholm had already been accepted as pupils. At the Academy, Jolin would develop his sense for a stylish line in combination with bright and clean colours in his paintings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of 20th-century popular music, Baltimore first was a major center for the {{development}} of East Coast ragtime, producing the legendary performer and composer Eubie Blake. Later, Baltimore became a hotspot for jazz, and a home for such legends in the field as Chick Webb and Billie Holiday. The city's jazz scene {{can be traced to the}} early part of the 20th century, when the style first spread across the country. Locally, Baltimore was home to a <b>vibrant</b> African American musical tradition, which included funereal processions, beginning with slow, mournful tunes and ending with lively ragtime numbers, very similar to the New Orleans music that gave rise to jazz.|$|E
5|$|Many American {{cities and}} towns have <b>vibrant</b> music scenes which, in turn, support a number of {{regional}} musical styles. Along with musical centers such as Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, New York City, San Francisco, New Orleans, Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Nashville, Austin, and Los Angeles, many smaller cities such as Asbury Park, New Jersey have produced distinctive styles of music. The Cajun and Creole traditions in Louisiana music, the folk and popular styles of Hawaiian music, and the bluegrass and old time music of the Southeastern states are {{a few examples of}} diversity in American music. Modern day music is heavily influenced by previous and present African-American music genres.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{historical}} note, the Jewish {{community has}} figured centrally {{in the history}} of Transylvania, and in that of the wider region. They were a substantial and increasingly <b>vibrant</b> presence in Cluj in the modern era, contributing significantly to the town's economic dynamism and cultural flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although the community comprised a significant share of the town's population during the interwar era—between 13 and 15 percent—this figure plummeted {{as a consequence of the}} Holocaust and emigration; by the 1990s only a few hundred Jews remained in Cluj-Napoca.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as <b>vibrant</b> in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E
