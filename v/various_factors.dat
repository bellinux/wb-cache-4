5|$|During the 1990s, bulkers were {{involved}} in an alarming number of shipwrecks. This led ship-owners to commission a study seeking to explain the effect of <b>various</b> <b>factors</b> on the crew's effectiveness and competence. The study showed that crew performance aboard bulk carriers was the lowest of all groups studied. Among bulker crews, the best performance was found aboard younger and larger ships. Crews on better-maintained ships performed better, as did crews on ships where fewer languages were spoken.|$|E
5|$|For an implant {{to become}} {{permanently}} stable, the body must grow bone {{to the surface}} of the implant (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on <b>various</b> <b>factors)</b> was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|E
5|$|Medieval England was {{a patriarchal}} {{society and the}} lives of women were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary beliefs about gender and authority. However, the position of women varied considerably according to <b>various</b> <b>factors,</b> including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which part of the country they lived. Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men.|$|E

5|$|While genetic {{influences}} {{are important}} to understanding obesity, they cannot explain the current dramatic increase seen within specific countries or globally. Though it is accepted that energy consumption in excess of energy expenditure leads to obesity on an individual basis, {{the cause of the}} shifts in these two factors on the societal scale is much debated. There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of <b>various</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|E

The Pandavas assumed {{different}} identities and lived incognito in Virata Matsya Kingdom. The Kauravas wished to reveal Pandavas' real identities so that they would repeat another exile of 13 years in a cyclic fashion. The issues faced by the Pandavas and their wife Draupadi at Matsya due to <b>various</b> <b>factors,</b> notably Virata's brother-in-law Kichaka form the rest of the story.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{continued}} to do research on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, {{and the way in}} which <b>various</b> <b>factors</b> affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.|$|E
5|$|Between 1937 and 1938, Bishop {{studied the}} effects of <b>various</b> <b>factors,</b> {{including}} different substances in blood and different temperatures, on the feeding behaviour of the chicken malaria (Plasmodium gallinaceum) vector, Aedes aegypti. She also examined factors that contributed to Plasmodium reproduction. This work {{became the basis for}} subsequent ongoing research into a malaria vaccine. Her subsequent work was spurred by the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research aided the British war effort because the most prevalent antimalarial, quinine, was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies. From 1947 to 1964, she {{was in charge of the}} Institute's Chemotherapy Research Institute, associated with the Medical Research Council.|$|E

Stitched clothes, such as the shalwar kameez for women and kurta–pyjama combinations or European-style trousers and shirts for men, are also popular.

5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and helped save victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at <b>various</b> <b>factors</b> {{that contributed to the}} crash. The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the victims and their families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E
5|$|In {{supplying}} this demand, the ice trade increasingly shifted north, {{away from}} Massachusetts and towards Maine. <b>Various</b> <b>factors</b> contributed to this. New Englands' winters became warmer during the 19th century, while industrialisation {{resulted in more}} of the natural ponds and rivers becoming contaminated. Less trade was brought through New England as other ways of reaching western US markets were opened up, making it less profitable to trade ice from Boston, while the cost of producing ships in the region increased due to deforestation. Finally, in 1860 there {{was the first of}} four ice famines along the Hudson-warm winters that prevented the formation of ice in New England-creating shortages and driving up prices.|$|E

In giving recommendations for boundary changes over the years, the Committee has considered <b>various</b> <b>factors,</b> including using hill ridges, rivers and roads as boundaries rather than arbitrarily drawn lines; {{and the need for}} electoral divisions to have approximately equal numbers of voters so that electors' votes carry the same weight regardless of where they cast their ballots. In 1963, the EBRC adopted a rule allowing the numbers of voters in divisions to differ by no more than 20%. The permitted deviation was increased to 30% in 1980. It is up to the Cabinet {{to decide whether or not}} to accept the Committee's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Various</b> <b>factors</b> {{lay behind}} this sudden mass response. Economically, the news {{had reached the}} US {{at the height of}} a series of {{financial}} recessions and bank failures in the 1890s. The gold standard of the time tied paper money to the production of gold and shortages {{towards the end of the}} 19th century meant that gold dollars were rapidly increasing in value ahead of paper currencies and being hoarded. This had contributed to the Panic of 1893 and Panic of 1896, which caused unemployment and financial uncertainty. There was a huge, unresolved demand for gold across the developed world that the Klondike promised to fulfil and, for individuals, the region promised higher wages or financial security.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to <b>various</b> <b>factors</b> such as lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E
