5|$|The {{earliest}} geological {{period of}} the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian, {{takes its name from}} the Cambrian Mountains, where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants.

5|$|As the society, Durkheim noted {{there are}} several {{possible}} pathologies {{that could lead to}} a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are anomie and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between <b>various</b> <b>groups,</b> which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.|$|E

5|$|Capital to {{fund the}} scheme had been raised {{separately}} by the Wakefield and Leeds committees. A complicated restructuring of the finances in 1721 fixed the nominal capital at £26,700. Regular dividends at 7 per cent were paid to the shareholders from 1718, and the navigation was leased to <b>various</b> <b>groups,</b> who {{would be responsible for}} collection of tolls and repairs. The lease rose from £800 in 1704 to £2,600 in 1729, when receipts from each of the previous five years had averaged £6,016. The early trade consisted mainly of woollen goods from Leeds, Wakefield, Halifax and Bradford, with wool and corn from Lincolnshire and East Anglia travelling in the opposite direction. By the 1720s there were also significant quantities of coal.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Bevin {{announced}} he would challenge Kentucky's senior U.S. Senator, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, in the 2014 Republican primary.

After announcing he would seek the governorship in 2015, Bevin emerged from a four-way Republican primary, besting his nearest competitor, Agriculture Commissioner James Comer by 83 votes. On November 3, 2015, he defeated the state's attorney general, Democrat Jack Conway, in the general election.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the severe agricultural damage, the government initiated a food ration.

Similar to the aftermath of other natural disasters, the distribution of the aid raised concerns and accusations over the amount of food and material, or lack thereof, for the affected citizens.

5|$|In two {{regions of}} Australia, the central west coast and eastern central Australia, forms of early {{agriculture}} {{may have been}} practiced. People living in permanent settlements of over 200 residents sowed or planted {{on a large scale}} and stored the harvested food. The Nhanda and Amangu of the central west coast grew yams (Dioscorea hastifolia), while <b>various</b> <b>groups</b> in eastern central Australia (the Corners Region) planted and harvested bush onions (yaua - Cyperus bulbosus), native millet (cooly, tindil – Panicum decompositum) and a sporocarp, ngardu (Marsillea drumondii).|$|E
5|$|Paratheria is an {{obsolete}} {{term for}} a taxonomic group including the xenarthran mammals (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) and <b>various</b> <b>groups</b> thought {{to be related to}} them. It was proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths, anteaters, armadillos, and pangolins, usually classified as placentals, from both marsupial and placental mammals, an arrangement that received little support from other workers. When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s, they were thought to be related to xenarthrans, leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals. However, by the early 1990s, gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans, and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals.|$|E
5|$|Since {{settlement}} it {{has repeatedly}} flooded, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Adelaide's western suburbs were especially {{prone to flooding}} due to their location on the river's alluvial fan. As development of Adelaide progressed the amount of rainfall required for flooding decreased and consequent damage increased. Increased stormwater runoff, modification of the river's banks and other changes all served to exacerbate the problem. Work done by <b>various</b> <b>groups</b> to minimise flooding was often counter productive {{with the creation of}} levees, moving and widening channels and other works simply shifting the flooding elsewhere.|$|E
