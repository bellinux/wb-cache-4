50|$|Validation is {{intended}} to ensure a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) results in a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the operational needs of the user. For a new development flow or verification flow, validation procedures may involve modeling either flow and using simulations to predict faults or gaps {{that might lead to}} invalid or incomplete verification or development of a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). A set of <b>validation</b> <b>requirements</b> (as defined by the user), specifications, and regulations may then be used as a basis for qualifying a development flow or verification flow for a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). Additional validation procedures also include those that are designed specifically to ensure that modifications made to an existing qualified development flow or verification flow will have the effect of producing a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the initial design requirements, specifications, and regulations; these validations help to keep the flow qualified. It is a process of establishing evidence that provides a high degree of assurance that a product, service, or system accomplishes its intended requirements. This often involves acceptance of fitness for purpose with end users and other product stakeholders. This is often an external process.|$|E

40|$|<b>Requirements</b> <b>validation</b> is a {{critical}} phase of requirements engineering processes, which makes sure that requirements are correct, consistent, complete and accurate. <b>Requirements</b> <b>validation</b> is used in determining the right requirements, while verification determines that implementation is correct with respect to its requirements. The main objective of validation is to certify that requirement specification document is the acceptable description of the system, {{which is going to}} be implemented. <b>Requirements</b> <b>validation</b> techniques (RVTs) play pivotal role to detect possible defects in the requirements. RVTs can help in the completion of projects, within given schedule, budget and according to the desired functionality.

40|$|The <b>validation</b> of <b>requirements</b> is a {{fundamental}} step in the development process of safety-critical systems. In safety critical applications such as aerospace, avionics and railways, the use of formal methods {{is of paramount importance}} both for requirements and for design validation. Nevertheless, while for the verification of the design, many formal techniques have been conceived and applied, the research on formal methods for <b>requirements</b> <b>validation</b> is not yet mature. The main obstacles are that, on the one hand, the correctness of requirements is not formally defined; on the other hand that the formalization and the <b>validation</b> of the <b>requirements</b> usually demands a strong involvement of domain experts. We report on a methodology and a series of techniques that we developed for the formalization and <b>validation</b> of high-level <b>requirements</b> for safety-critical applications. The main ingredients are a very expressive formal language and automatic satisfiability procedures. The language combines first-order, temporal, and hybrid logic. The satisfiability procedures are based on model checking and satisfiability modulo theory.

40|$|<b>Requirements</b> <b>validation</b> is {{a crucial}} process to {{determine}} whether client-stakeholders 2 ̆ 7 needs and expectations of a product are sufficiently correct and complete.
