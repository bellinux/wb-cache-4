25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{stepping}} stick-slip motor, all these motors {{work on the}} same principle. Driven by dual orthogonal vibration modes with a phase difference of 90°, the contact point between two surfaces vibrates in an elliptical path, producing a frictional force between the surfaces. Usually, one surface is fixed, causing the other to move. In most piezoelectric motors, the piezoelectric crystal is excited by a sine wave signal at the resonant frequency of the motor. Using the resonance effect, a much lower voltage {{can be used to}} produce a high <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitude.</b>|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that several very different surfaces exhibit a common property: unusually large <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of the outermost atoms, well beyond the enhancement normally expected at typical clean surfaces. These special surfaces are: ice H 2 O(0001), alpha-Al 2 O 3 (0001), alpha-Ga(010) and Si(111) -(2 x 1). The root-mean-square <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes</b> in these surfaces are at least double the bulk values. The common cause that may explain these <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes</b> is that the surface atoms (or molecules {{in the case of}} ice) only have back-bonds that are nearly parallel to the surface. In this geometry, vibrations, especially perpendicular to the surface, involve primarily bond bending rather than bond stretching/compression: since bond bending is relatively soft, the corresponding vibration modes can have larger amplitudes. It is suggested that theory examine and confirm this cause of enhanced surface <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> and explore its implication for other phenomena such as adsorption and catalysis...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria {{adhering}} to surfaces exhibit nanoscopic vibrations {{that depend on}} the viscoelasticity of the bond. The quantification of the nanoscopic vibrations of bacteria {{adhering to}} surfaces provides new opportunities {{to better understand the}} properties of the bond through which bacteria adhere and the mechanisms by which they resist detachment. Often, however, bacteria do not adhere to bare surfaces but to adsorbed protein films, on which adhesion involves highly specific ligand receptor binding next to nonspecific DLVO interaction forces. Here we determine the contribution of adsorbed salivary protein and fibronectin films to vibrations exhibited by adhering streptococci and staphylococci, respectively. The streptococcal strain used has the ability to adhere to adsorbed salivary proteins films through antigen I/II ligand receptor binding, while the staphylococcal strain used adheres to adsorbed fibronectin films through a proteinaceous ligand receptor bond. In the absence of ligand receptor binding, electrostatic interactions had a large impact on <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of adhering bacteria on glass. On an adsorbed salivary protein film, <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of adhering streptococci depended on the film softness as determined by QCM-D and were reduced after film fixation using glutaraldehyde. On a relatively stiff fibronectin film, cross-linking the film in glutaraldehyde hardly reduced its softness, and accordingly fibronectin film softness did not contribute to <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of adhering staphylococci. However, fixation of the staphylococcus fibronectin bond further decreased <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> while fixation of the streptococcus bond hardly impacted <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> Summarizing, this study shows that both the softness of adsorbed protein films and the properties of the bond between an adhering bacterium and an adsorbed protein film {{play an important role in}} bacterial <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> These nanoscopic <b>vibrations</b> reflect the viscoelasticity of the bacterial bond with a substratum and play important roles in bacterial adhesion, detachment and susceptibility to antimicrobials...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} crack depth of a rotor-bearing-disk system on <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes</b> is investigated. Two {{models of the}} crack, which are the {{breathing}} and the open crack models, are considered. Finite element models and general harmonic balance solutions are derived with either breathing or open cracks which are valid for damped and undamped rotor systems. It is found via waterfall diagrams of the system with a breathing crack and slight unbalance that there are critical pairs of crack depth and frequency of large <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes</b> at the backward whirling frequencies. These high <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitudes</b> at the backward whirl appear at earlier crack depths than those at the forward whirl for both crack models. Resonance peaks at the second, third and fourth sub-harmonic frequencies emerge as the crack depth increases.

50|$|The {{function}} of a centrifugal pendulum absorber is as with any tuned mass absorbers based on an absorption principle rather than a damping principle. The distinction is significant since dampers reduce the <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitude</b> by converting the vibration energy into heat. Absorbers store the energy {{and return it to}} the vibration system at the appropriate time. Centrifugal pendulum absorbers like tuned mass absorbers {{are not part of the}} force/torque flow.|$|E
50|$|Under vibration, {{particles}} {{of different sizes}} segregate (Brazil nut effect). Vibration lifts and segregates particles on the inclined screen. When <b>vibration</b> <b>amplitude</b> is {{within the range of}} 3 to 3.5mm, the equipment segregates the large and small particles with best efficiency. If the amplitude is too high, the contact area between particles and screen surface is reduced and energy is wasted; if too low, particles block the aperture, causing poor separation.|$|E
