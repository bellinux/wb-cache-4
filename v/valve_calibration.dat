40|$|A computer-based, proportional-integral {{control system}} for {{supersonic}} blowdown wind tunnels {{was developed in}} a LabVIEW environment. The control algorithm is based on numerically integrating the differential equations used to model a supersonic blowdown wind tunnel in which the proportional and integral control terms were added and tuned in a simulation to determine their appropriate values. Values for these control terms can be obtained using a spreadsheet allowing for variation of the test section Mach number, test section area, stagnation pressure and plenum chamber volume {{as well as the}} pressure, temperature and volume of the storage tank. Accounting for the variation of many terms allows the control terms and resulting LabVIEW program to be easily integrated across different facilities. Experimental verification is provided along with a discussion of control <b>valve</b> <b>calibration,</b> optimization of control constants and additional capabilities of LabVIEW.

40|$|The exhaust {{manifold}} pressure {{is a crucial}} variable for turbocharged Diesel engines, affecting the torque production and the emissions through variations in the EGR mass flow and in the residual mass fraction in the cylinder. This variable is therefore considered very relevant for closed-loop EGR and turbocharger control. However, in production applications, {{the cost of the}} pressure sensor and the particularly harsh environment where this must work are practical barriers to its actual implementation. Therefore, the need for a rapid, reliable and robust estimation of this variable from low-cost production sensors is strong, above all, in the contest of advanced engine powertrains. This work describes the development of an estimator for the {{exhaust manifold}} pressure in a turbocharged Diesel engine with two-stage turbocharger. The approach proposed relies on a feed-forward scheme based on the inversion of a two-stage turbocharger model, which includes the radial turbines, nozzles and <b>valves.</b> <b>Calibration</b> and validation results of the estimator are presented in both steady-state and transient operating conditions...|$|R

The apparent deviation of a basic component involved a four inch regulating valve that would not fully close during post installation <b>calibration.</b> The regulating <b>valve</b> is used to control essential chilled water system chiller refrigerant pressure. APS completed the required evaluation based on inspections by the supplier, Flowserve US, Inc. The evaluation concluded the regulating valve would not fully close during <b>calibration</b> because the <b>valve</b> stem guide had become dislodged from the normal installed position. This is postulated to have occurred {{as a result of a}} fluid pressure surge inside the valve caused by incomplete venting of the valve prior to initiating water flow through the <b>valve</b> during <b>calibration.</b> Since the inability of the regulating valve to fully close during calibration resulted from maintenance activities during valve installation, no deviation in a A member of the STAR...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, centrifuge-based {{microfluidic}} platforms {{are reviewed}} and {{compared with other}} popular microfluidic propulsion methods. The underlying physical principles of centrifugal pumping in microfluidic systems are presented and the various centrifuge fluidic functions such as <b>valving,</b> decanting, <b>calibration,</b> mixing, metering, heating, sample splitting, and separation are introduced. Those fluidic functions have been combined with analytical measurement techniques such as optical imaging, absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to make the centrifugal platform a powerful solution for medical and clinical diagnostics and high-throughput screening (HTS) in drug discovery. Applications of a compact disk (CD) -based centrifuge platform analyzed in this paper include two-point calibration of an optode-based ion sensor, an automated immunoassay platform, multiple parallel screening assays, and cellular-based assays. The use of modified commercial CD drives for high-resolution optical imaging is discussed as well. From a broader perspective, we compare technical barriers involved in applying microfluidics for sensing and diagnostics as opposed to applying such techniques to HTS. The latter poses fewer challenges and explains why HTS products based on a CD fluidic platform are already commercially available, while {{we might have to}} wait longer to see commercial CD-based diagnostics. close 697...|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{shows the}} {{development}} of a test bench for a flow sensor devices calibration. The project development will be carried out at a company, between February 2017 and July 2017. Therefore, during the project time, the test bench will be designed, developed and tested. The purpose of the test bench is the calibration for one of the products that the company is currently developing. For the product calibration, it is necessary air flowing into. For the current test bench, the calibration needs an operator to control air flow by using manual <b>valves.</b> However, the <b>calibration</b> process is long and if the operator is not on site, the calibration process may fail. So the new test bench will include three modes of operation, which will be explained for the next chapters...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to delineate outcomes {{and to assess}} risk factors for in-hospital mortality among Chinese patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. MethodsFrom 2007 to 2008, a total of 9838 consecutive adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting {{were enrolled in the}} Chinese Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Registry, which included 43 centers from 17 province-level regions in China. This registry collected information on 67 preoperative factors and 30 operative factors believed to influence in-hospital mortality. The relationship between risk factors and in-hospital mortality was evaluated by univariate and logistic regression analyses. ResultsOverall in-hospital mortality was 2. 5 %. Eleven risk factors were found to be significant predictors for outcome: age (continuous), body mass index (continuous), left ventricular ejection fraction (continuous), preoperative New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, chronic renal failure, extracardiac arteriopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, preoperative atrial fibrillation or flutter (within 2 weeks), preoperative critical state, other than elective surgery, and combined <b>valve</b> procedure. <b>Calibration</b> with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was satisfactory (P = . 35), and the discrimination power was good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0. 81; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 79 – 0. 84). ConclusionsThe risk profiles and in-hospital mortality of Chinese patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were determined from data in the most up-to-date multi-institutional database. Eleven variables were demonstrated to be independent risk factors for in-hospital death after coronary artery bypass grafting...|$|R
30|$|A {{study of}} the {{calibration}} of WDN using online data of flow and pressure is presented herein. The methodology uses pressure observations at few nodes for calibration. In the present study, the values {{of most of the}} input parameters were obtained accurately and only the pipe roughness coefficients were adjusted. The most critical input parameter is observed to be the <b>valve</b> opening. During <b>calibration,</b> all the <b>valves</b> were checked for their current status and settings. Hourly, observations of pressure values in the network were used to adjust pipe roughness coefficient values by grouping them based on material and year of installation. This resulted in a more general <b>calibration.</b> Throttled <b>valves</b> were modeled based on percentage opening by classifying them into different groups. A close match between the modeled and observed pressure values were obtained for the case study for the whole day observations with different demands. The entire process of data collection and calibration is described. The methodology can be repeated for any network.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIncreasing {{the degrees}} of freedom in the air path has become a popular {{way to reduce the}} fuel {{consumption}} and pollutant emissions of modern combustion engines. That is why technical definitions will usually contain components such as multi or single-stage turbocharger, throttle, exhaust gas recirculation loops, wastegate, variable valve timing or phasing, etc. One of the biggest challenges is to precisely quantify the gas flows through the engine. They include fresh and burnt gases, with trapping and scavenging phenomena. An accurate prediction of these values leads to an efficient control of the engine air fuel ratio and torque. Fuel consumption and pollutant emissions are then minimized. In this paper, we propose to use an artificial neural networkbased model as a prediction tool for the engine volumetric efficiency. Results are presented for a downsized turbocharged spark-ignited engine, equipped with inlet and outlet variable <b>valve</b> timing. The <b>calibration</b> process that is used in this study only requires steady-state operating points. The validation stage was conducted on both steady-state and vehicle transients. Model prediction is in very good agreement with experimental results while keeping a very low calibration effort and matching embedded computational requirements. The conclusion stresses that thanks to their generic structure, neural models offer an interesting potential for generalization to even more complex technical definitions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Modified cineradiographic {{systems have}} been used {{clinically}} to detect partially broken outlet struts in normally functioning Björk-Shiley convexo-concave heart valves. Almost all such valves were explanted, presuming that full failure would likely follow. Inasmuch as the clinical setting only rarely permits examination of normally rated valves, the accuracy of radiographic detection cannot be clinically defined. This study uses the clinical radiographic technique in sheep implanted with known-status convexo-concave valves, comparing its accuracy and that of a newly developed, geometric image magnification radiography system. Methods: Twenty-one sheep with mitral convexo-concave valves were studied on both systems. Five were used for extensive training. When operators were expert with both systems, images of four intact valves and 12 valves with outlet strut single leg separations, along with a seventeenth single leg separation <b>valve</b> used for <b>calibration,</b> were integrated into 112 image sets organized into a balanced incomplete block design for evaluation by eight trained, blinded reviewers. Results: Cineradiography sensitivity was 24 % versus 31 % for direct image magnification. The odds ratio for detection of single leg separation by direct image magnification versus cineradiography was 2. 0 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 76 to 5. 9; p = 0. 13). Cineradiography specificity was 93 % versus 90 % for direct image magnification. Sensitivity and specificity varied markedly by reviewer, with sensitivity ranging from 8 % to 55 % and specificity from 51 % to 100 % for the combined technologies. Conclusions: The data support {{the need for more}} intensive training for convexo-concave valve imaging and further investigation of unconventional radiographic technologies. Clinical cineradiography of convexo-concave valves may detect as little as 25 % of valves having a single leg separation, underestimating the prevalence of single leg separations and thereby implying more rapid progression to full fracture than is actually the case.
