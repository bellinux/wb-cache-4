40|$|In this work, {{we report}} new quasars {{discovered}} in the <b>vicinity</b> <b>fields</b> of the Andromeda (M 31) and Triangulum (M 33) galaxies with the LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, also named Guoshoujing Telescope) during the 2013 observational season, {{the second year of}} Regular Survey. In total, 1330 new quasars are discovered in an area of ∼ 133 deg^ 2 around M 31 and M 33. With i magnitudes ranging from 14. 79 to 20. 0, redshifts from 0. 08 to 4. 85, the 1330 new quasars represent a significant increase of the number of identified quasars in the <b>vicinity</b> <b>fields</b> of M 31 and M 33. Up to the moment, there are in total 1870 quasars discovered by LAMOST in this area (see also Huo et al. 2010, 2013). The much enlarged sample of known quasars in this area can potentially be utilized to construct a precise astrometric reference frame for the measurement of the minute proper motions of M 31, M 33 and the associated substructures, vital for the understanding of the formation and evolution of M 31, M 33 and the Local Group of galaxies. Meanwhile, amongst the sample, there are in total 45, 98 and 225 quasars with i magnitudes brighter than 17. 0, 17. 5 and 18. 0 respectively. In the aforementioned brightness bins, 15, 35 and 84 quasars are reported here for the first time, 6, 21 and 81 are reported in Huo et al. (2010, 2013), while 0, 1 and 6 are from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and 24, 41 and 54 are from the NED database. These bright quasars provide an invaluable sample for the kinematics and chemistry study of the interstellar/intergalactic medium of the Local Group.

Materials and Methods: HT- 29 and L 929 cell lines were cultured in RPMI medium containing fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were exposed to 50 Hz electromagnetic field with intensities of 50, 200 and 400 gauss for 3 hours. Growth, proliferation and morphological changes were photographed using an inverted microscope. MTT assay was used to quantify cell viability. Results: Viability percent of HT- 29 (81. 097 ± 2. 703) and L 929 (89. 375 ± 3. 672) cell lines in the <b>vicinity</b> of electromagnetic <b>field</b> with intensity of 50 gauss was not significantly decreased compared to the control group.

40|$|We {{select from}} Paper I {{a sample of}} 306 massive star {{clusters}} observed with the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) in the <b>vicinity</b> <b>fields</b> of M 31 and M 33 and determine their metallicities, ages and masses. Metallicities and ages are estimated by fitting the observed integrated spectra with stellar synthesis population (SSP) models with a pixel-to-pixel spectral fitting technique. Ages for most young clusters are also derived by fitting the multi-band photometric measurements with model spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The estimated cluster ages span a wide range, from several million years {{to the age of}} the universe. The numbers of clusters younger and older than 1 Gyr are respectively 46 and 260. With ages and metallicities determined, cluster masses are then estimated by comparing the multi-band photometric measurements with SSP model SEDs. The derived masses range from ∼ 10 ^ 3 to ∼ 10 ^ 7 M_, peaking at ∼ 10 ^ 4. 3 and ∼ 10 ^ 5. 7 M_ for young (1 Gyr) clusters, respectively. Our estimated metallicities, ages and masses are in good agreement with available literature values. Old clusters richer than [Fe/H] ∼ - 0. 7 dex have a wide range of ages. Those poorer than [Fe/H] ∼ - 0. 7 dex seem to be composed of two groups, as previously found for Galactic GCs [...] one of the oldest ages with all values of metallicity down to ∼ - 2 dex and another with metallicity increasing with decreasing age. The old clusters in the inner disk of M 31 (0 [...] 30 kpc) show a clear metallicity gradient measured at - 0. 038 ± 0. 023 dex/kpc.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} the {{ionosphere}} on the detectability, polarization, structure and decay of low frequency magnetospheric hydromagnetic waves has been a topic of interest for thirty years. There are two classes of signal behavior in the atmosphere and ionosphere, one Where the ionosphere has little effect and one where the ionospheric conductivity controls the reflection, the amplitude detected {{on the ground and}} rate of signal decay. It has been assumed that the latter type of behavior is pertinent in most practical applications. Recent interest in global modes of the magnetospheric cavity requires areassessment of he assumption. We investigate one simple case, the hydromagnetic surface wave, and discuss what happens in more complicated modes. We conclude that signals in the <b>vicinity</b> of <b>field</b> line resonance will be strongly coupled to the local ionosphere but far away will not...|$|R

The targets include known GCs and candidates selected from the literature, {{as well as new}} candidates selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Analysis shows that 356 of them are likely GCs of various degree of confidence, while the remaining ones turn out to be background galaxies and quasars, stars and HII regions in M 31 or foreground Galactic stars. The 356 likely GCs include 298 bona fide GCs and 26 candidates known in the literature. Three candidates selected from the Revised Bologna Catalog of M 31 GCs and candidates (RBC) and one possible cluster from Johnson et al. are confirmed to be bona fide clusters. We search for new GCs in the halo of the M 31 amongst the new candidates selected from the SDSS photometry. Based on radial velocities yielded by LAMSOT spectra and visual examination of the SDSS images, we find 28 objects, 5 bona fide and 23 likely GCs. Amongst the five bona fide GCs, three have been recently discovered independently by others, the remaining 25 are our new identifications, including two bona fide ones. The new identified objects fall at projected distances ranging from 13 to 265 kpc from M 31. Of the two newly discovered bona fide GCs, one is located near M 33, probably a GC belonging to M 33. The other bona fide GC falls on the Giant Stream with a projected distance of 78 kpc from M 31. Of the 23 newly identified likely GCs, one has a projected distance of about 265 kpc from M 31 and could be an intergalactic cluster.
