40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on design {{simulations}} by the means of commercial software for a low speed circuit wind tunnel with an open test section, recently built at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronics and Materials Technology at THM University of Applied Sciences in Friedberg. The proposed wind tunnel has a test section with cross sectional area of 1 X 1 m 2 and a length of 1. 6 m. The maximum achievable speed is about 50 m/s with empty test section. The simulation had the target to propose and to verify various geometries - test chamber, tunnel contraction, diffuser etc. as well the tunnel corner including the vanes. In addition, {{the influence of the}} vanes number and their shape on the <b>ventilator</b> <b>power</b> needed and the flow velocity uniformity as well, have been subjects of the investigation. Also the ventilator type (rotational segment) impact on the flow pattern within the operational area has been scrutinized...|$|E

30|$|There is {{an ongoing}} {{development}} of turbine <b>powered</b> <b>ventilators</b> able to support patients with mild acute respiratory failure in the intermediate care environment at the hospital. The capability for these home care ventilators to deliver adequate FI 02 is an important end-point for patient's safety.|$|R
30|$|The ICU {{physicians}} had {{to complete}} 11 specific tasks for each ventilator, four mainly dedicated to monitoring and seven to setting: (a) alarm control (users must shut down alarms, identify the reason and modify setting to stop alarms); (b) mode recognition (exact {{reading of the}} ventilator mode set by investigator); (c) identify humidification system {{on the screen and}} modify it; (d) ventilator setting reading (VT, ventilation rate, PEEP and trigger value); (e) power on the ventilator; (f) start ventilation; (g) set inspiratory flow to a value defined by the investigator (40 – 80  L min− 1); (h) ventilator mode modification; (i) set cycling to 60 %; (j) non-invasive ventilation mode activation; and (k) ventilator extinction (complete <b>ventilator</b> <b>powering</b> down). In each group of tests (i.e. monitoring or setting), tasks were to be performed in a randomized order. The test was a priori considered as a failure if the correct response was given after more than 120  s, or if the physicians did not provide a correct response or abandoned the task. Due to technical constraints, we chose not to use a high-fidelity environment with a manikin, but to perform measurements with the ventilators connected solely to the test lung. Besides a task failure rate evaluation, these scenarios were also dedicated to enable usability and mental workload scoring using psycho-cognitive scales.|$|R
40|$|This master´s thesis {{deals with}} {{influence}} of forced air {{flow from the}} <b>ventilators</b> on the <b>power</b> transformer cooling. For this analysis was used simulation software ANSYS CFX, that uses the finite volume method for calculations of dynamic properties of liquids. In {{the introduction of the}} thesis is presented the basic terminology of fluid flow, temperature fields and theory of transformers. The simulation is divided to the analysis of flow through the left and right radiator models...|$|R
