40|$|The present {{treatment}} of safety margin considerations for powered-lift (upper wing surface blowing) <b>STOL</b> <b>aircraft</b> emphasizes wind shear endurance, {{in order to}} establish safety margin criteria for such aircraft that are equivalent to those of conventional transport aircraft. The simulation results obtained show that a 6. 6 deg climb gradient at V(app) for <b>STOL</b> <b>aircraft</b> is required for equivalent shear endurance in approaching a long STOL airport runway, if the <b>STOL</b> <b>aircraft</b> is equipped with an elaborate control/display system and is permitted a change in configuration...|$|R
40|$|A new {{wind shear}} warning system for powered-lift <b>STOL</b> <b>aircraft</b> was {{evaluated}} {{by using a}} flight simulator. Wind shear warning systems for CTOL aircraft {{have been designed to}} detect horizontal shear only. Because the approach air speed of <b>STOL</b> <b>aircraft</b> is lower than that for CTOL <b>aircraft,</b> <b>STOL</b> <b>aircraft</b> are more vulnerable to vertical wind due to (1) a gradient of horizontal shear that is smaller for STOL than for CTOL aircraft because of slower airspeed; (2) <b>STOL</b> <b>aircraft</b> spend longer time in a downdraft; and (3) vertical wind causes a more radical change in the <b>STOL</b> <b>aircraft's</b> flight path because of its lower airspeed. In order to detect the vertical wind, the wind shear warning system proposed calculates the difference between potential flight path measured on-board during shear traversal and trimmed flight path estimated from aircraft status. The most characteristic feature of this new system is that it utilizes only inertial information and pitot-static airspeed data; this yields a convenient means of on-board implementation. Simulation test results confirm that the new system can detect the vertical shear...|$|R
