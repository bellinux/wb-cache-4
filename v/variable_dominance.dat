40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an investigation}} of phonological variation occurring {{as a function of}} stylistic choice in Spanish. The main variable processes include glide formation, vowel coalescence, vowel deletion, nasal and lateral place assimilation, nasal neutralization, continuancy assimilation, obstruent devoicing, voicing assimilation, and aspiration. Optimality Theory (OT) is the theoretical framework. Previous generative work on phonological variation in Spanish and other languages has been couched in discussions of “optional ” or “variable ” rules. More recently, a principle of “floating ” constraints (FCs) has been applied to explain inter-speaker variation. The present study develops the FC theory of variation and applies it systematically to the analysis of stylistic data from several dialects of Spanish. It is argued that stylistic variation in Spanish- and indeed in all languages- is the result of <b>variable</b> <b>dominance</b> relations among ranked universal constraints. The primary advantage of the FC model is its ability to account for all speech processes, variable as well as categorical, within a single framework. Under this model, constraints fall into two broadly-defined constraint families, MARKEDNESS and FAITHFULNESS. Data from a variety of Spanish dialects are given to sho...|$|E

40|$|Size-selective {{predation}} by fish {{is often}} {{considered to be}} a primary driver of seasonal declines in large-bodied Daphnia populations. However, large Daphnia commonly exhibit midsummer extinctions in ponds lacking plank-tivorous fish. A number of empirical and theoretical studies suggest that resource competition and its interaction with nutrient enrichment may determine <b>variable</b> <b>dominance</b> by large Daphnia. Low resource levels may favor competitive dominance by small-bodied taxa while large Daphnia may be favored under high resource conditions or following a nutrient/productivity pulse. Nutrient enrichment may also influence the strength of invertebrate predation on Daphnia by affecting how long vulnerable juveniles are exposed to predation. We investigated these hypotheses using an in situ mesocosm experiment in a permanent fishless pond that exhibited seasonal losses of Daphnia pulex. To explore the effects of nutrient enrichment, Daphnia plus a diverse assemblage of small-bodied zooplankton were exposed to three levels of enrichment (low, medium, and high). To explore the interaction between nutrient enrichment and invertebrate predation, we crossed the presence/absence of Notonecta undulata with low and high nutrient manipulations. We found no evidence of competitive reversals or shifts in dominance among nutrient levels, Daphnia performed poorly regardless of enrichment. This may have been due to shifts in algal composition to dominance by large filamentous green algae. Notonecta had significant negative effects o...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the large}} number of studies on the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), the {{knowledge}} of environmental and biotic responses in shallow marine environments remains quite poor. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages of the Sidi Nasseur and Wadi Mezaz sections in Tunisia were studied quantitatively and the paleoecologic interpretations provide new insights into the complex relationship between PETM global warming and perturbations of shallow marine settings. These sections expose upper Paleocene to lower Eocene shales and marls of the El Haria Formation up to the phosphate layers of the Chouabine Formation underlying the El Garia limestones. The Sidi Nasseur section contains a more complete and expanded Paleocene–Eocene boundary interval compared to Wadi Mezaz, although being truncated at the top. The Wadi Mezaz section contains a more complete post-PETM interval. The studied interval can be subdivided into a sequence of 4 biofacies, representing respectively a latest Paleocene biofacies, two PETM biofacies and one post-PETM Eocene biofacies. The latest Paleocene biofacies 1 consists of numerous calcareous benthic foraminifera (e. g. Anomalinoides midwayensis, Frondicularia aff. phosphatica and various Bulimina and Lenticulina species), abundant non-calcareous taxa (Haplophragmoides) and rare planktic foraminifera, indicating a slightly hypersaline eutrophic inner neritic to coastal environment, regularly interrupted by oxygen deficiency (moderate dysoxia). During the latest Paleocene, this highly productive environment shallowed as indicated by the increasing abundances of A. midwayensis. The <b>variable</b> <b>dominance</b> of non-calcareous agglutinated taxa in biofacies 1 indicates post-mortem dissolution effects. The TOC d 13 C org record reveals a sharp negative excursion, marking the base of the Eocene. In general, the absence of lithologic changes, an increasing sedimentation rate and absence of reworking indicate that the initial part of the PETM is complete and expanded in the Sidi Nasseur section. A sharp faunal turnover coincides with this negative d 13 C org excursion and is characterized by the disappearance or diminution of common Paleocene taxa in this area. During the PETM, benthic foraminifera are less abundant and consist of opportunistic non-calcareous taxa together with deeper dwelling (middle neritic) lagenids and buliminids (biofacies 2 and 3). Planktic foraminifera, dominated by flat-spired Acarinina (mainly A. multicamerata), become more abundant, as observed in many open marine sequences worldwide. All these faunal parameters suggest more stressed probably severe dysoxic sea floor conditions within a transgressive phase during the onset of the PETM. An estimation of the total duration of the Sidi Nasseur PETM interval is difficult to establish, yet the lack of recovery carbon isotope values suggests that the preserved PETM interval reflects only a part of the CIE “core”. The top of the PETM interval is truncated due to local (?) erosion during the early Eocene. The Eocene recovery fauna is mainly composed of Lenticulina and Stainforthia species (biofacies 4), indicating restricted coastal to hyposaline lagoonal eutrophic conditions, distinctly different from earlier environmental conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect on college {{students}} of an Assertive Training program that combined Rational Emotive Therapy with behavioral techniques. Assertiveness was measured by ascendance-submission (A-S Reaction Study), dominance (Edwards Personal Preference Schedule), and fear (Fear Survey Schedule). Prior to the group training the 135 volunteers, through the technique of stratified random sampling, were placed in two experimental groups and one control group at Ball State University and two experimental groups and one control group at Butler University. At the time of the group training, at Ball State University eight subjects participated in the experimental groups of the study and at Butler University 22 subjects participated in the experimental groups of the study. The experimental group at Ball State University (5 males and 3 females) and the experimental group at Butler University (8 males, 14 females) participated in a primarily verbal Assertive Training workshop lasting for two hours one night a week for four weeks. The experimental groups participated in an Assertive Training model which included a theoretical and cognitive presentation of the theory of Assertive Training and of Rational Emotive Therapy. The techniques of modeling, rehearsal/role-playing, and feedback were utilized. The control group was placed on a waiting list and contacted a week before the fifth and final session to take the post-tests. The members of the control group were not notified that they were members of the control group. The A-S Reaction Study, the Dominance Scale from the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule, and Fear Survey Schedule, were administered to the experimental and control subjects at the conclusion of the training period. The Ball State University sample was eliminated from the study because the procedures used by the facilitators departed from the original research design and, thus, made them non-comparable. The instruments were scored and the three scales (A-SRS, Dominance Scale from EPPS, and FSS) were subjected to a multivariate analysis of variance. The F value whichwas obtained for treatment between groups (3. 9992) was statistically significant at the. 05 level. Since the HO (1) null hypothesis: There will be no difference between the vector of the means of the experimental groups and the control groups on the total score of the A-S Reaction Study, the Dominance Scale of the Edwards Personal. Preference Schedule, and the total score of the Fear Survey Schedule [...] was rejected, further analysis of the data was performed using univariate analysis of variance. An F value (8. 7028 significant at the. 05 level) was obtained for the <b>variable,</b> <b>dominance.</b> Therefore, a conclusion can be made that dominance contributes to the overall rejection of the H 0 (1) (treatment). The F values which were obtained for sex (1. 0336) and treatment x sex (2. 3617) were not significant at the. 05 level. Therefore, the H 0 (2) null hypothesis [...] There will be no difference between the vector of means of the males and the means of the females [...] were not rejected. A correlation study was made in order to assess the degree of relationships between the instruments used in the study. The Dominance Scales score from the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule correlates with the A-S Reaction Study score (+. 426938), and with the Fear Survey Schedule (- 0220731). Also the A-S Reaction Study score correlates with the Fear Survey Schedule score (-. 327414). While these correlations are not strong, they are sufficient to insure that the instrumentation assessed essentially the same construct, assertion. The findings from this study were: 1. There was a significant difference found between the experimental group and the control group which was mainly due to theDominance Scale score on the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule. 2. There was no significant difference found between males and females. 3. In the intercorrelation study substantial relationships were found among the three instruments. A conclusion was drawn that college students can be taught to become more assertive in social interpersonal relationships by including rational-emotive procedures with behavioral techniques of Assertive Training. 3 Thesis (D.

The definitive {{version of}} this article is available at: [URL] large body size and high rates of metabolic heat production associated with male mating success in polygynous systems creates potential thermoregulatory challenges for species breeding in warm climates. This is especially true for marine predators carrying large blubber reserves intended for thermoregulation in cold water and fuel provision during extended fasts. Thermographic images were used to measure changes in skin temperature (TS) in adult male northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) over the breeding season. Environmental variables, primarily ambient temperature and solar radiation, were the principal determinants of mean and maximum TS. When controlled for environmental <b>variables,</b> <b>dominance</b> rank significantly impacted mean TS, being highest in alpha males. Behavioral activity significantly influenced TS but in a counter-intuitive way, with inactive males exhibiting the highest TS. This was likely due to strong impacts of environmental variables on the kinds of behavior exhibited, with males being less active on warm, humid days at peak solar radiation. We classified thermal windows as areas in which TS was one standard deviation greater than mean TS for the individual seal within a thermograph. Thermal features suggest active physiological thermoregulation during and after combat and significant circulatory adaptations for heat dumping, as evidenced by recurring locations of thermal windows representing widely varying TS values. Frequent observations of localized TS above 37 ??C, particularly after combat, suggest the production of thermoregulatory stress during breeding behavior. Our findings demonstrate the importance of environmental drivers in shaping activity patterns during breeding and provide evidence for thermoregulatory costs of successful breeding in large polygynous males.

A minimal explanation for binocular rivalry involves strong competitive inhibition between neurons responding to different monocular stimuli to preclude simultaneous activity in the two groups.

Here a minimal nonlinear neural model is developed incorporating inhibition, self-adaptation, and recurrent excitation. The model permits derivation of an equation for mean dominance duration {{as a function of}} the underlying physiological <b>variables.</b> The <b>dominance</b> duration equation incorporates an explicit representation of Levelt’s second law.

40|$|Climate change denial {{has been}} found to {{correlate}} with sociopolitical ideology. The general aim of the present thesis was to investigate this relation, and more specifically to 1) test the unique effects of intercorrelated ideological variables on denial, and 2) investigate the psychological underpinnings of the ideology-denial relation. This approach helps estimating what component of right-wing ideology better explains climate change denial; resistance to change (indexed by left-right/liberal-conservative political orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, and system justification), or acceptance of inequality (indexed by social dominance orientation [SDO]). In Paper I, SDO outperformed the effects of right-wing authoritarianism and political left-right orientation on denial (Study 1 and 2). Further, the SDO-denial relation was stable when denial scores were experimentally lowered by a newscast that communicated supportive evidence for climate change (Study 2). Thus, the following studies focused specifically on the SDO-denial relation by testing path models that also included other ideological variables (political conservatism, system justification, and endorsement of nature dominance), as well as personality <b>variables</b> (<b>dominance,</b> empathy, openness to experience, and anxiety avoidance) and/or gender. In Paper II, SDO and endorsement of nature dominance explained unique parts of climate change denial, and both of these variables mediated the effects of system justification and (low) empathy on denial. SDO mediated also the effect of dominance. In Paper III, focusing specifically on denial of human-induced climate change, SDO either partially or fully mediated the effects of political conservatism and gender across two cultural contexts (Brazil and Sweden).  Additional analyses extended these results, by building on the model presented in Paper II. These analyses showed that SDO (and in some cases also political conservatism and endorsement of nature dominance) fully mediated the effects of gender and personality variables on denial, with one exception: Predisposition to avoid experiencing anxiety predicted denial directly, as well as through a link via general conservative ideology (system justification or political conservatism). In sum, the results indicate that denial is more strongly and consistently predicted by SDO than by the other included variables. Thus, endorsement of group-based inequality/hierarchies offers an important explanation for climate change denial. ...|$|R

Our objective was to study the venous blood and CSF flows in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). Materials and Methods: PC-MRI sequences were added to brain MRI conventional protocol in 19 patients suspected of CVT, among whom 6 patients had CVT diagnosis confirmed by MR venography. Results were compared with 18 healthy age-matched volunteers (HV). Results: In patients without CVT (NoCVT) confirmed by venography, we found heterogeneous individual venous flows, and <b>variable</b> side <b>dominance</b> in paired veins and sinuses, comparable to those in healthy volunteers. In CVT patients, PC-MRI detected no venous flow in the veins and/or sinuses with thrombosis. Arterial flows were preserved. CSF aqueductal and cervical stroke volumes were increased in a patient with secondary cerebral infarction, and decreased in 4 patients with extended thrombosis in the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses. These results suggest the main role of the venous system in the regulation of the dynamic intracranial equilibrium. Conclusions: CVT produces highly individualized pattern of disturbance in venous blood drainage. Complementary to MRI venography, PC-MRI provides non-invasive data about venous blockage consequences on CSF flow disturbances...|$|R

We found heterogeneous individual venous flows and <b>variable</b> side <b>dominance</b> in paired veins and sinuses. In some participants, the accessory epidural drainage preponderated over the habitually dominant jugular outflow.

Results show that qualitative categories are not adequate for describing ecological connectivity; multivariate descriptions are much better predictors, with urban area, number of urban patches, urban patch extent, level of aggregation, and perimeter area fractal dimension composing the significant synthetic <b>variables.</b> The <b>dominance</b> of area as a differentiating variable {{led to the development of}} a new urban connectivity index using a combination of urban area and state population size. This metric, based on readily available aspatial data, explains 78 % of variation in ecological connectivity. These results provide a simple but novel tool for beginning to understand the role of urban morphology in promoting desirable environmental outcomes and managing environmental risks in urbanizing landscapes. ...|$|R
40|$|A whole farm {{simulation}} {{approach was}} used to assess the economic impacts of five alternative strategies for controlling East Coast fever (ECF), a cattle disease, on farms from two sites in Kenya. The strategies were also ranked using the stochastic dominance criterion to determine the most preferred one by risk-averse smallholder farmers. The strategies involve the current acaricide-based method and immunization control strategies using the infection and treatment method (ITM) in combination with different levels of acaricide use. The simulation results indicated that immunization strategies generated higher mean values for output variables; net present value, internal rate of return benefit-cost ratio, annual cash receipts, net cash farm income and net farm income than the currently used conventional method. In all cases, the immunization strategy in which acaricide use was reduced by 75 percent generated the highest values for the output <b>variables.</b> The stochastic <b>dominance</b> ranking criterion also indicated that this was the most preferred ITM strategy which also generated the highest confidence premium...|$|R
40|$|Women {{have a huge}} {{opportunity}} as {{the leader}} in the company to decide the investment for herself. Generally, women have low participation in the investment activity. Women usually have not a full appreciation on the financial issues. It is because women are too risk averse, too emotional, sometimes simply too easy to lose the investment profit, and too broke to be good investors. On the contrary, as the leader for the company, women engaged {{in a very good}} job position or to be a good decision maker with their expertise. Thus, the researcher will investigate the relationship between some <b>variables</b> with the <b>dominance</b> portfolio investment especially for women in Indonesia as the company leader. There are 310 women as the samples in this research from around Indonesia. The result of the study show that financial knowledge, perception towards investment, self assessment as investor, and financial planning have significant relationship toward the dominance portfolio investment...|$|R
40|$|Social {{relationships}} in nonhuman primates result from investments that individuals make while pursuing tness-maximizing strategies. These strategies sometimes include social exchange, either reciprocity (exchange {{of the same}} acts) or interchange (exchange of different acts). Individuals in many species may negotiate for services in biological markets, particularly grooming and agonistic support. They also may compete for access to valuable social partners. Abundant evidence for reciprocity in grooming and in support and for competition over partners exists, notably for females in some cercopithecines. However, evidence for interchange of grooming and support is scarcer, and apparent interchange may be a byproduct of correlations between grooming or support and some third <b>variable</b> (e. g. <b>dominance</b> rank). Chimpanzees have been prominent in discussions of social exchange, especially because male chimpanzees cooperate in many ways. Most analyses of interchange have used data on captive chimpanzees; these provide good evidence for reciprocity, but ambiguity with regard to interchange. Data on an unusually large chimpanzee community at 1) Author’...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between socially oriented client characteristics and facilitative therapist variables on client {{perceptions of the}} therapeutic relationship (CPTR) was investigated. Subjects were 75 undergraduate students who answered a pretherapy questionnaire to measure the socially oriented client <b>variables</b> trusting, warmth, <b>dominance</b> (16 PF), sex role orientation (Bem Sex Role Inventory), wanted and expressed inclusion, control, and affection (FIRO-B). Subjects were blocked on trusting and expressed affection and randomly assigned to a warm or neutral therapist condition where they saw a counselor for one fifty minute session. CPTR was measured using the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory, Counselor Rating Form, Therapist Rating Scales and Global Warmth Rating. Results indicated that subjects perceived {{a difference in the}} warm and neutral therapist conditions. And there was a significant interaction between the client variables of trusting and therapist condition. In addition, a significant interaction between the client variables of trusting and expressed affection was found. Additional correlational analysis indicated that certain other client variables are also related to CPTR...|$|R
40|$|Supervising Professor: Roger L. Mellgren Previous {{studies show}} that men with {{masculine}} facial characteristics are perceived as more dominant than men with less masculine facial characteristics. This study investigated whether facially dominant men behaved more dominantly and were more prone to sexual jealousy. Participants were 115 males enrolled in UTA introductory psychology classes. Dominant behavior constituted {{the number of times}} participants stuck to their position in a series of cooperative decision making trials; sexual jealousy was measured using a modification of Buss et al’s. (1992) jealousy scenario, and facial dominance was measured using subjective ratings. Results indicated a significant positive correlation between facial dominance and sexual jealousy but no equivalent correlation between facial dominance and behavioral dominance. Associated findings vi revealed significant positive correlations between facial dominance and each of the four <b>variables</b> of trait <b>dominance,</b> height, self-presentation bias, and directional asymmetry. Results were discussed in the context of measurement validity and androgen exposure...|$|R
40|$|The {{promotion}} of female autonomy is both intrinsically and instrumentally desirable. We document {{differences in the}} distribution of female autonomy in India (using the National Family Health Survey 2005 – 2006) addressing two methodological challenges: the multidimensional nature of the concept and its frequent measurement with ordinal variables (which are not amenable to direct comparisons of social averages). We tackle these challenges with three methods based on stochastic dominance techniques suited for ordinal and dichotomous <b>variables.</b> Whenever these <b>dominance</b> conditions hold for a pairwise comparison, we can conclude that the multidimensional autonomy distribution in one state is more desirable than in another one across a broad range of criteria for the individual and social welfare evaluation of autonomy. Consistently across the three methods, we find that most of the states with better autonomy distributions (in pairwise comparisons) come from the north east and the south, whereas most of the states with worse autonomy distributions come from the north...|$|R
