40|$|Libraries are {{increasingly}} {{called upon to}} efficiently use collection dollars in creative ways. Content needs are ever increasing, and, with the growing range of format and delivery options, finding means to identify resources that provide unique, or added, value is essential. Libraries regularly receive offers of sale pricing, or reduced pricing, for the subscription or purchase of multititle collections. Most often, these packages are for online content that the library may, or may not, have already acquired {{in one of the}} multiple formats available. In an environment of multiple formats, ISBNs and/or ISSNs per <b>title,</b> <b>variable</b> <b>titles,</b> and alternate imprint or copublishing, identifying the unique or duplicated holdings of library collections becomes a major challenge. The knowledge bases supporting booksellers, serials agents, and discovery tool providers strive {{to do a good job}} of linking content available in different formats and on different platforms. Although these vendors robustly provide alternate format, title, provider, and imprint data on a title-by-title basis, none of their administrative tools provide the library customer with the ability to easily compare aggregate data held in the knowledge base with data extracted from a title package list. This paper presents a description of library data needs and bookseller data provision goals, followed by a review of the power and functional limitations of current marketplace tools. Practical examples are provided of how these tools may be used to guide collection development and make wise acquisitions decisions...|$|R

The review demonstrated that variations in users` professional and educational backgrounds are likely to have an important influence on Internet-based knowledge acquisition and structuring. A good knowledge of users is therefore necessary for the successful design of an on-line information service, particularly for multidisciplinary domains such as the water sector which cover a wide range of subject disciplines, and scientific, technological and industrial domains. The implications of the variety of individuals involved in the water sector for structuring information/knowledge on the Internet is demonstrated by analysing the International Water Association`s membership database as a function of several <b>variables,</b> including <b>title,</b> job function, organisation type, nationality and fields of interest. The database revealed a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds, as well as diverse interests between different organisations.

40|$|The new {{curriculum}} of Chemistry {{has been put}} into action progressively since 2007. Teachers are {{certainly one of the}} most important components of applying the curriculums and it is important to determine the opinions of teachers about the curriculum. Within the aim of this view, a scale is developed by the researcher. This scale is applied to 99 chemistry teachers from every city of Turkey who joined to the pre-service course of Chemistry Curriculum arranged by Ministry of National Education. Factor analysis is applied into the scale and it is determined that the scale consists of 4 factors. Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient is found 0, 85. The frequencies and percentage of teachers’ opinions on the scale is stated and also, teachers’ opinions are statistically analyzed according to the variables of gender, kind of school, title and years on job. Consequently, the results show that teachers have some insufficiencies on the assessment and evaluation, and the content of the objectives are highly comprehended by the teachers while it is reached that 10 th grade Chemistry topics are too dense.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify antecedents that would predict organizational commitment. One category of predictor was the “Big Five” personality traits (extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism and openness) and the other category included job design characteristics (skill variety, task identity, task significance, task autonomy, and task feedback). This research also investigated the association that demographic <b>variables</b> (job <b>title,</b> job tenure, organization tenure, age, gender and education) had with all major variables. A survey was completed by 142 participants of five Chinese organizations in Beijing, from the health/medical, banking, insurance, international business, and construction sectors. Agreeableness, openness and all job design characteristics were significantly correlated with affective commitment, whereas extraversion and agreeableness, neuroticism were related to continuance commitment. Regression analyses showed that agreeableness and openness were salient predictors of affective commitment. Agreeableness and neuroticism contributed significantly to continuance commitment. The conclusions are discussed in relation to their practical implications for organizations, and researchers, and the need for future research. The major implications from this research are that managers in organizations need to enrich employees’ job content to enhance their affective commitment, and keep in mind the links between some personality traits and continuance commitment. This study encourages future research to focus on doing more longitudinal cross-cultural studies in order to assess the generalizability of previous research findings...|$|R

40|$|Summary. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} simultaneous variable selection and estimation in partially linear models with a divergent number of covariates in the linear part, {{under the assumption that}} the vector of regression coefficients is sparse. We apply the SCAD penalty to achieve sparsity in the linear part and use polynomial splines to estimate the nonparametric component. Under reasonable conditions it is shown that consistency in terms of variable selection and estimation can be achieved simultaneously for the linear and nonparametric components. Furthermore, the SCAD-penalized estimators of the nonzero coefficients are shown to be asymptotically normal with the same means and covariances that they would have if the zero coefficients were known in advance. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample behavior of the SCAD-penalized estimators. Key Words and phrases.

40|$|Background: A {{profusion of}} {{regression}} equations exists relating surface area, fat-free mass, total body water and various clinical variables to height and body mass, directly or indirectly. Other published equations lack either the height or the mass term. Objective: The main {{aim is to}} show how algebraically different types of prediction equation are interrelated, thus facilitating the integration of research findings and future choices of equations. Another is to explore the rationales for the equations. Research methods and procedures: The treatment is largely algebraic, but illustrated numerically. Results and discussion: The most straightforward way of relating the predicted variables to height and body mass is through the linear regression function (A[height] + B[body mass] + C). The power function (heighta × TBM b) is also used, in estimating body surface area (BSA) or fat-free mass (FFM) for example, but for ordinary ranges of body size this approximates closely to the linear function. BSA and FFM are each sometimes used as intermediate variables in estimating other variables from height and body mass, but this is unnecessary if the relevant equations are, in effect, combined. For some predicted <b>variables</b> of the <b>title</b> either the height term or the mass term proves superfluous. For FFM a theoretical equation is derived {{that takes into account}} the tendency of FFM to increase with both height and fat mass. For limited ranges of height this approximates numerically to the above linear function. The analysis suggests that prediction equations obtained by linear regression are generally to be recommended...|$|R

40|$|Defence date: 14 February 2003 Examining Board: Prof. Uschi BACKES-GELLNER (University of Zurich) Prof. Colin CROUCH (EUI, Supervisor) Prof. David MARSDEN (London School of Economics and Political Science) Prof. Philippe C. SCHMITTER (EUI) This study compares {{labour market}} {{institutions}} and their emergence {{in the media}} production industries of Great Britain and Germany. The two principal institutions examined are vocational education and training patterns {{on the one hand}} and recruitment channels on the other hand. The former manage the labour market entry at the start of an individual's career while the latter govern the repeated labour market transactions between company and employee that occur throughout an individual's career. The comparison of these institutions in the two industries is based on novel labour market data for both companies' and individuals' training and employment behaviour in Germany and the UK. On a theoretical level, the comparison analyses dynamics of institutional formation and contributes to the literature on varieties of capitalism and socio-economic institutions. The examination of labour market institutions in the media industries of two countries that are generally classified as belonging to opposite types of market economy allows us to study dynamics of institutional reproduction and change. In order to map difference and similarity in institutional formation, the comparative research design is organised along two institutional <b>variables,</b> job <b>titles</b> and joint supply, and three potential causal mechanisms for institutional development, technological, societal and hierarchical embeddedness. Job titles and joint supply are constituent parts of an occupational labour market and represent different types of social norms, namely conventional and essential norms. The three types of embeddedness encapsulate environmental spheres that expose actors to different forces, deemed important for institutional development in the existing literature. Important results emerge with respect to the adequacy of training regimes in the media industry, marked by short-term employment and project production in both the UK and Germany. The British industry's further training regime emerges as superior to the German dual system of initial training in light of the large freelance workforce in both countries. With respect to institutional formation processes, the main counter-intuitive outcomes are that job titles in the German industry resemble those of its British counterpart, and that the British industry has arrived at a comprehensive joint supply regime. Contrary to predictions of the literature on varieties of capitalism, institutional dynamics on the industry level can thus deviate from their respective national parents. The cases show that institutional formation varies not primarily with differences in the national institutional set-up but with the type of institution and the uncertainty of actors in arriving at and legitimising such an institution. The less distributive the character of an institution, and the less actors need to legitimise an enforcement regime, the more independent of national institutions they become in their efforts to arrive at an institution...|$|R

The {{participants in this study}} totaled 188 which included 148 classroom teachers and forty reading specialists. Data for the participants were gathered by using a Likert scale PLC survey. This fifteen item survey had three definite domains: critical elements, human resources, and structural conditions. There was a need to gather demographic data from the participants so seven questions were added by the researcher. ^ The research design employed a cross-sectional survey, with quantitative methodology, which included percentages, weighted mean, and the Statistical Practices for Social Sciences (SPSS) Program to analyze the data using a Kruskal-Wallis test. This non-parametric test examined the data to reveal any statistically significant difference among the different groups. ^ The results of the findings indicated that based on age and years of experience, Title I elementary school teachers generally perceived PLCs as being effective, mainly in these PLC characteristics: collaboration, supportive leadership, socialization, time to meet and talk, physical proximity, teacher empowerment, trust and respect, and cognitive and skills very significantly with age of the teacher as well as the years of teaching experience characteristics. However, the findings indicated that teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions towards PLC factors in relation to teachers 2 ̆ 7 professional roles registered a no statistically significant difference. ^ The implications from the study are that PLCs are effective in eliminating teacher isolation through promoting more communication structures in schools. Developing PLCs in Title I elementary schools, specifically increases collaboration and teacher involvement in the decision making process of schools because many aspects of the collaboration and decision making process have a ripple effect. Further, a major implication was that PLCs hold a critical element to effective collaboration and cooperation. ...|$|R
40|$|In 2001 the Institute of Medicine {{identified}} a significant {{gap between what}} is known about how we care for patients and the care that they receive. This identified gap renewed interest in {{the development and implementation of}} evidence-based practice (EBP). A number of research studies have evaluated barriers to EBP yet questions still arise as to why evidence is not routinely incorporated into practice. This led to a new field of inquiry called implementation science focused on methods for translating evidence into practice. The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework purports that successful implementation of EBP is a function of the strength of the evidence to be implemented, the quality of the context into which it will be implemented and appropriate facilitation. There currently are levels of evidence and measures of context that can be utilized but no measures of appropriate facilitation. The purpose of this research was to develop an instrument (the Facilitation Assessment Index) to measure facilitation. This methodological study was conducted to determine the psychometric properties of an investigator-developed instrument to define and measure the concept of facilitation. The instrument was distributed to 1025 Registered Nurses in an Academic Medical Center. The response rate was 28 %. The majority of respondents were in a staff nurse role, over age 35 and had at least a Bachelor's degree. The Facilitation Assessment Index (FAI) demonstrated adequate psychometrics. Factor analysis delineated four subscales entitled Support, Leadership, Respect and Autonomy. The overall reliability of the scale was r =. 93 and the range of reliability of the subscales was r =. 85 -. 93. The test-retest correlation for the total scale was r =. 85 (p<. 001). Correlations for the subscales ranged from r =. 61 -. 85 (p<. 01). Relationships between demographic variables and facilitation were evaluated.

Full copies of relevant publications were downloaded and <b>variables</b> extracted, including <b>title,</b> year of publication, type of article, clinical focus. As a comparator a similar search was conducted for articles about asthma using the search term ‘asthma’. Results: 41 allergy-related articles were identified in the 60 years since the journal was launched. In the same time period there were 147 articles about asthma. In 31 of the 60 years reviewed there were no articles at all about any allergy-related topic. The focus of the articles published were eczema (6), food allergy (6), rhinoconjunctivitis (5), anaphylaxis (4), urticaria (1). There were no articles on angioedema. Some articles addressed multiple atopic disorders, eg ‘Allergic diseases in the elderly’ (1968), ‘Allergic disorders amongst horticultural, agricultural and forestry workers’ [letter] (1965). Conclusions: Allergy has a low profile in the British Journal of General Practice. This low profile persists despite the increasing prevalence of atopic disorders and major national reports highlighting the need for better care of the allergic patient in primary care. Our exploratory study highlights a missed opportunity to educate and inform General Practitioners about allergy through this widely circulated journal. Further work is needed to understand better why so few articles on allergy are published in the BJGP. If the paucity of publications reflects the number of articles submitted then BSACI members interested in informing and improving allergy management in General Practice should include the BJGP on their list of target journals. Where next: To share these observations with the Editor of the BJGP to understand whether they reflect editorial policy or lack of submissions from clinicians and researchers with expertise in allergy. To work with the BJGP to identify collaborative initiatives to address the serious mismatch between the prevalence of allergy in the clinical consultation and the number of allergy- related articles in the literature for GPs...|$|R
40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} whether library andinformation science (LIS) doctoral research atNorth American institutions has, over the lasteighty or so years, displayed a clear trendtoward addressing topics other than thoseassociated with librarianship and traditionallibrary functions; and whether one can discern,in this regard, any significant differencesamong those institutions. Design – Conceptual content analysis ofdissertation titles and abstracts. Setting – North American universities withAmerican Library Association accredited LISprograms {{in the period}} 1930 through 2009. Subjects – The titles and, to the extentavailable, the abstracts of 3, 230 LIS doctoraldissertations completed at these institutionsduring this period. Methods – Having opted for a directed, singlecategorytype content analysis, the researchersbegan by pre-establishing a group of termswhich they assumed could “represent the corecurriculum of the master’s in library science”:terms which they surmised would therefore beable to function, where they appeared in “therecords of doctoral output”, as good indicatorsthat that output itself can rightly be judged tohave had “an explicit focus onlibraries/librarianship” (pp. 36, 44). The termsselected were: “librar*”, “catalog*”, “circulat*”,“collection develop*”, “collection manag*”,“school media”, and “reference” (where “*” indicates truncation, and that any term beginning with the respective letter string was acceptable). The researchers then simply tallied {{for each of the}} 3, 230 dissertations under investigation how many times {{one or more of the}} pre-chosen terms occurred in its title and in its abstract, not recording which term or terms that occurred. (They do not make entirely clear to what extent data collection was computerized.) They subsequently analyzed the data longitudinally and by institution, with only one, nominal and dichotomous, <b>variable</b> for the <b>title</b> as well as for the abstract: whether or not any of the pre-chosen terms occurred at least once. Multiple occurrences, whether of the same term or of varying terms, played no role. Their analysis for the entire period of 1930 through 2009 was based on title data only, and did not take doctorate-granting institution into account. The separate analysis (N= 2, 305) for the period 1980 through 2009 excluded the thirty cases in which one or more of the terms occurred in the title but none of them occurred in the abstract. Main Results – One occurrence of any of the specified terms in the title was, for the overall period of 1930 - 2009, enough for any given dissertation to be qualified as having an explicit focus on libraries/librarianship. The percentage of such dissertations remained fairly stable from the 1930 s through the 1980 s, at between 56 % and 62 %, with the exception of an unexplained dip for the 1950 s to 44. 1 %. Then, for the 1990 s, the researchers discovered a fall-off from 57. 9 % to 36. 0 %, and in the following decade a further decrease, down to a level of 21. 5 %. During the separately-analyzed period 1980 - 2009, the percentage of dissertations with at least one of the specified terms in the title as well as in the abstract diminished steadily from well over half (58. 4 %) for 1980 - 1984 to less than 1 in 5 (19. 8 %) for 2005 - 2009. A chi-square test revealed that the relationship between year of dissertation and term occurrence is statistically significant. By far the greatest decrease, of 15 percentage points, was that between the first half and the second half of the 1990 s. Interestingly, during the whole thirty-year period, the percentage where a term appeared not in the title but only in the abstract remained fairly constant, at around 20 %, give or take about 2. 5 percentage points. Yet when one looks at how many of the dissertations displayed none of the terms in the title and none in the abstract, one sees a continuous increase starting at 20. 7 % for 1980 - 1984 all the way up to 61. 0 % for 2005 - 2009, with the sharpest climb, of more than 17 percentage points, occurring around the mid- 1990 s. The distinction between the year 1980 and the year 2009 is even greater: from just over 1 in 7 (14. 7 %) to more than 3 out of 5 (62. 2 %). The analysis by institution revealed a statistically significant relationship for the period 1980 - 2009 between institution at which the dissertation was written and the occurrence of any of the terms at least once in both title and abstract. Certain institutions (most notably SUNY-Albany, Syracuse, Missouri, Hawaii, Montréal, and Long Island) showed a much higher than average overall level of no occurrence, and some (Michigan in particular, but also, for example, Florida State and the University of North Carolina) displayed a remarkably consistent decline in occurrence. Conclusion – The researchers conclude that their study, insofar as North America is concerned, “has provided empirical evidence for... the lessening focus in LIS dissertations on topics commonly associated with librarianship” and that it “supports the assertion that this focus varies significantly between schools—with some schools demonstrating a more explicit connection to library-related topics than other schools” (p. 43). They are unsure how best to interpret these findings or how they could be applied, but they do offer certain suggestions for possible interpretations and pose a few questions regarding what those interpretations might imply (p. 44). One could, they suggest, argue that the terms employed in the study “are themselves antiquated, and dissertations are charting new territory, pushing the boundaries of both research and practice. ” Another possibility is that “while the dissertations may not be immediately applied work, the work could be utilized for application. ” On the other hand, it may simply be the case that the selected terms indeed remain trustworthy indicators, and that doctoral candidates “are no longer studying topics that are relevant to the practical field” of librarianship. One could perhaps even justifiably assert that LIS is in effect no longer a single unified discipline but, rather, has split into a library field and an information field, whereby the latter has been steadily gaining the upper hand in LIS programs, albeit less so at some institutions than at others. In pondering the above alternatives for interpretation of this study’s results, the library practitioner will probably also be inclined to reflect, the authors suggest, on the prospects for adequate academic research support of actual library practice, while keeping in mind, furthermore, that the formal education of future practitioners will largely remain in the hands of those trained as LIS doctoral students. To what extent will these educators feel an affinity with, and possess an understanding of, the world of practical librarianship...|$|R
