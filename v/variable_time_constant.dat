40|$|In {{this study}} we {{determine}} a viable bioenergetic model for power allocation during a cycling race. Various models have been proposed to address power allocation in races with two models rising above others: the Morton-Margaria Three Tank model and the Skiba Energy Balance model. The energy balance model was implemented in MATLAB and compared against the gold standard implementation in Golden Cheetah to model the depletion of an athlete's energy over the course a ride. The implementation of the model was successful as verified by ride data from a cyclist in the 2014 Tour de France. Additionally, the model was further tested with sample power profiles {{in order to understand}} the depletion of energy over the course of a ride. Two key findings emerged from the investigation. First, we require a better account of exhaustion in the energy balance model which can be achieved by weighting the time spent below critical power over the time spent above critical power. This is because a cyclist becomes more exhausted by efforts at higher power outputs compared to the recovery at an effort below critical power. Second, energy balance models should use a <b>variable</b> <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> as rides and races have highly variable recovery periods below critical power which affects the ability of an athlete to reconstitute their energy. Use of a <b>variable</b> <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> could address the weighting of efforts below critical power identified in the first finding as well. by Alexander D. Springer. Thesis: S.

40|$|The Hodgkin-Huxley {{formalism}} for quantitative {{characterization of}} ionic channels {{is widely used}} in cellular electrophysiological models. Model parameters for these individual channels are determined from voltage clamp experiments and usually involve the assumption that inactivation process occurs on a time scale which is infinitely slow compared to the activation process. This work shows that such an assumption may lead to appreciable errors under certain physiological conditions and proposes a new numerical approach to interpret voltage clamp experiment results. In simulated experimental protocols the new method was shown to exhibit superior accuracy compared to the traditional least squares fitting methods. With noiseless input data the error in gating <b>variables</b> and <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> was less than 1 %, whereas the traditional methods generated upwards of 10 % error and predicted incorrect gating kinetics. A sensitivity analysis showed that the new method could tolerate up to approximately 15 % perturbation in the input data without unstably amplifying error in the solution.

The provenance of these parameters {{can be difficult to}} establish, and so {{it is important to understand}} how parameter values influence model behaviour. In this study we examined how model parameters influence the repolarising current I Kr in the Courtemenache-Ramirez-Nattel model of the human atrial action potential. We used a statistical approach in which Gaussian processes (GP) are used to emulate the model outputs. A GP emulator can treat model inputs and outputs as uncertain, and so can be used to directly calculate sensitivity indices.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a neural model of interval timing, which reproduces the duration discrimination experiments of Wearden (1992). The model comprises 3 layers of neural units. The {{units in the}} first layer represent clusters of neurons with probabilistic internal feedback that maintains self-sustained (short-term memory) activity for a random time. The unit in the second layer is a spiking neuron that fires {{as long as a}} sufficient number of input clusters are active. The unit in the third layer detects the offset of firing in the previous layer by producing a short burst of spikes. Analysis and simulation of the model shows spikes produced at random times with a distribution determined by the number of units in the first layer, their survival time constant, and the threshold of the unit in layer 2. Interval times can be learned with any of these parameters but lead to different Weber law relations.

A number of voltage-gated ionic currents {{can contribute to the}} generation or amplification of MPR, but how the interaction of these currents with linear currents contributes to MPR is not well understood. We explored this in the pacemaker PD neurons of the crab pyloric network. The PD neuron MPR is sensitive to blockers of H- (IH) and calcium-currents (ICa). We used the impedance profile of the biological PD neuron, measured in voltage clamp, to constrain parameter values of a conductance-based model using a genetic algorithm and obtained many optimal parameter combinations. Unlike most cases of MPR, in these optimal models, the values of resonant- (fres) and phasonant- (fϕ = 0) frequencies were almost identical. Taking advantage of this fact, we linked the peak phase of ionic currents to their amplitude, in order to provide a mechanistic explanation the dependence of MPR on the ICa gating <b>variable</b> <b>time</b> <b>constants.</b> Additionally, we found that distinct pairwise correlations between ICa parameters contributed to the maintenance of fres and resonance power (QZ).

40|$|International audiencePropofol is a {{chemical}} agent commonly {{used as an}} intravenous general anesthetic. At the cellular level, this short-acting ananesthetic positively modulates GABAergic inhibitory activity by targeting GABA-A receptors [1]. This type of receptors are widespread {{in the brain and}} can be present both within synaptic clefts, as well as on extrasynaptic locations along the dendrites and neuron membrane where they are responsible for tonic inhibition. At the macroscopic level of SEEG (deep Stereographic-Electro Encephalogram) or EEG (Electro Encephalogram) recordings, one observes, with certain doses of propofol, a paradoxical excitation phenomenon [2] the generation mechanisms of which are not clearly understood. In this study, we suggest a potential mechanism for the appearance of paradoxical excitation occurring under propofol-induced general anaesthesia. We show, with a model network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, that tonic inhibition – induced by the binding of propofol to extra-synaptic receptors – together with an increase of the synaptic <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> within an certain range [3] can account for the phenomenon of paradoxical excitation. However, changes in the gain (or conductance) of the synaptic inhibition do not correspond to a sudden increase in neuronal population firing rate nor synchrony as described in the experiments [3]. The action of propofol on extrasynaptic GABAergic receptors was modelled by varying the conductance g ton of a tonic current in the form $I ton = g ton (V − E ton) $ as described in [4].

In thepresent study a new method, fuzzy clustering, is proposed to determine expiratory <b>time</b> <b>constants.</b> Fuzzy clustering differs from other methods since it neither interferes with expiration nor presumes any functional {{relationship between the}} <b>variables</b> analysed. Furthermore, <b>time</b> constantbehaviour during expiration can be assessed, instead of an average timeconstant. The <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> obtained with fuzzy clustering are comparedto <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> conventionally calculated from the same expirations. Methods. 20 mechanically ventilated patients, including 10 patients with COPD, were studied. The data of flow, volume and pressure were sampled. From these data, four local linear models were detected by fuzzy clustering. The <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> (τ) of the local linear models (clusters) were calculated by a least-squares technique. <b>Time</b> <b>constant</b> behaviour was analysed. <b>Time</b> <b>constants</b> obtained with fuzzy clustering were compared to <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> calculated from flow-volume curves usinga conventional method.

Sensory fibers had <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> that were about 3 <b>times</b> the <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> for motor fibers. The strength-delay curves gave similar <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> as those obtained from strength-duration curves...|$|R
25|$|Increases in the strength-duration <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> are {{observed}} when this conductance is activated by depolarization, or by hyperventilation. However, demyelination, which exposes internodal membrane {{with a higher}} membrane <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> {{than that of the}} original node, can also increase strength-duration <b>time</b> <b>constant.</b>|$|R
