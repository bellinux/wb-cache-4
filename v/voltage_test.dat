40|$|The {{essential}} {{demand in}} high AC <b>voltage</b> <b>testing</b> is {{the availability of}} a <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> with high qual-ity, which is variable in amplitude and frequency. The power supply should not have any influence on the measurements – even the PD-measurement- and should be able to control a fault of the test objects insulation safely. These demands can be fulfilled using modern IGBT in-verters. Two level voltage source inverters with connected resonant or filter circuits are normally used to generate a high-quality <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> by feedback control. The properties of power fre-quency inverters for high <b>voltage</b> <b>tests</b> are pre-sented in this article along with two typical circuit topologies...|$|R

40|$|Bridging faults in CMOS {{circuits}} sometimes {{degrade the}} output voltage and time performance without altering the logic function. The traditional <b>voltage</b> <b>testing</b> models {{based on the}} normal power supply voltage do not accurately model this behavior. In this paper we develop a model of bridging faults that accounts for both the bridging resistance distribution and gate sensitization and propagation choices. This model shows that fault coverage increases at lower power supply voltages. It suggests that decreasing the power supply voltage is a promising technique to maximize the real fault coverage of <b>voltage</b> <b>tests,</b> thereby minimizing the number of relatively slow Iddq tests required to achieve high quality...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{fundamental}} investigations of partial discharge behaviour of typical defects of PE/XLPE-insulated medium <b>voltage</b> cables at <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> with variable shape and frequency. The investigations were started {{because of the}} increasing use of alternative <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> (e. g. VLF 0. 1 Hz) for onsite testing of PE/XLPE insulated medium voltage cables and the increased integration of PD measurement techniques in the on-site testing equipment. The possibility to compare PD measurement results from 50 / 60 Hz AC <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> with the results from alternative <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> is questioned in this work as well as the possibility to transfer the knowledge from 50 / 60 Hz AC <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> measurements to the measurement results obtained from alternative <b>test</b> <b>voltages.</b> (orig.)

50|$|This test is {{to measure}} the total {{resistance}} of a product’s insulation by applying a voltage of 500 V - 1000 V for low voltage systems. The minimum acceptable value of resistance for a product to pass an insulation resistance test is 1 megohm (1000 kΩ). The insulation resistance test is {{not a substitute for}} the high <b>voltage</b> <b>test.</b> Many standards and safety agencies have specified this is a universal test for all products.

50|$|A hipot test (also called Dielectric Withstanding Voltage (DWV) test) verifies {{that the}} {{insulation}} {{of a product}} or component is sufficient to protect the operator from electrical shock. In a typical hipot test, high voltage is applied between a product's current-carrying conductors and its metallic shielding. The resulting current that flows through the insulation, known as leakage current, is monitored by the hipot tester. The theory behind the test {{is that if a}} deliberate over-application of test voltage does not cause the insulation to break down, the product will be safe to use under normal operating conditions—hence the name, Dielectric Withstanding <b>Voltage</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

The purpose of this test program was to evaluate and characterize the performance of this capacitor bank. These tests were {{necessary in order to}} proceed with the design of a final building block module that is to be used to create a reliable and cost effective multi-hundred megajoule energy storage system. The period of performance covered by this contract is from January 1, 1991 through August 31, 1992. American Control Engineering has provided all of the necessary facilities, personnel and materials that were required to perform this testing effort (except for the existing capacitor bank, the LLNL provided flashlamp assembly and E-size ignitron switch tube), An overall view of the assembled capacitor bank system as it appeared at the completion of this subcontract is shown. The initial statement-of-work for the testing and characterization of the capacitor bank was as follows: (1) Measure all of the principal electrical parameters for the 1. 7 megajoule prototype capacitor bank at low voltage before proceeding to high <b>voltage</b> <b>testing.</b> This low <b>voltage</b> <b>testing</b> is to include measurement of both normal and fault current and voltage waveforms, starting with the smallest building block grouping and proceeding systematically through to the capacitor bank load. (2) Assemble and attach each of the major subsystem elements to the capacitor bank as they are required for low <b>voltage</b> <b>testing</b> including the ignition output switch structure, coaxial transmission line and load assembly. (3) Make comparison of the test results collected through low <b>voltage</b> <b>testing</b> with those forecasted by the computer mode.

50|$|Underwriters Laboratories (UL), {{a global}} {{independent}} safety science company, defines how a protector {{may be used}} safely. UL 1449 became compliance mandatory with the 3rd edition in September 2009 to increase safety compared to products conforming to the 2nd edition. A measured limiting <b>voltage</b> <b>test,</b> using six times higher current (and energy), defines a voltage protection rating (VPR). For a specific protector, this voltage may be higher compared to a Suppressed Voltage Ratings (SVR) in previous editions that measured let-through voltage with less current. Due to non-linear characteristics of protectors, let-through voltages defined by 2nd edition and 3rd edition testing are not comparable.|$|E
50|$|This test {{is carried}} out by {{applying}} a significantly higher than operating voltage to the device under test. In this test, the insulation of a product, stressed {{to a greater extent}} than under normal operating conditions, should not be breached for the product to pass. In most cases, the device is stressed to twice its normal operating voltage. During type testing, i.e. testing during designing a product or for a double insulated product, however, much larger voltage may be applied. For all electrical products, the high <b>voltage</b> <b>test</b> is a universal test, meaning that every unit should pass before it can be used.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} optimal <b>voltage</b> <b>testing</b> approaches for physically-based faults in CMOS circuits. We describe the general {{nature of the}} problem and then focus on two fault types: resistive bridges between gate outputs that cause pattern sensitive functional faults and opens in transmission gates that cause delay faults. In both cases, the traditional stuckat model is inadequate. The test vector to sensitize and propagate a resistive bridging fault is not unique. The traditional greedy test vector selection is optimistic, with some choices having poor real coverage. We realistically model the fault and fault coverage, and describe an optimal selection strategy. In a transmission gate with an open NMOS or PMOS device, the output voltage is degraded, increasing delay and reducing noise margin. We model this fault and show how lowvoltage testing can be used to detect it. Our goal in applying these techniques to all important fault types is to maximize the real coverage of <b>voltage</b> <b>tests,</b> thereby minimizing the number of relatively slow Iddq tests required to achieve high quality...|$|R
40|$|Crosslinked {{polyethylene}} (XLPE) insulated {{power cables}} {{are used for}} transmission and distribution of electrical power. Such cables are subjected to extensive high <b>voltage</b> <b>testing</b> for performance evaluation and quality control purposes.

Alternatively conductive paint is used to prepare such a termination. This paper presents a method of calculating the voltage distribution across such a resistive termination when subjected to AC <b>voltage</b> <b>testing.</b> The proposed method is used to determine the effect of different design parameters on voltage and stress distribution on such cable ends.
