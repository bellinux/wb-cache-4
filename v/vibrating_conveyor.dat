50|$|Improvement over {{conventional}} {{fluidized bed}} technology {{has led to}} discovery of vibratory fluidized bed where the bed is design by combining vibration and gas flowing vertically towards the conveyor bed. It offers some advantages of fluidized bed, however the feed will move along the <b>vibrating</b> <b>conveyor</b> until they have dried adequately to break up and this will cause lower chance of agglomerates build-up in the feed; hence it is useful for processing group C particles which have small size of fine particles, into smaller agglomerates.|$|E

They are used extensively in food grade applications where sanitation, washdown, and low maintenance are essential.

They {{can be used to}} convey newly cast metal parts which may reach upwards of [...] Due to the fixed nature of the conveying pans vibrating conveyors can also perform tasks such as sorting, screening, classifying and orienting parts. Vibrating conveyors have been built to convey material at angles exceeding 45° from horizontal using special pan shapes. Flat pans will convey most materials at a 5° Incline from horizontal line.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In a {{cigarette}} silk production line of {{a cigarette}} factory, the noise of <b>vibrating</b> <b>conveyor</b> not only endangers the health of workers ’ listening, but also reduces work efficiency. In this paper, the modal of the frame was analyzed with the ANSYS software. The analysis {{results show that the}} frame has torsion vibration and swing. These vibrations will bring adverse effects and noise. Through designing a vibration isolation system on the <b>vibrating</b> <b>conveyor,</b> the reasonableness and effectiveness of the isolation component were proved with static and dynamic analysis of the vibration isolation system with finite element method. At the same time, some rules what select the spring parameters were summed up. Through analyzing the isolation effect of the vibration isolation system in different parameters, these regularity conclusions will provide a basis for the noise reduction [1]...|$|E

40|$|Program {{status and}} accomplishments {{for a project}} to develop alfalfa as a biomass fuel for power {{generation}} are summarized in this report. The main areas of reporting include: (1) alfalfa separation pilot plant testing, (2) design of gasification plant, (3) alfalfa leaf meal feeding trials and analysis, (4) integrated plant design and cost estimate, and (5) site plan construction and environmental permits. The alfalfa separation pilot plant fractionation equipment encountered operating problems from rocks and other tramp materials in the alfalfa bales. An investigation of techniques and equipment to remove the tramp materials resulted {{in the selection of}} a <b>vibrating</b> <b>conveyor</b> system. The Carbona gasification plant design basis and the Westinghouse scope of supply and design basis for the hot gas filter are provided in the report. The alfalfa leaf meal feeding trials showed that this economically critical co-product can be a viable livestock feed ingredient if favorable price, availability, and quality are maintained.

40|$|Abstract At {{the plant}} of Outokumpu Stainless Tubular Products AB in Molkom {{a wide range}} of butt weld {{fittings}} are produced. These are aimed mainly for the process industries and one of the products are ninety degree bend elbows in various dimensions. The elbows are made from stainless sheet metal and when formed to a tube they need to be welded along its inner radius. This is made by a pick and place type industrial robot working in a closed compartment. The assignment given by Outokumpu aims to investigate and suggest a new concept for a more reliable manufacturing process within the work cell.   The cell consists of five main areas chronologically listed as passed by the elbow: ·          Automated, <b>vibrating</b> <b>conveyor.</b> ·          Fixture with the purpose to serve the robot with one elbow at a time, placed in the correct position. ·          Industrial robot to pick up the elbow and drag it along the welding head. ·          TIG inverter with a stationary welding head·          A hydraulic press with a template of the final shape of the elbow corrects flaws.  Almost every problem in the cell and defects on the products coming out of it {{can be traced back to}} the fixture and in some cases also to the robots pick up tooling. The focus of the task was therefore put mainly on those two areas. As the work proceeded Outokumpu chose to develop a new tool for the robot themselves which they did with good results. I chose to incorporate it into my study and change focus to the fixture instead.   The problems and possible causes to them were identified and discussed with my tutor: The elbows fall incorrectly into or beside of the fixture.   Fixtures are old and worn down. The elbows path between conveyor and fixture are somewhat out of control The smaller dimensions have room enough to slip past the fixture. Edges to be welded are to far from each other or badly shaped Commissioning time, some start up steps is more complex then they need to be. Some of the setting possibilities in the working cell are unnecessary and can be fixed instead. The positions of pick up and welding head are not really fixed in the robot software, these are reprogrammed every time elbow size are changed. ·          Various errors at weldingo    Robot managed to pick incorrectly placed elbow   Proposals to solve the above specified problems: All parts in contact with the elbows are to be made of harden able steel. A suitable one is C 45 E which can be casehardened to about 700 HV. On the outer edge of the conveyer a support are placed to prevent excessive wear. The fixture is partially redesigned with a support to control the elbows path better. Guide arms with dual purpose are added. First they guide the elbow into the fixture and secondly they turn it to the correct angle towards the robot. Pins are used along with quick lock clamps to obtain faster and easier commissioning. The pick and place tool developed by Outokumpu are used...|$|E
40|$|Beyond insecticides, {{alternative}} methods to control insect pests for agriculture and vectors of diseases are needed. Management strategies involving the mass-release of living control agents have been developed, including genetic control with sterile insects and biological control with parasitoids, for which aerial release of insects is often required. Aerial release in genetic control programmes often {{involves the use}} of chilled sterile insects, which can improve dispersal, survival and competitiveness of sterile males. Currently available means of aerially releasing chilled fruit flies are however insufficiently precise to ensure homogeneous distribution at low release rates and no device is available for tsetse. Here we present the smart aerial release machine, a new design by the Mubarqui Company, based on the use of <b>vibrating</b> <b>conveyors.</b> The machine is controlled through Bluetooth by a tablet with Android Operating System including a completely automatic guidance and navigation system (MaxNav software). The tablet is also connected to an online relational database facilitating the preparation of flight schedules and automatic storage of flight reports. The new machine was compared with a conveyor release machine in Mexico using two fruit flies species (Anastrepha ludens and Ceratitis capitata) and we obtained better dispersal homogeneity (% of positive traps, p< 0. 001) for both species and better recapture rates for Anastrepha ludens (p< 0. 001), especially at low release densities (< 1500 per ha). We also demonstrated that the machine can replace paper boxes for aerial release of tsetse in Senegal. This technology limits damages to insects and allows a large range of release rates from 10 flies/km 2 for tsetse flies up to 600, 000 flies/km 2 for fruit flies. The potential of this machine to release other species like mosquitoes is discussed. Plans and operating of the machine are provided to allow its use worldwide...|$|R
