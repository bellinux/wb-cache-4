There are two predominant alternative funding models: capita-tion (pro <b>viders</b> receive a fixed lump-sum payment per pa tient per period, independent of the number of services performed) and salaried remuneration.

40|$|PurposeThis study {{aimed to}} develop and {{validate}} an instrument to measure patient perception of quality of nursing care and related hospital services in a tertiary care setting. MethodsWe compiled an instrument with 72 items that patients may perceive as quality of nursing care and related hospital services, following an extensive literature search, discussions with patients and care pro-I <b>viders</b> and a brainstorming session with an expert panel. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. A sample (n = 120) of patients stayed in general surgical or medical units responded to the interviewer administered instrument upon discharge. Item analysis and principal component factor analysis were performed to assess validity, and internal consistency was calculated to measure reliability. ResultsOf the 72 items, 18 had greater than 20 % of responses as ‘not relevant’. A further 11 items were eliminated since item-total correlations were less than. 2. Factor analysis was performed on remaining 43 items which resulted in 36 items classifying into eight factors accounting for 71 % of the variation. Factor loadings in the final solution after Varimax rotation were interpersonal aspects (. 68 –. 85), efficiency (. 62 –. 79), competency (. 66 –. 68), comfort (. 60 –. 84), physical environment (. 65 –. 82), cleanliness (. 81 –. 85), personalized information (. 76 –. 83), and general instructions (. 61 –. 78).

5000|$|In 1989, Pete Wallingford, an Educational Technologist from Seattle, Washington with a {{background}} in multi-store dive operations management, scuba diving instruction and commercial diving, initially started a marine conservation organization called [...] "The Friends of the Reef Foundation" [...] in response to customers of his dive stores complaining about the declining state of the coral reefs. For the international diving community he created a portable underwater obstacle course and adjunct curriculum for trim, proper weighting and buoyancy-control training, which was made of PVC pipe hoops shaped like diamonds, subsequently named Hover Stations. The program {{was adopted by the}} National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration in 1989. By 1991, the Diamond Reef System had developed into an instructional, marketing and dive industry promotional program under the company, Buoyancy Training Systems, Inc. The name Buoyancy Training Systems, Inc eventually was renamed Buoyancy Training Systems International, Inc. and presently Diamond Reef Systems. The Diamond Reef System was adopted into the Environmental Protection Agency's diving education program in 1991. It also received recognition from the ROLEX Corporation, Diving Equipment Manufacturers Association, University of Washington educational technology department and dive training program, Glen Egstrom Ph.D at the University of California at Los Angeles diving program, University of North Carolina diving program, Alex Brylske Ph.D a Professional Association of Dive Instructors' Course Director and Hillary <b>Viders</b> Ph.D at the National Association of Underwater Instructors. Permission was subsequently given by all diver certification agencies worldwide (to include PADI, NAUI, BSAC, CMAS, YMCA, SSI and GUE) to permit participating licensed and insured instructors and their respective Divemasters / Divecons to include the Diamond Reef Hover Stations and Challenge Courses in pool and open water training. This was due to the effectiveness of the training aids and the 'diver release' safety feature that was built into each Hover Station.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in mobile devices and network technologies have set new {{trends in the}} way we use computers and access networks. Cloud Computing, where processing and storage resources are residing on the network is one of these trends. The other is Mobile Computing, where mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are believed to replace personal computers by combining network connectivity, mobility, and software functionality. In the future, these devices are expected to seamlessly switch between different network providers using vertical handover mechanisms in order to maintain network connectivity at all times. This will enable mobile devices to access Cloud Services without interruption as users move around. Using current service delivery models, mobile devices moving from one geographical location to another will keep accessing those services from the local Cloud of their previous network, which might lead to moving a large volume of data over the Internet backbone over long distances. This scenario highlights the fact that user mobility will result in more congestion on the Internet. This will degrade the Quality of Service and by extension, the Quality of Experience offered by the services in the Cloud and especially multimedia services that have very tight temporal constraints in terms of bandwidth and jitter. We believe that a different approach is required to manage resources more efficiently, while improving the Quality of Service and Media Service Delivery in which services run on localised public Clouds and are capable of populating other public Clouds in different geographical locations depending on service demands and network status. Using an analytical framework, this paper argues that as the demand for specific services increases in a location, it might be more efficient to move those services closer to that location. This will prevent the Internet backbone from experiencing high traffic loads due to multimedia streams and will offer service pr- <b>viders</b> an automated resource allocation and management mechanism for their services...|$|R
40|$|Currently, the {{business}} of location based service providers largely depends on the existing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), i. e. GPS and recently also GLONASS. Not only are these two systems operated under {{the discretion of the}} US and Russian military, respectively, but they also give only best effort guarantees on accuracy and availability. Because of this and given that LBS providers increasingly rely on positioning information, EU is preparing the launch of Europe’s own GNSS platform, Galileo, which is expected to be fully operational around 2020. Besides the free-of-charge basic service, a Commercial Service (CS) with advanced characteristics will be offered at a premium-rate to service providers. The business case behind the launch of Galileo assumed that part of the investments would be recouped by having service providers pay for the enhanced characteristics of CS, i. e. higher positioning accuracy, signal au- thentication capability and service guarantee. However, as yet, it is still highly unclear whether service providers are in fact interested to pay for accessing CS signals, especially because the access to civil satellite navigation signals has been traditionally free-of-charge. Motivated by the lack of research in this area, this thesis seeks an answer to the question “What are the factors contributing to the willingness of service providers to adopt the future Galileo Commercial Service?” To answer this, we analyzed secondary data through desk research as well as con- ducted in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. Specifically, we found that the factors contributing to the willingness of service providers to adopt CS are the key value drivers, other value determinants, demonstrated usefulness, ap- proaches alternative to Galileo CS, and reverse salients. In overall, it appears that service providers are reluctant to make any serious preparations for adopt- ing CS, as they indicate there are too many uncertainties. In order to increase the chances of adoption, we suggest clarifying the value proposition of CS as well as creating awareness of it early on and focusing attention either on getting governments on board to create trust and reputation for CS or on service pro- <b>viders</b> directly...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a fully automatic Estonian {{word sense disambiguation}} system called semyhe {{which is based on}} Estonian WordNet (EstWN) hyponymjhypernym hierarchies and meant to disambiguate both nouns and verbs. 1 Short description of the system The main inspiration for our system is Agirre and Rigau (1996) similar system that disambiguates the English noun senses based on WordNet hyponymjhypernym hierarchy, taking into consideration the distances between the nodes corresponding to the word senses in the WordNet tree as well as the density of the tree. They have also experimented with using meronyms/holonyms in addition to hyponyms/hypernyms but report that it does not improve the results. Our main object was not to focus on the homonymous words only (lexical sample), but to try to disambiguate all nouns and verbs in the text. The Estonian WordNet (EstWN) also contains adjectives but they are not linked by hyponym/hypernym relations. The word sense disambiguation could also try to describe a unique sense for adverbs but in our case such words have not yet been included in the thesaurus. As far as we know this is the first attempt on automatic Estonian word sense disambiguation. 1. 1 Input The input text for our system must be morphologically analyzed, meaning that each word is provided with its lemma and morphological reading. Taking those two into account we can localize the senses that correspond to the word in EstWN hyponym/hypernym tree (<b>Vider</b> et aL 1999). It must be mentioned that although the morphological description in the input can be quite detailed, we only use the information on whether the word is a noun or a verb. A simple morphological analysis that only looks at the word-form and not its context can result in very ambiguous output. On average 45 % of the words are morphologically ambiguous in Estonian texts (Kaalep, 1997). The ambiguity can be greatly reduced by also applying the Estonian morphological disambiguator (Kaalep and Vaino, 1998) to the text before the word sense disambiguation. Since even then the words can in principle stay morphologically ambiguous, our system doesn't require each word to have exactly one morphological reading assigned to it in the input text...|$|E

Oppgaven har sitt teoretiske utgangspunkt i et multimodalt perspektiv, som innebærer at mennesker tilegner seg kunnskap gjennom flere former for tegn og modaliteter. Videre har oppgaven også et didaktisk-pedagogisk perspektiv, med fokus på pedagogiske og didaktiske metoder i ulike læreres hørelæreundervisning. Undersøkelsen har blitt gjennomført i form av observasjoner og kvalitative intervjuer av ulike lærere og deres undervisning. Resultatene viser at samtlige informanter anser det som viktig å ha balanse og sammenheng mellom teoretisk og praktisk arbeid i hørelæreundervisningen. Videre anser samtlige informanter forholdet mellom hørelære og instrumentalspill og sang som svært viktig. Inkludering av elevenes hovedinstrument i undervisningen trekkes fram som en gunstig metode for å tydeliggjøre dette. Benyttelsen av slikt arbeid er dog ulik i de respektive informantenes undervisning, da det krever forutsetninger som ikke ligger til rette hos et flertall av lærerne. The {{purpose of this}} study is to gain insight into how {{different}} teachers in ear training consider and work with theoretical and practical elements, in their teaching in Swedish and Norwegian high schools. Furthermore, the study also focuses on how the teachers consider the relationship between ear training and instrumental playing and singing. Prior research on this topic shows that there are differences among ear training teachers, between the purpose of their teaching, and what is done practically. With this in mind, my aim is to gain an insight in how different teachers work with these aspects in their own teaching. I also wish to get more knowledge of how they view these aspects in relation to the general teaching of ear training. The study has its theoretical basis in a multimodal perspective, which means that people  acquire knowledge through multiple forms of signs and modalities. Furthermore, the study also has a didactic-pedagogical perspective, focusing on the pedagogical and didactic methods of different teachers in the subject of ear training.   The survey has been conducted in the form of qualitative interviews with various teachers, as well as observations of their teaching. The results indicate that all the informants consider it important to have balance and coherence between theoretical and practical work in ear training. Furthermore, all informants consider the relationship between ear training and instrumental music and singing as very important. Inclusion of the students own instruments in ear training lessons, is emphasized as a beneficial method for working with this aspect. The degree to which this method is utilized, is however expressed as different among the informants. Working so, however, requires certain conditions, that are sometimes missing...|$|E

Some of them may contain multiword expressions (MWEs) and achieving them faster than compositional alternatives proved efficient in symbolic parsing (see below). We propose to apply this strategy to symbolic LTAG (Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar) parsing using an architecture adaptable to probabilistic parsing. We are particularly interested in LTAGs because, according to (Abeillé and Schabes 1989), they show several advantages with respect to parsing MWEs. Firstly, unification constraints on feature structures attached to tree nodes allow one to naturally express dependencies between arguments at different depths in the elementary trees (as in NP 0 <b>vider</b> DET sac 'to express one's secret thoughts', where the determiner DET embedded in the direct object must agree in person and number with the subject NP 0). Secondly, the so-called extended domain of locality offers a natural framework for representing two different kinds of discontinuities. Namely, discontinuities coming from the internal structure of a MWE are directly visible in elementary trees and are handled in parsing mostly by substitution. Disconti-nuities coming from insertion of modifiers (e. g. a bunch of NP, a whole bunch of NP) are invisible in elementary trees but are handled in parsing by adjunction. Consider the sentence in example (1). (1) Acid rains in Ghana are equally grim. When it is being scanned by a left-to-right parser, two competing interpretations are syntactically valid for the first 4 words. One of them considers rains as a verb whose subject is acid while, according to the other, rains is the head noun of the NN compound acid rains. Our objective is to propose a parsing strategy which would promote the latter interpretation due the fact that it contains a known MWE. More precisely, the parser should: (i) trivially, admit only grammar-compliant analyses of a sentence, (ii) achieve MWE-oriented interpretations more rapidly than potential compositional interpretations, (iii) eliminate no grammar-compliant interpretations. Note that all these conditions could rather easily be met for sentence (1) in a pre-processing-based approach in which potential MWEs are identified prior to parsing and conflated into word-with-spaces tokens. Such an approach might however lead to a parsing failure in the case of sentence (2) if the two initial tokens are wrongly merged into a nominal compound in the pre-parsing step. In order to avoid errors of this kind, MWE identification and parsing should be performed jointly. (2) Hunger strikes the civilians since 2001. Seminal works, such as (Finkel and Manning 2009, Green et al. 2011, 2013, Constant et al. 2013), show that the results of probabilis-tic MWE identification and/or parsing are improved when both tasks are performed simultaneously. (Wehrli et al. 2010) point out that such an improvement (also within further parsing-based applications, e. g. machine translation) occurs in symbolic parsing (here: in a Chomskian grammar-based approach) when the knowledge about a potential occurrence of MWEs guides the parsing process. Our goal is to apply a similar strategy to the one in (Wehrli et al. 2010), i. e. to systematically promote MWE-oriented interpretations, within LTAG parsing 1 We additionally wish to design the parser architecture {{in such a way that}} corpus-based probabilities about MWE contexts can be 1 The parsing algorithm should of course abstract away from the way the input LTAG grammar was obtained (manually crafted, generated from a metagram-mar, or learned from a treebank) ...|$|E
