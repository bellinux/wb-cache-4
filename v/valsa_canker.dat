40|$|NYS IPM Type: Fruits IPM Fact SheetPerennial canker (also called <b>Valsa</b> <b>canker,</b> Cytospora canker, Leucostoma canker, and peach canker) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{debilitating}} diseases of peach trees in the Northeast. It also occurs regularly on sweet cherry, apricot, and plum trees, but is not generally as damaging on these crops. Successful long-term production of peaches is seldom possible if the disease is not controlled...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of biocontrol agent Saccharothrix yanglingensis Hhs. 015 action against Valsa mali, a major apple <b>Valsa</b> <b>canker</b> pathogen, was examined using a novel, sensitive (minimum detection limit 100 pg/μL) and reliably RT-qPCR technique. Prior to lesion formation, total concentration of V. mali in the bark {{showed a significant}} decrease (p< 0. 05) after 24 h of Hhs. 015 treatment. This was more pronounced at 48 and 96 h post treatment. After lesion formation, levels of V. mali remained constant at the boundary between infected and uninfected bark tissues, although the relative expansion rate of the lesion was significantly reduced (p< 0. 05). Gene expression levels of endo-polygalacturonase, a marker for fungal pathogenicity, were sharply reduced while host induced resistance callose synthase levels increased significantly (p< 0. 05) at the boundary bark at 9 d after Hhs. 015 treatment. The results showed that biocontrol agent Hhs. 015 prevented infection of V. mali by inhibiting pathogen growth, down-regulating pathogenicity factor expression and inducing {{a high level of}} host resistance...|$|E
40|$|In fungi, heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide binding {{proteins}} (G-proteins) are {{key elements}} of signal transduction pathways, which control growth, asexual and sexual development, as well as virulence. In this study, we have identified two genes encoding heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits, named Gvm 2 and Gvm 3, from Valsa mali, the causal agent of apple <b>Valsa</b> <b>canker.</b> Characterization of Gvm 2 and Gvm 3 mutants indicates that Gvm 3 may be a crucial regulator of vegetative growth. Deletion of the corresponding gene results in a 20 % reduction in growth rate. Besides, Gvm 2 and Gvm 3 seem {{to be involved in}} asexual reproduction, and mutants are hypersensitive to oxidative and cell membrane stresses. Interestingly, both G protein alpha subunits were most probably involved in V. mali virulence. In infection assays using Malus domestica cv. 'Fuji' leaves and twigs, the size of lesions caused by deletion mutants △Gvm 2, or △Gvm 3 are significantly reduced. Furthermore, many genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes-important virulence factors in V. mali-are expressed at a lower level in these deletion mutants. Our results suggest that Gvm 2 and Gvm 3 {{play an important role in}} virulence probably by regulation of expression of cell wall degrading enzymes. △Gvm 2, and △Gvm 3 mutants were further analyzed with respect to their impact on the transcript levels of genes in the cAMP/PKA pathway. The expression of the genes encoding adenylate cyclase VmAC, protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit VmPKR, and PKA catalytic subunit VmPKA 1 are down-regulated in both mutants. Further analyses indicated that intracellular cAMP level and PKA activity are down-regulated in the △Gvm 3 mutant, but are basically unchanged in the △Gvm 2 mutant. Overall, our findings indicate that both Gvm 2 and Gvm 3 play diverse roles in the modulation of vegetative growth, asexual development, and virulence in V. mali...|$|E
40|$|Valsa mali (V. mali) is the causative {{agent of}} apple tree <b>Valsa</b> <b>canker,</b> which heavily damages the {{production}} of apples in China. However, the biological roles of the RNA interfering (RNAi) pathway in the pathogenicity of V. mali remain unknown. Dicer-like proteins (DCLs) are important components that control the initiation of the RNAi pathway. In this study, VmDCL 1 and VmDCL 2 were isolated and functionally characterized in V. mali. VmDCL 1 and VmDCL 2 are orthologous in evolution to the DCLs in Cryphonectria parasitica. The deletion of VmDCL 1 and VmDCL 2 did not affect vegetative growth when the mutants (ΔVmDCL 1, ΔVmDCL 2 and ΔVmDCL 1 DCL 2) and wild type strain 03 – 8 were grown on a PDA medium at 25 °C in the dark. However, the colony of ΔVmDCL 1 increased by 37. 1 % compared to the 03 – 8 colony in a medium containing 0. 05 % H 2 O 2 3 days after inoculation, {{and the growth of}} ΔVmDCL 1 was significantly inhibited in a medium containing 0. 5 M KCl at a ratio of 25. 7 %. Meanwhile, in the presence of 0. 05 % H 2 O 2, the growth of ΔVmDCL 2 decreased by 34. 5 % compared with the growth of 03 – 8, but ΔVmDCL 2 grew normally in the presence of 0. 5 M KCl. More importantly, the expression of VmDCL 2 was up-regulated 125 -fold during the pathogen infection. In the infection assays using apple twigs, the pathogenicity of ΔVmDCL 2 and ΔVmDCL 1 DCL 2 was significantly reduced compared with that of 03 – 8 at a ratio of 24. 7 and 41. 3 %, respectively. All defective phenotypes could be nearly rescued by re-introducing the wild type VmDCL 1 and VmDCL 2 alleles. Furthermore, the number and length distribution of unique small RNAs (unisRNAs) in the mutants and 03 – 8 were analyzed using deep sequencing. The number of unisRNAs was obviously lower in ΔVmDCL 1, ΔVmDCL 2 and ΔVmDCL 1 DCL 2 than that in 03 – 8, and the length distribution of the sRNAs also markedly changed after the VmDCLs were deleted. These results indicated that VmDCLs function in the H 2 O 2 and KCl stress response, pathogenicity and generation of sRNAs...|$|E
