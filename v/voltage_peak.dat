A 1200 hertz {{amplitude}} modulated sine wave is pressed into {{the left and right}} channels with a phase difference of 90 degrees. Each channel holds one of the two bit streams required for the time code. In one cycle of either wave form, two bits are stored: one on the positive <b>voltage</b> <b>peak</b> and one on the negative voltage valley. The relative amplitudes of these peaks represent either a binary one or zero. A relatively high amplitude on either peak represents a one, a relatively low amplitude represents a zero. In each channel is a separate bitstream, the left channel is not identical to the right (disregarding the phase difference).|$|E
50|$|A {{rectifier}} and {{a filter}} capacitor were connected directly to the mains. If the mains power was AC, the rectifier converted it to DC. If it was DC, the rectifier effectively acted as a conductor. When operating on DC, the voltage available was reduced by the voltage drop across the rectifier. Because an AC waveform has a <b>voltage</b> <b>peak</b> that {{is higher than the}} average value produced by the rectifier, the same set operating on the same root mean square AC supply voltage would have a higher effective voltage after the rectifier stage. In areas using 110-120 volt AC, a simple half-wave rectifier limited the maximum plate voltage that could be developed; this was adequate for relatively low-power audio equipment, but television receivers or higher-powered amplifiers required either a more complex voltage doubler rectifier or warranted the use of a power transformer with a conveniently high secondary voltage. Areas with 220-240 volt AC supplies could develop higher plate voltage with a simple rectifier. Transformerless power supplies were feasible for television receivers in 220-240 volt areas. Additionally, the use of a transformer allowed multiple independent power supplies from separate transformer windings for different stages.|$|E
30|$|RMS and <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> are {{indicators}} of masticatory muscle activity [22]. After BTX-A injection, {{all of the}} EMG parameters were immediately decreased. Regarding <b>peak</b> <b>voltage,</b> both groups 1 and 2 exhibited significantly lower values when compared with pre-injection measurements. <b>Peak</b> <b>voltage</b> is generally regarded as the maximum muscle power of the measured muscle [26, 27]. Therefore, when the <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> is reduced, maximum muscle power may also be decreased [28]. The decreased <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> {{might be due to}} the paralytic effects of BTX-A. RMS also showed similar results in that groups 1 and 2 RMS values were significantly different after injection. RMS measurements indicate the activity of the masseter muscle, and therefore, decreased RMS values suggest that masseter muscle activity was also reduced.|$|R

5000|$|When a {{transformer}} is first energized, a transient current up to 10 to 15 {{times larger than}} the rated transformer current can flow for several cycles. Toroidal transformers, using less copper for the same power handling, can have up to 60 times inrush to running current. Worst case inrush happens when the primary winding is connected at an instant around the zero-crossing of the primary voltage, (which for a pure inductance would be the current maximum in the AC cycle) and if the polarity of the voltage half cycle has the same polarity as the remanence in the iron core has. (The magnetic remanence was left high from a preceding half cycle). Unless the windings and core are sized to normally never exceed 50% of saturation, (and in an efficient transformer they never are, such a construction would be overly heavy and inefficient) then during such a start up the core will be saturated. This can also be expressed as the remnant magnetism in normal operation is nearly as high as the saturation magnetism at the [...] "knee" [...] of the hysteresis loop. Once the core saturates however, the winding inductance appears greatly reduced, and only the resistance of the primary side windings and the impedance of the power line are limiting the current. As saturation occurs for part half cycles only, harmonic rich waveforms can be generated, and can cause problems to other equipment. For large transformers with low winding resistance and high inductance, these inrush currents can last for several seconds until the transient has died away (decay time proportional to ~XL/R)and the regular AC equilibrium is established. To avoid magnetic inrush, only for transformers with an air gap in the core, the inductive load needs to be synchronously connected near a supply <b>voltage</b> <b>peak,</b> in contrast with the zero voltage switching which is desirable to minimize sharp edged current transients with resistive loads such as high power heaters. But for toroidal transformers only a premagnetising procedure before switching on allows to start those transformers without any inrush current peak. Inrush current can be divided in three categories:- ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether unintentionally applied currents may have induced the previously reported resistive and current-voltage characteristic anomalies near the superconducting transition temperature in quasi-one-dimensional aluminum lines.

Additional a. c. current applied to the voltage leads instead of the current leads induces an excess <b>voltage</b> <b>peak</b> near the critical current in V(I) curves. The resistive peak near the transition results from mixing, but we cannot explain the <b>voltage</b> <b>peak</b> by a simple mixing analysis.

In the liquid nitrogen during the increase of the heat flux there is superheating (temperature overshoot) and boiling hysteresis takes place. We explain <b>voltage</b> <b>peaks</b> and <b>voltage</b> oscillations by the hysteresis phenomenon in boiling nitrogen during the increase and decrease of the heat flux in the nitrogen which {{is a result of}} current redistribution in the HTS tapes. Based on the measurements of voltage and temperature of the HTS tapes during current overload and numerical analysis of the process we estimated the heat-transfer characteristics from the HTS tapes to liquid nitrogen.

Inverter driven loads such as heat pumps generate oddharmonics that can be modulated by fluctuations in thoseloads, such as oscillating torque.

The process of Joule heating, evaporation, and plasma generating and expanding is evident. According to Fig.  4, a blurring light is observed, and the {{voltage and current}} rises slowly, indicating a Joule heating process (≤[*] 168 [*]ns). At 218 [*]ns, the voltage is suddenly increased while the emitting light is distinct, and {{the area of the}} light is nearly the area of the bowtie bridge. This corresponds to the evaporation process of the energetic Al/Ni superlattice. When the voltage reaches its maximum at 258 [*]ns, the explosion associated with plasma generation takes place following with intense light. After exploding, the plasma expansion towards ambient is apt to cause shock wave. Product particles which existed in the combustion of Al/Ni RMFs are not observed in this study, implicating that the explosion of energetic Al/Ni superlattice is uniform under high-pulse current [38]. Therefore, the time of the <b>voltage</b> <b>peak</b> can be regarded as the delay time (Tb) (between the onset of the current pulse and the <b>voltage</b> <b>peak</b> signal). The energy absorbed of the sample during this delay time is deemed as the critical explosion energy (Ec). We should note that the point of onset light emission intensity corresponds to the <b>voltage</b> <b>peak</b> (258 [*]ns). The signal of light emission intensity is hardly to be detected because of the weak light prior to explosion.|$|E

The paper built a Virtual Instrument platform based on LabVIEW and PXI 4220 modularized hardware of NI. Then, a testing and analysis system for corn ultra-weak bioluminescence features was designed. Different freshness corns were tested and analyzed about the relation of freshness and ultra-weak bioluminescence features. The experimental results shows that the ultra-weak bioluminescence <b>voltage</b> <b>peak</b> values of different freshness corns all maximize about 1 hour, and <b>voltage</b> <b>peak</b> values between different freshness corns have no evident relationship. However, the ultra-weak bioluminescence voltage energy sum of different freshness corns increase progressively with the freshness degree. So, detection of voltage energy sum of different freshness corns can reflect wheat freshness effectively. Comparing with traditional method, the freshness detection method based on wheat ultra-weak bioluminescence features can realize precise, rapid and nondestructive examination...|$|E

5000|$|Rotary gaps {{operated}} in two modes, synchronous and [...] A synchronous gap {{was driven by}} a synchronous AC motor so that it ran at a fixed speed, and the gap fired in direct relation to the waveform of the A.C. supply that recharged the tank capacitor. The operator changed {{the point in the}} waveform where the gaps were closest by adjusting the rotor position on the motor shaft relative to the stator's studs. By properly adjusting the synchronous gap, it was possible to have the gap fire only at the <b>voltage</b> <b>peaks</b> of the input current. This technique made the tank circuit fire only at successive <b>voltage</b> <b>peaks,</b> thereby delivering maximum energy from the fully charged tank capacitor each time the gap fired. The break rate was thus fixed at twice the incoming power frequency (typically, 100 or 120 breaks/second, corresponding to 50 Hz or 60 Hz supply). When properly engineered and adjusted, synchronous spark gap systems delivered the largest amount of power to the antenna. However, electrode wear progressively changed the gap's firing point, so synchronous gaps were somewhat temperamental and difficult to maintain.|$|R
