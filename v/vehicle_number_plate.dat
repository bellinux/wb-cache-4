The system, based on regular PC with video camera, catches video frames which include a visible car <b>Vehicle</b> <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> and processes them. Once a <b>Vehicle</b> <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> is detected, its digits are recognized, displayed on the User Interface or checked against a database. The focus is on the design of algorithms used for extracting the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> from a single image, isolating the characters of the plate and identifying the individual characters. The Proposed system can be implemented using Vision Assistant & LabVIEW 2010. The performance of the system can be investigated on real images of the number plates of different vehicles...|$|E

During comparing it uses a edge detection and compares pixel to pixel templates that are already define in the program. And after matching the number plate it request for the RFID card. For this RF receiver is also interface with it and when RFID card is sweep on the RF receiver it detect its ID and match with the ID that is already stored in the database. Radio frequency identification (RFID), is a generic term for technology that radio waves is used to identify people automatically and objects. If the ID and the number are matches with the database then it show the message “authorized person ” else “unauthorized person”. Both should be match with the database. If single one condition is true then it shows “unauthorized person”. The objective is to design an efficient automatic authorized vehicle identification system by using the <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> <b>plate.</b> The developed system firstly detects the vehicle and then it capture the <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> <b>plate.</b> And <b>Vehicle</b> <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> is extracted by using the image segmentation and Optical character recognition technique which is used for the recognizing the character. and then resulting data is used to compare with the records on a database and data extracted from RFID.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} extraction of the vehicle number plates from the image using hybrid mathematical morphology techniques. The gist is to use different morphological operations {{in such a way}} so that the number plate of the vehicle can be identified accurately. The method makes the extraction of the plate independent of color, size and location of number plate. The proposed approach can be divided into different processes, which are, image enhancement, morphing transformation, morphological gradient, combination of resultant images and extracting the number plate from the objects that are left in the image. This algorithm can quickly and correctly detect the number plate area from the vehicle image.

We concentrate on two key issues of this application: speed and robustness. Our focus is put on detecting parts of a number plate, instead of the number plate itself as a whole. To achieve the target of real-time detection, two simple features based on a redefined vertical edge map are constructed. To address the illumination-sensitive problem of using colour information, a Gaussian weighted histogram intersection (GWHI) method is proposed. The above new ideas compose the {{major part of the}} algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate a promising preliminary result on detecting yellow number plates in terms of detection speed and robustness, which shows the feasibility of the proposed method...|$|E
