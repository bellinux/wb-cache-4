40|$|Aging {{is related}} to a {{deterioration}} of cognitive performance and to multiple alterations in the brain. Even {{before the beginning of}} a noticeable cognitive decline, the framework which holds cognitive function experiences these alterations. From a system-vulnerability point of view of cognition, the deterioration associated with age would be the collection of repercussions during a life. Brain function and structure are modified in a multidimensional way, which could concern different aspects like structural integrity, functional activity, connectivity, or glucose metabolism. From this point of view, the effects of aging could affect the most brain systems and their functional activity. In this study, we analyze the functional development of three cognitive domains in relation to aging, educational level, and cognitive reserve (CR). A total of 172 healthy subjects were divided into two age groups (young and old), and completed a battery of classic neuropsychological tests. The tests were organized and analyzed according to three cognitive domains: working memory and flexibility, <b>visuoconstructive</b> functions, and declarative memory. Subjects also completed a questionnaire on CR. Results showed that the performance in all cognitive domains decreased with age. In particular, tests related to working memory, flexibility, and <b>visuoconstructive</b> abilities were influenced by age. Nevertheless, this effect was attenuated by effects of education, mainly in <b>visuoconstructive</b> domain. Surprisingly, visual as well as verbal memory tests were not affected either by aging, education, or CR. Brain plasticity plays a prominent role in the aging process, but, as other studies have shown, the plasticity mechanism is quite different in healthy vs. pathological brains. Moreover, this plasticity brain mechanism could be modulated by education and CR. Specially, cognitive domains as working memory, some executive functions and the <b>visuoconstructive</b> abilities seem to be modulated by education. Therefore, it seems to be crucial, to propose mechanisms of maintenance of a healthy and enriched brain, since it promotes auto-regulatory mechanisms of well-aging...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To verify the performance of Parkinson's disease patients in activities requiring <b>visuoconstructive</b> and visuospatial skills.

40|$|AbstractA unique {{opportunity}} to understand genetic determinants of cognition is offered by Williams syndrome (WS), a well-characterized hemideletion on chromosome 7 q 11. 23 that causes extreme, specific weakness in visuospatial construction (the ability to visualize an object {{as a set of}} parts or construct a replica). Using multimodal neuroimaging, we identified a neural mechanism underlying the WS <b>visuoconstructive</b> deficit. Hierarchical assessment of visual processing with fMRI showed isolated hypoactivation in WS in the parietal portion of the dorsal stream. In the immediately adjacent parietooccipital/intraparietal sulcus, structural neuroimaging showed a gray matter volume reduction in participants with WS. Path analysis demonstrated that the functional abnormalities could be attributed to impaired input from this structurally altered region. Our observations confirm a longstanding hypothesis about dorsal stream dysfunction in WS, demonstrate effects of a localized abnormality on visual information processing in humans, and define a systems-level phenotype for mapping genetic determinants of <b>visuoconstructive</b> function...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{a review}} of the literature, the {{diagnostic}} criteria used for children with nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD) were identified as follows: (a) low visuospatial intelligence; (b) discrepancy between verbal and visuospatial intelligence; (c) <b>visuoconstructive</b> and fine-motor coordination skills; (d) visuospatial memory tasks; (e) reading better than mathematical achievement; and (f) socioemotional skills. An analysis of the effect size was used to investigate the strength of criteria for diagnosing NLD considering 35 empirical studies published from January 1980 to February 2011. Overall, our results showed that the most important criteria for distinguishing children with NLD from controls were as follows: a low visuospatial intelligence with a relatively good verbal intelligence, <b>visuoconstructive</b> and fine-motor coordination impairments, good reading decoding together with low math performance. Deficits in visuospatial memory and social skills were also present. A preliminary set of criteria for diagnosing NLD was developed on these grounds. It was concluded, however, that—although some consensus is emerging—further research is needed to definitively establish shared diagnostic criteria for children with NLD...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} thrombolysis and visuoperceptual functions in right hemisphere (RH) infarct patients. Fifty-six consecutive patients with first acute RH infarct were matched for age, years of education and stroke severity {{at the time of}} admission to the emergency department (baseline NIHSS; National Institute of Health Stroke Scale), compared according to whether (T+) or not (T−) they received thrombolysis. Neurological (NIHSS at hospital ward; Barthel index; BI) and neuropsychological examinations were conducted 4  days after onset. <b>Visuoconstructive</b> abilities were assessed with the block design and visual search and reasoning with the picture completion subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale revised. Visual neglect was assessed with the conventional subtests of the Behavioural Inattention test and visual memory with the visual reproduction subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised. T+ and T− patients did not differ in baseline NIHSS, age, years of education, hemianopia, hemiparesis, or in basic ADL (BI). T− patients had more severe strokes (NIHSS at hospital ward) and poorer <b>visuoconstructive</b> abilities than T+ patients.

40|$|Abstract Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess {{children}} and adolescents with mild and severe anxiety disorders for their performance in attention, verbal episodic memory, working memory, <b>visuoconstructive</b> skills, executive functions, and cognitive global functioning and conduct comparative analyses with the performance of children free from anxiety disorders. Methods: Our sample comprised 68 children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years (41 with current diagnoses of anxiety disorders and 27 controls) selected from a larger cross-sectional community sample of adolescents. Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders were categorized into two groups on the basis of anxiety severity (mild or severe). All participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment battery to evaluate attention, verbal episodic memory, working memory, <b>visuoconstructive</b> skills, and executive and cognitive functions. Results: No differences were found in any neuropsychological tests, with the single exception that the group with mild anxiety had better performance on the Digit Span backward test compared to subjects with severe anxiety and to controls (p = 0. 041; η 2 = 0. 11). Conclusions: Not only might anxiety disorders spare main cognitive functions during adolescence, they may even enhance certain working memory processes...|$|E
40|$|Dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) affects most neuropsychological domains {{including}} language, memory, and visuo-spatial skills. The {{latter are}} usually assessed by poorly quantifiable copying tasks. We assessed constructional abilities using the Developmental Test of Visuomotor Integration (VMI) comprised {{of a series}} of model drawings of increasing complexity. Twenty-six patients meeting NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for DAT, 21 normal aged subjects with normal mental status examinations, and 14 patients with vascular dementia were tested. In DAT, we found significant correlations between <b>visuoconstructive</b> ability and memory registration, delayed recall, and language functions such as confrontation naming and word-list generation. Less marked, but significant correlations were found in the vascular dementia group between <b>visuoconstructive</b> ability and memory registration and word-list generation. A few normal elderly subjects were unable to copy the most challenging figures. The study demonstrates that: (1) VMI is a convenient method for quantifying constructional deficits in DAT and other dementing illnesses; (2) constructional deficits are highly correlated with dementia severity and memory and language deficits in DAT; (3) neuropsychological deficits are less highly inter-correlated in vascular dementia than in DAT; and (4) abnormal constructional skills are present in some normal elderly...|$|E
40|$|Developmental {{topographical}} disorientation (DTD) is {{the presence}} of navigational deficits in the context of normal intellectual ability {{and in the absence of}} any perinatal, neurological, or psychiatric disorder. As only three cases of DTD have been fully described thus far, we are still unable to draw definitive conclusions about its nature and relationship with other visuospatial competencies, such as mental rotation. The case of Mr. L. A., a 38 -year-old man with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, sheds some light on these open questions. A neuropsychological assessment including IQ, memory, visuospatial, <b>visuoconstructive,</b> and navigational tests showed that Mr. L. A. has pure navigational deficits affecting both route knowledge and cognitive map processing. Unlike previously described cases of DTD, Mr. L. A. was not affected by any other visuospatial or <b>visuoconstructive</b> deficits. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task involving the recall of route knowledge, Mr. L. A. showed activation in the occipital areas, involved in low-level perceptual analysis of the stimuli, and showed no activation in the areas activated in controls with regard to route knowledge. The present case suggests that different types of DTD exist, which are characterized by different navigational difficulties and anomalous/lacking functional brain activities in specific navigational networks...|$|E

40|$|Background The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{association}} between thrombolysis and length of hospital stay after right hemisphere (RH) infarct, and to identify which cognitive functions were predictive of discharge. Methods The study group consisted of 75 acute RH patients. Thirty-three patients had thrombolysis. Neuropsychologicalexaminations were performed within 11 days of stroke onset. The cognitive predictors were visual neglect, visual memory, visual search and reasoning and <b>visuoconstructive</b> abilities. The outcome variable was time from stroke to discharge to home. Results Thrombolysis emerged as a statistically significant predictor of discharge time in patients with moderate/severe stroke (NIHSS ≥ 5). In the total series of patients and in patients with mild stroke (NIHSS < 5), thrombolysiswas not significantly associated with discharge time. Milder <b>visuoconstructive</b> defects shortened the hospital stay of the whole patient group and of patients with moderate/severe stroke. In all patient groups, independence in activitiesof daily living (ADL) was a significant single predictor of a shorter hospital stay. The best combination of predictors for discharge was independence in ADL in the total series of patients and in patients with mild stroke, and thrombolysis and independence in ADL in patients with moderate/severe stroke. Conclusions Thrombolytic treatment was a significant predictor of earlier discharge to home in patients with moderate/severe RH infarct, while cognitive functions had less predictive power...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with right}} or more rarely left parietotemporal lesions after stroke may have {{profound}} visuospatial disorders that impair {{activities of daily}} living (ADL) and long-term outcome. Clinical studies indicate improvements with systematic training of perception. Studies of perceptual learning in healthy persons suggest rapid improvements in perceptual learning of spatial line orientation with partial transfer to nontrained line orientations. Objective. The authors investigated a novel feedback-based perceptual training procedure for the rehabilitation of patients after stroke. Methods. In an uncontrolled trial, 13 participants showing profound deficits in line orientation and related visuospatial tasks within 12 to 28 weeks of onset performed repetitive feedback-based, computerized training of visual line orientation over 4 weeks of treatment. Visual line-orientation discrimination and visuospatial and <b>visuoconstructive</b> tasks were assessed before and after training. Results. The authors found (a) rapid improvements in trained but also in nontrained spatial orientation tests in all 13 participants, partially up to a normal level; (b) stability of the obtained improvements at 2 -month follow-up; (c) interocular transfer of training effects to the nontrained eye in 2 participants suggesting a central, postchiasmatic locus for this perceptual improvement; and (d) graded transfer of improvements to related spatial tasks, such as horizontal writing, analog clock reading, and <b>visuoconstructive</b> capacities but no transfer to unrelated measures of visual performance.

Based on these positive findings, it was examined in the present case study whether a child who had been diagnosed to suffer from tuberculous meningitis would benefit from TENS. Furthermore, as aggression and overactive behaviour were also prominent clinical symptoms, the effects of methylphenidate were investigated. Methods and Procedures: Neuropsychological tests were used to assess attention/concentration and visuospatial and <b>visuoconstructive</b> memory. Behaviour, including the level of activity during 24 hours, was assessed by one observation scale and actigraphy. Experimental interventions: TENS and methylphenidate.

All children underwent cognitive and neurologic follow-up examination sessions 2 years after the insult. Cognitive development was assessed with age-appropriate instruments. RESULTS: Although mean cognitive performance was in the lower normative range, we found poorer results in subtests measuring <b>visuoconstructive</b> skills, short-term memory, and processing speed. Risk factors for negative cognitive outcome were young age at stroke, seizures, combined lesion location (cortical and subcortical), as well as marked NI.

Networks in the delta (2 - 4 Hz) frequency range decrease, while networks in the beta/gamma frequency range (> 16 Hz) increase in size with advancing age.

Objective: To investigate {{the relationship between the}} presence of anosognosia symptoms and cognitive domains, functional abilities, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (pAD) and elderly controls (EC). Methods: Twenty-one pAD (14 women) and twenty-two EC (16 women) were submitted to a neuropsychological battery of tests assessing global cognitive status, and specific cognitive functions: memory, executive and attention functions, verbal fluency and <b>visuoconstructive</b> abilities. Additionally, functional abilities (FAQ) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI) were measured. Results: The linear regression statistical test found general anosognosia to be associated with subjective memory complaints, age and Arithmetic-DRS in the EC group. On the other hand, cognitive and functional abilities scores (Arithmetic- DRS, IQCODE and FAQ) were the best predictors in pAD patients, particularly for behavioral awareness.

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} on 25 longitudinal studies involving 901 initially non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients to examine the magnitude of decline across multiple cognitive domains associated with disease progression. Pooled effect sizes reflecting the standardized difference between baseline and follow-up neuropsychological performance were calculated for 8 cognitive domains using a random-effects model. Relatively small effect sizes were found across all cognitive domains (d =. 00 -. 40). During a mean follow-up interval of 29 months, significant declines were detected in global cognitive ability (d =. 40), <b>visuoconstructive</b> skills (d =. 32), and memory (d =. 29). Age showed a significant relation with decline in global cognitive ability and memory. Lower educational level was associated with greater decline in all cognitive domains. Studies with longer follow-up intervals yielded larger effect sizes for global cognitive ability. In non-demented PD patients, changes in cognitive functions over time appear to be modest. Educational level, age, and length of the follow-up interval are likely to affect the magnitude of decline in several domains.

METHODS: Seventy patients undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery (CABG) were investigated preoperatively, two to three and five to nine days postoperatively with a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment including orientation, word fluency, naming, arithmetic, memory, and <b>visuoconstructive</b> tasks. RESULTS: Patients exhibited significant early postoperative impairment affecting all tasks but naming. Except for the orientation measurement, most patients recovered by the fifth to ninth postoperative day. Only six patients had delirium according to DSM III-R criteria on {{the second or third}} postoperative day. Cluster analysis of neuropsychological data obtained on the second to third postoperative day identified 10 patients who were cognitively compromised. As a group, these patients had required a greater number of defibrillations and exhibited lower cardiac indices postoperatively. Preoperatively, patients at risk for postoperative dysfunction were characterised by lower verbal memory, word fluency, and clock orientation scores.

The information is intended to provide help for early diagnosis and appropriate stimulation of these patients. In the sample reported here, only about half of the patients referred with presumptive diagnosis were in fact (FISH), indicating that facial dysmorphism {{may not be the most}} reliable sign for diagnosis. Initial pediatric signs are developmental delay and nocturnal irritability. In consultation, facial dysmorphies and heart murmur are detected. There is also low birth weight, failure to thrive, unsuccessful breastfeeding, and gastroesophageal reflux. All these symptoms are strongly suggestive of Williams syndrome. Subsequent steps consist of cardiologic studies. Our results indicate that the triad of symptoms consisting of infantile hypercalcemia, dysmorphic facies, and supravalvular aortic stenosis, which until recently was considered fundamental for Williams syndrome diagnosis, is not usually present and does not lead to an early diagnosis. Cognitively, these children are characterized by hypersociability, hyperacusia, deficient <b>visuoconstructive</b> abilities, attentional deficit and hyperactivity, and in some cases, spontaneous musical interests.

METHODS: seven to 10 year-old girls and boys from a poor community in São Paulo were evaluated: 27 eutrophyc, 31 stunted and 15 chronically malnourished. Neuropsychological evaluation involved cognitive functions not fully assessed in this population, such as working, declarative and non-declarative memories, attention and executive functions. Socio-economic indicators, maternal mental health and the children's behaviour at school were also evaluated. RESULTS: malnourished children had a lower score on the vocabulary test than the eutrophic and stunted groups (p s< 0. 05), performed worse in the visuospatial working memory task (p = 0. 01), were more anxious than the stunted (p = 0. 006), and despite having lower average birth weight than eutrophic children (p = 0. 01), only two children as had prenatal malnutrition. Stunted children exhibited no impairment. No differences in socio-economic variables were found among groups. CONCLUSIONS: chronic malnutrition was associated to impairment of expressive speech, visual-spatial short-term memory and increased anxiety.

She further showed severe <b>visuoconstructive</b> and executive deficits, ideomotor apraxia, elements of Gerstmann’s syndrome, bilateral agraphesthesia and discrete asymmetric motor deficits. Blood tests were unremarkable. Structural brain imaging revealed diffuse fronto-temporo-parietal atrophy, which was most severe in the parietal regions. Meanwhile, FDG-PET suggested asymmetrical fronto-temporo-parietal hypometabolism, with sparing of the posterior cingulate gyrus. A diagnosis of possible corticobasal syndrome (CBS) was made. Amyloid-PET using the novel tracer NAV 4694 was ordered, and revealed significant deposition of fibrillar amyloid (SUVR 2. 05). The primary diagnosis was CBS with underlying Alzheimer pathology and treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor was initiated. Determination of underlying pathological CBS subtype is not simple even when based on extensive investigation including clinical presentation, atrophy patterns on MRI, and regional hypometabolism on FDG-PET. By contrast, amyloid imaging quickly confirmed Alzheimer pathology, and allowed rapid initiation of treatment in this complex case with early psychiatric symptoms. This case study illustrates the clinical utility of amyloid imaging {{in the setting}} of atypical cases seen in a tertiary memory clinic...|$|E
40|$|Background: Current {{views on}} {{continuous}} positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment {{to improve the}} cognitive deficits of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are controversial, so we performed a meta-analysis. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was undertaken in PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, PsycInfo, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CNKI, WanFang, VIP, and CBMdisc for studies published from June 1971 to July 2014. The outcome measures included neuropsychological tests of the 7 cognitive domains detailed below. Results: After screening the titles and abstracts and thoroughly reading the full text, we obtained 13 studies with little risk of bias that incorporated 1744 middle-aged obese participants with mild to severe OSAS. The studies were published from 1994 to 2012. Treatment durations varied from 1 to 24 weeks. The effect sizes of attention, vigilance, processing speed, working memory, memory, verbal fluency, and <b>visuoconstructive</b> skills domains were − 0. 10 (P = 0. 24), − 0. 12 (P = 0. 04), − 0. 08 (P = 0. 16), 0. 00 (P = 0. 95), − 0. 04 (P = 0. 30), − 0. 06 (P = 0. 34), and − 0. 01 (P = 0. 92), respectively. Conclusions: Cognition partially improved in patients with OSAS after CPAP treatment. The only domain with significant improvement was vigilance. Rigorous randomized controlled trials need to be performed to obtain clear results...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: Cognitive {{impairment}} {{is one of}} {{the core}} symptoms of Niemann Pick type C (NPC) disease, but few data concerning the neuropsychological profile of NPC patients are available. The aim of our study was to characterize cognitive impairments in NPC disease and to assess the evolution of these symptoms and the impact of miglustat on cognitive follow-up. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 21 adult patients diagnosed with NPC disease. Neuropsychological data (global cognitive efficiency, language, attention, executive functions, praxis, and <b>visuoconstructive</b> functions tests) were retrieved to describe the cognitive profile of patients. Cognitive impairment scores over time were assessed under treatment by miglustat. Results: The majority of patients (90 %) were impaired in one or more cognitive function. Executive functions and attention were the most impaired cognitive functions. Conversely, storage in the episodic memory was preserved in 61. 5 % of cases. Mean neuropsychological scores were stable during the period under miglustat (mean of 3. 8 years). Conclusions: This study {{is one of the}} first to assess the cognitive profile of adult NPC patients. This profile is not specific to attention and executive dysfunctions; however, the preservation of storage in the episodic memory is promising for cognitive remediation. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of miglustat on cognition, but in this study, patients were stable under this treatment...|$|E
40|$|The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is an inexpensive, {{fast and}} easily {{administered}} measure of cognitive function, {{especially in the}} elderly. This instrument is a popular clinical tool widely used in screening for cognitive disorders and dementia. The CDT can be applied in different ways and scoring procedures also vary. OBJECTIVE: The aims {{of this study were}} to analyze the performance of elderly on the CDT and evaluate inter-rater reliability of the CDT scored by using a specific algorithm method adapted from Sunderland et al. (1989). METHODS: We analyzed the CDT of 100 cognitively normal elderly aged 60 years or older. The CDT ("free-drawn") and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered to all participants. Six independent examiners scored the CDT of 30 participants to evaluate inter-rater reliability. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A score of 5 on the proposed algorithm ("Numbers in reverse order or concentrated"), equivalent to 5 points on the original Sunderland scale, was the most frequent (53. 5 %). The CDT specific algorithm method used had high inter-rater reliability (p< 0. 01), and mean score ranged from 5. 06 to 5. 96. The high frequency of an overall score of 5 points may suggest the need to create more nuanced evaluation criteria, which are sensitive to differences in levels of impairment in <b>visuoconstructive</b> and executive abilities during aging...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} aphasic {{patients}} {{to draw from}} memory objects with a characteristic shape has been investigated. Their capacity to reproduce the form of real objects was studied by showing them {{for a short time}} line drawings of simple objects. When the patient had analysed and recognized the figure, the model was hidden from view and the subject was asked to draw the same object from memory. This Drawing from Memory task was administered to 54 aphasics, 67 patients with right hemisphere lesions, 44 nonaphasic left brain-damaged patients and 23 normal controls. The influence of <b>visuoconstructive</b> disabilities was controlled by administering to the same patients a standard test for constructional apraxia (copying 10 geometrical figures). The severity and clinical form of the aphasia and the presence of semantic-lexical impairment at the receptive level were also examined in the aphasic patients. The following results were obtained. (1) Aphasic patients scored significantly less well than the control groups on the Drawing from Memory task and the intergroup differences became greater when the scores from the test for constructional apraxia were included by an analysis of covariance. (2) No significant correlation was detected between the severity and clinical form of the aphasia and the scores obtained on the Drawing from Memory task. (3) There was a significant correlation between impaired drawing from memory and disruption at the semantic-lexical level of language integration...|$|E
40|$|The weak central {{coherence}} hypothesis {{represents one}} of the current explanatory models in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Several experimental paradigms based on hierarchical figures have been used to test this controversial account. We addressed this hypothesis by testing central coherence in ASD (n = 19 with intellectual disability and n = 20 without intellectual disability), Williams syndrome (WS, n = 18), matched controls with intellectual disability (n = 20) and chronological age-matched controls (n = 20). We predicted that central coherence should be most impaired in ASD for the weak central coherence account to hold true. An alternative account includes dorsal stream dysfunction which dominates in WS. Central coherence was first measured by requiring subjects to perform local/global preference judgments using hierarchical figures under 6 different experimental settings (memory and perception tasks with 3 distinct geometries with and without local/global manipulations). We replicated these experiments under 4 additional conditions (memory/ perception*local/global) in which subjects reported the correct local or global configurations. Finally, we used a <b>visuoconstructive</b> task to measure local/global perceptual interference. WS participants were the most impaired in central coherence whereas ASD participants showed a pattern of coherence loss found in other studies only in four task conditions favoring local analysis but it tended to disappear when matching for intellectual disability. We conclude that abnormal central coherence does not provide a comprehensive explanation of ASD deficits and is more prominent i...|$|E
