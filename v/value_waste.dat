50|$|According to {{a report}} done by Energetics Incorporated for the DOE in November 2004 titled Technology Roadmap and several others done by the European commission, the {{majority}} of energy production from conventional and renewable resources are lost to the atmosphere due to onsite (equipment inefficiency and losses due to waste heat) and offsite (cable and transformers losses) losses, that sums to be around 66% loss in electricity <b>value.</b> <b>Waste</b> heat of different degrees {{could be found in}} final products of a certain process or as a by-product in industry such as the slag in steelmaking plants. Units or devices that could recover the waste heat and transform it into electricity are called WHRUs or heat to power units. For example, an Organic Rankine cycle unit uses an organic fluid as the working fluid. The fluid has a lower boiling point than water to allow it to boil at low temperature, to form a superheated gas that could drive the blade of a turbine and thus a generator. Thermoelectric (Seebeck, Peltier, Thomson effects) units may also be called WHRU, since they use the heat differential between two plates to produce DC Power.|$|E

Rosauer (2013) developed what {{he refers}} to as an actionable definition of organizational culture: [...] "Organizational culture is an emergence - an extremely complex incalculable state that results from the combination of a few simple ingredients.

Ingredient #1 - Employee (focus on engagement) #2 The Work (focus on eliminating waste increasing <b>value)</b> <b>waste</b> #3 The Customer (focus on likelihood of referral). The purpose of the Three Bell Curves methodology is to bring leadership, their employees, the work and the customer together for focus without distraction, leading to an improvement in culture and brand. Reliance of the research and findings of Sirota Survey Intelligence, who has been gathering employee data worldwide since 1972, the Lean Enterprise Institute, Cambridge, MA, and Fred Reichheld/Bain/Satmetrix research relating to NetPromoterScore. [...] Ravasi and Schultz (2006) wrote that organizational culture is a set of shared assumptions that guide what happens in organizations by defining appropriate behavior for various situations. It is also the pattern of such collective behaviors and assumptions that are taught to new organizational members as a way of perceiving and, even, thinking and feeling. Thus, organizational culture affects the way people and groups interact with each other, with clients, and with stakeholders. In addition, organizational culture may affect how much employees identify with an organization.|$|E

40|$|<b>Value</b> and <b>waste</b> are {{concepts}} {{that are used}} in improvement projects. In lean the concepts are fairly simple. Reduce the <b>waste</b> and the <b>value</b> has increased. However, value is both multidimensional and differs over time. If the concepts <b>value</b> and <b>waste</b> are to be used, the concepts must be clearly defined and measured. Otherwise, value can be reduced for the customer/user and the cost increased for the producer/seller. The purpose in this thesis is to investigate how <b>value</b> and <b>waste</b> are perceived by different stakeholders, how <b>value</b> and <b>waste</b> are related, and how <b>value</b> and <b>waste</b> are measured. The focus of the study is the improvement of production and services. The study does not investigate the product/service development. The conclusions are based on a number of cases and research from different fields such as resource-based view and marketing. The study use mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Measures of forecasting accuracy and their relations where explored with different statistical tools {{in order to understand the}} influence of measures and dimensions. The view of value concerning energy efficiency was examined in a statistical analysis of a survey concerning stakeholders’ view of a specific value, energy efficiency, as well as their influence on the value creation process. A multiple qualitative case study explores the relation between <b>value</b> and <b>waste</b> in different settings and the consequences of waste focus. The findings in the multiple case study are confirmed and elaborated further by an additional case study, both qualitative and quantitative, of value stream mapping. <b>Value</b> and <b>waste</b> are analysed with the use of order winners and qualifiers. Also, a model to clarify the consequences of mixing value creation and value exchange for customer/user and producer/seller have been defined and used in the analysis. Depending on the stakeholder there is a difference between whether value can be regarded as a use value, exchange value or both. Even if exchange value is related to a specific moment in time, use value is not. The view of value differs among stakeholders which increase the risk of sub-optimisation in production. <b>Value</b> and <b>waste</b> have multi-dimensional properties and there are links between the different dimensions. The relationships depend upon the situation in question. The lean seven types of waste are not independent dimensions. Also, the concept of waste as anti-value is too simplistic. In all cases studied the focus is on <b>waste,</b> not <b>value.</b> Also, it is often the symptoms of waste that are of interest in measures taken not the root causes. Reduction of waste without considering the value can create new waste. Since waste is a dependent variable, it should not be measured without considering value. Another complication is that <b>value</b> and <b>waste</b> often occurs at different points in time and in different settings. Single measures are sensitive to its environment. Several measures are more robust. Measures distort and influence the perception and thereby the decision of the studied phenomena. Also, the notion of <b>value</b> and <b>waste</b> becomes harder to define and trace as the resolution and detailing of the studied process increases.

40|$|Hoarding {{has become}} {{increasingly}} prominent in clinical practice and popular culture in recent years, giving rise to extensive research and commentary. Critical responses {{in the social sciences}} have criticised the cultural assumptions built in to the construct of ‘hoarding disorder’ and expressed fears that it may generate stigma outweighing its benefits; however, few of these studies have engaged directly with ‘hoarders’ themselves. This paper reports on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with ten individuals living in England, who received assessment and intervention for hoarding from Social Services. Their narratives drew on the cultural repertoire of values and discourses around waste and worth, the mediation of sociality and relationships through material objects, physical constraints on keeping order, and the role played by mental health. Analysing these perspectives anthropologically shows how dominant models of hoarding, such as the DSM- 5 paradigm, potentially lend themselves to reductionist understandings that efface the meaning ‘hoarding’ may have and thereby deny agency to the person labelled as ‘hoarder’. More culturally informed analysis, by contrast, affords insights into the complex landscape of <b>value,</b> <b>waste,</b> social critique, emotion, interpersonal relationships and practical difficulties that may underlie hoarding cases, and points the way to more person-centred practice and analysis...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{concern is}} caused by the problem of potato peel waste (PPW) to potato {{industries}} in Europe. An integrated, environmentally-friendly solution is yet to be found and is currently undergoing investigation. Potato peel is a zero <b>value</b> <b>waste</b> produced by potato processing plants. However, bio-ethanol produced from potato wastes has a large potential market. If Federal Government regulations are adopted in light of the Kyoto agreement, the mandatory blending of bio-ethanol with traditional gasoline in amounts up to 10 % will result in a demand for large quantities of bio-ethanol. PPW contain sufficient quantities of starch, cellulose, hemicellulose and fermentable sugars to warrant use as an ethanol feedstock. In the present study, a number of batches of PPW were hydrolyzed with various enzymes and/or acid, and fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisae var. bayanus to determine fermentability and ethanol production. Enzymatic hydrolysis with a combination of three enzymes, released 18. 5 g L- 1 reducing sugar and produced 7. 6 g L- 1 of ethanol after fermentation. The results demonstrate that PPW, a by-product of the potato industry features a high potential for ethanol production. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
