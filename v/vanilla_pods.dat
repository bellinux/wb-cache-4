The Spanish replaced this image with that of the Virgin of the Remedies. Very early on 8 September, residents and pilgrims come to the pyramid and sanctuary to sing [...] "Las mañanitas" [...] and carrying paper lamps. This is the most important religious event in the city, with events related to it on almost every block. This event brings in people from all parts of the city and from many parts of the region. One tradition associated with this is the exchange of small gifts among the strangers in the crowd. Traditional dress is usually worn only for this event. For women, this includes a black or dark blue skirt, with trim in magenta, or emerald green, a wrap belt tied on the hip, a blouse embroidered with flowers, a rebozo or neckerchief, with earrings and a cross of silver. Men wear loose pants and shirts of natural cotton cloth, huaraches, a wrap belt with one end hanging loose in front, and wool shoulder wrap decorated with geometric designs and a palm frond hat. Concurrent with the feast of the Virgin from the 1 to the 16th of September is the regional fair. The trueque, while still practiced in its original form, has also evolved into this regional fair, called the Feria de Cholula. It features local food and music, culminating on Mexico's Independence Day.|$|E

50|$|The {{vegetative}} tissue of the <b>vanilla</b> <b>pod</b> is killed {{to stop the}} vegetative growth of the pods and disrupt the cells and tissue of the fruits, which initiates enzymatic reactions responsible for the aroma. The method of killing varies, but may be accomplished by heating in hot water, freezing, or scratching, or killing by heating in an oven or exposing the beans to direct sunlight.

50|$|Vanilla extract is a {{solution}} containing the flavor compound vanillin as the primary ingredient. Pure vanilla extract is made by macerating and percolating <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> in {{a solution}} of ethanol and water. In the United States, {{in order for a}} vanilla extract to be called pure, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that the solution contains a minimum of 35% alcohol and 100g of vanilla beans per litre (13.35 ounces per gallon). Double and triple strength (up to 20-fold) vanilla extracts are available.|$|E
50|$|Vanilla {{flavoring}} in food may {{be achieved}} by adding vanilla extract or by cooking <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> in the liquid preparation. A stronger aroma may be attained if the pods are split in two, exposing more of a pod's surface area to the liquid. In this case, the pods' seeds are mixed into the preparation. Natural vanilla gives a brown or yellow color to preparations, depending on the concentration. Good-quality vanilla has a strong, aromatic flavor, but food with small amounts of low-quality vanilla or artificial vanilla-like flavorings are far more common, since true vanilla is much more expensive.|$|E

30|$|A {{previous}} study {{has shown that}} the colonizing Bacillus isolates produce β-d-glucosidase, which mediates glucovanillin hydrolysis and influences flavor formation (Chen et al. 2015). The study further indicated that the curing process would result in metabolite variation.

In this study, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and multivariate chemometric methods to characterize the metabolic changes between <b>vanilla</b> <b>pod</b> and <b>vanilla</b> bean, identifying characteristic metabolites, and interpreted these changes in order to reveal the biosynthesis pathway of vanillin.|$|R
50|$|Vanilla tahitensis is a {{polyploid}} {{species and}} {{has been shown to}} be a cross between Vanilla planifolia and Vanilla odorata. This hybridisation may have happened naturally or inadvertently in the period 1350-1500 in tropical America. It was used by the Aztecs and the flavour proved popular with the Spaniards. Hernán Cortés brought <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> to Europe where they were grown in greenhouses, and cultivation was attempted in various tropical locations. Seed from Madagascar were taken to Tahiti in 1848 by the French Admiral Ferdinand-Alphonse Hamelin, and it was this foundation stock that is now cultivated as Vanilla tahitensis in French Polynesia. In Mexico, it is pollinated by a specific species of bee, so when grown elsewhere, the flowers need to be pollinated by hand in order for the pods to develop.|$|E
5000|$|The food {{industry}} uses methyl and ethyl vanillin as less-expensive substitutes for real vanilla. Ethyl vanillin is more expensive, {{but has a}} stronger note. Cook's Illustrated ran several taste tests pitting vanilla against vanillin in baked goods and other applications, and {{to the consternation of}} the magazine editors, tasters could not differentiate the flavor of vanillin from vanilla; however, for the case of vanilla ice cream, natural vanilla won out. [...] A more recent and thorough test by the same group produced a more interesting variety of results; namely, high-quality artificial vanilla flavoring is best for cookies, while high-quality real vanilla is slightly better for cakes and significantly better for unheated or lightly heated foods. The liquid extracted from <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> was once believed to have medical properties, helping with various stomach ailments.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to popular}} belief, the Totonac people, who inhabit {{the east coast}} of Mexico in the present-day state of Veracruz, were the first to {{cultivate}} vanilla. According to Totonac mythology, the tropical orchid was born when Princess Xanat, forbidden by her father from marrying a mortal, fled to the forest with her lover. The lovers were captured and beheaded. Where their blood touched the ground, the vine of the tropical orchid grew. In the 15th century, Aztecs invading from the central highlands of Mexico conquered the Totonacs, and soon developed a taste for the <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods.</b> They named the fruit tlilxochitl, or [...] "black flower", after the matured fruit, which shrivels and turns black shortly after it is picked. Subjugated by the Aztecs, the Totonacs paid tribute by sending vanilla fruit to the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan.|$|E

50|$|Vanilla essence {{occurs in}} two forms. Real seedpod extract is an {{extremely}} complicated mixture of several hundred different compounds, including vanillin, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, furfural, hexanoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, eugenol, methyl cinnamate, and isobutyric acid. Synthetic essence consists of a solution of synthetic vanillin in ethanol. The chemical compound vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) is {{a major contributor to}} the characteristic flavor and aroma of real vanilla, but hundreds of compounds contribute to a complex flavor that vanillin can only approximate. Another minor component of vanilla extract is piperonal (heliotropin). Vanillin was first isolated from <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> by Gobley in 1858. By 1874, it had been obtained from glycosides of pine tree sap, temporarily causing a depression in the natural vanilla industry. Vanillin can be easily synthesized from various raw materials, but the majority of food-grade (>99% pure) vanillin is made from guaiacol. Lower priced milk chocolate, cream, cookies and other desserts often use artificial vanillin in place of natural vanilla.|$|E
50|$|In 1836, {{botanist}} Charles François Antoine Morren {{was drinking}} coffee on a patio in Papantla (in Veracruz, Mexico) and noticed black bees flying around the vanilla flowers {{next to his}} table. He watched their actions closely as they would land and work their way under a flap inside the flower, transferring pollen in the process. Within hours, the flowers closed and several days later, Morren noticed <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> beginning to form. Morren immediately began experimenting with hand pollination. A few years later in 1841, a simple and efficient artificial hand-pollination method was developed by a 12-year-old slave named Edmond Albius on Réunion, a method still used today. Using a beveled sliver of bamboo, an agricultural worker lifts the membrane separating the anther and the stigma, then, using the thumb, transfers the pollinia from the anther to the stigma. The flower, self-pollinated, will then produce a fruit. The vanilla flower lasts about one day, sometimes less, so growers have to inspect their plantations every day for open flowers, a labor-intensive task.|$|E

The trueque, while still practiced in its original form, has also evolved into this regional fair, called the Feria de Cholula. It features local food and music, culminating on Mexico's Independence Day.The next most important citywide event is called the Bajada de la Virgen, which also involves the Virgin of the Remedies. This time, instead of the masses climbing the pyramid to honor her, she comes down for two weeks in May or June to visit the various neighborhoods and surrounding rural communities. The tradition of bringing down the image from the pyramid began in 1825. The next occurred in 1870 and the third in 1890. Today, it is an annual event, but it is not the original image which leaves, rather it is a substitute. The reason for this is that the processions take a toll on the ancient image. The replicas of the image are considered to be [...] "sisters" [...] to the original, with the impression that it is the idea of the Virgin which is important, not the physical image. The last time the original image left the church was in 1999, due to the earthquake. It was kept at the monastery of San Gabriel until it could be returned after repairs. During the Bajada, the image is carried through the streets in some portion of the city every morning, which has been prepared with elaborate gateways of flowers, and more decorating the route. When the image comes down off the pyramid, she travels through all ten neighborhoods three times in an event called the [...] "circulares." [...] Each circulare is dedicated to a different saint, and presided over by a mayordomo. Each neighborhood sponsors one of the circulares every ten years, providing food and drink, incense and other necessities for the rite. She descends again on August 11, all the way to the town of San Luis Tehuiloyocan.|$|E

According to the m/z analysis, the <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> showed significant differences from vanilla beans. In addition, 21 precursors related to vanillin synthesis were identified, and 7 pathways of vanillin biosynthesis were constructed, including glucovanillin, glucose, cresol, capsaicin, vanillyl alcohol, tyrosine, and phenylalanine pathways. To {{the best of}} our knowledge, the glucose, cresol, capsaicin, and vanillyl alcohol pathways have not yet been reported in any vanilla curing process. However, these pathways have wide range of distribution in microbial metabolism. Therefore, microorganisms may have participated in vanillin biosynthesis during the curing of vanilla.|$|E

In this study, the metabolic changes of <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> and vanilla beans were characterized using MS-based metabolomics to elucidate the biosynthesis of vanillin. The <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> were significantly different from vanilla beans. Seven pathways of vanillin biosynthesis were constructed, namely, glucovanillin, glucose, cresol, capsaicin, vanillyl alcohol, tyrosine, and phenylalanine pathways. Investigations demonstrated that glucose, cresol, capsaicin, and vanillyl alcohol pathway were detected {{in a wide range}} of distribution in microbial metabolism. Thus, microorganisms might have participated in vanillin biosynthesis during vanilla curing. Furthermore, the ion strength of glucovanillin was stable, which indicated that glucovanillin only participated in the vanillin biosynthesis during the curing of vanilla.|$|E
40|$|Biphasic sonoelectroanalysis is {{employed}} in the detection of vanillin (4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzaldehyde). Ethyl acetoacetate is characterized as an electrochemical and sonoelectrochemical solvent and it is shown that quantitative electrochemical measurements {{can be made in}} this solvent of relatively low dielectric constant. The electrochemical oxidation of vanillin in this medium is shown to give oxidative linear sweep voltammetric signals sensitive to microadditions. In addition, the near reversible kinetics of vanillin in ethyl acetoacetate facilitate sensitive square-wave voltammetry. Electrode passivation leads to typically diminishing peak heights for the same concentration of vanillin, but by employing ultrasound between each scan, peak heights are maintained by quantitative depassivation of the electrode surface. Microadditions of 0. 05 mM vanillin to ethyl acetoacetate yield a linear calibration plot with r = 0. 9987 and a detection limit of 0. 016 mM. The determination of vanillin in natural vanilla essence is then achieved by the exploitation of biphasic sonoelectrovoltammetry in aqueous ethanolic <b>vanilla</b> <b>pod</b> extract and ethyl acetoacetate. In contrast with silent voltammetry, ultrasound facilitates emulsification and extraction of vanillin in the extract permitting an analytical square-wave voltammetric signal to be obtained. Micro-additions to two separate samples of vanilla essence facilitate quantification of vanillin in the extract. Close agreement with a blind analysis of the samples using HPLC-UV is observed with a limit of detection in the biphasic medium of 0. 020 mM. Biphasic sonoelectroanalysis removes the need for sample degradation or a separation step, which would lengthen and complicate the analytical protocol. It can therefore be concluded that biphasic sonoelectroanalysis demonstrates an attractive alternative to currently accepted techniques...|$|R
