In addition, it has already been reported that 3 -methylhistamine and phenylethylamine are competitive antagonists of histamine N-methyl-transferase (HMT), the enzyme responsible for rapid inactivation of histamine. Our results suggest the possibility that 3 - methyl-histamine and phenylethylamine as competitive antagonists of histamine N-methyl-transferase lead to potentiation of histamine induced constriction of isiolated guinea-pig trachea, probably due to the decrease of histamine methylation and consequent inactivation. In as much, 3 -methyl-histamine and phenylethylamine had no effect on the basal tone of isolated trachea smooth muscle, as well as on other mechanisms leading to increased responsiveness of guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle (acetylcholine, KCl, electro stimulation) ...|$|E

Low concentrations (10 k and 10 M) of exogenous histamine enhanced both spontaneous and antigen-induced histamine release. The enhancement of antigen-induced histamine release was inhibited by metiamide {{but not by}} mepyramine, whereas the enhancement of spontaneous hista-mine release was not significantly affected by either histamine antagonist. At higher concentrations of exogenous histamine (106 to 10 M), uptake and metabolism significantly interfered with the method.

40|$|Abstract Background Histamine is {{commonly}} acknowledged as an inflammatory mediator in peripheral tissues, leaving {{its role in}} brain immune responses scarcely studied. Therefore, {{our aim was to}} uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms elicited by this molecule and its receptors in microglia-induced inflammation by evaluating cell migration and inflammatory mediator release. Methods Firstly, we detected the expression of all known histamine receptor subtypes (H 1 R, H 2 R, H 3 R and H 4 R), using a murine microglial cell line and primary microglia cell cultures from rat cortex, by real-time PCR analysis, immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. Then, we evaluated the role of histamine in microglial cell motility by performing scratch wound assays. Results were further confirmed using murine cortex explants. Finally, interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were evaluated by ELISA measurements to determine the role of histamine on the release of these inflammatory mediators. Results After 12 h of treatment, 100 μM histamine and 10 μg/ml histamine-loaded poly (lactic- co -glycolic acid) microparticles significantly stimulated microglia motility <b>via</b> <b>H</b> 4 R activation. In addition, migration involves α 5 β 1 integrins, and p 38 and Akt signaling pathways. Migration of microglial cells was also enhanced in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/ml), used as a positive control. Importantly, histamine inhibited LPS-stimulated migration <b>via</b> <b>H</b> 4 R activation. Histamine or H 4 R agonist also inhibited LPS-induced IL- 1 β release in both N 9 microglia cell line and hippocampal organotypic slice cultures. Conclusions To our knowledge, we are the first to show a dual role of histamine in the modulation of microglial inflammatory responses. Altogether, our data suggest that histamine per se triggers microglia motility, whereas histamine impedes LPS-induced microglia migration and IL- 1 β release. This last datum assigns a new putative anti-inflammatory role for histamine, acting <b>via</b> <b>H</b> 4 R to restrain exacerbated microglial responses under inflammatory challenge, which could have strong repercussions in the treatment of CNS disorders accompanied by microglia-derived inflammation. </p...|$|E
