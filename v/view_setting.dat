25|$|On 7 November 2007, Opera Mini 4 was released. According to Johan Schön, {{technical}} lead of Opera Mini development, the entire code was rewritten. Opera Mini 4 includes {{the ability to}} view web pages similarly to a desktop based browser by introducing Overview and Zoom functions, and a landscape <b>view</b> <b>setting.</b> In Overview mode, the user can scroll a zoomed-out version of certain web pages. Using a built-in pointer, the user can zoom into {{a portion of the}} page to provide a clearer view; this is similar to the functionality of Opera's Nintendo-based web browsers. This version also includes the ability to synchronise with Opera on a personal computer.|$|E

The game mostly consists of an aerial <b>view</b> <b>setting,</b> in which {{the boy and his}} dog negotiate the terrain and fend off hostile creatures. [...] If the boy is currently selected as the player character, his dog will be controlled by the artificial intelligence, and vice versa. Both characters can find refuge in caves or a town, where they can regain their hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, either character can increase in level with improved stats such as strength and evasion. Options including changing equipment, casting alchemy spells, or checking status can be quickly performed by rotating through the game's Action Ring system. Combat takes place in real-time. Located below the players hit points is a percentage gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy, as well as how far the player can run. Swinging a weapon or running causes the gauge to fall to 0% and then quickly recharges, allowing the character to attack at full strength or to run at full sprint once it is full. The gauge may also fill up to allowing the player to use charged attacks with equipped weapons.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{answering}} queries using views {{has been studied}} extensively due to its relevance {{in a wide variety}} of data-management applications. In these applications, we often need to select a subset of views to maintain due to limited resources. In this paper, we show that traditional query containment is not a good basis for deciding whether or not a view should be selected. Instead, we should minimize the <b>view</b> <b>set</b> without losing its query-answering power. To formalize this notion, we first introduce the concept of "p-containment. " That is, a <b>view</b> <b>set</b> V is p-contained in another <b>view</b> <b>set</b> W, if W can answer all the queries that can be answered by V. We show that p-containment and the traditional query containment are not related. We then discuss how to minimize a <b>view</b> <b>set</b> while retaining its query-answering power. We develop the idea further by considering p-containment of two <b>view</b> <b>sets</b> with respect to a given set of queries, and consider their relationship in terms o [...] ...|$|R

The user can choose to have a standard view or zoomed view. When the iPhone is placed in a standard <b>view</b> <b>setting,</b> the icons are normal size and the text remains the same. With a zoomed view option, the icons on the screen and the text become slightly larger. This enables the user to have a more customized appearance and it can potentially help some users read the screen easier.|$|E
50|$|Writers of {{speculative}} {{fiction in}} the later 1800s (as at other times) varied in the approaches they took toward the nearer and farther future. Some novels took a short-term look ahead in time, from 25 years, as in Peck's The World a Department Store, to a century or more (Brooks's Earth Revisited, or Bellamy's Looking Backward). Others took a longer look ahead, of even thousands of years (as with Macnie's The Diothas).

40|$|When {{a client}} submits {{a set of}} XPath queries to a XML {{database}} on a network, the set of answer sets sent back by the database may include redundancy in two ways: some elements may appear {{in more than one}} answer set, and some elements in some answer sets may be subelements of other elements in other (or the same) answer sets. Even when a client submits a single query, the answer can be self-redundant because some elements may be subelements of other elements in that answer. Therefore, sending those answers as they are is not optimal with respect to communication costs. In this paper, we propose a method of minimizing communication costs in XPath processing over networks. Given a single or a set of queries, we compute a minimal-size <b>view</b> <b>set</b> that can answer all the original queries. The database sends this <b>view</b> <b>set</b> to the client, and the client produces answers from it. We show algorithms for computing such a minimal <b>view</b> <b>set</b> for given queries. This <b>view</b> <b>set</b> is optimal; it only includes elements that appear in some of the final answers, and each element appears only once...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnswering queries using views is {{the problem}} which {{examines}} how to derive the answers to a query when we only have the answers to a <b>set</b> of <b>views.</b> Constructing rewritings is a widely studied technique to derive those answers. In this paper we consider {{the problem of the}} existence of rewritings in the case where the answers to the views uniquely determine the answers to the query. Specifically, we say that a <b>view</b> <b>set</b> V determines a query Q if for any two databases D 1,D 2 it holds: V(D 1) =V(D 2) implies Q(D 1) =Q(D 2). We consider the case where query and views are defined by conjunctive queries and investigate the question: If a <b>view</b> <b>set</b> V determines a query Q, is there an equivalent rewriting of Q using V? We present here interesting cases where there are such rewritings in the language of conjunctive queries. Interestingly, we identify a class of conjunctive queries, CQpath, for which a <b>view</b> <b>set</b> can produce equivalent rewritings for “almost all” queries which are determined by this <b>view</b> <b>set.</b> We introduce a problem which relates determinacy to query equivalence. We show that there are cases where restricted results can carry over to broader classes of queries...|$|R

Opera Mini 4 replaced Opera Mini Advanced. Originally, Google was the default search engine on Opera Mini. On 8 January 2007, Opera Software and Yahoo! announced a partnership to make Yahoo! search the default instead. On 27 February 2008, Opera Software announced that Google would henceforth be the default search engine for Opera Mini and Opera Mobile.A version for the Android operating system was announced on 10 April 2008. Rather than port the code to Android, a wrapper was created to translate Java ME API calls to Android API calls.|$|E

Any value of α> 0.5 is not recommended since it degrades the aggregate capacity as shown in Figure 11, decreases the proportional fairness as shown in Figure 10, and consumes higher transmit power by the MBSs. Setting α= 0 as in the eICIC case would reduce both Csum and Clog drastically.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} incremental maintenance of an SQL view {{in the face of}} database updates, and show {{that it is possible to}} reduce the total time cost of view maintenance by materializing (and maintaining) additional views. We formulate the problem of determining the optimal <b>set</b> of additional <b>views</b> to materialize as an optimization problem over the space of possible <b>view</b> <b>sets</b> (which includes the empty set). The optimization problem is harder than query optimization since it has to deal with multiple <b>view</b> <b>sets,</b> updates of multiple relations, and multiple ways of maintaining each <b>view</b> <b>set</b> for each updated relation. We develop a memoing solution for the problem; the solution can be implemented using the expression DAG representation used in rule-based optimizers such as Volcano. We demonstrate that global optimization cannot, in general, be achieved by locally optimizing each materialized subview, because common subexpressions between different materialized subviews can allow no [...] ...|$|R

This largely overcomes the burden of learning new view functions and updating past view functions. We theoretically examine convergence issues {{and the influence of}} streaming views in the proposed algorithm.
