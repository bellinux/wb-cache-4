Here, we estimate measures of the migration based on existing tagging data from Icelandic, Faroese and Continental (Scotland, North Sea and Norway) waters. Saithe tagged in <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters</b> were seldom caught outside <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters</b> (, 1 % of tag returns), whereas 42 % of adult saithe tagged in Faroese waters were recaptured outside Faroese waters. Of adult saithe tagged in Norwegian waters 6. 6 % were recaptured outside Continental waters. In broad terms, there was a net migra-tion of saithe towards <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters.</b> The distance between tagging and recapture increased with increasing size and age, with saithe tagged in Norwegian waters moving the longest distances. The results demonstrate significant, but variable, migration rates of adult saithe in the Northeast Atlantic.

40|$|Five {{species of}} baleen whales are {{regularly}} encountered at their feeding grounds in <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters</b> during summer. Systematic monitoring of distribution and abundance of cetaceans in <b>Icelandic</b> and adjacent <b>waters</b> was initiated in 1987 {{as a part}} of the North Atlantic Sightings Surveys (NASS). In this thesis, the objecive is to summarize the results of these surveys in relation to changes in the marine environment and the feeding ecology of four baleen whale species. The results presented here demonstrate an important role played by baleen whales in the marine ecosystem around Iceland. <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters</b> represent summer feeding grounds for these migratory species, which are believed to fast or feed at much lower rates during winter. Deposition of energy reserves during the feeding season differed among reproductive classes and was highest in pregnant females in both fin and minke whales. Two independent methods to estimate daily feeding rates of fin whales gave similar results. The annual food consumption by the 12 species of cetaceans regularly occurring in <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters</b> was estimated at around 6 million tons with around two thirds attributable to fin and minke whales. Satellite tracking experiments gave first indications of migration route and winter destinations of North Atlantic minke whales and suggested a later departure from the feeding grounds in autumn than generally assumed. A a two stage modelling approach indicates that per-capita prey abundance affects body condition of fin whales which in turn affects fecundity. These results are consistent with a density dependent response in pregnancy rate. Pronounced oceanographic changes in <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters</b> since the mid- 1990 s, appear to have caused a northward shift in the distribution of several fish species, a decrease in krill abundance and a collapse in the sand eel population off southern and western Iceland. Concurrently, appreciable changes have occurred in distribution and abundance of several cetacean species. These include a pronounced decrease in the abundance of minke whales in the Icelandic shelf area since 2001, increase in fin whale abundance in the Irminger Sea and large increase in humpback whale abundance in recent decades. Some of these changes appear to be related to the observed oceanographic and biological changes, while others are harder to explain. The decrease in minke whale abundance in the Icelandic continental shelf area after 2001 seems to be related to the decrease in the abundance of important prey species, sand eel and capelin. Apparently, minke whales have responded to these environmental changes by 1) a shift in distribution away from <b>Icelandic</b> coastal <b>waters</b> and 2) a change in diet of the animals remaining in <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters</b> from sand eel, euphausiids and capelin, to herring and gadoids. Concurrently with increasing sea temperature in the deep waters of the Irminger Sea, the distribution of fin whales expanded into this area, possibly due to an increase in the fin whale’s dominant prey species, euphausiids. In recent decades, humpback whale abundance has increased dramatically in <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters.</b> It is hard to relate this increase to any particular biological changes in the marine environment. An apparent northward shift in distribution of blue whales may be related to the decrease in euphausiid abundance in the waters south and southwest of Iceland. The research presented in this thesis indicates that effects of warming on cetacean distribution and abundance are already evident in <b>Icelandic</b> and adjacent <b>waters.</b> The NASS series has revealed appreciable changes in distribution of several cetacean species and studies into feeding ecology and energetics provide possible explanations for these changes. Potential benefits of global warming to subarctic and/or migratory species through increased size of suitable habitat might be offset by increased competition from the south. Continued monitoring of the distribution and abundance of cetaceans as well as further studies into their feeding ecology are essential for better understanding of the recent and ongoing changes documented here...|$|R

40|$|Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters,</b> in the Davis Strait, {{and east}} and {{southeast}} of Greenland is a transboundary stock which inhabits both the Greenlandic and the Icelandic Fishing Zones.

In the present paper, an optimization scheme for this transboundary cod stock is suggested, including a standard bioeconomic model of the fisheries and simple game theory. Simulations indicate that if the resource is considered to be an entirely migratory resource, both the total catch volume and the net present value (NPV) of the resource rent are maximized when all landings of the stock are made from the Icelandic zone.

40|$|Fishing {{mortality}} affects {{demographic characteristics}} of a population, and is a major determinant in loss of spawners from a ®sh stock; directly in¯uencing stock productivity and recruitment variability. We investigated the effects of ®shing on {{the composition of the}} spawning stock of cod (Gadus morhua) in <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters</b> by partitioning relative ®shing mortality and spawning stock biomass (SSB) into ®ner spatial components than those used previously. Geographic regions of reproductive importance were identi®ed around the country, in contrast to traditional paradigms of cod stock structure in <b>Icelandic</b> <b>waters.</b> SSB and relative ®shing mortality were unevenly distributed in waters around Iceland, where gill nets selectively removed larger spawners from inshore waters of the main spawning grounds, whose demographic characteristics were more conducive to progeny survival. Changes in stock structure and demographic characteristics caused by changes in spatially explicit exploitation patterns can signi®cantly affect stock productivity through differential loss of reproductive potential. Our approach of partitioning SSB into ®ner spatial units than those used previously, enabled a more detailed analysis of the distribution of spawners and exploitation of the Icelandic cod stock, and will enable the development of spatially disaggregated models of total egg production, that in turn may assist in differentiating the inherent variability within stock±recruitment relationships...|$|R
