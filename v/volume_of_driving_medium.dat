40|$|Industrial {{vehicles}} with undercarriage with elastomeric tracks are frequently used in agriculture and forestry, which {{is connected with}} moving on deformable ground. A friction method of transmitting the drive between a drive pulley and a track, which is often applied, is sensitive to adverse ambient conditions, whereas {{the influence of the}} ground on friction feedback conditions {{in the area of the}} ground working on the drive system is significant. Deformable ground may be a source of contamination, which considerably reduces a friction coefficient on wrap of a drive pulley. The article includes the analysis of deformable ground influence on the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> moment transmitted between a drive pulley and elastomeric track. It has been demonstrated that the influence of deformable ground, as a result of additional pressures working on wrap of a drive pulley may, in some circumstances, considerably increase the moment transmitted by means of friction feedback of a drive pulley with elastomeric track. Increase <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> moment may be higher than 50 %. The analysis includes limited applicability of Euler and Entelwein’s law in the description of transmitting the moment between a drive pulley with elastomeric lining and elastomeric track...|$|R

50|$|The {{transportation}} {{system in the}} United States is complex and extensive. Traffic <b>volumes,</b> types <b>of</b> vehicles, <b>driving</b> styles, population density, speed limits, and many other factors vary dramatically from one region to the next. As a result, highway traffic control measures (including type of equipment and implementation), are not strictly consistent. Federal Guidelines do not address certification methods for traffic controllers, flaggers, or other personnel responsible for traffic control. This responsibility is managed on a state or local agency level, and therefore certification requirements are not consistent and are administered locally. Safety standards (irrespective of traffic control) are mandated by OSHA as well as state-level occupational safety departments.|$|R

40|$|This paper details {{an initial}} {{exploration}} into {{the development of}} a breathing building skin. This research proposes a system of diaphragms {{as an alternative to the}} use of fans for distributing <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> air. The <b>driving</b> concepts for this project are the three types of evolutionary adaptation: flexibility, acclimation, and learning. Of particular interest is how these biological concepts relate to architectural design. Parametric modelling was used throughout the project to study a family of folding geometry. This allowed for the iterative development of a complex part that is capable of being manufactured from a single sheet of material. Preliminary calculations point to this system being several times more energy efficient than a fan at moving a given <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> air per Watt of electricity. This research is significant as it puts forth a potentially energy efficient and highly integrated alternative to fans, while also illustrating a way of relating biological concepts of adaptation to architectural design. ...|$|R

40|$|Plug-in Electric Vehicles (EV) offer a {{clean and}} cost {{effective}} means {{in the long run}} <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> short to <b>medium</b> distances within the city, even with the current high purchase cost. In Australia EV may be attractive as a second car in the multicar household. The acceptance of EV requires a change in behaviour – instead of re-fuelling, this vehicle requires battery charging each 140 - 160 km, either at home or at specialised charging stations. A limited number of EVs are being driven in Perth as part of the Western Australia Electric Vehicle trial (WA EV trial). The trial monitors the performance, benefits, infrastructure and practical implications of EV fleet. This paper explores the opinions and experiences of 43 of the participants. Factor analysis and multiple regression are applied to identify the main motivators and barriers in purchasing and using an EV. Ninety per cent of respondents are confident about driving the EV; more than 45 % take trips of more than 30 km. While zero tailpipe emissions is the most desirable feature of EV, followed closely by home charging, the limited range of the vehicle is regarded as the most serious barrier to EV uptake. The overall satisfaction with the EV performance is high (an average score of 3. 96 out of 5), although 13 participants experienced at least one technical difficulty, when driving the EVs in the trial. Two latent constructs reflecting environmental concerns, and technology learning, along with EV benefits and technical difficulties experienced while driving an EV explain 59. 2 % of the variability of the willingness to purchase an EV as the next vehicle...|$|R

40|$|With {{water as}} <b>driving</b> <b>medium</b> and {{delivered}} medium in a device {{similar to a}} simple jet apparatus, the pressure and velocity fields of the mixing zone were explored with a pitot bar; the ratio <b>of</b> delivered to <b>driving</b> <b>volume</b> ranged between the values 0, 1, 2, and 4. An attempt was also made to analyze the mixing flow mathematically by integration of the equation of motion, {{with the aid of}} conventional formulas for the turbulent shearing stress, but this succeeded only approximately for the very simplified case that a driving jet is introduced in an unlimited parallel flow, while the pressure over the whole mixing field is assumed to be constant. In spite of these dissimilar assumptions for the theory and the experiment, the form of the measured and the computed velocity profiles indicates a very high degree of approximation. The pressure rise, which was approximated by Flugel's formulas, disclosed good agreement with the measured values...|$|R
50|$|Forres is {{situated}} on the A96 trunk route connecting the cities of Aberdeen and Inverness. The River Findhorn was originally crossed by fording near Waterford Farm. A suspension bridge was opened in 1831 to cross the river at {{the west end of}} the town. This bridge was replaced by the current bridge in 1938. Due to high <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> traffic passing through the town centre, a bypass was built in the late 1980s to reduce congestion in the town centre. The A940 connects Forres with Grantown-on-Spey, Aviemore and the south directly without the requirement <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> via Inverness.

40|$|Due to high {{efficiency}} in helping breaking rocks, positive displacement motor has a widespread application {{in the field}} of oil and gas drilling engineering. However, service life of positive displacement motor becomes shorter resulting from failure <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> shaft thread. The three-dimensional simulation model <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft’s connecting thread has been developed based on the principle of virtual work, Von Mises yield criterion, and contact nonlinear theory. This article has put forward the plan to optimize structure <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft with straight thread based on the design principle of double-shouldered thread; besides, fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft with straight thread before and after optimization has been assessed by resorting to the multiaxial fatigue principle and Brown–Miller critical plane rule. In line with research results, mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft with straight thread are superior to those <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft with taper thread. Under the load of axial drill pressure with fluctuation and alternating torque, fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft with straight thread after optimization is greatly improved.

40|$|Gear {{rattle of}} {{multi-step}} helical gear system is treated. Mesh stiffness variations and higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque are {{considered in the}} system. The effects of higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque are studied by numerical analysis. As a result, the followings were made clear. (1) In the resonance region of lower mode, when the frequency <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque is nearly equal to the one which is the natural frequency of higher mode divided by some integer, the response contains the higher mode and its amplitude of acceleration becomes large. However this phenomenon is not so affected by the higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque. (2) First harmonic <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque generates higher harmonic resonance and higher harmonic <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque generates the main resonance, hence the interaction of these two resonances makes the amplitude of the resonance large. (3) Because of interaction of higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque and mesh stiffness variation, resonances like gear noise occur with many side-bands in low frequency region, and {{the region of the}} rattles becomes wide. (4) Gear rattles in the case of small constant torque are almost chaos, and chaos by intermittency is recognized...|$|R
