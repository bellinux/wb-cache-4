5|$|Acting on James Bevel's {{call for}} a march from Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial {{collaboration}} with SNCC, attempted to organize the march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> demonstrators. This day {{has become known as}} Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the Civil Rights Movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} {{the views of the}} Mubalig of <b>the</b> phenomenon of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women in <b>the</b> household (KDRT). <b>Violence</b> <b>against</b> women in <b>the</b> household is often justified because society is understood as being legitimized in the understanding of religion as they learn from the preachers. Bias in understanding, interpreting, and conveying religious teachings to the people—especially with regards to <b>the</b> issue of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women in <b>the</b> household—causes <b>the</b> growing injustices <b>against</b> women. Conversely, if there is no bias in understanding, interpreting, and conveying religious teachings by preachers, {{it will be possible to}} minimize <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women in <b>the</b> household. Key words: <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women, Mubalig, biased religious teaching...|$|R

5|$|For {{the next}} year, the RPF waged a classic {{hit-and-run}} style guerrilla war, capturing some border areas but not making significant {{gains in the}} war against the Rwandan army. Following the June 1992 formation of a multi-party coalition government in Kigali, Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country.|$|E

5|$|Inclined {{to form an}} {{alliance}} with the Habsburgs (and even give up the Polish crown to pursue his ambitions in Sweden), Sigismund conducted secret negotiations with them and married Archduchess Anna. Accused by Zamoyski of breaking his covenants, Sigismund III was humiliated during the sejm of 1592, which deepened his resentment of szlachta. Sigismund was bent on strengthening {{the power of the}} monarchy and Counter-Reformational promotion of the Catholic Church (Piotr Skarga was among his supporters). Indifferent to the increasingly common breaches of the Warsaw Confederation religious protections and instances of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Protestants, the King was opposed by religious minorities.|$|E

5|$|In 2005 {{the average}} price of a {{detached}} house in Christchurch was £323,416. On average property in Christchurch is 24% more expensive than anywhere else in England and Wales. Nearly 80% of residences are owner occupied, 3% are vacant and a further 3% are second homes. The borough has around 25,000 cars: an average of 1.21 per household. Christchurch, in common with the rest of Dorset, has lower crime rates than average for the UK. Reported crime rates per 1,000 of the population in 2006 (with figures for 2001 in brackets) are as follows: <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> person 10.4 (4.8), sexual offences 0.7 (0.3), robbery 0.2 (0.3), burglary 2.2 (4.0), theft of vehicles 0.9 (2.5), theft from vehicles 3.6 (7.2).|$|E

5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bees.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{the leader}} of the North Carolina branch of the CPUSA, Junius Scales, became the final CPUSA member convicted under the Smith Act, and the only one convicted after the Yates decision. Prosecutors pursued Scales' case because he {{specifically}} advocated violent political action and gave demonstrations of martial arts skills. Scales was accused of violating the membership clause of the Smith Act, not the clause prohibiting advocacy of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> government. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Scales contended that the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act rendered the Smith Act's membership clause ineffective, because the McCarran Act explicitly stated that membership in a communist party does not constitute a per se violation of any criminal statute. In 1961, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, upheld Scales' conviction, finding that the Smith Act membership clause was not obviated by the McCarran Act, because the Smith Act required prosecutors to prove first, that there was direct advocacy of violence; and second, that the defendant's membership was substantial and active, not merely passive or technical. Two Justices of the Supreme Court who had supported the Yates decision in 1957, Harlan and Frankfurter, voted to uphold Scales' conviction.|$|E
5|$|The Jain {{concept of}} Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It {{does not make}} any {{exception}} for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed {{for the sake of}} food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains {{go out of their way}} so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} traces {{through history}} {{the manner in}} which women around the globe have been forced into subordination to man. In this context, it looks at the role played by the patriarchal system in women's subjugation and <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women. It identifies the different faces of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women around <b>the</b> world and focuses on the various forms of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women. <b>The</b> dissertation then presents a global review of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women in detention and analyses the abusive use of this power by agencies of the state. To reflect how this power, lacking in accountability and deterrent force, can result in a mockery of the whole concept of justice, <b>the</b> dissertation reviews <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women who are directly under the control of police [...] the primary law enforcement agency of the state. The dissertation uses examples the Indian sub-continent to show how the attitude of police in developing countries has, instead of controlling <b>the</b> <b>violence,</b> promoted <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women and <b>the</b> impact of this attitude on the society. The dissertation analyses the general attitude of police towards <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women; <b>the</b> victims' perception of the police, and the police perception of abused women on the issues of family violence. It observes that elimination of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women cannot be achieved through law reform alone. Proper enforcement of such reformative measures, accountability of the enforcers and condemnation of enforcers when they fail to do what is expected of them are equally important to eliminate <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women. <b>The</b> dissertation concludes with the argument that under the present structure of society <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women cannot be eliminated until the attitude of women towards their own selves is changed {{as well as that of}} men in general and police in particular, which directly affects the attitude of men towards women...|$|R
