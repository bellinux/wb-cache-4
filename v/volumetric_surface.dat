40|$|Quantifying and {{visualizing}} {{the shape}} of developing biological tissues provide information about the morphogenetic pro-cesses in multicellular organisms. The {{size and shape of}} biological tissues depend on the number, size, shape, and arrange-ment of the constituting cells. To better understand the mechanisms that guide tissues into their final shape, it is important to investigate the cellular arrangement within tissues. Here we present a data processing pipeline to generate 3 D <b>volumetric</b> <b>surface</b> models of epithelial tissues, as well as geometric descriptions of the tissues ’ apical cell cross-sections. The data processing pipeline includes image acquisition, editing, processing and analysis, 2 D cell mesh generation, 3 D contour-based surface reconstruction, cell mesh projection, followed by geometric calculations and color-based visualization of morphological parameters. In their first utilization we have applied these procedures to construct a 3 D <b>volumetric</b> <b>surface</b> model at cellular resolution of the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila melanogaster. The ultimate goal of the reported effort is to produce tools for the creation of detailed 3 D geometric models of the individual cells in epithelial tissues. To date, 3 D <b>volumetric</b> <b>surface</b> models of the whole wing imaginal disc have been created, and the apicolateral cell boundaries have been identified, allowing for the calculation and visualization of cell parameters, e. g. apical cross-sectional area of cells. The calculation and visualization of morphological parameters show position-dependent patterns of cell shape in the wing imaginal disc.

40|$|In {{computer}} graphics, {{two types}} of geometric representations are widely used: surfaces and volumes. Surfaces are infinitely thin skins defining the boundary of an object, and {{have been successful in}} modeling realistic appearances. However, their lack of information about the solid nature of objects make them inadequate for many applica-tions. Volumes represent the entire solid geometry of an object in a three-dimensional grid. Volumes, however, are inefficient and cannot achieve high resolutions since they must maintain information about internal geometry that is not pertinent to rendering realistic appearances. We have created a new, hybrid data structure, the <b>volumetric</b> <b>surface,</b> which com-bines the benefits of surfaces and volumes. A <b>volumetric</b> <b>surface</b> represents solid ma-terials in a thin region near the surface of an object in an efficient, multi-resolution data structure.

40|$|Glassy carbon {{plates were}} thermochemically gas phase {{oxidized}} to obtain monolithic sandwichlike electrode assemblies with high surface area porous films for {{electrochemical energy storage}} applications. Film thicknesses were varied by variation of oxidation parameters time, temperature, and oxygen concentration and measured with electron microscopy. The mass density of the porous carbon film material was estimated by fitting a geometrical model to experimental gravimetric data. Optical Raman spectroscopy line scans suggest that the porosity has a gradient between the surface and the film/bulk interface, which is supported by pore-size distribution data obtained from small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) on slightly oxidized and fully oxidized samples. Detailed inspection of the power law behavior of SAXS data suggests that the internal surface area of well-oxidized glassy carbon (GC) is compact and extends over the entire probed volume and thus has optimal pore connectivity. This effect goes along with pore enlargement and a relative decrease of internal surface area per volume. Slightly oxidized carbon has no pore space with a compact, high connectivity internal surface area.

A {{number of new}} space-borne remote sensing systems, operating at microwave frequencies, have been developed that provide a more direct retrieval of surface soil moisture. These systems are attractive since they provide global data coverage and the horizontal resolution is similar to weather forecasting models.
