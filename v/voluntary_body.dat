5|$|The Cullompton Company of Volunteers (a <b>voluntary</b> <b>body</b> of soldiers) {{was first}} raised in 1794 and {{continued}} until 1810. The volunteer companies were formed following Britain's {{entry into the}} French Revolutionary Wars and continued to exist during the Napoleonic Wars. Cullompton was the first inland town to offer to raise a volunteer company (on 16 May 1794) and on 24 June the volunteers were accepted. The first commander, Captain Jarmin, was a former Marine officer. The company was formed into a battalion with 11 other volunteer companies called the Hayridge (later Highbridge) regiment. It had 1,200 men and three companies were based in Cullompton with a barracks in New Cut. Jarmin died in 1794 and was succeeded by Henry Skinner Esq. In 1801 the company became a cavalry troop and was then disbanded only to be reformed in 1805 when hostilities with France resumed. Many Cullompton men fought in the Peninsular War and at the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{began to}} re-arm and recruit after August 1969. In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA. Both were {{supported}} {{by the people of}} the Free Derry area. Meanwhile, relations between the British Army and the nationalist community, which were initially good, deteriorated. In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops. The government introduced internment on 9 August 1971, and in response, barricades went up once more in the Bogside and Creggan. This time, Free Derry was a no-go area, defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA. From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army, and the Provisionals began a bombing campaign in the city centre. As before, unarmed 'auxiliaries' manned the barricades, and crime was dealt with by a <b>voluntary</b> <b>body</b> known as the Free Derry Police.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} unemployment among married women {{within the context}} of evolving government policy rather than from a gender or feminist perspective. It establishes how, during the inter-war years, government policy towards women's unemployment developed in line with the ideas of female-dominated <b>voluntary</b> <b>bodies</b> and was only of fringe interest to the state. In particular, it stresses that a small number of middle-class women shaped official attitudes towards unemployed women through their activities in <b>voluntary</b> <b>bodies,</b> particularly the Central Committee on Women's Training and Employment, as well as their own rise in public service. This group operated within an environment that accepted women to be dispensable as a source of labour and where many female activists felt that women on unemployment benefit should train to be domestic servants, despite {{the fact that many of}} those women did not normally want domestic work because it was badly paid, of low status and uninsured. During the inter-war years governments relied heavily upon <b>voluntary</b> <b>bodies</b> to 'fill the gaps' in state welfare provision in their fringe areas of interest such as women's unemployment. In this instance, however, the <b>voluntary</b> <b>bodies</b> failed to assess or tackle the problem effectively...|$|R

25|$|In 1967, local {{authorities}} were empowered to provide family planning advice to any who requested {{it and to}} provide supplies free of charge. In addition, medical training was expanded following the Todd Report on medical education in 1968. In addition, National Health expenditure rose from 4.2% of GNP in 1964 to 5% in 1969 and spending on hospital construction doubled. The Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 empowered {{local authorities}} to maintain workshops for the elderly either directly or via the agency of a <b>voluntary</b> <b>body.</b> A Health Advisory Service was later established to investigate and confront the problems of long-term psychiatric and mentally subnormal hospitals in the wave of numerous scandals. The Family Planning Act 1967 empowered local authorities {{to set up a}} family planning service with free advice and means-tested provision of contraceptive devices while the Clean Air Act 1968 extended powers to combat air pollution. More money was also allocated to hospitals treating the mentally ill. In addition, a Sports Council was set up to improve facilities. Direct government expenditure on sports more than doubled from £0.9 million in 1964/65 to £2 million in 1967/68, while 11 regional Sports Councils had been set up by 1968. In Wales, five new health centres had been opened by 1968, whereas none had been opened from 1951 to 1964, while spending on health and welfare services in the region went up from £55.8 million in 1963/64 to £83.9 million in 1967/68.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{a period}} of {{enormous}} change and flux in the English education service. It notes {{that a number of}} the supports and sources of advice traditionally available to parents ofyoung people with special educational needs and to the young people themselves are now reduced, are being changed or {{are in the process of}} being removed. It proposes a new emphasis for service professionals, administrators and the <b>voluntary</b> <b>bodies</b> working in the area of special educational needs. The central premise is that the work and role of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>bodies,</b> in supporting young people with special needs and their parents, should be welcomed and confirmed as a vital element within the educational process. A range of practical service strategies is proposed which is intended to sustain a user friendly educational service during a time of massive change. A model for confirming the potentially significant role of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>bodies</b> in this important area of educational need is offered...|$|R
