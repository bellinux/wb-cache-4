40|$|Understanding the {{influence}} of environmental variability on population dynamics is a fundamental goal of ecology. Theory suggests that, for populations in variable environments, temporal correlations between demographic vital rates (e. g., growth, survival, reproduction) can increase (if positive) or decrease (if negative) the variability of year-to-year population growth. Because this variability generally decreases long-term population viability, <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> correlations may importantly affect population dynamics in stochastic environments. Despite long-standing theoretical interest, {{it is unclear whether}} <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> correlations are common in nature, whether their directions are predominantly negative or positive, and whether they are of sufficient magnitude to warrant broad consideration in studies of stochastic population dynamics. We used long-term demographic data for three perennial plant species, hierarchical Bayesian parameterization of population projection models, and stochastic simulations to address the following questions: (1) What are the sign, magnitude, and uncertainty of temporal correlations between vital rates? (2) How do specific pairwise correlations affect the year-to-year variability of population growth? (3) Does the net effect of all <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> correlations increase or decrease year-to-year variability? (4) What is the net effect of <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> correlations on the long-term stochastic population growth rate (λs) ? We found only four moderate to strong correlations, both positive and negative in sign, across all species and <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> pairs; otherwise, correlations were generally weak in magnitude and variable in sign. The net effect of <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> correlations ranged from a slight decrease to an increase in the year-to-year variability of population growth, with average changes in variance ranging from − 1 % to + 22 %. However, <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> correlations caused virtually no change in the estimates of λs (mean effects ranging from − 0. 01 % to + 0. 17 %). Therefore, the proportional changes in the variance of population growth caused by demographic correlations were too small on an absolute scale to importantly affect population growth and viability. We conclude that, in our three focal populations and perhaps more generally, <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> correlations have little effect on stochastic population dynamics. This may be good news for population ecologists, because estimating <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> correlations and incorporating them into population models can be data intensive and technically challenging...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{temporal}} {{variance in}} life‐history traits is generally predicted to decrease individual fitness and population growth. We {{show that a}} widely used result of stochastic sensitivity analysis that bolsters this generality is flawed because it ignores the effects of correlations between vital rates. Considering {{the effects of these}} correlations (although ignoring autocorrelations), we show that the apparently simple relationship between <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> variance and fitness can be considerably more complex than previously thought. In particular, the previously estimated negative sensitivities of fitness or population growth to variance in a <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> can be either enhanced by positive correlations between rates or reversed by negative correlations, even to the point that variability in a rate can increase fitness or population growth. We apply this new sensitivity calculation to data from the desert tortoise and discuss its interpretation in light of the factors generating <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> correlations...|$|E
40|$|Selection {{is assumed}} to {{eliminate}} life-histories showing high variability in <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> that have the greatest influence on population performance. Therefore, an inverse variability-importance relationship of <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> {{is believed to be}} a universal pattern for diverse life-histories. We tested for such a relationship using multi-year demographic data on a large number of populations of two perennial plant species. Applying different approaches, we first examined the overall variability-importance relationship for the average main <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> (survival, growth, retrogression, fecundity) per species, and then separately for each population. We found an overall inverse relationship between temporal variation and importance of the average main <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> for both study species, but these negative species-level correlations were mainly caused by different scales of the examined <b>vital</b> <b>rates.</b> When variability-importance relationships were examined across individual demographic transitions within populations, the abundance of positive and negative correlations depended largely on the method used, and positive correlations were more common after correcting <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> for sampling variation than when using uncorrected <b>vital</b> <b>rates.</b> Our results cast doubt on the generality of the demographic buffering hypothesis, suggesting that the inverse variability-importance relationship may not be a universal pattern when <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> are examined for multiple populations of the same plant species...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{selection}} may favor {{two very}} different types of social behaviors that have costs in <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> (fecundity and/or survival) to the actor: helping behaviors, which increase the <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> of recipients, and harming behaviors, which reduce the <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> of recipients. Although social evolutionary theory has mainly dealt with helping behaviors, competition for limited resources creates ecological conditions in which an actor may benefit from expressing behaviors that reduce the <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> of neighbors. This may occur if the reduction in <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> decreases the intensity of competition experienced by the actor or that experienced by its offspring. Here, we explore the joint evolution of neutral recognition markers and marker-based costly conditional harming whereby actors express harming, conditional on actor and recipient bearing different conspicuous markers.

We find that marker-based conditional harming can evolve under a large range of recombination rates and group sizes under both finite panmictic and infinite structured populations.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{pressures}} {{have caused}} changes {{in both the}} mean and variance of environmental conditions, with associated effects on the demography of natural populations. The demographic effects of environmental change can manifest through direct (i. e., physiological) or indirect pathways (i. e., through shifts in species interactions). For many populations, environmental change will affect multiple life cycle stages simultaneously, thereby altering <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> correlation structures with potentially important impacts on evolutionary fitness. The effects of environmental change will also often be habitat-specific, particularly when species interactions modify demographic sensitivity to climate. As a result, the {{effects of climate change}} are likely to vary across a species range, with important implications for range expansion and population viability. In chapter 2, I examine the effects of joint <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> responses to environmental drivers on the evolution of life histories in variable environments. I show that <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> covariation, generated when multiple vital rates respond to a shared environmental driver, can fundamentally alter evolutionary selection pressures. Negative <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> covariation promotes the evolution of demographic lability (stronger demographic responsiveness), while positive covariation promotes buffering (weaker demographic responsiveness), altering the range of life histories over which the evolution of buffered and labile vital rates are a predicted evolutionary outcome. By identifying the life histories for which selection pressures are most sensitive to environmentally-driven <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> covariation, this study provides a richer understanding of both life history evolution and the capacity of species to cope with ongoing changes to contemporary environments. In chapter 3, I use a long-term study of lesser snow geese to test the hypothesis that demographic and developmental responses to climate will be weakest in habitats where resource diversity is greatest. I find support for this hypothesis, and my results indicate that gosling demography is much more responsive to climate in recently colonized, freshwater habitats where landscape diversity and gosling diet diversity is low. These results underscore the potential importance of accounting for biotic interactions when predicting spatio-temporal responses to climate. In chapter 4, I quantify the consequences of observed climate change for lesser snow goose population dynamics across habitats. I find that climate change increases population growth in all habitats, but that such increases are disproportionately large in novel inland freshwater habitats. These results suggest that in a warmer and more variable climate, the breeding range and population growth of lesser snow geese is likely to increase, counteracting current management efforts to reduce overabundant populations...|$|E

40|$|In a {{stochastic}} environment, long-term fitness can {{be influenced}} by variation, covariation, and serial correlation in vital rates (survival and fertility).

Overall, the estimated levels of <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> variation had only minor effects on long-term fitness, and the effects of <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> covariation and serial correlation were even weaker.

Finally, we tested the prediction that adult survival, because it more strongly influences fitness in a constant environment, will be less variable than newborn survival, and we found only mixed support for the prediction.

40|$|Studying the {{demography}} of {{wild animals}} remains challenging as {{several of the}} critical parts of their life history {{may be difficult to}} observe in the field. In particular, determining with certainty when an individual breeds for the first time is not always obvious. This can be problematic because uncertainty about the transition from a prebreeder to a breeder state - recruitment - leads to uncertainty in <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> estimates and in turn in population projection models. To avoid this issue, the common practice is to discard imperfect data from the analyses. However, this practice can generate a bias in <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> estimates if uncertainty is related to a specific component of the population and reduces the sample size of the dataset and consequently the statistical power to detect effects of biological interest. Here, we compared the demographic parameters assessed from a standard multistate capture-recapture approach to the estimates obtained from the newly developed multi-event framework that specifically accounts for uncertainty in state assessment. Using a comprehensive longitudinal dataset on southern elephant seals, we demonstrated that the multi-event model enabled us to use all the data collected (6639 capture-recapture histories vs. 4179 with the multistate model) by accounting for uncertainty in breeding states, thereby increasing the precision and accuracy of the demographic parameter estimates. The multi-event model allowed us to incorporate imperfect data into demographic analyses. The gain in precision obtained has important implications in the conservation and management of species because limiting uncertainty around vital rates will permit predicting population viability with greater accuracy. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Elasticities of matrix {{elements}} from population projection matrices {{are commonly used}} to analyze the relative contributions of different life history transitions (birth, survival, growth) to the finite rate of increase (lambda). Hitherto, comparative demography based on matrix models has relied upon decomposing elasticity matrices into blocks, each containing matrix elements deemed to represent recruitment, stasis, or progression to larger size classes. Elasticities across an entire matrix always sum to unity, and different populations and species can be compared {{on the basis of the}} relative proportions of these three variables. This method has been widely used, but it contains a weakness in that the value of matrix elements is a function of more than one <b>vital</b> <b>rate.</b> For example, transitions representing progression to larger size classes involve a survival rate as well as a growth rate. Ideally, then, demographic comparisons between populations should be made using elasticities of vital rates themselves, rather than elasticities of matrix elements that are compounds of those rates. Here, we employ the complete set of general equations for the elasticity of vital rates in an entirely new analysis of matrices for 102 species of perennial plants. The results show a surprising similarity to an earlier analysis based upon matrix element elasticity and provide important confirmation of general patterns of correlation between plant life history and demography. In addition, we show that individual <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> elasticities cannot, on their own, predict variation in life history.

We used population viability analysis to evaluate effects {{of past and}} proposed habitat loss on the White-breasted Thrasher (Ramphocinclus brachyurus), a cooperatively breeding songbird with a global population size of < 2000 individuals. We used an individual-based approach to build the first demographic population projection model for this endangered species, parameterizing the model with data from eight years of field study before and after habitat loss within the stronghold of the species' distribution. The recent habitat loss resulted in an approximately 18 % predicted decline in population size; this estimate was mirrored by a separate assessment using occupancy data. When mortality rates remained close to the pre-habitat loss estimate, quasi-extinction probability was low under extant habitat area, but increased with habitat loss expected after current plans for resort construction are completed. Post-habitat loss mortality rate estimates were too high for projected populations to persist. <b>Vital</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity analyses indicated that population growth rate and population persistence were most sensitive to juvenile mortality. However, observed values for adult mortality were closest to the threshold value above which populations would crash. Adult mortality, already relatively low, may have the least capacity to change compared to other vital rates, whereas juvenile mortality may have the most capacity for improvement. Results suggest that improving mortality estimates and determining the cause(s) of juvenile mortality should be research priorities.

A population decline could be expected with only a 6 % decrease in adult survival, whereas a 32 % decrease in fecundity would be necessary to bring about a population decline.

However, rmax can be a difficult parameter to estimate, particularly for long- lived species, for which appropriate life table data or abundance time series are typically not obtainable. We describe a method for improving estimates of r max for long- lived species by integrating life- history theory (allometric models) and population- specific demographic data (life table models). Broad allometric relationships, such as those between life history traits and body size, have long been recognized by ecologists. These relationships are useful for deriving theoretical expectations for rmax, but rmax for real populations may vary from simple allometric estimators for “archetypical” species of a given taxa or body mass. Meanwhile, life table approaches can provide population- specific estimates of rmax from empirical data, but these may have poor precision from imprecise and missing <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> parameter estimates. Our method borrows strength from both approaches to provide estimates {{that are consistent with}} both life- history theory and population- specific empirical data, and {{are likely to be more}} robust than estimates provided by either method alone. Our method uses an allometric constant: the product of rmax and the associated generation time for a stable- age population growing at this rate. We conducted a meta- analysis to estimate the mean and variance of this allometric constant across well- studied populations from three vertebrate taxa (birds, mammals, and elasmobranchs) and found that the mean was approximately 1. 0 for each taxon.

We parameratized our model with data from a 6 -year study on black bears in Aspen, Colorado and datasynthesized from other research studies. Using computer simulation, we investigated the effect that dif-ferent levels of conflict-bear removal can have on a bear population by comparing a “reference” scenariowhere bears did not benefit from human food sources or experience conflict-bear removals with twourban scenarios where bears had varying access to human foods, but conflict bears were removed. Weused perturbation analyses to evaluate consequences for changing population vital rates and to estimatethe impact each <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> change had on population growth.

In the high-elevation population, ? was significantly lower than unity, indicating population decline. Survival of adults was the <b>vital</b> <b>rate</b> that contributed most to population persistence in both populations. We discuss our results in the context of demographic patterns of turtle species, emphasizing {{the differences between the two}} populations studied and potential conservation implications...|$|E
40|$|Life-history theory {{predicts that}} the <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> that {{influence}} population growth the most should be buffered against environmental fluctuations due to selection for reduced variation. However, it remains unclear whether populations actually are influenced by such “demographic buffering,” because variation in <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> can be compared on different measurement scales, {{and there has been}} little attempt to investigate whether the choice of scale influences the chance of detecting demographic buffering. We compared two statistical approaches to examine whether demographic buffering has influenced <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> in wild Svalbard reindeer. To account for statistical variance constraints on <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> limited between 0 and 1 in analyses of demographic buffering, one approach is to scale observed variation by the maximum possible variation on the arithmetic scale. When applying this approach, the results suggested that demographic buffering was occurring. However, when we applied an alternative approach that identified statistical variance constraints on the logit scale, there was no evidence for demographic buffering. Thus, the choice of measurement scale must be carefully considered before one can fully understand whether demographic buffering influences life histories. Defining the appropriate scale may require an understanding of the mechanisms through which demographic buffering may have evolved...|$|R
40|$|Point 1 Management of crops, commercialized or {{protected}} species, plagues or life-cycle evolution are subjects requiring comparisons {{among different}} demographic strategies. The simpler methods fail in relating changes in <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> {{with changes in}} population viability whereas more complex methods lack accuracy by neglecting interactions among <b>vital</b> <b>rates.</b> Point 2 The difference between the fitness (evaluated by the population growth rate λ) of two alter-native demographies is decomposed into {{the contributions of the}} differences between the pair-wised <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> and their interactions. This is achieved through a full Taylor expansion (i. e. remainder = 0) of the demographic model. The significance of each term is determined by permutation tests under the null hypothesis that all demographies come from the same pool. Point 3 An example is given with periodic demographic matrices of the microscopic haploid phas...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{influences of}} density-dependent and -independent processes on <b>vital</b> <b>rates</b> and population dynamics have been debated in ecology for {{over half a}} century, yet it is only recently that both processes {{have been shown to}} operate within the same population. However, generalizations on the role of each process across species are rare. Using a process-orientated generalized linear modelling approach we show that variations in fecundity rates in populations of three species of ungulates with contrasting life histories are associated with density and winter weather in a remarkably similar manner. However, there are differences and we speculate that they are a result of differences in size between the species. Much previous research exploring the association between <b>vital</b> <b>rates,</b> population dynamics and density-dependent and -independent processes has used pattern-orientated approaches to decompose time-series into contributions from density-dependent and -independent processes. Results from these analyses are sometimes used to infer associations between <b>vital</b> <b>rates,</b> density and climatic variables. We compare results from pattern-orientated analyses of time-series with process-orientated analyses and report that the two approaches give different results. The approach of analysing relationships between <b>vital</b> <b>rates,</b> density and climatic variables may detect important processes influencing population dynamics that time-series methodologies may overlook...|$|R
