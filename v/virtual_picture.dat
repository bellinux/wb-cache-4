50|$|Collision avoidance: AIS was {{developed}} by the IMO technical committees as a technology to avoid collisions among large vessels at sea that are not within range of shore-based systems. The technology identifies every vessel individually, along with its specific position and movements, enabling a <b>virtual</b> <b>picture</b> to be created in real time. The AIS standards include a variety of automatic calculations based on these position reports such as Closest Point of Approach (CPA) and collision alarms. As AIS is not used by all vessels, AIS is usually used in conjunction with radar. When a ship is navigating at sea, information about the movement and identity of other ships in the vicinity is critical for navigators to make decisions to avoid collision with other ships and dangers (shoal or rocks). Visual observation (e.g., unaided, binoculars, and night vision), audio exchanges (e.g., whistle, horns, and VHF radio), and radar or Automatic Radar Plotting Aid are historically used for this purpose. These preventative mechanisms, however, sometimes fail due to time delays, radar limitations, miscalculations, and display malfunctions and can result in a collision. While requirements of AIS are to display only very basic text information, the data obtained can be integrated with a graphical electronic chart or a radar display, providing consolidated navigational information on a single display.|$|E

40|$|The {{direct mode}} {{used in the}} bi-predictive {{pictures}} (B-pictures) can efficiently improve the coding performance of B pictures, because it has small overhead and obtains a predictive picture from two reference pictures. The traditional temporal direct mode (TDM) derives the motion vector of the current block by scaling the motion vector of the co-located block in the backward reference picture. However, when the current block and its co-located block in backward reference picture belong to different objects with different motion directions, the prediction efficiency of TDM is drastically reduced. In this paper, we propose an improved direct mode prediction method. In the method, a <b>virtual</b> reference <b>picture</b> is generated using the pixel projection technique. Then the <b>virtual</b> reference <b>picture</b> is used to predict the direct mode blocks in B pictures.

Pictures are synthesized {{for the sake}} of better exploitation of the redundancies between neighbouring views in a multi-view sequence. Pictures are synthesized through a 3 D warping method to estimate certain views in a multi-view set. Depth map and associated colour video sequences are used for view generation and tests. H. 264 /AVC coding standard based MVC draft software is used for coding colour videos and depth maps as well as certain views which are predicted from the virtually generated views. Results for coding these views with the proposed method are compared against the reference H. 264 /AVC simulcast method under some low delay coding scenarios. The rate-distortion performance of the proposed method outperforms that of the reference method at all bit-rates. Index Terms—MVC, video coding, virtual view synthesis. 1...|$|E

40|$|Does {{visually}} perceived distance differ when {{objects are}} viewed in augmented reality (AR), {{as opposed to}} the real world? What are the differences? These questions are theoretically interesting, and the answers are important for the development of many tablet- and phone-based AR applications, including mobile AR navigation systems. This article presents a thorough literature review of distance judgment experimental protocols, and results from several areas of perceptual psychology. In addition to distance judgments of real and virtual objects, this section also discusses previous work in measuring the geometry of <b>virtual</b> <b>picture</b> space and considers how this work might be relevant to tablet AR. Then, the article presents the results of two experiments. In each experiment, observers bisected egocentric distances of 15 and 30 m in tablet-based AR and in the real world, in both indoor corridor and outdoor field environments. In AR, observers bisected the distances to virtual humans, while in the real world, they bisected the distances to real humans. This is the first reported research that directly compares distance judgments of real and virtual objects in a tablet AR system. Four key findings were: (1) In AR, observers expanded midpoint intervals at 15 m, but compressed midpoints at 30 m. (2) Observers were accurate in the real world. (3) The environmental setting—corridor or open field—had no effect. (4) The picture perception literature is important in understanding how distances are likely judged in tablet-based AR. Taken together, these findings suggest the depth distortions that AR application developers should expect with mobile and especially tablet-based AR...|$|E

40|$|The Portuguese galleon, the São João, {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} enigmas in South African maritime history, not only because so little is known about its cargo, passengers and crew, but also because the location of the wreck has puzzled researchers from the early 20 th century until the present. The aim of the Port Edward Project 2001 - 2003 was to assess both documentary and physical material pertaining to the wreck, to throw more light on the location of the wreck site and survivor camp because this ship is an important part of South Africa’s maritime history as it was the first cargo ship wrecked along the country’s coastline. Many researchers believe it was one of the most richly laden ships to have left India since it was discovered. To begin with all available sources containing reference to the São João and the events surrounding its wrecking were investigated. This established a historical archaeological standard for dating and identification of Portuguese shipwrecks along the South African coast. A chronological examination of the extent of documentary sources resulted in an archaeological underwater and land survey in the area where {{the greatest}} concentrations of artefacts are still found today. This geographic area was within a defined zone within the municipal area of Port Shepston. Investigations were limited to a stretch of coast and adjacent inland area between the town of Port Edward, more specifically Tragedy Hill, and the Kuboboyi River. The archaeological material investigated: includes: Chinese porcelain shards, cowrie shells, cornelian beads, pepper and cannons. To prevent reiterating previous investigator’s research a survey was conducted to determine what scientific research has been done on the archaeological material. The actual location of the campsite has not been indisputably determined. It became evident that some research has been done to identify this important site but always only up to a certain point where some uncertainty still remains. This uncertainty is the result of certain factors. Firstly, Tim Maggs only positively identified the wreck site in the early 1980 ’s. Secondly, great amounts of agricultural activity have been reported in the area and thirdly the survivors only camped for twelve days, which limits the possibility of finding any material. In order to assist in locating this elusive site, the descriptions and details of other Portuguese campsites were investigated. From this it was possible to construct a <b>virtual</b> <b>picture</b> of the survivor camp by comparing the survivor’s account and the known characteristics of Portuguese survivor camps with the artefacts found and geography of the Port Edward area. The chronological examination of documentary sources, the comparison of other Portuguese survivor campsites, the artefacts found in Port Edward and the geography of the area led to the following conclusions: it can be said with a reasonable amount of certainty that the site in Port Edward is that of the São João. A site which demonstrates Portuguese campsite characteristics, where great concentrations of pepper have been found, was identified. It has been established that the partnership with historical documentation and archaeology gives this project the option of taking the investigations further. The virtual scenario assists in reducing the possibilities and refining the focus as opposed to merely terminating the search. It is recommended that specialized equipment be used for future underwater research since the sea conditions are harsh and dangerous. Tough the possible location of the survivor camp was established further excavations might reveal more about the construction of the camp.
