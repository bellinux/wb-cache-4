25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Windows Store, Microsoft encouraged third parties to use Windows Installer {{as the basis for}} installation frameworks, so that they synchronize correctly with other installers and keep the internal database of installed products consistent. Important features such as rollback and <b>versioning</b> depend on a consistent internal database for reliable operation. Furthermore, Windows Installer facilitates the principle of least privilege by performing software installations by proxy for unprivileged users.|$|E

It is notable that the DSM-5 is identified with Arabic rather than Roman numerals. Beginning with DSM-5, the American Psychiatric Association will use decimals to identify incremental updates (e.g., DSM-5.1, DSM-5.2) and whole numbers for new editions (e.g., DSM-5, DSM-6), similar to the scheme used for software <b>versioning.</b>|$|E

The XML Signature W3C Recommendation has been adopted to allow for digital signatures of components within the ACS container.|$|E
25|$|JavaScript was {{initially}} developed in 1996 {{for use in}} the Netscape Navigator Web browser. In the same year Microsoft released an implementation for Internet Explorer. This implementation was called JScript due to trademark issues. In 1997 the first standardized version of the language was released under the name ECMAScript in the first edition of the ECMA-252 standard. The explicit <b>versioning</b> and opt-in of language features was Mozilla-specific and has been removed. Firefox 4 was the last version which referred to a JavaScript version (1.8.5). With new editions of the ECMA-262 standard, JavaScript language features are now often mentioned with their initial definition in the ECMA-262 editions.|$|E

25|$|In October 2008, it was {{announced}} that Windows 7 would also be the official name of the operating system. There has been some confusion over naming the product Windows 7, while <b>versioning</b> it as 6.1 to indicate its similar build to Vista and increase compatibility with applications that only check major version numbers, similar to Windows 2000 and Windows XP both having 5.x version numbers. The first external release to select Microsoft partners came in January 2008 with Milestone 1, build 6519. Speaking about Windows 7 on October 16, 2008, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer confirmed compatibility between Windows Vista and Windows 7, indicating that Windows 7 would be a refined version of Windows Vista.|$|E

Marble, the virtual globe software, now supports voice navigation, a map creation wizard, {{as well as many}} new plugins. Gwenview image viewer now allows users to compare two or more photos side by side. The Kontact database has also been ported to Akonadi which allows the database to be easily accessible from other applications. Furthermore, the KMail database has also been ported to Akonadi. DigiKam has been updated to support face detection, image <b>versioning,</b> and image tagging.

2500|$|Many {{blogging}} {{and content}} management systems {{do not support}} <b>versioning</b> of content, that is, if an entry is updated, a uniquely accessible version is not created.
