50|$|<b>Viridian</b> <b>Green</b> Laser Sights, part of Laser Aiming Systems Corporation, is a laser sight {{manufacturer}} in Minneapolis, Minnesota {{that specializes in}} developing green laser sights for firearms. The lasers are green, {{as opposed to the}} traditional red, because the color is closer {{to the center of the}} visible spectrum and therefore more easily visible to the human eye. Viridian products are available to military, law enforcement, and civilian users and they are compatible with a wide range of firearms.|$|E
50|$|His {{favorite}} color is red. He also has special weakness for ultramarine blue, cadmium yellow and <b>viridian</b> <b>green.</b> One can notice {{the dominance of}} these colors in all his paintings. Th attraction of pata (traditional scroll) painters of primary colors influenced him. Nevertheless, he is no less interested in creating tones of new colors combining primary colors, In this, the Impressionists of the west have influenced him. He consciously follows the radical attitude of the Impressionists {{in the use of}} colors. It may be mentioned here that, after Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, his favorite artists are Van Gohg, Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso.|$|E
5000|$|Phthalocyanine green G, {{also called}} phthalo <b>green,</b> <b>viridian</b> hue, pigment <b>green</b> 7, copper {{phthalocyanine}} green, C.I. pigment green 7, non-flocculating green G, polychloro copper phthalocyanine, and C.I. 74260, is a synthetic green pigment {{from the group}} of phthalocyanine dyes, a complex of copper(II) with chlorinated phthalocyanine. It is a very soft green powder, insoluble in water.|$|R
50|$|Morisot {{employed}} a rather unusual palette in this painting. She painted the dark blue coat {{of the woman}} on the right with cerulean blue which was rarely used by the Impressionists. The green foliage is painted in a mixture of emerald <b>green,</b> <b>viridian,</b> lead white and cadmium yellow. Cadmium yellow was not yet widely used at this time.|$|R
30|$|In {{specific}} regions, {{including the}} right side of the background, the Suzanne Bambridge’s forehead, hand and collar, the copper does not seem combined with arsenic. These results suggest the presence of further Cu-based pigment(s), such as verdigris and verditer blue. Although, Verdigris does not appear among the colours names from the painting supplies ordered by Gauguin, the green pigment was previously identified in 1889 and 1890 paintings by the artist [18]. In addition, as explained above, the greenish blue shades of the dress contain pigment(s) based on chromium. <b>Viridian,</b> chrome oxide <b>green</b> and chrome green (mixture of chrome yellow and Prussian blue) are potential candidates.|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{illustrates}} the analytical characterization of 12 academic nude paintings by Veloso Salgado, made between 1883 and 1893. The study {{was done with}} in situ methods (infrared reflectography and EDXRF) and benchtop equipment (Raman and FTIR microscopes and SEM-EDS). Infrared reflectography revealed underdrawings, painting style, execution method and retouched/restored areas. Analytical techniques allowed the identification of gypsum, lead white, barium white, zinc white, yellow ochre, chrome yellow, zinc yellow, vermilion, synthetic ultramarine blue, cerulean blue, Prussian blue, <b>viridian,</b> <b>green</b> earth, Paris green, red ochre, raw umber and lamp black. These results provide valuable information on Salgado’s palette and his artistic production technique and allow the distinction between palettes used in Lisbon and Paris and consequently, technical interchanges between both Academies. Finally, this study intends to start a systematic analytical study of the Faculty of Fine Arts’ collection, allowing the characterization of many other authors and their influences {{for the development of}} painting methodology in this Academy...|$|E
30|$|In Van Gogh’s time, mass-produced machine-ground paints {{were already}} available, like {{those from the}} firm of LeFranc&cie [55]. On the other hand, paints were still hand-ground and {{prepared}} in small colorman shops that received their powdered pigments from manufacturers [30]. Among these merchants were Julien Tanguy and probably Tasset et L’Hôte who were Van Goghs main suppliers from his Arles period onwards [12]. The way of grinding has both {{an impact on the}} consistency and thus handling properties, {{as well as on the}} brightness of the paint [55, 56]. Machine-ground paints were considered too fine, which would result in a loss of substantial consistency and reduced brilliance [57]. This latest effect is due to the fact that with decreasing pigment size the reflection (scattering) of light increases, which might result in a less saturated paint color. In addition, since finely ground pigments need more binding medium, the color of the paint is more affected by the yellowing of the oil as well. Also Van Gogh was aware of the effects of pigment particle sizes and ordered coarser ground paints in order to have paints that were “both fresher and longer-lasting”. 12 In our project we had access to a small mechanical grinding glass mill as well as several glass slabs and mullers for grinding by hand. Both methods were explored and it was decided to use the glass slabs and the glass mullers on muscle power because this was probably the method mainly used by Van Gogh’s suppliers. Furthermore, this method had the advantage that larger amounts of paint could be made at once than in the mechanical mill that was to our disposal. Above that the grinding process could be better monitored and adjusted if needed when ground by hand. We did not have the possibility to compare the particle sizes of the reconstruction pigments with those used by Van Gogh, but it might be expected that nowadays pigment particle sizes are somewhat smaller than in the late 19 th century. The extent to which this affects the color of the reconstruction paints is unclear; a recent study by Gueli et al. revealed that grinding of pigments, including cobalt blue and <b>viridian</b> <b>green,</b> to sizes ranging from 0 to 75  µm, does not induce changes detectable by the human eye neither in terms of hue nor in terms of color saturation [58].|$|E
5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome <b>green,</b> also called <b>viridian</b> or institutional <b>green</b> when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|R
500|$|Verdigris is made {{by placing}} a plate or blade of copper, brass or bronze, {{slightly}} warmed, into a vat of fermenting wine, leaving it there for several weeks, and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal. The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by Pliny. It {{was used by the}} Romans in the murals of Pompeii, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks; it was unstable, it could not resist dampness, it did not mix well with other colors, it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact., and it was toxic. Leonardo da Vinci, in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome <b>green.</b> <b>Viridian,</b> also called chrome green, is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate, was patented in 1859. [...] It became popular with painters, since, unlike other synthetic greens, it was stable and not toxic. Vincent van Gogh used it, along with Prussian blue, to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting Cafe terrace at night.|$|R
5000|$|Van Gogh {{suffered}} {{a bout of}} severe mental illness in late July and early August, but was able to resume painting in late August and early September 1889. After making a reed-pen drawing of the work, now held by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, he copied the composition twice in oils in his studio, one approximately the same size (F615) and a smaller version (F743). The larger studio version was probably painted in a single sitting, with a few minor later adjustments adding touches of yellow and brown. Van Gogh sketched out the design with charcoal underdrawing; he applied thin paint on the cypress trees and sky, with the ground allowed to show in places, and thick impasto for the foreground wheat and the clouds above. [...] Characteristically, he preferred the brilliant white of zinc white (zinc oxide) for the white clouds rather than lead white, despite its poor drying qualities, with his palette also including cobalt blue for the sky, shades of chrome yellow for the wheat field, <b>viridian</b> and emerald <b>green</b> for the bushes and cypresses, and touches of vermilion for the poppies in the foreground and also synthetic ultramarine. [...] The July [...] "plein air" [...] version was much more heavily worked, and may be considered a study for the more considered September studio painting. He sent the smaller and less accomplished studio version {{to his mother and}} sister as a gift.|$|R
