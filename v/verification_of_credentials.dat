In this field, most {{research has been}} directed into optimizing the prover operations and exploring the usability boundaries on mobile platforms like smart cards and mobile phones. This research assumes that the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>credential</b> proofs occur at a powerful back end. However, {{a broad range of}} (embedded) applications lack this powerful back end. This article shows that hardware accelerators for modular exponentiations, greatly reduce the run time of applications that require credential verification in an embedded context. In addition, when verification requires a considerable amount of the total run time (i. e., communication included), the use of dual-base (simultaneous) exponentiation hardware further increases the overall performance. All tests have been performed in a practical setup between a smartphone and an embedded terminal using NFC communication...|$|R

In March 1790, Grégoire questioned the article on voting rights in the National Assembly, wishing to ensure that men of colour also received the right to vote. The colonial deputies persuaded the National Assembly to close discussion of the matter. During that same month Barnave, a pro-slavery advocate, delivered his report on maintaining the slave trade.

40|$|Traditionally, {{creation}} and revocation of certificates {{are governed by}} policies that are carried manually, off-line, by trusted agents. This approach to certificate management is appropriate for many current applications, where these policies cannot be verified automatically (e. g. require <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>of</b> non-digital <b>credentials).</b> But it is expensive, time consuming and error-prone for the growing class of applications where certificate management policies can be formalized and carried-out automatically. We argue that, in these cases, {{creation and}} revocation of certificates {{could be viewed as}} any other online service available in a system. Access to these particular service instances could be regulated much {{in the same manner as}} file access or resource allocation. This paper proposes a formulation for certification and revocation policies, and a framework for their support. In this framework, certificate management policies are enforced by generic policy engines, wrapped around certification authorities and revocation servers. The proposed framework is easy to deploy, requiring no modifications of current public key infrastructure (PKI). Moreover, we show that this framework is quite affordable, even in its present, experimental stage...|$|R
30|$|A Strong User Authentication Framework for Cloud Computing: Choudhury et al. ([2011]) {{propose a}} strong user {{authentication}} framework that {{conforms to the}} Isolated IDMS properties, where single Cloud SP {{is responsible for the}} storage, maintenance and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> identity <b>credentials</b> and does not rely on any trusted third party (IdP). Proposed framework uses smart card based on bilinear pairings and user password to provide two-level Authentication, in order to avoids illegitimate access to Cloud resources and data. The framework offers User-Centricity by offering support to self-service feature via password change facility specified in the system design. The proposed secure Cloud framework ensures user Privacy via limited disclosure principle by using two separate channels for the transmission <b>of</b> sensitive user <b>credentials</b> that minimizes the impact of information disclosure and ascertain protection against identity theft attacks. Distribution <b>of</b> <b>credentials</b> is achieved in a way that some information is stored in the user’s smart card, whereas one-time key (password) is sent by the server to user’s mobile via SMS, thus offering support to Identity federation as well. However, the system specifies no Authorization mechanism. Furthermore, the design of proposed framework falls short, as far as Auditing and Logging is concerned.|$|R
40|$|Access {{control in}} mobile and {{pervasive}} computing {{is a complex}} issue, with many aspects relating to the establishment, management, and enforcement of methods and policies that allow mobile devices to share resources with each other. Communication between mobile devices can arise spontaneously, involve the sharing of few resources between heterogeneous platforms, and only need to be maintained for a short time. Additionally, the devices often {{communicate with each other}} a single time, and have no pre-shared secret or a priori knowledge of the other device. In this paper we propose a secure solution for providing controlled access to local resources in mobile and pervasive computing environments. Our solution incorporates demonstrative <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> security <b>credentials,</b> a key-based capability delegation, and easy to use access control features in order to provide simple access with low maintenance costs. It is particularly designed for one-time-only communication between mobile-to-mobile or mobile-to-kiosk devices...|$|R

Lightweight management and security protocols are designed to facilitate the interaction in the community. Authentication of devices and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>credentials</b> rely on security information available in the device as well as information provided by the doctrine and by other peers in the community.

To examine the impact of out-migration on Kenya’s nursing workforce. Study Setting. This study analyzed de-identified nursing data from the Kenya Health Workforce Informatics System, collected by the Nursing Council of Kenya and the Department of Nursing in the Ministry of Medical Services. Study Design. We analyzed trends in Kenya’s nursing workforce from 1999 - 2007, including supply, deployment and intent to out-migrate, measured by requests for <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>credentials</b> from destination countries. Principle Findings. From 1999 - 2007, six percent of Kenya’s nursing workforce of 41, 367 nurses applied to out-migrate. Eighty-five percent of applicants were registered or BScN prepared nurses, 49 % applied within 10 years of their initial registration as a nurse, and 82 % of first-time applications were for the U. S. or U. K. For every four nurses that Kenya adds to its nursing workforce through training, one nurse from the workforce applies to out-migrate, potentially reducing by 25 % Kenya’s ability to maintain its nursing workforce through training...|$|E
40|$|The American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) sets {{standards}} and certifies and recertifies physicians to practise internal medicine and its subspecialties in America. The ABIM {{was established in}} 1936 as a non-profit corporation, one of many specialty boards, such as the American Board of Family Medicine, the American Board of Pediatrics, the American Board of Surgery, etc. The umbrella organisation for these groups is the American Board of Medical Specialties. Members of the American College of Physicians take certifying and recertifying examinations produced by ABIM. Beginning in 1990, ABIM certificates were valid for 10 years. To maintain certification, physicians were required to participate in ABIM maintenance of certification (MOC) programme. The goals are to improve quality of care, to set standards for clinical competency, to foster continuing scholarship, and lead to medical quality improvement. The MOC programme involves <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>credentials,</b> completion of self-evaluation, and completion of a secure exam. The self-evaluation component is the most complex and {{has been the most}} controversial due to the diversity of internal medicine careers and continued learning patterns. ABIM continually introduces new options for evaluation of practice performance. In addition to recertification in General Internal Medicine, ABIM has subspecialty examinations.

It has been accepted as an important way for internists to assure quality of practice and currency of medical information...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Attribute-based Credentials (ABCs) allow {{citizens}} to prove certain properties about themselves without necessarily revealing their full identity. Smart cards are an at-tractive container for such credentials, for security and privacy reasons. But their limited processing power and random access storage capacity pose a severe challenge. Recently, we, the IRMA team, managed to fully implement a limited {{subset of the}} Idemix ABC system on a smart card, with acceptable running times. In this paper we extend this functionality by overcoming the main hurdle: limited RAM. We implement an efficient extended Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) for recomputing pseudorandom-ness and reconstructing variables. Using this we implement Idemix standard and domain pseudonyms, AND proofs based on prime-encoded attributes, and equality proofs of rep-resentation modulo a composite, together with terminal verification and secure messaging. In contrast to prior work that only addressed the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> one <b>credential</b> with only one attribute (particularly, the master secret), we can now perform multi-credential proofs on <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> 5 attributes and complex proofs in reasonable time. We provide a detailed performance analysis and compare our results to other approaches...|$|R
40|$|We present {{protocols}} {{for speeding}} up fixed-base exponentiation and variable-base exponentiation using an untrusted computation resource. In the fixed-base protocols, {{the base and}} exponent may be blinded. If the exponent is fixed, the base may be blinded in the variable-base exponentiation protocols. The protocols are the first ones for accelerating exponentiation {{with the aid of}} an untrusted resource in arbitrary cyclic groups. We also describe how to use the protocols to construct protocols that do, with the aid of an untrusted resource, exponentiation modular an integer where the modulus is the product of primes with single multiplicity. One application of the protocols is to speed up exponentiation-based verification in discrete log-based signature and credential schemes. For example, the protocols can be applied to speeding up, on small devices, the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> signatures in DSS, El Gamal, and Schnorr’s signature schemes, and the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> digital <b>credentials</b> in Brands’ credential system. The protocols use precomputation and we prove that they are unconditionally secure. We analyze the performance of our variable base protocols where the exponentiation is modulo a prime p: the protocols provide an asymptotic speedup of about O(0. 24 (k log k) 2 3), where k = log p, over the square-and-multiply algorithm, without compromising security...|$|R
30|$|Identity {{management}} systems may offer support to identity federation that enhances {{the security of}} identity information during the transmission and storage <b>of</b> <b>credentials.</b> Identity federation has two meanings: {{it can be a}} method of associating and communicating a person’s digital identity and attributes that are stored across multiple Cloud based IDMSs or it could be any standard, contract and technology that make the identity information movable across independent domains (Arias-Cabarcos et al. [2012]; Chen and Zhao [2012]; Shin et al. [2009]; Slone [2004]; Suriadi et al. [2009]). Identity federation plays the key role in securing user credentials while moving towards the Cloud. Identity federation can be achieved via any of the following mechanisms: Multiple IdPs and SPs: An IDMS might involve multiple IdPs and CSPs for the storage and processing of service consumer’s identity information (Celesti et al. [2010]; Chadwick and Casenove [2011]; Hoellrigl et al. [2010]). In other words, the identity <b>credentials</b> <b>of</b> a single service consumer are stored at multiple Cloud servers in small chunks following the distributed architecture. Consequently, while performing authentication, authenticator collects the identity information from all the relevant IdPs and CSPs and processes them as required. Hierarchical Storage: Identity information stored in hierarchical fashion either on a single server or on multiple nodes (typical Cloud scenario) is considered to follow the identity federation principle (Yan et al. [2009]). Hierarchical storage offers different levels of access and improves the information accessibility and security. In the hierarchical storage, IDMSs store user information with different access levels considering the sensitivity of identity credentials; therefore, in case if any intermediate node gets compromised, the impact of information loss will be minimal. Distributed Computation: Distributed Computation: IDMSs are said to be following the identity federation principle, if they follow the distributed processing architecture for user authentication. The distributed architecture works by disseminating the identity information among multiple Cloud servers for the computation or <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> user <b>credentials.</b> This approach accelerates the authentication process and improves security (Ates et al. [2011]; Chowdhury and Noll [2007]; Kim et al. [2010]; Ranchal et al. [2010]).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reasoning about trust {{management}} and credential-based {{systems such as}} SDSI/SPKI, is one of today’s security challenges. The representation and reasoning problem for this (simple) public key infrastructure is challenging: we need to represent permissions, complex naming constructions (“Martinelli’s officemate is FAST’s PC-Chair’s Colleague”), intervals of time and metric time for expiration dates and validity intervals. Such problem is only partly solved by current approaches. At first because they focus on Lamport and Rivest’s SDSI and SPKI, the major goal being {{to show that the}} proposed logics and semantics captured exactly SPKI behavior or were better in this or that respect. Second, reasoning about time is missing. Complicated logics and algorithms are put in place for name resolution but it is always assumed that just the valid credentials are evaluated. What we find missing is what Syverson termed an “independently motivated semantics”. Here, we propose such a semantics with annexed logical calculi. The semantics has a natural intuitive interpretation and in particular can represent timing constraints, intersection of validity intervals and naming at the same time. We also provide a logical calculus based on semantic tableaux with the appealing feature that the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>credentials</b> allows for the direct construction of a counter-model in the semantics when invalid requests are made. This combines semantic tableau method for modal and description logics with systems for reasoning about interval algebra with both qualitative and metric constraints. ...|$|E

40|$|The future {{development}} of quantum-computers could turn many key agreement algorithms {{used in the}} Internet today fully insecure, endangering many applications such as online banking, e-commerce, e-health, etc. At the same time, the Internet is further evolving to enable the Internet of Things (IoT) in which billions of devices deployed in critical applications like healthcare, smart cities and smart energy are being connected to the Internet. The IoT not only requires strong and quantum-secure security, as current Internet applications, but also efficient operation. The recently introduced HIMMO scheme enables lightweight identity-based key sharing and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>credentials</b> in a non-interactive way. The collusion resistance properties of HIMMO enable direct secure communication between any pair of Internet-connected devices. The facts that attacking HIMMO requires lattice techniques {{and that it is}} extremely lightweight make HIMMO an ideal lightweight approach for key agreement and information verification in a post-quantum world. Building on the HIMMO scheme, this paper firstly shows how HIMMO can be efficiently implemented even in resource-constrained devices enabling combined key agreement and credential verification one order of magnitude more efficiently than using ECDH-ECDSA. while being quantum secure. We further explain how HIMMO helps to secure the Internet and IoT by introducing the DTLS-HIMMO operation mode. DTLS, the datagram version of TLS, is becoming the standard security protocol in the IoT, however, it is very frequently discussed that it does not offer the right performance for IoT scenarios. Our design, implementation, and eval-uation show that DTLS-HIMMO operation mode achieves the security properties of DTLS-Certificate security suite while being quantum secure and exhibiting the overhead of symmetric-key primitives. ...|$|E
40|$|In most {{client-server}} interactions {{over the}} Web, the server requires {{the client to}} disclose certain credentials before providing the client with the requested service (server policy).

40|$|A {{question}} whether contesting of credentials {{is designed to}} protect the UN against actions of plenipotentiaries lacking satisfactory credentials, or it is an expression of objection to the power which granted the credentials is discussed in the present article. Chapter two bears on credentials in international law. As appears from analogy to law of treaties, credentials in a wide sense of that term, are a document accorded by a competent state authority, international organization or even an international conference furnishing a certain person or persons with power to represent in performing transactions regulated by international law. Chapter three treats of procedure of verifying credentials in the UN and presents the scope of competence of the Credentials Committee and the General Assembly in that respect. The UN practice in the range of credentials is presented in chapter four with a more detailed discussion of Chinese, Hungarian, Congese, Kampuchean and South-African cases. Presentation of the most crucial incidents related to credentials allowed a critical estimation of the UN actions in the final conclusions of the article. They are characterised by inconsistencies, voluntarism, and deviations from legal regulation. Presently, verifying credentials in the UN is not exclusively of a formal character. Representativeness of authority concerned is assessed upon aplication of various criteria (of effective authority and democracy) subject to varying circumstances. There {{is a great deal of}} anxiety in connection with the case of South African Republic that <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>credentials</b> could be transformed into the instrument limiting an universal character of the organization. Delaying a decision on credentials sometimes for many years (the so-called Hungarian formula) has to be considered as an inconsistency with the letter of the law.

40|$|In Punjab, {{the influx}} of migrant labour {{particularly}} in agriculture sector started with the green revolution and picked up subsequently. Due to monoculture in the cropping pattern, the state has become largely dependent on migrant labourers for various agricultural operations. The influx of seasonal as well as permanent labour from outside has led to various socio-economic problems in Punjab. In the wake of this, {{the present study was}} purposively conducted in the Central Zone of Punjab for the year 2011 to find the causes and impact of labour in-migration in Punjab. A total of 105 respondents belonging to the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Nepal constituted the sample frame. The results have revealed that better income and employment opportunities at the destination place were the major factors responsible for migration. About 64 per cent of the respondents earned less than ` 20000 per annum at their native places and 60 per cent of them had less than 200 days of employment in a year, whereas 23 per cent of the labourers were unemployed at their native place. However, after migration 63 per cent of the migrants could earn from ` 20000 to ` 50000 per annum and 34 per cent earned more than ` 50000 per annum in Punjab, leading to a major share (60 % of total income) as remittances sent back to their native places. On the other hand, the flip side of {{the influx of}} migrants in the study area increased the drug menace by 37 per cent, social tension by 45 per cent and crime by 43 per cent.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to put the study of mimicry on the {{information}} security research map. Mimicry in humans has received little scholarly attention. Sociologist Diego Gambetta has constructed a framework that enables reasoning about episodes of mimicry based on trust in signs. By looking at the problem of phishing the applicability of this framework to problems of mimicry in information security system was tested. It was found that while the framework offers valuable insights, it needs to be updated since the assumptions that it makes do not hold in practice. A new framework is proposed, built on the core ideas of Gambetta’s framework, and extended with results from a literature study of phishing and other sources. This framework has been used for finding possible solutions to problems in web browser interface design. Because the nature of authentication was found to be the observation of discriminatory signals the paper also discusses the ethical issues surrounding the use of credentials. We hope that this paper will help system designers in finding and choosing appropriate credentials for authentication. By using the proposed framework a system can be analysed for the presence of credentials that enable the discrimination between genuine users and impostors. The framework can also serve as a method for identifying the dynamics behind user <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>credentials.</b> The two problems that the framework can help address are the impersonation of providers and the impersonation of users. Like much other security research the results of this paper can be misused by attackers. It is expected that the framework will be more useful for defenders than attackers, as it is of an analytical nature, and cannot be used directly in any attacks. Since this study is of an exploratory nature the findings of the study need to be verified through research with greater validity. The paper contains directions for further research...|$|E
