25|$|These are basal, {{emerging}} from the bulb initially enclosed in a tubular membranous sheath of cataphylls. These are generally two (sometimes three) and linear, strap-shaped or oblanceolate. <b>Vernation,</b> {{the arrangement of the}} emerging leaves relative to each other, varies between species. These may be applanate (flat), supervolute (conduplicate) or explicative (pleated). In applanate <b>vernation</b> the two leaf blades are pressed flat to each other within the bud and as they emerge; explicative leaves are also pressed flat against each other, but the edges of the leaves are folded back (externally recurved) or sometimes rolled; in supervolute plants one leaf is tightly clasped around the other within the bud and generally remains {{at the point where the}} leaves emerge from the soil (for illustration, see Stearn and Davis). In the past, this feature has been used to distinguish between species and to determine the parentage of hybrids but has been shown to be homoplasious, and not useful in this regard.|$|E
25|$|Snowdrops {{have been}} known since the {{earliest}} times under various names but were named Galanthus in 1753. As the number of recognised species increased various {{attempts were made to}} divide the species into subgroups, usually {{on the basis of the}} pattern of the emerging leaves (<b>vernation).</b> In the era of molecular phylogenetics this characteristic has been shown to be unreliable and now seven moleculary defined clades are recognised corresponding to the biogeographical distribution of species. New species continue to be discovered.|$|E
25|$|Early {{molecular}} phylogenetic studies {{confirmed the}} genus was monophyletic and suggested four clades, which were labelled as series, {{and showed that}} Davis' subseries were not monophyletic. An expanded study in 2013 demonstrated seven major clades corresponding to biogeographical distribution. This study used nuclear encoded nrITS (Nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer), and plastid encoded matK (Maturase K), trnL-F, ndhF, and psbK–psbI, and examined all species recognised at the time, and also two naturally occurring putative hybrids. The morphological characteristic of <b>vernation</b> that earlier authors had mainly relied on was shown to be highly homoplasious. A number of species, such as G. nivalis and G. elwesii demonstrated intraspecific biogeographical clades, indicating problems with speciation {{and there may be}} a need for recircumscription. These clades were assiged names, partly according to Davis' previous groupings. In this model clade Platyphyllus is sister {{to the rest of the}} genus.|$|E
500|$|Drosera regia, {{commonly}} known as the king sundew, is a carnivorous plant in the sundew genus Drosera that is endemic to a single valley in South Africa. The genus name Drosera comes from the Greek word droseros, meaning [...] "dew-covered". The specific epithet regia is derived from the Latin for [...] "royal", a reference to the [...] "striking appearance" [...] of the species. Individual leaves can reach [...] in length. It has many unusual relict characteristics not found in most other Drosera species, including woody rhizomes, operculate pollen, and the lack of circinate <b>vernation</b> in scape growth. All of these factors, combined with molecular data from phylogenetic analysis, contribute to the evidence that D.regia possesses some of the most ancient characteristics within the genus. Some of these are shared with the related Venus flytrap (Dionaeamuscipula), which suggests a close evolutionary relationship.|$|E
500|$|Drosera regia {{flowers in}} January and February, {{producing}} scapes up to [...] long. The scapes emerge vertically, lacking the circinate <b>vernation</b> of its leaves {{and all other}} scapes of the genus Drosera, {{with the exception of}} D.arcturi. The scapes consist of two primary branches and bear 5 to 20 (sometimes 30) unscented pink flowers with [...] long petals. Bracts are small, bearing some reduced tentacles. Each flower has three unbranched, spreading styles emerging {{from the top of the}} ovary and extending beyond the five erect stamens (15mm long), which surround the ovary. This arrangement minimizes the chance of self-fertilisation. Studies have shown that the operculate pollen shed in tetrads (fused groups of four pollen grains), characteristics that are similar in the related Dionaeamuscipula (the Venus flytrap) and Aldrovandavesiculosa, is incompatible with clones, failing to produce seed when plants are self-fertilised. Seeds are brown to black, linear and ornamented with fine network-like markings, and 2mm long and 0.5mm in diameter. Seed is shed by the end of March.|$|E
500|$|Drosera regia {{plants are}} fairly large herbs that produce {{horizontal}} woody rhizomes and {{a crown of}} large, linear leaves up to [...] long and [...] wide. The leaves possess stalked glands (tentacles) on the upper surface of the lamina along nearly {{the entire length of}} the leaf. The leaves lack petioles and stipules, emerging by circinate <b>vernation</b> (uncurling) and tapering to a filiform point. The tentacles and the leaf itself are capable of responding to prey by bending toward insects trapped in the sticky mucilage produced by the glands. Leaves are even capable of folding over themselves several times. Each leaf can possess thousands of tentacles, which can aid in the retention of larger prey when combined with the leaf wrapping tightly around captured insects. In its native habitat, D.regia has been known to capture large beetles, moths and butterflies. Plants go dormant during the colder season and form a dormant bud, consisting of a tight cluster of short, immature leaves. Plants begin to break dormancy in mid-July with a typical growing season lasting from October to April, though this is variable and plants can continue growing year-round without dormancy. Individual leaves die back but remain attached to the short stem, clothing the bottom portion of the plant in the blackened dead leaves of former years.|$|E
500|$|Stephens placed D.regia {{in section}} Psychophila Planch., which {{at that time}} {{included}} D.arcturi, D.stenopetala, and D.uniflora, though she noted that the many-flowered inflorescence was unusual for this group. In 1970, the South African botanist Anna Amelia Obermeyer suggested that D.regia did not fit {{into any of the}} taxonomic groups established by Ludwig Diels in his 1906 monograph on the family. Obermeyer noted the unusual characteristics that set D.regia apart from any other Drosera species: the operculate pollen, circinate leaf <b>vernation,</b> undivided styles, and woody rhizomes. In 1994, Rüdiger Seine and Wilhelm Barthlott proposed classifying D.regia as the sole species in a new subgenus, Drosera subg. Regiae, to [...] "give adequate recognition to the isolated position of D.regia within the genus." [...] This taxonomic position was affirmed by Jan Schlauer in his dichotomous key and taxonomic revisions published in 1996. Also in 1996 two Czech researchers, Jindřich Chrtek and Zdeňka Slavíková, proposed changes to the taxonomy of the genus by splitting D.regia off into its own, monotypic genus, Freatulina. Chrtek and Slavíková cited the many morphological differences between D.regia and every other member of the genus Drosera in support of their decision to make this taxonomic split. They reaffirmed their taxonomic opinions in a 1999 article that also split the tuberous Drosera, members of the subgenus Ergaleium, to Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's resurrected genus Sondera. These taxonomic revisions, however, have not gained any support, being rejected or largely ignored by recent publications on the genus.|$|E

50|$|The first Cryptocoryne {{species was}} {{described}} in 1779 as Arum spirale by Retzius. The genus was described by Friedrich Ernst Ludwig von Fischer in 1828. However, the scientific classification of Cryptocoryne species is very complicated and there are different opinions about it. Lagenandra is another genus {{closely related to the}} genus Cryptocoryne. The two can be easily told apart since the leaves of Cryptocoryne species exhibit convolute <b>vernation</b> whereas Lagenandra species exhibit involute <b>vernation.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{involute}} <b>vernation</b> both margins on opposing {{sides of}} the leaf are rolled up forming two tubes that meet at the midrib of the leaf.|$|E
5000|$|Circinate <b>vernation</b> is {{the manner}} in which a fern frond emerges. As the fern frond is formed, it is tightly curled so that the tender growing tip of the frond (and each {{subdivision}} of the frond) is protected within a coil. At this stage it is called a crozier (after the shepherd's crook) or fiddlehead (after the scrollwork {{at the top of a}} violin). As the lower parts of the frond expand and toughen up, they begin to photosynthesize, supporting the further growth and expansion of the frond. In the case of many fronds, long hairs or scales provide additional protection to the growing tips before they are fully uncoiled. Circinate <b>vernation</b> may also be observed in the extension of leaflets, in the compound leaves of Cycads. Circinate <b>vernation</b> is also typical of the carnivorous plant family Droseraceae, for example see [...] of Drosera filiformis.|$|E

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{convolute}} <b>vernation</b> involves the wrapping of one {{margin of the}} leaf's blade over the other. This folding mechanism makes the emerging leaf look like a tube.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vernation</b> (from vernal meaning spring, {{since that}} is when leaves spring forth in {{temperate}} regions) is the formation of new leaves or fronds. In plant anatomy, it is the arrangement of leaves in a bud.|$|E
50|$|Left on the plant, each fiddlehead would unroll {{into a new}} frond (circinate <b>vernation).</b> As fiddleheads are {{harvested}} {{early in the season}} before the frond has opened and reached its full height, they are cut fairly close to the ground.|$|E
50|$|The fronds of {{tree ferns}} are usually {{very large and}} multiple-pinnated, {{but at least one}} type has entire (undivided) fronds. The fronds of tree ferns also exhibit circinate <b>vernation,</b> meaning the young fronds emerge in coils that uncurl as they grow.|$|E

50|$|Drosera filiformis, {{commonly}} known as the thread-leaved sundew, is a small, insectivorous, rosette-forming species of perennial herb. A species of sundew, it is unusual within its genus in that the long, erect, filiform (thread-like) leaves of this plant unroll in spirals - an arrangement similar to the circinate <b>vernation</b> seen in ferns.|$|E
5000|$|Leaves alternate, spiral to distichous, penninerved, brochidodromous, simple or imparipinate, {{herbaceous}} or coriaceous, sometimes very large, {{with simple}} dentate edges, sometimes heteromorphic, often {{the base of}} the stalk is woody and {{the base of the}} foliole is pulvinulate, lacking stipules, <b>vernation</b> conduplicate, often dotted with red glands. Stomata anomocytic or paracytic, usually hypostomatic.|$|E
50|$|The Sawdoniales {{were among}} the first {{vascular}} plants in the fossil record. They are zosterophylls, descending from the same ancestors that modern lycophytes evolved from. They bore lateral, reniform sporangia, branched dichotomously, and grew at the ends by unrolling (circinate <b>vernation).</b> Some had smooth stems, others were covered in small spines; fungal bodies have been reported in some spines.|$|E
50|$|The Ostryopsis-Carpinus-Ostrya subclade {{is defined}} by staminate flowers without a perianth, operculate pollen {{apertures}} with endexine not thickening at apertural region, a base chromosome number of 8, and a plicate leaf <b>vernation</b> pattern. Several characters, including glabrous receptacle of staminate flowers, smooth nutlet surface, and secondary veins extending directly into leaf teeth, differentiate Ostryopsis from Carpinus and Ostrya.|$|E
50|$|The trophophore {{is located}} {{high on the}} common stalk, but the common stalk is subterranean, giving the {{impression}} that the leaf originates near ground level.
