40|$|Abstract. Distributing valve {{is the key}} {{component}} of underwater hydraulic breaker, and the theoretical analysis of it is very necessary. Through the flow analysis of the conical valve core, the cone angle of the conical valve core has been determined, the design parameters of distributing valve have been verified. According to the force balance equation of the conical valve core and distributing valve core, the corresponding simulation research and analysis have been done for this distributing valve, the rationality of the design has been further verified. According to the knowledge of hydraulic breaker, <b>valve</b> <b>mouth</b> flow and force analysis, the various analysis and validation of distributing valve of breaker have been done, the rationality of design has been checked, and the analysis method can be adopted in studies of this area...|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Artemisia campestris. They {{create an}} almost straight, tubular silken case. It is {{yellow-brown}} {{and up to}} 20 mm long. The rear end is weakly compressed and two <b>valved.</b> The <b>mouth</b> angle is about 15°. Larvae can be found from October to June.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Asteraceae species, {{including}} Achillea clavenae, Achillea millefolium, Achillea moschata, Anthemis, Carduus, Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Cirsium arvense, Eupatorium cannabinum, Inula britannica, Inula conyza, Inula helenium, Pulicaria dysenterica and Tanacetum species. They {{create a}} slender tubular silken case of about 10 mm long. It is straw coloured and three <b>valved.</b> The <b>mouth</b> angle is about 30°.|$|R
50|$|The Kirby-Morgan KM 48 Supermask is unique, in {{that the}} {{airspace}} for the eyes is completely separate from the mouth area, and the mask can be worn as a half mask by leaving off the mouthpiece pod, which holds the demand valve or rebreather mouthpiece. This allows bailout to a standard scuba demand <b>valve</b> with <b>mouth</b> grip, but also allows the diver to carry bailout gas fitted to a second pod, which can be clopped to the mask when the primary pod has been unclipped. This can be done underwater, and {{as there is a}} standard mouthpiece inside the pod, breathing can commence before the pod is fully connected and sealed. The pod can be cleared of water after sealing, and the eye-space is not affected by the switch.|$|R
50|$|In bony fish, {{the gills}} {{lie in a}} branchial chamber covered by a bony operculum. The great {{majority}} of bony fish species have five pairs of gills, although a few have lost some {{over the course of}} evolution. The operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills, so bony fish do not have to rely on ram ventilation (and hence near constant motion) to breathe. <b>Valves</b> inside the <b>mouth</b> keep the water from escaping.|$|R
40|$|Background: In the {{presence}} of turbinate dysfunction, an inferior turbinectomy for persistent hypertrophy of bone and/or mucosa may be performed. We sought to explore anatomic feasibility of a transoral turbinectomy. Methods: After transoral inferior turbinectomy in 12 cadavers, average distances from the external nasal valve to inferior turbinate and from pyriform aperture to inferior turbinate were compared. Average "area of access" was calculated. Preoperative and postoperative nasal length, tip projection, and alar-base width were also compared. Results: Average distance from external nasal valve to inferior turbinate was 32. 4 mm. Average distance from aperture to inferior turbinate was 2. 4 mm (P < 0. 0001). Average "areas of access" to nasal vault through the external nasal <b>valve</b> and <b>mouth</b> were 183. 9 mm(2) and 243. 6 mm(2) (P = 0. 07), respectively. Conclusions: The transoral approach provides a larger "area of access" to the turbinate, a statistically significant reduction of distance to target, no postoperative changes in nasal soft tissue, and easier instrumentation...|$|R
