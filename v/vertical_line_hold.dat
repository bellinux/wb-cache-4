50|$|To use the <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> test, take a ruler {{or other}} {{straight}} edge and {{draw a line}} parallel to the y-axis for any chosen value of x. If the <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> you drew intersects the graph more than once for any value of x then the graph is not the graph of a function. If, alternatively, a <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> intersects the graph no more than once, no matter where the <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> is placed, then the graph is the graph of a function. For example, a curve which is any straight line other than a <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> will be the graph of a function. As another example, a sideways parabola (one whose directrix is a <b>vertical</b> <b>line)</b> is not the graph of a function because some <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> will intersect the parabola twice.|$|R

5000|$|The Extended Drawing Test [...] is a {{computerized}} graphonomic assessment for arm and hand function. The EDT measures {{the ability of}} the subject to draw <b>vertical</b> <b>lines,</b> with both the left and right hands. To compare performance between gross arm movements and fine finger control, the subjects draw <b>lines</b> <b>holding</b> either the tablet's pen (held by the fingers) or a mouse (held by the whole hand). The latter movements do not include finger movements. Norms have been established for 3- to 70-year-old healthy persons. Deviations from the healthy norms will reflect different pathologies for different patient groups, e.g., hemiplegic stroke patients. The first paper mentioning EDT is Vuillermot, Pescatore, Holper, Kiper, and Eng (2009).|$|R

5000|$|It {{consists}} of <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> with horizontal lines connecting two adjacent <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> scattered randomly along their length; the horizontal lines are called [...] "legs". The number of <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> equals {{the number of}} people playing, and at the bottom of each line there is an item - a thing that will be paired with a player. The general rule for playing this game is: choose a line on the top, and follow this line downwards. When a horizontal line is encountered, follow it to get to another <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> and continue downwards. Repeat this procedure until reaching the end of the <b>vertical</b> <b>line.</b> Then the player is given the thing written {{at the bottom of the}} line.|$|R
50|$|In imaging optics, all {{light rays}} {{crossing}} the input aperture at x1=xI are redirected by it towards the output aperture at x1=xO where xI=m xO. This ensures that {{an image of}} the input of formed at the output with a magnification m. In phase space, this means that <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> in the phase space at the input are transformed into <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> at the output.

50|$|TVL {{is defined}} as the maximum number of {{alternating}} light and dark <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> that can be resolved per picture height.

50|$|In mathematics, the <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> test is {{a visual}} way to {{determine}} if a curve is a graph of a function or not. A function can only have one output, y, for each unique input, x. If a <b>vertical</b> <b>line</b> intersects a curve on an xy-plane more than once then for one value of x the curve has more than one value of y, and so, the curve does not represent a function. If all <b>vertical</b> <b>lines</b> intersect a curve at most once then the curve represents a function.|$|R
