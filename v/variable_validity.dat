Because the basis of prevention is epidemiology, problems of validity in the epidemiologic literature ought to be recognized by the primary medical advisor, so that he may optimize prevention. This article addresses the question of validity {{from the standpoint of the}} material, analysis, and interpretation. Validity of the material is discussed from four main points of reference: the diagnostic criteria of the disease, selection biases, misclassification of exposure, and control group relevance. Validity of the analysis is considered from the standpoint of the etiologic hypothesis; the notion of the “expected minimum analysis” is discussed. The three main aspects of this are the control of confounders, the introduction of test-variables, and the concept of refinement of the independent and dependent <b>variables.</b> <b>Validity</b> of interpretation is presented as a function of the introduction of test-variables.

40|$|Background: Skin {{needling}} is {{a technique}} used to improve the appearance of acne scarring. Objective: To comprehensively review the medical literature regarding skin needling {{as a treatment for}} acne scarring. Methods: A literature search was performed using the PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases, in addition to reviewing the bibliographies of relevant articles. Results: Ten studies presented patients treated with skin needling alone, while eight studies discussed skin needling in combination with other treatments for acne scarring. All studies showed improvements in scarring after needling, with 12 reporting statistical significance. The median number of treatments when needling was used alone was three, the median duration between treatments was 4 weeks, and the median needle length used was 1. 5 mm. Reported adverse events were infrequent and included post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, “tram track” scarring, acne, and milia. There were no reports of bacterial infections. Limitations: The studies reviewed were heterogeneous in design and of <b>variable</b> <b>validity,</b> with some not reporting statistical significance. Conclusion: There is moderate evidence to suggest that skin needling is beneficial and safe for the treatment of acne scarring.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the bias and precision of four residualized <b>variable</b> <b>validity</b> estimates (C 0, C 1, C 2, C 3) across a number of study conditions. Validity estimates that considered measurement error, correlations among error scores, and correlations between error scores and true scores (C 3) performed the best, yielding no estimates that were practically significantly different than their respective population parameters, across study conditions. Validity estimates that considered measurement error and correlations among error scores (C 2) {{did a good job}} in yielding unbiased, valid, and precise results. Only in a select number of study conditions were C 2 estimates unable to be computed or produced results that had sufficient variance to affect interpretation of results. Validity estimates based on observed scores (C 0) fared well in producing valid, precise, and unbiased results. Validity estimates based on observed scores that were only corrected for measurement error (C 1) performed the worst. Not only did they not reliably produce estimates even when the level of modeled correlated error was low, C 1 produced values higher than the theoretical limit of 1. 0 across a number of study conditions. Estimates based on C 1 also produced the greatest number of conditions that were practically significantly different than their population parameters. i...|$|E

40|$|Background: Direct–to–consumer {{genetic testing}} (DTCGT) offers risk {{estimates}} {{for a variety}} of complex diseases and conditions, yet little is known about its impact on actual users, including their decisions about sharing the information gleaned from testing. Ethical considerations include the impact of unsolicited genetic information with <b>variable</b> <b>validity</b> and clinical utility on relatives, and the possible burden to the health care system if revealed to physicians. Aims: The qualitative study explored primary care patients’ views, attitudes, and decision making considerations regarding DTCGT. This article focuses on the disclosure decisions participants made regarding participation, testing, and results of DTCGT, a topic which arose as a secondary aim of the study. Methods: Through four longitudinal interviews (pre–test, results, 3 and 12 months post–test) we examined twenty primary care patients’ decisions, expressed intentions, and actions regarding disclosure to immediate and extended family, friends and coworkers, and physicians about participation in and results of DTCGT. Individual interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and a summative approach to describe the global themes. Results: Most participants disclosed to some immediate family; less than half disclosed to extended family; approximately half talked to friends. Most participants stated they would or might disclose to physicians about DTCGT and a few did. Conceptual themes that emerged from the data analysis include ambivalence about disclosure, consistency between intention and actual disclosure behavior and decisions, and conditional information sharing. Conclusions: Participants’ intentional and actual disclosure patterns offer insight into how they view DTCGT, weigh results, and the potential impact of DTCGT...|$|E
30|$|Statistical {{process control}} (SPC) theory takes a {{negative}} view of adjustment of process settings, which is termed tampering. In contrast, quality and lean programmes actively encourage operators to acts of intervention and personal {{agency in the}} improvement of production outcomes. This creates a conflict that requires operator judgement: How does one differentiate between unnecessary tampering and needful intervention? Also, difficult is that operators apply tacit knowledge to such judgements. There {{is a need to}} determine where in a given production process the operators are applying tacit knowledge, and whether this is hindering or aiding quality outcomes. The work involved the conjoint application of systems engineering, statistics, and knowledge management principles, {{in the context of a}} case study. Systems engineering was used to create a functional model of a real plant. Actual plant data were analysed with the statistical methods of ANOVA, feature selection, and link analysis. This identified the variables to which the output quality was most sensitive. These key variables were mapped back to the functional model. Fieldwork was then directed to those areas to prospect for operator judgement activities. A natural conversational approach was used to determine where and how operators were applying judgement. This contrasts to the interrogative approach of conventional knowledge management. Data are presented for a case study of a meat rendering plant. The results identify specific areas where operators’ tacit knowledge and mental model contribute to quality outcomes and untangles the motivations behind their agency. Also evident is how novice and expert operators apply their knowledge differently. Novices were focussed on meeting throughput objectives, and their incomplete understanding of the plant characteristics led them to inadvertently sacrifice quality in the pursuit of productivity in certain situations. Operators’ responses to the plant are affected by their individual mental models of the plant, which differ between operators and have <b>variable</b> <b>validity.</b> Their behaviour is also affected by differing interpretations of how their personal agency should be applied to the achievement of production objectives. The methodology developed here is an integration of systems engineering, statistical analysis, and knowledge management. It shows how to determine where in a given production process the operator intervention is occurring, how it affects quality outcomes, and what tacit knowledge operators are using. It thereby assists the continuous quality improvement processes in a different way to SPC. A second contribution is the provision of a novel methodology for knowledge management, one that circumvents the usual codification barriers to knowledge management.|$|E
40|$|Background Measurement {{tools that}} {{evaluate}} personal, social and occupational life domain wellbeing {{are increasingly being}} used to measure how people are feeling and flourishing. The New Zealand Sovereign Wellbeing Index (NZSWI) is a measure specifically developed to evaluate the wellbeing of New Zealanders, and to track how their wellbeing is changing over time. Best practice in psychometric measurement requires sound assessment {{in order to be}} useful for those interpreting and utilising the results of wellbeing measures, and the NZSWI’s reliability and validity has yet to have been investigated. The aim of this research was to determine the test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity of the NZSWI. Methods The aim of this research was to determine the test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity of the New Zealand Sovereign Wellbeing Index. Seventy-one adults aged 18 years and over completed a survey battery, including the New Zealand Sovereign Wellbeing Index and additional validated wellbeing measures at two time points, one week apart. Test-retest reliability between the two time points was analysed by calculating an intraclass correlation coefficient. Internal consistency was assessed at time point 1 using a Cronbach’s alpha correlation coefficient. Construct validity, both convergent and discriminant, was evaluated against validated psychometric tools using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Results With regard to test-retest reliability, 78 items (89 %) displayed substantial reliability (Cronbach’s coefficients between 0. 61 and 1. 0). Ten items (11 %) had moderate reliability (coefficients between 0. 41 and 0. 60). For internal consistency, five of the twenty total topic headings (25 %) had coefficient alphas above 0. 70, eleven (55 %) had coefficient alphas between 0. 50 and 0. 69, two (10 %) had alphas between 0. 40 and 0. 49, and two (10 %) had coefficient alphas under 0. 25. With regard to convergent validity, all items measured within the 15 topic tables displayed strong validity with Spearman’s coefficients above 0. 50. For discriminant validity, one topic (11 %) returned a small correlation, six topics (67 %) returned medium correlations, and 3 two topics (22 %) returned strong correlations, therefore demonstrating <b>variable</b> <b>validity</b> in this aspect. Conclusion On the whole these results suggest that the New Zealand Sovereign Wellbeing Index is a reliable and valid psychometric measurement tool for assessing wellbeing constructs in a New Zealand adult population...|$|E

A 5 -factor structure with some important similarities and differences to the original version was confirmed. This study shows that the police officers utilize different coping strategies in the same complex situations during the deportation of UARC. The use of escape-avoidance and self-control increased the likelihood of psychological disturbance, whereas positive reappraisal had a protective effect.
