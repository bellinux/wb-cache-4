40|$|Among the pests {{that cause}} {{reduction}} on common bean yield, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci biotype B (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) stands out. The insect causes direct damages {{due to its}} feeding on plants and indirect damages by the sugary excretion of honeydew, providing {{the development of the}} sooty mould. In addition this species is an important <b>vector</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> such as the golden bean mosaic virus. Thus, this work aimed to study the non-preference for oviposition and antibiosis in bean cultivars to the whitefly. Experiments were carried out in a greenhouse at Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil, from January to March 2012. The following cultivars were used in the assays: IAC-Centauro, IAC-Una, IAC-Formoso, IAPAR- 81, IPR-Eldorado, IPR-Siriri (all resistant); and Perola and IAC-Harmonia (both susceptible), previously screened from field experiments.

Among the sucker insects causing damages on squash Cucurbita pepo (L.), the aphid Aphis gossypii (Glover) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is pointed {{as one of the most}} important, once their nymphs and adults suck the sap of the leaves continuously, besides being potential <b>vector</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus.</b> The present research evaluated different cultivars, aiming to identify the resistance against this aphid. The cultivars Novita, Sandy, Caserta Cac Melhorada, Novita Plus, Samira, AF- 2858 and Caserta TS were used in laboratory assays (T= 25 ± 2 ºC; RH= 70 ± 10 % and fotophase= 12 h). In the immature phase the duration of nymphal instars was evaluated, the total duration and their viability, confining individuals on leaf disks from cultivars. In the adult phase the duration of reproductive period, the fecundity and the biological cycle were observed. The cultivar 'Sandy' expressed high level of antibiosis and feeding non-preference against A. gossypii, increasing the nymphal stage and causing mortality near to 70 %. Besides, this cultivar reduced the production of nymphs and the longevity of the insects. The 'Novita Plus' cultivar also induced significant nymphal mortality, however in lower levels than those verified in 'Sandy', indicating a moderate resistance...|$|E

40|$|The tobacco aphid (Myzus persicae nicotianae) is a {{cosmopolitan}} pest {{and one of}} the major pests of tobacco. Due to its damaging potential, particularly as a <b>vector</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> diseases, management of M. persicae nicotianae relies heavily on chemical control. However, due to insecticide resistance development and ever-stringent regulations on plant protection products in external markets in the First World, {{it is now clear that}} an integrated pest management approach which encourages natural enemy activity is needed. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two of the most commonly found tobacco aphid natural enemies in the country, the ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and the parasitoid, Aphidius colemani (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) as biological control agents of the tobacco aphid. The biology of H. variegata and its aphid predation rates, A. colemani parasitism rate, intraguild predation of the parasitoid by the ladybird, and the effects of some common aphicide sprays on the ladybird were studied. The egg and larval-pupal periods of H. variegata were 2. 6 and 12 - 17 days, respectively. Hippodamia variegata 1 st instar larvae could not survive on tobacco leaves due to impeded movement by sticky exudates from leaf trichomes making them less effective in controlling the tobacco aphid. Adult ladybrids, however, proved to be the most effective. A female ladybird had a daily predation rate of 30. 2 aphids compared to the male which consumed 5. 5 aphids per day. The adult male + female and adult female + 3 rd instar larva combinations were equally capable of suppressing tobacco aphid populations as was the female alone.
