5|$|The {{library was}} {{completed}} in late 2014 following the transfer of materials from the former library across the street, which closed on 30 August. It {{opened to the public}} on Saturday, 13 December 2014 to an estimated 12,000 <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> enjoyed a day of performances and festivities. The first six weeks of operation saw 272,000 <b>visitors,</b> <b>who</b> collectively checked out over 167,700 items.|$|E

A large number of restaurants, galleries, and retail stores cater to thousands of <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> attend plays each year at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. In 2011, the festival sold more than 390,000 tickets to its theater productions.|$|E
5|$|Misch {{lived in}} Berlin {{in the same}} house he moved into when he was {{released}} by the Soviets. The house is in the district of Rudow in South Berlin. Misch regularly received <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> wished to speak to or interview him. Misch died in Berlin on 5 September 2013 at the age of 96.|$|E
5|$|Over {{time the}} {{increased}} {{numbers of people}} gathering at the site resulted in tensions between the Jewish <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> wanted easier access and more space, and the residents, who complained of the noise. This gave rise to Jewish attempts at gaining ownership of the land adjacent to the Wall.|$|E

5|$|Abd al-Rahman quietly {{began to}} regroup the Ansar as a {{religious}} sect. Until 1914, he lived in seclusion in Omdurman or on Aba Island, closely watched by Slatin's intelligence agents. Despite the surveillance he built considerable influence in the White Nile region. He often visited the many mosques in Omdurman to meet his followers with his face covered so {{he would not be}} recognized by government agents. He received many <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> sought his blessing.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Creek's steady flow, warmth, deep pools, {{and small}} waterfalls attract <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> wade, swim, float, kayak, and snorkel in its waters. Four named hiking paths {{intersect}} the Fossil Creek corridor: the Flume–Irving, Fossil Springs, Mail, and Deadman Mesa trails. The U.S. Forest Service allows dispersed camping {{in some parts}} of the area but has made other parts, such as riparian zones, off-limits to overnight stays. Other activities in the area include wildlife viewing, photography, fishing, and visits to the remains of the Childs-Irving infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|From Thirlspot two routes lead up Helvellyn. The old pony route took a {{very safe}} and steady route {{for the benefit of}} early <b>visitors,</b> <b>who</b> took horses and a guide from the inn. The route {{traverses}} the flank of White Side to join the ridge at the col just below Lower Man. The other route, known as the White Stones Route, originally marked by stones painted white, crosses the fellside at a lower level and fords Helvellyn Gill to join the path from Swirls.|$|E

Signs were changed, the playing field was repainted, and {{accommodations}} were prepared for the thousands of expected spectators. In total, South Florida's economy received an estimated $220million boost from <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> arrived to watch the two games.|$|E
5|$|Inside the LBC, {{visitors}} {{pass through}} a number of exhibits about the bell before reaching the Liberty Bell itself. Due to security concerns following an attack on the bell by a visitor with a hammer in 2001, the bell is hung out of easy reach of <b>visitors,</b> <b>who</b> are no longer allowed to touch it, and all visitors undergo a security screening.|$|E
5|$|Minnie Island State Park offers {{opportunities}} for picnicking and fishing to <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> reach it by boat. Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity, which is redundant because {{the island is}} accessible by boat. The Oh Ranger website advises visitors of the tiny island to use a kayak to access the island because the island is heavily wooded {{and it is difficult}} to find a spot to dock.|$|E

5|$|The town {{came into}} being as a spa in the Restoration and had its heyday as a tourist resort under Beau Nash when the Pantiles and its chalybeate spring {{attracted}} <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> wished to take the waters. Though its popularity waned {{with the advent of}} sea bathing, the town remains popular and derives some 30 percent of its income from the tourist industry.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shenboo Atlas of 1933, in the 1930s {{most people}} lived within the {{perimeter}} of the Xi'an Wall but still {{there were a lot of}} unoccupied open areas. Among the <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> came to see the Xian Wall were American captain (later general) Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Průšek (1906–1980) in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried out more renovations and additions to the wall. At that time, the Yangmacheng tower, the Zhalou sluice tower, the Kuixinglou dipper tower, the Jiaolou corner tower and the Dilou defense tower were all refurbished; the crumbling parts of the rampart were changed into gates; and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter-connected.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, {{more than}} 90% {{of the workers}} and <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> died in the towers had been {{at or above the}} points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation, fell or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed in the building's {{eventual}} collapse. The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact died as well.|$|E

5|$|Museum curators {{consider}} <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> pick up {{items from}} the ground to be thieves, and local police will charge them as such. The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of ten years. On 22 June 2015, two British youths from the Perse School were convicted of theft after picking up buttons and shards of decorative glass they found on the ground near the area where camp victims' confiscated personal effects were stored. The boys, both 17 years old, received probation and were fined £170, but later appealed the sentence. Curators said that similar incidents happen {{once or twice a}} year.|$|E
5|$|The many <b>visitors</b> <b>who</b> come to birdwatch, sail or {{for other}} outdoor recreations are {{important}} to the local economy, but the land-based activities jeopardize nesting birds and fragile habitats, especially the dunes. Some access restrictions on humans and dogs help to reduce the adverse effects, and trips to see the seals are usually undertaken by boat. The spit is a dynamic structure, gradually moving towards the coast and extending to the west. Land is lost to the sea as the spit rolls forward. The River Glaven can become blocked by the advancing shingle and cause flooding of Cley village, Cley Marshes nature reserve, and the environmentally important reclaimed grazing pastures, so the river has to be realigned every few decades.|$|E
5|$|To the north, the {{conflict}} held a strong economic component {{in addition to}} territorial disputes. Newfoundland {{was the site of}} a British colony based at St. John's, and the French colonial base was at Plaisance, with both sides also holding a number of smaller permanent settlements. The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe. These colonists numbered fewer than 2,000 English and 1,000 French permanent settlers (and many more seasonal <b>visitors)</b> <b>who</b> competed with one another for the fisheries of the Grand Banks, which were also used by fishermen from Acadia (then encompassing all of present-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and Massachusetts.|$|E
