40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{influence}} of <b>the</b> field <b>setup</b> on <b>the</b> dosimetry at the junction in singleisocenter half-beam techniques. Methods: The dosimetry at the junction for a two-field <b>setup</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> gantry at zero was first evaluated with radiochromic films. A three-field setup, with an anterior field and two opposed lateral fields, was also analyzed for two different relative positions of the fields involved. In all cases, the dose increase at the central axis, called the junction dose, was measured. Results: Junction doses varied greatly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>setup.</b> For <b>the</b> three-field <b>setup,</b> <b>the</b> junction dose differed from that obtained <b>with</b> <b>the</b> two-field <b>setup,</b> and it greatly depended on the relative position of the fields. When the anterior field was closer to the gantry than the lateral fields, a field gap occurred and the junction dose was negative. When the anterior field was farther from the gantry than the lateral fields, a field overlap was obtained and the junction dose was positive. The difference in the junction dose between <b>the</b> three-field <b>setups</b> was around 18...|$|R
