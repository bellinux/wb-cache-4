40|$|Background: Urothelial bladder {{carcinoma}} (UBC) is a chemo-sensitive tumour, but {{the response}} to treatment is heterogeneous. CD 147 {{has been associated with}} chemotherapy resistance. We aimed to define tumours with an aggressive phenotype by the combined analysis of clinicopathological and biological parameters. Methods: 77 patients with T 1 G 3 or muscle-invasive UBC treated by radical cystectomy were studied. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect CD 147, heparanase, CD 31 (blood <b>vessels</b> <b>identification)</b> and D 2 - 40 (lymphatic <b>vessels</b> <b>identification)</b> expressions. The immunohistochemical reactions were correlated with the clinicopathological and the outcome parameters. 5 -year disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results: The 5 -year DFS and OS rates were significantly influenced by the classical clinicopathological parameters, and by the occurrence of lymphovascular invasion. CD 147 and heparanase immunoexpression did not affect patients’ outcome. However, patients with pT 3 /pT 4 tumours had a median OS time of 14. 7 months (95 % CI 7. 1 - 22. 3, p= 0. 003), which was reduced to 9. 2 months (95 % CI 1. 5 - 17. 0, p= 0. 008) if the tumours were CD 147 positive. We developed a model of tumour aggressiveness using parameters as stage, grade, lymphovascular invasion and CD 147 immunoexpression, which separated a low aggressiveness from a high aggressiveness group, remaining as an independent prognostic factor of DFS (HR 3. 746; 95 % CI 1. 244 - 11. 285; p= 0. 019) and OS (HR 3. 247; 95 % CI 1. 015 - 10. 388, p= 0. 047). Conclusion: CD 147 overexpression, included in a model of UBC aggressiveness, may help surgeons to identify patients who could benefit from a personalized therapeutic regimen. Additional validation is needed...|$|R

40|$|Intravascular {{lymphoma}} (IVL) is a {{rare disease}} form of malignant lymphoma, and {{it is characterised by}} the selective growth of lymphoma cells within the lumina of <b>vessels.</b> <b>Identification</b> of this disease at an early stage is difficult because of non-specific clinical symptoms and neuroradiological findings. Most reported IVL cases are diagnosed at post-mortem following autopsy. We report the case of a patient who presented with status epilepticus (SE) as the initial manifestation of IVL. Despite the administration of anti-convulsant agents and general care the patient’s condition deteriorated rapidly after admission, culminating in death due to respiratory failure and heart failure 21 days after the onset of symptoms. Post-mortem examination revealed IVL in the brain and multiple organs. Epileptic seizures often appear during the clinical course of IVL; however, they occur most frequently at advanced stages. Diagnosis of IVL that first presents with SE is of clinical importance because the treatment and prognosis of acute SE arising from IVL are different from those of SE originating from other causes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Urothelial bladder {{carcinoma}} (UBC) is heteroge-neous in its pathology {{and clinical}} behaviour. Evaluation of prognostic and predictive biomarkers is necessary, {{in order to}} produce personalised treatment options. The present study used immunohistochemistry to evaluate UBC sections containing tumour and non-tumour areas from 76 patients, for the detec-tion of p-mTOR, CD 31 and D 2 - 40 (blood and lymphatic <b>vessels</b> <b>identification,</b> respectively). Of the non-tumour and tumour sections, 36 and 20 % were scored positive for p-mTOR expression, respectively. Immunoexpression was observed in umbrella cells from non-tumour urothelium, in all cell layers from non-muscle-invasive (NMI) tumours (including expression in superficial cells), and in spots of cells from muscle-invasive (MI) tumours. Positive expression decreased from non-tumour to tumour urothelium, and from pT 1 /pTis to pT 3 /pT 4 tumours; however, the few pT 3 /pT 4 positive cases had worse survival rates, with 5 -year disease-free survival being significantly lower. Angiogenesis occurrence was impaired in pT 3 /pT 4 tumours that did not express p-mTOR. In conclusion, p-mTOR expression in non-tumour umbrella cells is likely a reflection of their metabolic plasticity, and extension to the inner layers of the urothelium in NMI tumours is consistent with an enhanced malignant potential. The expression in cell spots in a few MI tumours and absence of expression in the remaining tumours is intriguing and requires further research. Additional studies regarding the up- and downstream effectors of the mTOR pathway should be conducted...|$|R

40|$|Background: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is a {{progressive}} autoimmune disease {{with a wide}} range of morphological and functional changes in microscopic examination of small blood <b>vessels.</b> <b>Identification</b> of vascular diseases at early stage, plays an essential role in the prevention of its’ vascular complications. Nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) is a non-invasive, easy, painless, and accurate method for evaluation of microcirculation and could be used for this purpose. The vast majority of studies on capillaroscopy in lupus patients have shown that changes are not specified to lupus –unlike Systemic Sclerosis- and are more likely to overlap with other diseases. Therefore, it was decided to check capillaroscopic changes and evaluate morphological changes and capillary structure in terms of quality and quantity in lupus patients. M aterials and Methods: Nail fold capillaroscopic findings of 114 patients aged 19 - 75 years old were reviewed in this study. The results were categorized as: a) normal, b) non-specific morphological abnormalities, and c) Scleroderma-like pattern.   Results were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using SPSS 21 software. "Chi square" test was used to analyze the relationships between variables (P< 0. 05 was considered significant). Results : Our results show that Lupus –independent of any other microvascular risk factor can significantly affect the morphology and structure of blood circulation and these changes are shown with detail by nail fold capillaroscopy. C onclusion: Most of the findings are in line with similar studies performed by other investigators in this field. However, no specific pattern was recognized and microbleeding was higher in our patients with scleroderma-like pattern of involvement. </p...|$|R

The Red and Blue ensigns with the Great Seal of Newfoundland in the fly were used officially from 1904 until 1965, with the Red Ensign being flown as civil ensign by merchant shipping, and the Blue being flown by governmental ships (after the British tradition of having different flags for merchant/naval and government <b>vessel</b> <b>identification).</b>|$|E
