5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate <b>vertically</b> <b>downwards.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-1990s, the {{popularity}} of Doom led to many shareware [...] "Doom clones", with Radix {{being one of the}} few first person shooters which takes place in a zero gravity environment and where the player controls a ship rather than a human. In some sense, Radix is superficially similar to Descent. However while Descent had full 3D maps with six degrees of motion, Radix uses the earlier 2.5D map designs of Doom clones. These are characterized by flat levels with no rooms over rooms, albeit with slopes of various degrees. Despite being a spacecraft, freedom of motion is limited - it is impossible to turn fully <b>vertically</b> upwards or <b>downwards,</b> nor fly upside down.|$|R
25|$|Almost {{all of the}} {{underground}} mines re-worked lodes {{that had already been}} mined from the surface. Because of the great quantity of underground water, it was necessary to dig horizontal adits into the hillsides to de-water the mines. Dartmoor's topography, cut with deep valleys, helped there and in many cases it was possible to dig to a reasonable depth without the need to pump out water. These adits connected with shafts that were either sunk <b>vertically</b> <b>downwards</b> or followed the line of the steeply dipping lode. Working the lode then took place by stoping from the horizontal levels in the usual manner.|$|E
25|$|The geology of the site, {{a former}} farmer's field on a slight slope, {{with a heavy}} clay soil that is subject to {{seasonal}} movements when wet, meant that substantial foundations and drainage had to be constructed. The main support for the above ground structures consists of 210 concrete piles extending <b>vertically</b> <b>downwards</b> into the soil, each up to 7 metres deep. These pilings were engineered in June 2009 by a specialist company, Wig-Palen, from Belgium, using a 62-ton machine to drill and compact the required holes. Concrete was then poured into the hollow drill {{to fill the void}} as the drill was extracted, and steel reinforcement cages were then placed into the still-wet concrete. This screw-piling technique ensured that the cemetery foundations were both end-bearing and friction-bearing in nature, increasing the stability of the pilings and the structures they support.|$|E
25|$|Super Speed Water Slides: These two water slides, {{also known}} as Geronimo Falls, were set {{slightly}} {{apart from the rest}} of the park and took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost <b>vertically</b> <b>downwards</b> and was covered with screening for the first several feet. As barriers on the side of the slides were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at their side as they descended, since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury. Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water—which made a large splash—and then a small pool. Only one of these slides remains today, however the track was replaced with one that was not as steep. The tracks the old slides followed are still visible. Today it is known as the H-2-Oh-No. Vertigo and Vortex, two adjacent enclosed tube slides still use the same end splash pool that 2 of the other old speed slides used.|$|E

Other fields along the same fault zone include the Beverly Hills Oil Field to the north, and the Long Beach Oil Field to the south. [...] The Baldwin Hills region is complexly faulted, with the primary Newport-Inglewood Fault on the northeast, another parallel fault to the southwest, a structural block between them offset <b>downwards</b> <b>vertically</b> (a graben), and the entire region criss-crossed by even smaller faults perpendicular to the main Newport-Inglewood zone.|$|R

The results showed that airflow direction {{has an impact on}} perceived discomfort due to draught. At 20 o C and 23 o C, airflow from below was perceived as most uncomfortable followed by airflows towards the back and front. At 26 o C airflow from above and towards the back caused most dissatisfaction due to draught, but generally {{only a few of the}} subjects perceived discomfort at this temperature. Discomfort due to draught was most often felt at the body regions directly exposed to the airflow. These were the legs, the feet, and the lower back at airflow from below; the neck, the shoulders and the hands at airflow from above; the neck, the back, the shoulders and the legs at airflow from behind; the knee and the arm facing the windbox when exposed to air movements directed towards the side; and the hands and the knees when exposed to air movements towards the front...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{possible}} mass {{effect on the}} steric course of nucleophilic attack on three analogues of 4 -tert-butylcyclohexylidene has been undertaken. 1 HNMR analyses {{have been used to}} determine the ratios of the trans isomers over the cis ones resulting from axial and equatorial attack of the nucleophile. The preference for axial attack is largest for the heavier brominated indandione substituent and least for the non-halogenated one. Computer simulation studies of our molecular structures were also carried out. Using PCMODEL executed on a Sun Workstation and run on Windows®, the cis and trans structures were optimized by energy minimization procedures in the program. For the minimized structures, {{it was found that the}} cis structures have higher energy values than the corresponding trans isomers. The latter is favored by further separation of the tert-butyl groups and the indandione substituent. A pyramidalization experiment was also performed using this program. This was done by displacing the 4 -tert-butylcyclohexylidene portion <b>vertically</b> upwards and <b>downwards</b> by 0. 1 A and then calculating the energies of the structures without minimization. It was found from this study, that the energies of the molecules distorted upwards to 0. 4 A have lower energies compared to similar molecular structures distorted downwards...|$|R

40|$|Gentrification {{has been}} seen to be a {{predominantly}} urban process, characterised by wholesale replacement of working class communities by a mobile middle-class population (Glass, 1964). More recently, contributions have acknowledged that gentrification is taking place further down the hierarchy of urban settlements with Neil Smith (2002) noting that gentrification is expanding both <b>vertically,</b> upwards and <b>downwards</b> through the settlement hierarchy (from cities to provincial cities, Dutton 2003; 2005 to smaller towns) and horizontally across the globe. English market towns, this thesis argues, {{have become part of}} what Hackworth and Smith (2001) term the third wave of gentrification with the state ‘entangled’ in the process of gentrification. This can be seen through the encouragement of regeneration in market towns, initiated through the 2001 Market Towns Initiative (MTI) that sought to regenerate ailing market towns within England. The service role of these rural towns {{has been seen}} as crucial to anchoring key services that service the wider rural hinterlands in which market towns serve (Powe and Shaw, 2004) The central argument of this thesis is that market towns are now at the leading edge of rural restructuring. Many types of market town gentrifier have been identified, specifically mature, ‘geriatrifiers’ who reside in the remote market towns and had past service class working lives via professional and managerial employment and secondly, professional/managerial gentrifiers, identified previously in rural villages (Phillips, 1993) who were using market towns as bases to commute and raise a family. Unlike previous narrative concerning gentrification, this middle class incursion was physically reflected through new build developments that have been targeted at market towns.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{training}} systems on canopy microclimate, leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, vigour, yield and wine quality were studied in two trials, that {{were set up}} at Lisbon, with the white variety "Fernao Pires" (1989 - 1992), and at Bairrada region with the red variety "Agua Santa" (1991 - 1992). The influences of the pruning system (Guyot vs Royat), trunk height(45 vs 85 cm), shoot positioning and irrigation were studied on "Fernao Pires" variety. The very dry summers caused a natural water stress which induced premature leaf senescence and low photosynthetic rates that negatively affected berry sugar accumulation and caused a progressive reduction in the pruning weight. the <b>vertically</b> upwards and <b>downwards</b> shoot positioning induced a higher fruitfulness but caused an excessive cluster exposure. During the ripening period, leaf water potential was more adverse on the Royat than Guyot systems but {{did not affect the}} photosynthetic rate of exposed leaves. Generally, the pruning system did not affect yield and wine quality but the Royat systems showed a positive effect on vigour. Trunk height showed a negative effect on wine alcohol content and pH in some cases. The irrigation affected positively grapevine physiology, growth and yield without changing wine quality. In the experiment located at Bairrada, the traditional system - single curtain trained vertically upwards - was compared with the lyre system (divide canopy). The Lyre system showed lower shoot and leaf densities per curtain. The canopy microclimate was improved on Lyre as showed by the larger exposed surface leaf area and lower radiation attenuation inside the canopy. During the ripening period, Lyre induced a mild stress that reduced the photosynthetic rate and lateral growth.
