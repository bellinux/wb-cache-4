40|$|Background: Emotion dysregulation {{is central}} to the {{clinical}} conceptualization of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), with individuals often displaying instability in mood and intense feelings of negative affect. Although existing data suggest important neural and behavioral differences in the emotion processing of individuals with BPD, studies thus far have only explored reactions to overt emotional information. Therefore, it is unclear if BPD-related emotional hypersensitivity extends to stimuli presented below the level of conscious awareness (preattentively). Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure neural responses to happy, angry, fearful, and neutral faces presented preattentively, using a backward masked affect paradigm. Given their tendency toward emotional hyperreactivity and altered amygdala and frontal activation, we hypothesized that individuals with BPD would demonstrate a distinct pattern of fMRI responses relative to those without BPD during the <b>viewing</b> of <b>masked</b> affective versus neutral faces in specific regions of interest (ROIs). Results: Results indicated that individuals with BPD demonstrated increases in frontal, cingulate and amygdalar activation represented by number of voxels activated and demonstrated a different pattern of activity within the ROIs relative to those without BPD while <b>viewing</b> <b>masked</b> affective versus neutral faces. Conclusions: These findings suggest that in addition to the previously documented heightened responses to overt displays of emotion, individuals with BPD also demonstrate differential responses to positive and negative emotions, early in the processing stream, even before conscious awareness...|$|R

40|$|International audienceInfants have a {{sophisticated}} behavioral and cognitive repertoire suggestive of {{a capacity for}} conscious reflection. Yet, demonstrating conscious access in infants remains challenging, mainly because they cannot report their thoughts. Here, to circumvent this problem, we studied whether an electrophysiological signature of consciousness found in adults, corresponding to a late nonlinear cortical response [~ 300 milliseconds (ms) ] to brief pictures, already exists in infants. We recorded event-related potentials while 5 -, 12 -, and 15 -month-old infants (N = 80) <b>viewed</b> <b>masked</b> faces at various levels of visibility. In all age groups, we found a late slow wave showing a nonlinear profile at the expected perceptual thresholds. However, this late component shifted from a weak and delayed response in 5 -month-olds (starting around 900 ms) to a more sustained and faster response in older infants (around 750 ms). These results reveal that the brain mechanisms underlying the threshold for conscious perception are already present in infancy but undergo a slow acceleration during development...|$|R

40|$|Neuroimaging {{studies have}} shown {{differential}} amygdala responses to masked (“unseen”) emotional stimuli. How visual signals related to such unseen stimuli access the amygdala is unknown. A possible pathway, involving the superior colliculus and pulvinar, is suggested by observations of patients with striate cortex lesions who show preserved abilities to localize and discriminate visual stimuli that are not consciously perceived (“blindsight”). We used measures of right amygdala neural activity acquired from volunteer subjects <b>viewing</b> <b>masked</b> fear-conditioned faces {{to determine whether a}} colliculo-pulvinar pathway was engaged during processing of these unseen target stimuli. Increased connectivity between right amygdala, pulvinar, and superior colliculus was evident when fear-conditioned faces were unseen rather than seen. Right amygdala connectivity with fusiform and orbitofrontal cortices decreased in the same condition. By contrast, the left amygdala, whose activity did not discriminate seen and unseen fear-conditioned targets, showed no masking-dependent changes in connectivity with superior colliculus or pulvinar. These results suggest that a subcortical pathway to the right amygdala, via midbrain and thalamus, provides a route for processing behaviorally relevant unseen visual events in parallel to a cortical route necessary for conscious identification...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of conscious visual perception {{is assumed to}} ignite late (∼ 250 ms) gamma-band oscillations shortly after an initial (∼ 100 ms) forward sweep of neural sensory (nonconscious) information. However, this neural evidence is not utterly congruent with rich behavioral data which rather point to piecemeal (i. e., graded) perceptual processing. To address the unexplored neural mechanisms of piecemeal ignition of conscious perception, hierarchical script sensitivity of the putative visual word form area (VWFA) was exploited to signal null (i. e., sensory), partial (i. e., letter-level), and full (i. e., word-level) conscious perception. Two magnetoencephalography experiments were conducted in which healthy human participants <b>viewed</b> <b>masked</b> words (Experiment I: active task, Dutch words; Experiment II: passive task, Hebrew words) while high-frequency (broadband gamma) brain activity was measured. Findings revealed that piecemeal conscious perception did not ignite a linear piecemeal increase in oscillations. Instead, whereas late (∼ 250 ms) gamma-band oscillations signaled full conscious perception (i. e., word-level), partial conscious perception (i. e., letter-level) was signaled via the inhibition of the early (∼ 100 ms) forward sweep. This inhibition regulates the downstream broadcast to filter out irrelevant (i. e., masks) information. The findings thus highlight a local (VWFA) gatekeeping mechanism for conscious perception, operating by filtering out and in selective percepts...|$|R

It focuses {{on the work of}} Canadian political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon, whose model of environmental conflict achieved considerable prominence in U. S. foreign policy circles in the 1990 s. The thesis argues that this success was due in part to widely shared neo-Malthusian assumptions about the Third World, and to the support of private foundations and policymakers with a strategic interest in promoting these views. It analyzes how population control became an important feature of American foreign policy and environmentalism in the post-World War Two period.

Objective: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) {{is characterized by}} emotion dysregulation, which underlies symptoms such as suicidality and impulsivity. Neuroimaging provides a method for probing the biological basis of emotion dysregulation. We examined neural activation and connectivity in individuals with BPD and healthy controls (HCs) during nonconscious and conscious emotion processing. Methods: 21 unmedicated individuals with BPD and 10 healthy controls (HCs) completed an fMRI task <b>viewing</b> <b>masked</b> and unmasked happy and fearful faces. Whole brain and region of interest (ROI) analyses examined between group differences in activation. Differences in amygdala connectivity were assessed using psychophysiological interactions (PPI). Results: During unmasked emotion processing, whole-brain and ROI analyses reveal greater activation in the amygdala and hippocampus and PPI analyses show greater connectivity between the amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) in participants with BPD. In HCs, greater connectivity {{was found between the}} amygdala and areas of the prefrontal cortex. During masked emotion processing, HCs show greater activation in frontal and temporal regions and greater connectivity between the amygdala and temporal regions. Conclusion: Results find altered frontal-limbic activation and connectivity in individuals with BPD relative to HCs, varying depending on whether the emotional stimulus is consciously or nonconsciously perceived. This suggests that there may be more than one neural pathway underlying emotion dysregulation in BPD...|$|R

30|$|Part of our {{interest}} in hyper-realistic masks stems from their use in security settings. At first sight, {{it is difficult to}} credit that a person wearing a full mask could board a plane unchallenged. How are we to make sense of such incidents? Do they reflect inattention {{on the part of the}} observer, or perhaps an unwillingness to confront the mask wearer? Or could it be that, in these situations, hyper-realistic masks are indistinguishable from real faces? In our experiments, almost no one reported noticing the mask, despite attending to the mask and answering several questions about its appearance. This was true for photographic images presented onscreen. It was also true for live confederates presented outdoors. The numbers are sobering. Of the 280 participants who <b>viewed</b> hyper-realistic <b>masks</b> in these studies (60 in Experiment 1; 60 in Experiment 2; 160 in Experiment 3), only two spontaneously reported the mask and only three more reported the mask following further prompting. Interestingly, all five of these participants <b>viewed</b> the <b>mask</b> live (Experiment 3) and at the closer viewing distance of 5  m. These are low detection rates. Evidently, the information available even in near-distance, live viewing (visual detail, 3 D form, motion) did not allow viewers to distinguish hyper-realistic masks from real faces with any generality. Nevertheless, the clustering of these few participants by viewing condition suggests that the available information may have some diagnostic value, above and beyond that which is available at longer viewing distances or in photographic presentations.|$|R
40|$|Context: Vigilance for {{threat is}} a key feature of {{generalized}} anxiety disorder (GAD). The amygdala and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex constitute a neural circuit {{that is responsible for}} detection of threats. Disturbed interactions between these structures may underlie pediatric anxiety. To date, no study has selectively examined responses to briefly presented threats in GAD or in pediatric anxiety. Objective: To investigate amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation during processing of briefly presented threats in pediatric GAD. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Government clinical research institute. Participants: Youth volunteers, 17 with GAD and 12 without a psychiatric diagnosis. Main Outcome Measures: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure blood oxygenation level-dependent signal. During imaging, subjects performed an attention-orienting task with rapidly presented (17 milliseconds) masked emotional (angry or happy) and neutral faces. Results: When <b>viewing</b> <b>masked</b> angry faces, youth with GAD relative to comparison subjects showed greater right amygdala activation that positively correlated with anxiety disorder severity. Moreover, in a functional connectivity (psychophysiological interaction) analysis, the right amygdala and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex showed strong negative coupling specifically to masked angry faces. This negative coupling tended to be weaker in youth with GAD than in comparison subjects. Conclusions: Youth with GAD have hyperactivation of the amygdala to briefly presented masked threats. The presence of threat-related negative connectivity between the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the amygdala suggests that the prefrontal cortex modulates the amygdala response to threat. In pediatric GAD, amygdala hyperresponse occurs {{in the absence of a}} compensatory increase in modulation by the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex...|$|R
40|$|In {{participants}} with {{major depressive disorder}} who are trained to upregulate their amygdalar hemodynamic responses during positive autobiographical memory recall with real-time {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) training, depressive symptoms diminish. This study tested whether amygdalar rtfMRI-nf also changes emotional processing of positive and negative stimuli in a variety of behavioral and imaging tasks. Patients with major depressive disorder completed two rtfMRI-nf sessions (18 received amygdalar rtfMRI-nf, 16 received control parietal rtfMRI-nf). One week before and following rtfMRI-nf training, participants performed tasks measuring responses to emotionally valenced stimuli including a backward-masking task, which measures the amygdalar hemodynamic response to emotional faces presented for traditionally subliminal duration and followed by a mask, and the Emotional Test Battery in which reaction times and performance accuracy are measured during tasks involving emotional faces and words. During the backward-masking task, amygdalar responses increased while <b>viewing</b> <b>masked</b> happy faces but decreased to masked sad faces in the experimental versus control group following rtfMRI-nf. During the Emotional Test Battery, reaction times decreased to identification of positive faces and during self-identification with positive words and vigilance scores increased to positive faces and decreased to negative faces during the faces dot-probe task in the experimental versus control group following rtfMRI-nf. rtfMRI-nf training to increase the amygdalar hemodynamic response to positive memories was associated with changes in amygdalar responses to happy and sad faces and improved processing of positive stimuli during performance of the Emotional Test Battery. These results may suggest that amygdalar rtfMRI-nf training alters responses to emotional stimuli {{in a manner similar to}} antidepressant pharmacotherapy...|$|R

An asymmetric effect is shown where the increase of luminance also increases fixation durations (Walshe & Nuthmann, 2014). However, the change in factors affecting top-down processing, such as blurring or phase noise, increases fixation durations when used to degrade a scene and decreases fixation durations when used to enhance a scene (Henderson, Olejarczyk, Luke & Schmidt, 2014; Einhäuser et al., 2006).|$|R

40|$|Adenomatous polyps are {{the leading}} cause of {{colorectal}} cancer, the third most lethal cancer in the world. Colonoscopy procedures {{are the leading}} method for diagnosis of polyps and the prevention of colorectal cancer. However, rates of polyp detection in colonoscopy are sub-optimal. Why might practitioners be missing polyps? Visual search literature suggests that memory for which areas of the image have been searched previously is at best imperfect, perhaps leading to incomplete inspections. I conducted an experiment in which novices attempted to detect polyps in images taken from real colonoscopies (images were divided into nine equally sized sections). Participants viewed either the entire image at once (free viewing) or saw the image one section at a time (<b>masked</b> <b>viewing).</b> It was hypothesised that students in the <b>masked</b> <b>viewing</b> condition would not need to rely on imperfect memory of their search to guide their gaze, and would hence scan the image more efficiently. This was predicted to result in greater accuracy in detecting polyps. Furthermore, differential performance was expected for items without a circular structure and the most difficult items based on previous research. 96 novices in polyp detection viewed a series of 50 test items, and rates of polyp detection were collected in line with Signal Detection Theory. Results did not support the hypotheses. Participants in the <b>masked</b> <b>viewing</b> condition were not significantly different from participants who viewed the full images in terms of polyp detection rates overall items, non circular items, or the most difficult items. Possibly, novices were unable to discriminate a target from noise even if they visualised it, leading to the observed pattern of results. These findings suggest limited efficacy in enhancing search strategies to be more comprehensive for training novices in polyp detection, but results would need to be replicated in a sample of experienced colonoscopists to suggest that an intervention for experts would be similarly ineffective...|$|R
