Adolescents (N = 389; 50. 4 % males) ages 12 – 14 completed measures of gratitude (moral affect and life-orientation), protective factors (e. g., academic and activity engagement, family relationship), and high-risk behaviors (e. g., sexual attitudes and behaviors, drug/alcohol use). Results indicated greater moral affect gratitude was the only <b>variable</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> with greater academic interest, better academic performance, and more extra-curricular activity engagement.

Data were collected in 1990 and 1993, and represent residents drawn from 268 facilities in 10 states. In the 1993 cohort activities of daily living (ADL) scores, cognitive performance scale (CPS) scores, age, taking antipsychotic medications, a history of falls, and mobility problems were resident-level <b>variables</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> with the use of restraints.

One hundred and forty-two patients out of 323 that underwent autologous transplantation for lymphoproliferative disorders were studied. The risk factors that were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analysis included: gender, sex, age, diagnosis, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy prior to conditioning regimen, disease status at peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) and type of harvest. Three patients developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (sMDS/AML) and three patients developed solid neoplasia. By univariate analysis diagnosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia and use of fludarabine and monoclonal antibodies were the only <b>variables</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> with the development of sMDS/AML. By multivariate analysis, the variables associated with sMDS/AML were the use of fludarabine and disease status at PBSCT. By univariate analysis, we found that radiotherapy and the use of monoclonal antibodies were <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> with the development of secondary solid neoplasia. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the only two <b>variables</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> with new cancers were radiotherapy and prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies. We report the lowest incidence of sMDS/AML after autologous stem-cell transplantation for lymphoproliferative malignancies. Major reasons could be ascribed to the stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria used to establish the real incidence of sMDS/AML because of chemo-radiotherapy used before transplant procedure. The low incidence of secondary solid tumors could be caused by the absence of total body irradiation as part of the conditioning regimen or the short follow-up...|$|R

The definitive CCRT consisted of a median dose of 54 Gy (range: 40. 0 - 68. 4 Gy) and two cycles of concurrent administration of mostly 5 -fluorouracil + cisplatinum. High expression of EGFR, VEGF, and COX- 2 was found in 79. 5 %, 31. 8 %, and 38. 6 %, respectively.
