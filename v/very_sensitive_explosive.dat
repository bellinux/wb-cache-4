50|$|Sodium {{hypochlorite}} and ammonia {{react to}} form a number of products, depending on the temperature, concentration, {{and how they are}} mixed. The main reaction is chlorination of ammonia, first giving chloramine (NH2Cl), then dichloramine (NHCl2) and finally nitrogen trichloride (NCl3). These materials are very irritating to the eyes and lungs and are toxic above certain concentrations; nitrogen trichloride is also a <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Inorganic ozonides {{are formed}} by burning potassium, rubidium, or caesium in ozone, or by {{treating}} the alkali metal hydroxide with ozone; if potassium is left undisturbed in air for years it accumulates a covering of superoxide and ozonide. They are <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosives</b> {{that have to}} be handled at low temperatures in an atmosphere consisting of an inert gas. Lithium and sodium ozonide are extremely unstable and must be prepared by low-temperature ion exchange starting from CsO3.

50|$|For optimal penetration, a high {{explosive}} {{with a high}} detonation velocity and pressure is normally chosen. The most common explosive used in high performance anti-armor warheads is HMX (octogen), although never in its pure form, {{as it would be}} too sensitive. It is normally compounded with a few percent of some type of plastic binder, such as in the polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) LX-14, or with another less-sensitive explosive, such as TNT, with which it forms Octol. Other common high-performance explosives are RDX-based compositions, again either as PBXs or mixtures with TNT (to form Composition B and the Cyclotols) or wax (Cyclonites). Some explosives incorporate powdered aluminum to increase their blast and detonation temperature, but this addition generally results in decreased performance of the shaped charge. There has been research into using the <b>very</b> high-performance but <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> CL-20 in shaped-charge warheads, but, at present, due to its sensitivity, this has been {{in the form of the}} PBX composite LX-19 (CL-20 and Estane binder).|$|R
50|$|Less <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosives</b> can be {{initiated}} by smaller quantities of more <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosives,</b> called primers or detonators, such as blasting caps. The use of increasingly less <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> materials {{to create an}} escalating chain reaction is known as an explosive train, initiation sequence, or firing train.|$|R
40|$|Even {{a single}} excess {{electron}} or ion migrating {{on the surface}} of <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosives</b> can catalyze their gradual exothermic decomposition. Mechanisms underlying such a charge-induced gradual thermal decomposition of highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosives</b> can be different. If <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> is a polar liquid, intense charge-dipole attraction between excess surface charges and surrounding explosive molecules can result in repetitive attempts of solvation of these charges by polar explosive molecules. Every attempt of such uncompleted nonequilibrium solvation causes local exothermic decomposition of thermolabile polar molecules accompanied by further thermal jumping unsolvated excess charges to new surface sites. Thus, ionized mobile hot spots emerge on charged explosive surface. Stochastic migration of ionized hot spots on explosive surface causes gradual exothermic decomposition of the whole mass of the polar explosive. The similar gradual charge-catalyzed exothermic decomposition of both polar and nonpolar highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosives</b> can be also caused by intense charge-dipole attacks of surrounding water vapor molecules electrostatically attracted from ambient humid air and strongly accelerated towards charged sites on explosive surfaces. Emission of electrons, photons and heat from ionized hot spots randomly migrating on charged surface of highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> aerosol nanoparticles converts such particles into the form of short-circuited thermionic nanobatteries.

50|$|The {{principle}} {{is most often}} used for detonating insensitive explosive compounds by using stages of less and less <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> compounds. A simple example is the common industrial detonator, where a very small amount of a <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> detonates, causing the less sensitive main charge of the detonator to detonate. It may involve additional steps where successively less sensitive compounds trigger a detonation wave in each other, with stages including various types of booster charges.|$|R

50|$|Pentanitroaniline is an {{explosive}} organic compound. It {{is a relatively}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> (much more so than TNT) {{that can be used}} as a base charge for detonators, although it is uncommon in this application.|$|R
50|$|In {{contact with}} metals (e.g. lead, calcium, iron), {{potassium}} picrate, like ammonium picrate and picric acid, forms picrates of said metals. These {{are often more}} dangerous and more <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosives.</b> Contact with such materials therefore should be prevented.|$|R
50|$|Its {{sensitivity}} {{has limited}} {{the usefulness of}} nitroglycerin as a military <b>explosive,</b> and less <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosives</b> such as TNT, RDX, and HMX have largely replaced it in munitions.

50|$|The {{booster charge}} {{is a highly}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> that will {{activate}} easily when subjected to {{the shock of the}} detonator. Typically, a pea-sized pellet of RDX is used. The purpose of the booster is to amplify the shock of the detonator and initiate the main explosive charge.|$|R
25|$|At room {{temperature}} (20°C (68°F)) the saturated vapour pressure is 50.525 bar, rising up to 72.45bar at —the critical temperature.

40|$|The area {{of highly}} {{conjugated}} organic polymers has commanded interest {{for quite some}} time. Polyacetylene (PA) is the (structurally) simplest conjugated organic polymer; however, its intractable nature has made its characterization quite difficult. The first successful PA film was produced in 1971 by Shirakawa and Ikeda from acetylene monomer and a highly concentrated Ziegler–Natta catalyst. Over the last 30 years, several methods have been introduced which allow for the synthesis of a pre-cursor polymer that can subsequently be transformed into PA. Unfortunately, many of these techniques either involve the extrusion of large molecular fragments that can limit the processing of these polymers or produce <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> and even <b>explosive</b> materials. Therefore, a forgiving and direct route to PA and substituted PA, such as ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), which might lead to new substrates and amenable processing conditions is worth pursuing. The metathesis polymerization of 1, 3, 5, 7 -cyclooctatetraene (COT) has been reported previously, however, the only successful routes to date have focused on early transition metal catalysts (tungsten) which are sensitive to air, moisture, and functional groups. It would be advantageous to use a late transition metal catalyst (ruthenium) which is more tolerant towards air, moisture and functional groups. Unfortunately, the RuCl_ 2 (☐CHPh) (PCy_ 3) _ 2, catalyst 1, {{was not able to}} polymerize COT presumably due to its lower activity. Here, we report the ROMP of COT by a highly active well defined ruthenium olefin metathesis catalyst, RuCl_ 2 (☐CHPh) (PCy_ 3) (IMesH_ 2), catalyst 2, to produce films of polyacetylene (PA) with conductivities comparable to those first produced by Shirakawa...|$|R
50|$|At room {{temperature}} (20 °C (68 °F)) the saturated vapour pressure is 50.525 bar, rising up to 72.45 bar at 36.4 C—the critical temperature.

50|$|Composition B was {{extremely}} common in western nations' munitions {{and was the}} standard explosive filler from early World War II until the early 1950s, when less <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosives</b> such as Composition H6 began to replace it in many weapons systems.

50|$|Each type of {{detonators}} have an instruction/information folder {{written by}} the manufacturer or the distributor. In it are clear {{instructions on how to}} crimp that specific type/model. Most detonators contain relatively <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> compound meant to initiate the staged detonation train. Crimping a detonator in the wrong place or with improper tools may cause it to detonate.|$|R
50|$|HHTDD is a {{powerful}} but moisture <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> compound. It is essentially an open analogue of the cyclic nitroamine cage compounds such as CL-20. While it is highly explosive, with a velocity of detonation even {{higher than that of}} CL-20, HHTDD readily decomposes in the presence of even trace amounts of water, making it unsuitable for any practical applications.|$|R
50|$|When the {{condition}} of the munitions was originally assessed there was concern that copper azide, an extremely <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive,</b> would be produced through reaction between lead azide and copper from fuse components (lead azide would react with water vapour, rather than liquid water, to form hydrazoic acid, which could react with copper in the detonating cap to form copper azide).|$|R

2500|$|TNT can be detonated {{with a high}} {{velocity}} initiator or by efficient concussion. For many years, TNT {{used to be the}} reference point for the Figure of Insensitivity.

5000|$|An {{explosive}} booster is a <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> {{charge that}} acts as a bridge between a (relatively weak) conventional detonator and a low-sensitivity (but typically high-energy) explosive such as TNT. By itself, the initiating detonator would not deliver sufficient energy to set off the low-sensitivity charge. However, it detonates the primary charge (the booster), which then delivers an explosive shockwave that is sufficient to detonate the secondary, main, high-energy charge.|$|R

50|$|Diazomethane is the {{chemical}} compound CH2N2, discovered by German chemist Hans von Pechmann in 1894. It is the simplest diazo compound. In the pure form at room temperature, {{it is an}} extremely <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> yellow gas; thus, it is almost universally used as a solution in diethyl ether.

50|$|Diethyl ether peroxide, {{also known}} as ethylidene peroxide, (-CH(CH3)OO-)n is a {{polymerization}} product of diethyl ether hydroperoxide. It is a colorless oily liquid that is an extremely brisant and friction <b>sensitive</b> <b>explosive</b> material. Amounts of less than 5 milligrams can damage chemical apparatuses. The dangerous properties of ether peroxides are the reason that diethyl ether and other peroxide forming ethers like tetrahydrofuran (THF) or ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (1,2-dimethoxyethane) are avoided in industrial processes.|$|R
