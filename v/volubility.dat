25|$|One {{biography}} describes him {{as having}} nice features including a good complexion, {{and a strong}} distinct voice. He also had an excellent <b>volubility</b> of language, an elegant ease of speech, and a good memory. He was generally open minded, had a great wit, and spoke with authority. Charles claims he was a direct descendant of Jacques de L'Orme, {{one of those who}} worked on the reform of the Custom of Bourbonnais.|$|E
25|$|Emily Stewart {{was well}} known as a hostess for her husband in both Ireland and London and during {{some of his most}} {{important}} diplomatic missions. In later years she was a leader of Regency London high society as one of the Lady Patronesses of Almack's. She is noted in contemporary accounts for her attractiveness, <b>volubility</b> and eccentricities. By all accounts, the two remained devoted to each other to the end, but they had no children. The couple did, however, care for the young Frederick Stewart, while his father, Stewart's half-brother, Charles, was serving in the army.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a portion}} of the scale which {{differed}} from the rest in quality and remained to the last 'under a veil.'...out of these uncouth materials she had to compose her instrument and then to give it flexibility. Her studies to acquire execution must have been tremendous; but the <b>volubility</b> and brilliancy, when acquired, gained a character of their own... There were a breadth, an expressiveness in her roulades, an evenness and solidity in her shake, which imparted to every passage a significance totally beyond the reach of lighter and more spontaneous singers... The best of her audience were held in thrall, without being able to analyze what made up the spell, what produced the effect—as soon as she opened her lips.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{assuming}} the external form of traditional literature, Ion Creangă's interests and creative interventions, Călinescu noted, separated {{him from his}} roots: [...] "peasants do not have [...] entirely cultured gifts.... Too much 'atmosphere', too much dialogic 'humor', too much polychromy {{at the expense of}} linear epic movements. The peasant wants the bare epic and desires the unreal." [...] The commentator passed a similar judgment on the author's use of ancient sayings, concluding that, instead of crystallizing and validating local folklore, the accounts appeal to cultured tastes, having as the generation of comedy and <b>volubility</b> as their main purpose. According to Vianu's assessment Creangă was [...] "a supreme artist" [...] whose use of [...] "typical sayings" [...] attests [...] "a man of the people, but not an anonymous and impersonal sample." [...] These verdicts, directly contradicting Junimist theories, were mirrored by several other 20th century exegetes belonging to distinct schools of thought: Pompiliu Constantinescu, Benjamin Fondane and Ion Negoițescu. Writing {{during the second half of}} the century, critic Nicolae Manolescu passed a similar judgment, believing that Creangă was motivated by a [...] "strictly intellectual sensuousness" [...] and the notion that [...] "pleasure arises from gratuitousness", while Manolescu's colleague Mircea Braga referred to [...] "the great secret of the man who has managed to transfer unaltered the code of popular creativity into the immanence of the cultured one." [...] In Braga's assessment, this synthesis managed [...] "the impossible", but the difficulty of repeating it with each story also resulted in mediocre writings: [...] "from among his few texts, even fewer are located on the relatively highest level of the relative aesthetic hierarchy".|$|E
2500|$|Speech that repeats earlier {{thoughts}} or thought-pictures, or shines {{a different light}} on them somehow, helps to keep both the speaker and the listener focused on the topic, and {{makes it easier for}} all to recall the key points later. [...] "Oral cultures encourage fluency, fulsomeness, <b>volubility.</b> Rhetoricians were to call this [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|The writer Lamartine [...] left a vivid {{description}} of Thiers, {{with whom he}} had dinner at this time: [...] "He spoke first; he spoke last; he hardly listened to the replies; but he spoke with an accuracy, with an audacity, with a fecundity of ideas, that excused his <b>volubility</b> of words from his lips. It was his spirit and heart which spoke....There was enough gunpowder in his nature to explode six governments." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aschenbach {{is greeted}} by the Hotel Manager, who shows him his room with ingratiating <b>volubility.</b> As the other guests {{assemble}} for dinner, Aschenbach watches them pass. His eye is taken by a young Polish boy, Tadzio, in whom he sees unnatural beauty ("Surely the soul of Greece; Lies in that bright perfection; ...Mortal child with more than mortal grace"). Aschenbach {{is aware of the}} fatuousness of his thoughts, but allows himself to indulge in his speculations.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, David Handelman from Rolling Stone said {{the songs are}} [...] "buoyed by the deft interplay of the three voices and a poetic tornado of imagery", featuring [...] "equally far-flung" [...] musical samples on an album that is [...] "littered with bullshit tough-guy bravado, but it's clever and hilarious bullshit". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commended the Dust Brothers' [...] "deft" [...] production and the Beastie Boys' rhymes, which he called [...] "hilarious, vicious, surreal, snotty." [...] Writing for Playboy, Robert Christgau said although it [...] "doesn't jump you the way great rap usually does," [...] "the Beasties and Tone-Loc's Dust Brothers have worked out a sound that sneaks up on you with its stark beats and literal-minded samples, sometimes in a disturbing way". He commended them for [...] "bearing down on the cleverest rhymes in the biz" [...] and wrote, [...] "the Beasties concentrate on tall tales rather than boasting or dissing. In their irresponsible, exemplary way they make fun of drug misuse, racism, assault, and other real vices fools might accuse them of." [...] In a retrospective review, he said the record's [...] "high-speed <b>volubility</b> and riffs from nowhere will amaze and delight you", calling it [...] "an absolutely unpretentious and unsententious affirmation of cultural diversity, of where [...] came from and where they went from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{criticism}} {{directed at}} Levin following You, and Me and the Next War and Ketchup deepened after {{the premiere of}} his third political play, Queen of a Bathtub ("מלכת אמבטיה), produced by the Cameri Theater in April 1970. David Levin directed the controversial play, which made pointed use of vulgarity, and contained provocative sketches such as [...] "The Binding" [...] in which Isaac begs his father Abraham not to hesitate to slaughter him, and [...] "The Courting" [...] which mocks Israeli <b>volubility</b> and arrogance. Perhaps because it was presented {{on the stage of}} an established theater, the play aroused an unprecedented storm of public opinion. Viewers protested and made a disturbance during the performances. The National Religious Party demanded censorship of a song that, in its opinion, profaned the honor of the Bible. The government threatened to withdraw its financial support from the theater. The criticism further addressed the play itself: [...] "a combination of flawed dialogues and ditties attempting to toss salt on our open wounds" [...] (Dr. Haim Gamzu); [...] "This 'theatrash' (mahazevel) makes us all out to be despicable killers, citizens of a militarist, money-grabbing state." [...] (Uri Porat); and [...] "a scene about a reporter, who comes to interview a young widow whose husband died in the trenches, and plays at love with her, only a demonic or infirm mind could devise... it's a malicious abuse of thousands of bereaved parents" [...] (Reuven Yanai). In spite of Levin's objections, the theater's management decided, in the wake of these outraged responses, to close the show after only nineteen performances.|$|E
2500|$|Savage {{first came}} to {{prominence}} as a boy treble in 1735, singing in a revival of Handel's Athalia and in Alcina during the composer's Covent Garden season. The role of Oberto in Alcina was composed with his voice particularly in mind. After his voice had broken, he initially continued his career singing as an alto [...] (countertenor), and later turned into a bass. As a countertenor he performed possibly the small roles of La Fortuna and Childerico in Handel's operas, Giustino (1737) and Faramondo (1738),impresario] [...] Heidegger encountered in casting it. It is certainly no historical precedent; in a similar dilemma Handel would normally have transposed or transferred a castrato part to a female singer". According to Anthony Hicks, however, {{the role of the}} goddess Fortuna was instead his last appearance as a treble, while the minor soprano part of Childerico, which has no arias, was probably sung an octave lower than written, having Savage's voice just broken (articles: Giustino (ii) and Faramondo, in Stanley Sadie (ed), The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, New York, Oxford University Press, 1997, II, pp. 121 e 440–441). and also appeared in the first performance of [...] Israel in Egypt (1739), as well as in revivals of other Handel oratorios. As a bass, he created the title role in Imeneo (1740), the role of Fenice in Deidamia (1741) [...] and that [...] of Manoa at the premiere of the oratorio Samson (1743). The 18th-century musicologist Charles Burney described Savage's voice as a [...] "powerful and not unpleasant bass". The description of his pupil R. J. S. Stevens is more complimentary: he describes Savage as possessing [...] "a pleasant voice of two octaves", and details that Savage sang with [...] "clear articulation, perfect intonation, great <b>volubility</b> of voice, and chaste and good expression".|$|E
6000|$|... "This, briefly, was {{the gist}} of the matter which Robertson related to the {{inspector}} with many repetitions and persistent <b>volubility.</b>|$|E
60|$|He did {{not wait}} for Clyffurde's reply, nor did he appear to notice the latter's obvious coldness of manner, but went prattling on with great <b>volubility.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke with}} feverish <b>volubility,</b> though his throat was parched and every word he uttered caused him pain. But he was {{determined}} that the game should proceed.|$|E
6000|$|This {{and much}} more with the <b>volubility</b> of {{relieved}} feelings. When he stopped, out of breath, Madison said, [...] "I have had a visitor since you left--Mr. McGee." ...|$|E

60|$|Now coming {{close to}} Alanno, we found, that with {{incredible}} <b>volubility,</b> he was addressing the assembly upon some all-absorbing subject connected with King Bello, and his presumed encroachments toward the northwest of Vivenza.|$|E

60|$|And then he bade {{them get}} the fire lit, and stalked out upon his crutch, {{with his hand}} on my shoulder, leaving them in a disarray, and silenced by his <b>volubility</b> rather than convinced.|$|E
60|$|Bob {{spoke with}} a sharp and rather treble <b>volubility,</b> and got through his long speech with {{surprising}} despatch, giving the blade of his knife an affectionate rub on his sleeve when he had finished.|$|E
60|$|But {{perhaps the}} most {{prominent}} feature in her character was her <b>volubility</b> when enraged,--the copiousness of her vocabulary and the tremendous force with which she shot forth her ideas and abuse in short abrupt sentences.|$|E
60|$|Dan uttered {{this with}} immense <b>volubility</b> and assurance, and the {{fishermen}} regarded him with deepening respect, as they awaited the Russian's answer. He replied by a stare and {{a shake of}} the head as before.|$|E
6000|$|Benson paused, half vexed at his <b>volubility,</b> {{and gazed}} keenly at Saxon {{to see if}} she had {{followed}} him. What he saw in her face and eyes satisfied him, and he added, with a short laugh: ...|$|E
60|$|This raving {{discourse}} {{she continued}} with prodigious <b>volubility,</b> walking on {{at a great}} pace, and dragging Ratcliffe along with her, while he endeavoured, in appearance at least, if not in reality, to induce her to moderate her voice.|$|E
60|$|The Russian {{visitors}} {{assembled in}} little knots, conversed amongst themselves meantime, in low murmurs, and with brief glances in our direction. It {{was a great}} contrast to the usual loud <b>volubility</b> of these gatherings. Miss Haldin followed me into the ante-room.|$|E
60|$|Then Nelly went on {{with great}} {{animation}} and <b>volubility</b> to tell of the trapping of the bear, and the snaring of rabbits, and the catching of fish, and of Roy's peculiar method of wading into the lake for ducks, and many other things.|$|E
60|$|There was a pause. Instead of {{responding}} to the invitation of Lady Monmouth to communicate with his usual readiness and <b>volubility,</b> Mr. Rigby was silent, and, {{if it were possible}} to use such an expression with regard to such a gentleman, apparently embarrassed.|$|E
60|$|His slow <b>volubility,</b> the {{sideways}} cranings of his neck, {{the black}} glances {{out of the}} very corners of his eyes, left Captain Whalley unmoved. He looked at the deck with a severe frown. Massy waited for some little time, then began to threaten plaintively.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, no, no!" [...] she answered, with a <b>volubility</b> and vehemence {{that was}} imitated from the French of the Canadas; [...] "no good to tell Saltwater. He much talk and long tongue. Thinks woods all water, {{understand}} not'ing. Tell Arrowhead, and June die." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} Mrs. Mavering had hissed {{out the last}} word she had her arm round her boy's neck and was {{clutching}} him, safe and sound after his peril, to her breast; and between her kissing and crying she repeated her accusals and denunciations with violent <b>volubility.</b>|$|E

60|$|That {{night the}} scene of our camp was indescribably romantic and wild.

60|$|She {{was only}} {{too eager to}} explain, and she did it with so much <b>volubility</b> and at such great length that I, who am good for nothing till I have had my {{cup of coffee in}} the morning, almost perished of an elucidation which the Altrurian bore with the sweetest patience.|$|E
60|$|Jingle {{delivered}} this singular {{summary of}} his prospects in life, with his accustomed <b>volubility,</b> and with various twitches of the countenance to counterfeit smiles.

60|$|Miss Mowcher {{listened to}} these words, which were very slowly and {{distinctly}} spoken, {{with her head}} on one side, and her eye {{in the air as}} if she were still looking for that answer.
