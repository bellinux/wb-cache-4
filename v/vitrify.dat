The Chief, Johnson, and company fight Covenant in the jungle and arrive at a UNSC outpost. Here, Keyes and Lord Hood plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, from {{activating}} a Forerunner artifact uncovered outside the ruins of the city of New Mombasa. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a slipspace portal which he and his followers enter.

Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal. Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine if}} immature bovine oocytes with cumulus cells at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage could be <b>vitrified</b> by aluminum sheets (AS; pieces of sheet-like aluminum foil). Cleavage rates in fertilized oocytes previously <b>vitrified</b> by the AS procedure were higher than those <b>vitrified</b> by a nylon-mesh holder (NM) procedure (89. 3 ± 2. 1 % vs. 65. 0 ± 3. 7 %). Cleaved embryos derived from the AS but not from the NM procedures developed to blastocysts. Furthermore, to investigate the effects of <b>vitrifying</b> GV oocytes on cytoplasmic structure and on the ability to undergo cytoplasmic changes, the intracellular phospholipid membrane (IM) was stained with the lipophilic fluorescent dye, 3, 3 '-dioctadecyloxa-carbocyanine perchlorate. After vitrification by AS, the IM remained intact relative to that of oocytes <b>vitrified</b> by NM. During in vitro maturation, reorganization of the IM was also undamaged in oocytes <b>vitrified</b> by AS before oocyte maturation, and the IM within oocytes <b>vitrified</b> by the NM procedure was evidently impaired. Finally, vitrification (AS) was used for GV oocytes collected using the ovum pick-up method. A bull calf was born after in vitro production and subsequent embryo transfer.

2500|$|In a rare {{manuscript}} from Kashan {{compiled by}} Abulqassim in 1301, {{there is a}} complete description of how faience production was carried out. [...] Frit was made of ten parts of powdered quartz, one part of clay and one part of glaze mixture. The addition of greater amounts of clay made wheel throwing of the faience easier, and allowed {{a better quality of}} work, because otherwise the material had little plasticity. [...] The glaze itself is “formed of a roughly equal mixture of ground quartz and the ashes of desert plants which contain a very high proportion of alkaline salts. [...] These act as a flux and cause the quartz to <b>vitrify</b> at a manageable temperature. [...] The two alone will produce a transparent glaze”. Lane compared this material with the French pâte tender, which was used by potters as recently as the eighteenth century. [...] This body material and the new glaze offered the potter a greater handling and manipulation ability. [...] This allows the potter to improve the quality and appearance of the vessel, including more refined decorative designs and patterns. The result was a substantial variety of products such as bowls of different size and shapes, jugs, incense burners, lamps, candlesticks, trays, tiles and so on. [...] These advantages also allowed greater control of carved decoration, the use of which the Seljuks refined and extended during the twelfth century.|$|E

The fertilisation rate of vitrified-warmed oocytes was significantly lower than that of fresh oocytes (45. 0 ± 12. 6 % vs. 85. 2 ± 6. 8 %, P < 0. 05), and was significantly improved by zona-drilling (85. 4 ± 7. 3 %).

40|$|Background: In {{order to}} assess the {{chromosomal}} status in embryos obtained from <b>vitrified</b> and fresh donated oocytes, preimplantational genetic diagnostic (PGD) was performed after biopsy of one blastomere at day 3. METHODS: A total of 249 oocytes were obtained from 23 oocyte donors, 80 oocytes {{were used in the}} <b>vitrified</b> group and 151 oocytes were used in the fresh group. Nine chromosomes (13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, X and Y) were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in 56 and 121 embryos from <b>vitrified</b> and fresh group respectively. Fertilization, cleavage rate, embryo quality and chromosomal abnormality rate were compared between groups evaluated. Results: <b>Vitrified</b> oocytes showed a survival rate of 97. 5 %. There {{was no significant difference in}} the fertilization rate (82. 7 % and 91. 4 %), Day 2 cleavage rate (90. 3 % and 87. 7 %) or blastocyst formation rate (31. 1 % and 44. 6 %) for the <b>vitrified</b> and fresh groups respectively. Chromosomal abnormality rate (66. 1 % versus 71. 9 %), percentage of abnormal blastocysts (61. 1 % versus 64. 8 %) and percentage of abnormalities for each analyzed chromosome were similar for the <b>vitrified</b> group compared with the control group. Conclusions: The rates of chromosomal abnormalities in embryos from <b>vitrified</b> oocytes are similar to those published previously; and comparable to those observed in embryos from fresh oocytes.

Settings: University teaching hospital. Study Design: A total of 249 women were retrospectively analyzed: 146 fresh day 5 blastocyst (group 1), 57 day 5 <b>vitrified</b> warmed blastocyst (group 2), and 46 <b>vitrified</b> warmed day 6 blastocyst (group 3) transfer cycles. Vitrification was done using solid surface methodology (non immersion protocol). The main outcomes were implantation rates, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rate per embryo transfer. Results: The baseline clinical characteristics were similar among all three groups. The implantation and clinical pregnancy rates following <b>vitrified</b> warmed day 6 blastocyst transfers (20. 9 % and 32. 6 %) were significantly lower as compared to day 5 fresh and <b>vitrified</b> warmed day 5 blastocyst transfers (40. 3 % and 56. 1 %, 36. 3 %, and 52. 6 %).
