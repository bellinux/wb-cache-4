5|$|The {{intermediate}} hippocampus has overlapping characteristics {{with both}} the <b>ventral</b> and dorsal hippocampus. Using anterograde tracing methods, Cenquizca and Swanson (2007) located the moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. This region has the smallest number of place cells. The <b>ventral</b> hippocampus functions in fear conditioning and affective processes. Anagnostaras et al. (2002) showed that alterations to the <b>ventral</b> hippocampus reduced {{the amount of information}} sent to the amygdala by the dorsal and <b>ventral</b> hippocampus, consequently altering fear conditioning in rats.|$|E
5|$|He 111 H-12: Modified {{to carry}} Hs 293A missiles, fitted with FuG 203b Kehl transmitter, and <b>ventral</b> gondola deleted.|$|E
5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 21 dorsal scales rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are {{strongly}} keeled scales, {{except for those}} bordering the <b>ventral</b> scales. These scales seem loosely attached to the skin and lower rows become increasingly wide; those closest to the <b>ventral</b> scales are twice {{as wide as the}} ones along the midline. The <b>ventral</b> scales number 132-150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal plate is single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.|$|E

50|$|Dorsal {{scales in}} 17 rows (in 19 rows behind the head). <b>Ventrals</b> 281. Anal plate divided, twice as broad as the <b>ventrals.</b> Subcaudals 3.|$|R
50|$|A. e. arenicola has 50 {{or fewer}} dorsal blotches. Females have 221 or more <b>ventrals,</b> and males have 212 or more <b>ventrals.</b> The smooth dorsal scales are {{arranged}} in 29 or 31 rows at midbody.|$|R
5|$|Plural: sterna. The {{breastbone}} of a bird. There are two types: i) carinate sterna—appearing in flighted birds, {{in which}} the <b>ventral</b> surface is keel-shaped, which provides ample surface area for attachment of wing muscles used for flight; and ii) ratite sterna—appearing in flightless birds, such as rhea, {{in which the}} <b>ventral</b> surface is flattened.|$|E
5|$|The bird's plumage {{colouration}} is most {{similar to}} the pale-bellied tapaculo. The S. g. morenoi subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo can be differentiated from the Perijá tapaculo by its entirely brown back and nape, and its different calls. Juveniles of this subspecies have a dull <b>ventral</b> plumage, while the Perijá tapaculo has a more yellow plumage. It also resembles the Caracas tapaculo but has a duller <b>ventral</b> colour.|$|E
5|$|The only genus {{that has}} {{retained}} the enlarged <b>ventral</b> scales is the sea kraits, Laticauda, with only five species. These snakes {{are considered to}} be more primitive, as they still spend much of their time on land, where their <b>ventral</b> scales afford them the necessary grip. Laticauda species are also the only sea snakes with internasal scales, i.e., their nostrils are not located dorsally.|$|E
50|$|Dorsally {{dark brown}} or purple-black, with purple gloss. Ventrally pale blackish purple, the <b>ventrals</b> margined behind with livid white. Dorsal scales in 17 rows. <b>Ventrals</b> 133-157; subcaudals 28-39. Total length 19 cm; tail 28 mm.|$|R
50|$|Midbody {{there are}} 21 rows of {{strongly}} keeled dorsal scales, while those bordering the <b>ventrals</b> are either smooth or only weakly keeled. There are 148-160 <b>ventrals,</b> and 32-40 paired subcaudal scales. The anal plate is single.|$|R

5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the presence of a}} premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the <b>ventral</b> part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate <b>ventral</b> squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped <b>ventral</b> margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E
5|$|Areas of the {{hippocampus}} are {{shown to be}} functionally and anatomically distinct. The dorsal hippocampus (DH), <b>ventral</b> hippocampus (VH) and intermediate hippocampus serve different functions, project with differing pathways, and have varying degrees of place cells. The dorsal hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze, lesions in the DH were shown to cause spatial memory impairment while VH lesions did not. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. The dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both the <b>ventral</b> and intermediate hippocampal regions.|$|E
50|$|The dorsal {{scales are}} {{arranged}} in 19 rows at midbody. They are strongly keeled, except {{for the first two}} rows. The first row (adjacent to the <b>ventrals)</b> is smooth, and the second row is weakly keeled. <b>Ventrals</b> 132-142; anal plate divided; subcaudals 51-71, divided.|$|R

5|$|Dorsal {{scales in}} 15 rows; <b>ventral</b> scales 200–231 in males, 198–227 in females; tail short and tapering; subcaudal scales single (undivided), 43–54 in males, 37–55 in females.|$|E
5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the <b>ventral</b> tegmental area, <b>ventral</b> pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E

5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 29–41 rows of dorsal scales. These are {{strongly}} keeled {{except for the}} outermost rows. The <b>ventral</b> scale count is 123–147, the subcaudals 14–38. Females have no more than 24 subcaudals. The anal scale is single.|$|E
5|$|Most Hydrophiinae are {{completely}} aquatic and {{have adapted to}} their environments in many ways, the most characteristic {{of which is a}} paddle-like tail that has improved their swimming ability. To a varying degree, the bodies of many species are laterally compressed, especially in the pelagic species. This has often caused the <b>ventral</b> scales to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. Their lack of <b>ventral</b> scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, but as they live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.|$|E

5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the <b>ventral</b> aorta. The <b>ventral</b> aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the <b>ventral</b> aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E

5|$|The larger scutes {{display a}} pattern of black or yellow lines. The wood turtle's {{plastron}} (<b>ventral</b> shell) is yellowish in color and has dark patches. The posterior margin of the plastron terminates in a V-shaped notch. Although sometimes speckled with yellowish spots, the upper surface of the head is often a dark gray to solid black. The <b>ventral</b> surfaces of the neck, chin, and legs are orange to red with faint yellow stripes along the lower jaw of some individuals.
