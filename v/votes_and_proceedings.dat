40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is an {{introduction}} into {{the basic principles of}} electoral law and instruments of their protection, especially through the judicial power, in the local elections. The right to participate on public affairs is one of the fundamental attributes of the citizens of a democratic state. Its protection through independent and impartial courts is very important. The first chapter sets out rights relating to elections into municipal councils. The second chapter explains the stages of the electoral process, including examples of selected court decisions related to some institutes. The third chapter deals with the protection of public subjective rights in the election judiciary. The protection is provided to political rights of voters, political parties, candidates and elected members of representative bodies. There is a brief mention about the protection that has been previously provided by civilian courts. In accordance with the system of the Judicial Administrative Procedure Code I discuss four particular types of proceedings - proceedings in matters of electoral rolls, proceedings in matters of registration of candidates, proceedings in matters of invalidibity of elections <b>and</b> <b>voting</b> <b>and</b> <b>proceedings</b> concerning termination of the mandate. The third type of procedure, judicial [...] ...|$|R
