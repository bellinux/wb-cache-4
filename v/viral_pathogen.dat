5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One <b>viral</b> <b>pathogen</b> is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E

25|$|Most plant immune {{responses}} involve systemic chemical signals sent {{throughout a}} plant. Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures {{were identified in}} rice (XA21, 1995) and in Arabidopsis (FLS2, 2000). Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors. These include the NBS-LRR class of proteins. When {{a part of a}} plant becomes infected with a microbial or <b>viral</b> <b>pathogen,</b> in case of an incompatible interaction triggered by specific elicitors, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response (HR), in which cells at the site of infection undergo rapid programmed cell death {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease to other parts of the plant. HR has some similarities to animal pyroptosis, such as a requirement of caspase-1-like proteolytic activity of VPEγ, a cysteine protease that regulates cell disassembly during cell death.|$|E

50|$|Venezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} virus is a mosquito-borne <b>viral</b> <b>pathogen</b> that causes Venezuelan {{equine encephalitis}} or encephalomyelitis (VEE).

50|$|Panicum mosaic virus (PMV) is a positive-sense {{single-stranded}} RNA <b>viral</b> <b>pathogen</b> that infects {{plant species}} in the Panicoid tribe of the grass family Poaceae.

The disease most commonly associated with the panicum mosaic virus pathogen is St. Augustine Decline Syndrome, which infects species of turf grass and causes chlorotic mottling. In addition to St. Augustine Decline, panicum mosaic virus is responsible for chlorotic streaking and mild green mosaicking in select cultivars of switchgrass and millet.|$|E

50|$|One {{risk that}} comes with weak strain {{inoculation}} is increased susceptibility to other viral strains and pathogens. Additionally, {{there is a risk}} that the weak strain could mutate into a more virulent strain. Alternatively, the inoculated weak viral disease might cause synergistic effects if another <b>viral</b> <b>pathogen</b> infects the plant. Despite the risks posed by cross-protection of crops using weak strains, the method has proven valuable in the control of several other viruses. Cross-protection appears to be the most promising option in the case of switchgrass {{because of the lack of}} resistance genes for pathogen control.|$|E
50|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus exhibits host tropism for CD4 related immune cells (e.g. T helper cells, macrophages or dendritic cells). These cells express a CD4 receptor, to which HIV can bind, through the gp120 and gp41 proteins on its surface. HIV also requires a second co-receptor along with the CD4-gp120 complex to enter the target cells - either CCR5 or CXCR4. This demonstrates {{an example of how}} cell surface receptors can affect the tropism of a <b>viral</b> <b>pathogen.</b> Since humans are the only organisms that have cells with these receptors, HIV only displays host tropism for humans. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a virus similar to HIV, is capable of infecting primates.|$|E
50|$|There {{exists a}} {{satellite}} virus to panicum mosaic virus. Although {{little is known}} about the satellite panicum mosaic virus, the pathogen is believed to play a role in the infection process because when combined with panicum mosaic virus, the satellite virus causes symptoms to appear earlier in the growing season and results in a more severe infection. Because of the change in disease virulence to the main <b>viral</b> <b>pathogen,</b> panicum mosaic virus and satellite panicum mosaic virus are believed to cause synergistic effects to their hosts. Satellite panicum mosaic virus cannot produce its own replication nor movement proteins, thus it depends entirely on panicum mosaic virus for replication and systemic movement in the host plant.|$|E

40|$|The major {{obstacle}} in combating infectious viral diseases in animals {{is the lack}} of effective vaccines. A large number of <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens</b> are mucosaly transmitted and must cross mucosal barriers to infect the host. The mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts represent the principal portals of entry for most animal <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens.</b> Current inactivated <b>viral</b> vaccines administered by intramuscular injection elicit primarily circulating antibodies. The best defense against these predominantly mucosal <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens</b> would be vaccines capable inducing both systemic and mucosal immunity which is a cost effective disease prevention tool. For most <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens,</b> induction of mucosal immunity appears most appropriate based on the routes of infection. The effectiveness of vaccine delivery to mucosal surfaces including respiratory tract may be most useful for prevention of the upper ways where secretory antibody is most important for protection against viral infection. Most external mucosal surfaces are replete with organized follicles and scattered antigen-reactive or sensitized lymphoid elements, including B cells, T lymphocytes, T cell subsets. plasma cells {{and a variety of other}} cellular elements involved in the induction and maintenance of immune response. Thus, a better understanding of the mucosal immune system is needed before effiective mucosal vaccines can be developed. ...|$|R
50|$|BPMV is the <b>viral</b> <b>pathogen</b> {{that causes}} the disease Bean Pod Mottle in {{soybeans}} and other legumes such as snap peas. BPMV is a species in the plant pathogenic virus family Comoviridae, and genus Comovirus characterized by icosahedral symmetry, non-enveloped, having two single stranded positive-sense RNAs (RNA-1 and RNA-2) separately encapsulated in isomeric particles, and are between 28 and 30 nm in diameter. (Bradshaw, 2007). The virus can overwinter in leaf-feeding beetle vectors (such as the bean leaf beetle), survive in perennial host species, and in virus-infected seed. In the North Central Region, the bean leaf beetle (Cerotoma trifurcate) is the most influential vector, by feeding on infected legumes and transferring virus particles to the next plant it lands on to feed.|$|E

Once a virus is introduced to a new area it can cost growers {{tens of millions of dollars}} to eradicate the <b>viral</b> <b>pathogen.</b> If the blueberry industry is to survive, quality controls will have to become a priority to limit the spread of blueberry viruses, especially those that can be transmitted through vectors.|$|E
