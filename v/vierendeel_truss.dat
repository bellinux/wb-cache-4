500|$|The World Trade Center towers {{included}} many structural engineering innovations in skyscraper design and construction, which allowed the buildings to reach new heights {{and become the}} tallest in the world. Traditionally, skyscrapers used a skeleton of columns distributed throughout the interior to support building loads, with interior columns disrupting the floor space.

50|$|The {{nature of}} a truss allows the {{analysis}} of the structure using a few assumptions and the application of Newton's laws of motion according to the branch of physics known as statics. For purposes of analysis, trusses are assumed to be pin jointed where the straight components meet. This assumption means that members of the truss (chords, verticals and diagonals) will act only in tension or compression. A more complex analysis is required where rigid joints impose significant bending loads upon the elements, as in a <b>Vierendeel</b> <b>truss.</b>|$|E
50|$|At the Salk Institute for Biological Studies (1959-1965) in La Jolla, CA, {{the need}} for {{mechanical}} services (air ducts, pipes, etc.) was so extensive that Kahn decided to create a separate service floor for them above each laboratory floor {{to make it easier}} to reconfigure individual laboratories in the future without disrupting neighboring spaces. He also designed each laboratory floor to be entirely free of internal support columns, making laboratory configuration easier. Komendant engineered the <b>Vierendeel</b> <b>trusses</b> that make this arrangement possible. These pre-stressed concrete trusses are about 62 ft long, spanning the full width of each floor and extending from the bottom of each service floor to the top. They are supported by steel cables embedded in the concrete in a curve similar to that of cables supporting a suspension bridge. Their rectangular openings, which are 6 ft high in the center and 5 ft at the ends, allow maintenance workers to move easily through the thicket of pipes and ducts on the service floors. The trusses impose strictly vertical loads on their support columns, to which they are attached not rigidly but with a system of slip plates and tension cables to permit small movements during moderate earthquakes.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} through analytical calculation, two-dimensional elastic modeling, and three-dimensional plastic modeling, the bearing capacity and failure modes of composite hollow trusses bi-supported with a 15 meter span, varying the number of central Vierendeel panels. The study found the proportion span/ 3 - span/ 3 - span/ 3, as the ideal relationship for the <b>truss</b> - <b>Vierendeel</b> - <b>truss</b> lengths, because by increasing the proportion of the length occupied by the central Vierendeel panels, the new system loses stiffness and no longer supports the load stipulated in the project. Furthermore, they can start presenting excessive vertical displacements and insufficient resistance to external shear forces acting on the panels...|$|R
5000|$|The {{institute}} {{is housed}} in a complex designed by the firm of Louis Kahn. Jack MacAllister, FAIA, of the Kahn firm was the supervising architect and a major design influence on the structure that consists of two symmetric buildings with a stream of water flowing in the middle travertine-paved central plaza that separates the two. In the beginning the buildings were made up {{of different kinds of}} concrete mixes. Kahn wanted {{to see what kind of}} mixture would best work as well as look the best. Each mixture had a different color. In the basement of the complex, there are different colored concrete walls because Kahn was experimenting with the mixtures. Kahn also added teak wood to the complex. Kahn wanted the teak and the concrete to complement each other. The buildings themselves have been designed to promote collaboration, and thus there are no walls separating laboratories on any floor. There is one floor in the basement, and two above it on both sides. The lighting fixtures have been designed to easily slide along rails on the roof, in tune with the collaborative and open philosophy of the Salk Institute's science. Inside the laboratories the ducts and vents are reinforced by concrete <b>Vierendeel</b> <b>trusses</b> supported by post-tensioned columns. The authorities at the time were very cautious due to the fact that they felt these trusses would not be able to hold in case of an earthquake, but in a tour de force of structural design, the engineer was able to achieve twice the ductility that a steel frame could offer. [...] At first Kahn wanted to put a garden in the middle of the two buildings. As construction continued, Kahn did not know what shape it should take. Kahn saw an exhibit of Luis Barragan's work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Kahn invited Baragan to collaborate on the court that separated the two buildings. Barragan told Kahn that he should not add one leaf, nor plant, not one flower, nor dirt. Instead, make it a plaza with a single water feature. The resulting space is considered the most impressive element of the entire design.|$|R

40|$|Luxembourg {{can be read}} as {{a system}} of {{plateaus}} interconnected by large pieces of infrastructure that physically connect them. The edges of the plateaus fullflil a communicating function together with the urban ensembles that occupy the platform. The development of these separate islands has always gone hand in hand with a specific economic ambition and has been instigated by firstly building a bridge (piece of infrastructure) to the new deserted plateau. In this respect we could classify the various plateaus as follows: Ville Haute plateau war economy and fortifications; Garer plateau, second industrial revolution and steel industry; Cents plateau, suburban lifestyle; Kirchberg plateau, service economy and the European Parliament. Within this system of intertwining plateaus there is one plateau that seems underdeveloped in relation to its potential within the current ambitions of Luxembourg to focus on the third industrial revolution. This plateau I call the fifth plateau. The “Fifth Plateau” project imagines a new way to catalyse the urbanization of that empty plateau in Luxembourg Ville. It does so by proposing an architecture of an infrastructural scale {{on the edge of the}} plateau. By doing so the project, firstly participates in the system of communication of between the various plateaus, secondly provides a programmatic fuel injection to instigate future development. The project is proposed as a 500 m long structure that sits on that edge facing the rest of the city. The structure allows for various sections to be hanged from it in accordance to the specific topographic condition. The horizontal surface on top of the <b>Vierendeel</b> <b>trusses</b> functions as a public promenade along the edge and is the address to the various programs below. The program is based on various aspects related to a third industrial revolution and is located in accordance to the opportunities the topography gives. Therefore the data centre is located where the structure enters the ground, where the project bridges a small valley the structure houses the restaurant, convention centre and hotel. The concave slope houses the robotics labs, where the concave slope facilitates the IT laboratories. Finally the soft, almost horizontal slope, closest to the Garer plateau will facilitate maker spaces for public use. The facade is a literal curtain wall that follows the movement of the topography and reflects the various longitudinal sections that facilitate the variety of programmatic elements. The project is a contemporary approach towards the edge condition in Luxembourg by performing as a light weight, flexible structure that moves with and accentuates the topographical condition of the fifth plateau. It proposes an architecture that addresses the newest economic ambition of Luxembourg, namely The Third Industrial Revolution. It sets out to function as the threshold for the further development of the Fifth plateau so that it can play its role as a new chapter within the history of the development of the plateaus in Luxembourg Ville. <br/...|$|R
