5000|$|There {{are several}} methods of comminution. Comminution of solid {{materials}} requires {{different types of}} crushers and mills depending on the feed properties such as hardness at various size ranges and application requirements such as throughput and maintenance. The most common machines for the comminution of coarse feed material are the jaw crusher (1m > P80 > 100 mm), cone crusher (P80 > 20 mm) and hammer crusher. Primary jaw crusher product in intermediate feed particle size ranges (100mm > P80 > 20mm) can be ground in Autogenous or Semi-Autogenous (AG or SAG) mills depending on feed properties and application requirements. For comminution of finer particle size ranges (20mm > P80 > 30 μm) machines like the ball mill, vertical roller mill, hammer mill, roller press or high compression roller mill, <b>vibration</b> <b>mill,</b> jet mill and others are used. For yet finer grind sizes (sometimes referred to as [...] "ultrafine grinding"), specialist mills such as the IsaMillTM are used.|$|E

40|$|Grinding {{belongs to}} the basic {{technological}} operations in the treatment and processing of minerals. The method of the intensive grinding in a liquid environment has become attractive for the preparation of technologically advanced materials of the high fineness. Its choice was motivated by the intensification of dispersion and by the protection of ground powder against oxidation. The result of energy and material interactions among the grinding media and grinding environment is the wear of the grinding media and contamination of the ground material. The hardness of the particles has an important influence on the rate of wear. Particles with hardness {{lower than that of}} the surface of milling tools cause much less wear than harder particles. The wear rate becomes much more sensitive to the ratio of the abrasive hardness Ha to the surface hardness Hs when Ha/Hs <¡­ 1.
