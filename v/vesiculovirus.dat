Substitution of the variant Pro- 123 with Leu had no effect on the fusogenic activity, while substitution of conserved Phe- 125 and Asp- 137 with Tyr and Asn, respectively, shifted the pH optimum of membrane fusion to a more acidic pH value and decreased the fusion efficiency.

40|$|AbstractWhile the {{envelope}} glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) {{is widely used}} for pseudotyping of lentiviral vectors, sub-optimal gene transfer into certain cell types and its sensitivity to inactivation by human complement hinders its broader applications.

However, both novel envelopes were found to be more resistant to inactivation by human serum complement compared to VSV-G. Thus CNV-G and PRV-G envelopes can be harnessed for multiple uses in the future based on the cell type that needs to be gene transduced and possibly for in vivo gene transfer...|$|R

40|$|The matrix (M) protein of {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus inhibits both nuclear import and export.

40|$|International audienceVesiculoviruses enter cells by {{membrane}} fusion, {{driven by}} a large, low-pH-induced, conformational change in the fusion glycoprotein G that involves transition from a trimeric pre-fusion toward a trimeric post-fusion state via monomeric intermediates. Here, we present {{the structure of the}} G fusion protein at intermediate pH for two <b>vesiculoviruses,</b> vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Chandipura virus (CHAV), which is responsible for deadly encephalopathies. First, a CHAV G crystal structure shows two intermediate conformations forming a flat dimer of heterodimers. On virions, electron microscopy (EM) and tomography reveal monomeric spikes similar to one of the crystal conformations. In solution, mass spectrometry shows dimers of G. Finally, mutations at a dimer interface, involving fusion domains associated in an antiparallel manner to form an intermolecular β-sheet, affect G fusion properties. The location of the compensatory mutations restoring fusion activity strongly suggests that this interface is functionally relevant. This work reveals the range of G structural changes and suggests that G monomers can re-associate, through antiparallel interactions between fusion domains, into dimers that play a role at some early stage of the fusion process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{envelope}} glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus induces membrane fusion at acidic pH. A highly conserved amino terminal region spanning residues 123 to 137 {{has previously been}} identified as an internal fusion domain. Here we have substituted specific amino acids within a carboxy terminal region, conserved in five <b>vesiculoviruses</b> encompassing residues 395 to 418, and studied {{the effect of these}} mutations on membrane fusion at acid pH and pH-dependent conformational change. Substitution of conserved Gly 395, Gly 404, Gly 406, Asp 409, and Asp 411 with Glu, Ala, Ala, Asn, and Asn, respectively, decreased the cell–cell fusion efficiency, as well as reduced the pH threshold of membrane fusion. Mutation of Gly 404 and Asp 409 to Lys and Ala, respectively, abolished the fusion activity. Mutant Gly 404 Lys also showed markedly altered resistance to trypsin digestion at acidic pH. These results suggest that the region between amino acids 395 to 418 is important for the fusogenic activity of the G protein. The possible role of this domain in conformational changes involved in fusion activity of VSV G is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{expression}} of two small basic proteins (C and C′) encoded {{by a second}} open reading frame of the New Jersey serotype of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) P gene was reported previously (Spiropoulou and Nichol,J. Virol., 67, 3103 – 3110, 1993). Here {{we found that the}} Indiana serotype virus also expressed C and C′ proteins from this reading frame. We eliminated C and C′ expression by making a single base change that introduced a stop codon in the C and C′ coding sequence, but left the P-protein sequence unchanged. This mutated P gene supported normal replication and packaging of VSV minigenomes encoding G and M proteins. The mutated P gene was also recombined into an infectious clone of VSV that was used to recover virus. The mutant virus no longer expressed the C and C′ proteins but showed growth kinetics identical to wild-type virus. The amounts of viral mRNAs and proteins synthesized were indistinguishable in mutant and wild-type virus infected cells as were the yields and composition of mutant and wild-type virus particles. The kinetics of host protein-synthesis shut-off were also identical for both viruses. Although the C and C′ proteins were dispensable for VSV growth in tissue culture, they are known to be conserved in all <b>vesiculoviruses,</b> and thus perhaps play a role in viral pathogenesis or transmission by insect vectors...|$|R
40|$|The {{glycoprotein}} (G) of {{vesicular stomatitis}} virus (VSV) {{is responsible for}} binding of virus to cells and for mediating virus entry following endocytosis by inducing fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. The fusion peptide of G is internal (residues 116 to 137) and exhibits characteristics {{similar to those of}} other internal fusion peptides, but recent studies have implicated the region adjacent to the transmembrane domain as also being important for G-mediated membrane fusion. Sequence alignment of the membrane-proximal region of G from several different <b>vesiculoviruses</b> revealed that this domain is highly conserved, suggesting that it is important for G function. Mutational analysis was used to show that this region is not essential for G protein oligomerization, transport to the cell surface, or incorporation into virus particles but that it is essential for acid-induced membrane fusion activity and for virus infectivity. Deletion of the 13 membrane-proximal amino acids (N 449 to W 461) dramatically reduced cell-cell fusion activity and reduced virus infectivity approximately 100 -fold, but mutation of conserved aromatic residues (W 457, F 458, and W 461) either singly or together had only modest effects on cell-cell fusion activity; recombinant virus encoding these mutants replicated as efficiently as wild-type (WT) VSV. Insertion of heterologous sequences in the juxtamembrane region completely abolished membrane fusion activity and virus infectivity, as did deletion of residues F 440 to N 449. The insertion mutants showed some changes in pH-dependent conformational changes and in virus binding, which could partially explain the defects in membrane fusion activity, but all the other mutants were similar to WT G with respect to conformational changes and virus binding. These data support the hypothesis that the membrane-proximal domain contributes to G-mediated membrane fusion activity, yet the conserved aromatic residues are not essential for membrane fusion or virus infectivity...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the pathogenic {{potential of the}} <b>vesiculoviruses</b> Isfahan and Chandipura for domestic animals, two ponies, two steers, three sheep, three goats and three pigs were inoculated with each virus intradermally in the tongue or, {{in the case of}} the pigs, in the snout, heel and coronary band. The ponies were also inoculated intradermally in the right commissure of the mouth. Animals inoculated with each virus were housed in one room and allowed to mingle freely with an equal number of uninoculated contact animals of each species. Clinical signs of infection, consisting of ulcers at the inoculation sites, were observed in the Chandipura study in two inoculated ponies, one inoculated steer and one inoculated goat. No elevated temperature was observed. Virus was isolated from the ulcerated tongue tissue, but not from serial blood samples, oesophageal-pharyngeal mucus samples, or from the tissues which were collected at necropsy. Precipitating antibody was not detected by the immunoelectroosmophoresis (IEOP) test in any of the pre- or post-serum samples except from two inoculated sheep at 29 days post-inoculation (D. P. I.). Low levels of neutralizing activity were detected in pre-inoculation serum from all steers, pigs, contact sheep, and one contact goat. By 15 D. P. I. all inoculated animals and contact ponies and steers exhibited increased neutralizing antibody titres. In studies with the Isfahan virus, lesions developed only at the inoculation sites in the two ponies, and the virus was isolated. No virus was isolated from any blood, oesophageal-pharyngeal mucus samples or tissues collected at necropsy. All pre-inoculation sera were negative for neutralizing and precipitating antibodies. By 14 D. P. I. all inoculated animals exhibited neutralizing antibody, while all the contacts remained negative. The IEOP test remained negative for all animals throughout the experiment. A sub-passage of a suspension of Isfahan-infected tongue tissue injected into ponies and steers also yielded only firm swellings of lesser extent than the original reaction at the inoculation sites.

40|$|Outcomes {{for most}} {{patients}} with acute leukemia remain dismal. In-vitro, <b>vesiculovirus</b> members induced rapid apoptosis of acute leukemia cells. Intravenous injection of lymphoblastic leukemia cells infected ex-vivo with attenuated Vesicular Stomatitis Virus or Maraba Virus followed by gamma-irradiation, controlled leukemic progression in murine recipients. Essential properties of this autologous vaccine [immunotherapy by Leukemia-Oncotropic Virus (iLOV) ] and the host’s immune system were characterized. iLOV durability {{was restricted to}} the leukemia used to manufacture the vaccine. At administration, virion cell-entry was required but <b>vesiculovirus</b> lifecycle completion was not essential. Apoptotic or necrotic leukemia cells, with/without co-injection of virus, were ineffective vaccines. Similarly ineffective were leukemia cells activated by, or injected with, Toll-like receptor agonists. Naïve recipients of adoptive splenocyte transfer from vaccine-treated immunocompetent donors were protected from leukemic challenge. Efficacy was notably diminished following matched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation; this correlated with isolated depletion of cytotoxic T-cells. iLOV was ineffective in athymic mice. Taken together, iLOV therapy relies on immediate spaciotemporal interactions between infected-dead/dying leukemia cells and the immune system; this promotes adaptive anti-tumor responses. Clinical translation could target patients in remission to control relapse. 	During the above I discovered that under specific conditions, live <b>vesiculovirus</b> exposed to a precise window of UV fluence reproducibly generates unique “non-replicating rhabdovirus-derived particles” (NRRPs) that maintain cell-entry and cytopathic properties. A gamut of leukemia cells, including multidrug-resistant blasts, underwent rapid NRRPs-induced apoptosis. Normal cell lines and healthy bone marrow mononuclear cells were resistant, in part through interferon-mediated signaling responses. Administering NRRPs intravenously was curative in a murine acute leukemia model, versus uniform disease progression using maximal tolerated dose of replicating virus. Serum levels of an array of immunomodulatory cytokines were significantly elevated after injection of NRRPs. iLOV prepared with NRRPs protected recipients from otherwise lethal leukemia. Intracranial administration of NRRPs proved nonlethal as opposed to neurotoxic live <b>vesiculovirus.</b> Following treatment, neutralizing antibodies were diminished with NRRPs compared to replicating virus.

In the present study, we provide the complete genomic sequences of four isolates from epidemics during 2003 - 2007. These sequences along with the deduced sequence of the prototype isolate of 1965 were analysed using phylogeny, motif search, homology modeling and epitope prediction methods. Comparison with other rhaboviruses was also done for functional extrapolations. All CHPV isolates clustered with the Isfahan virus and maintained several functional motifs of other rhabdoviruses.

Sequence similarities of the translated region of Piry virus with that of other viruses suggest that Piry virus is as distantly related to Chandipura virus {{as it is to}} the vesicular stomatitis viruses of Indiana and New Jersey serotypes. Based on the relative conservation of the amino acid sequence of the nucleocapsid protein of these vesiculoviruses, the N protein can be subdivided into at least three regions, possibly indicative of functional domains. Piry virus, first isolated by R. E. Shope in 1960 from an opossum in Brazil (Taylor, 1967), {{is a member of the}} <b>vesiculovirus</b> genus of the family rhabdoviridae. Serological studies (Cartwright & Brown, 1972) and virus interference studies (Crick & Brown, 1972) suggested that Piry virus was not closely related to any other known members of the <b>vesiculovirus</b> genus. As the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the rhabdoviruses carries antigenic group specificity, sequence comparisons between the Piry virus N protein and those of other distantly related vesiculoviruses may highlight conserved regions essential to this virus group.

40|$|Vesicular {{stomatitis}} is {{an important}} livestock disease endemic in the Americas. This zoonotic viral disease is characterized by vesicles, erosions and ulcers on the mouth, feet and udder. Pain, anorexia and secondary mastitis can cause decreased productivity in all species, and swine infected with some viruses may die. Although vesicular stomatitis is endemic in limited areas of the southeastern United States, these viruses have not caused outbreaks in livestock since the 1970 s. Epidemics in the Southwest are typically caused by newly introduced viruses, which usually disappear after 1 - 2 years. Affected herds are quarantined until the disease has run its course. Vesicular stomatitis closely resembles three vesicular diseases exotic to the U. S. : foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease, and vesicular exanthema of swine. Differentiation of these diseases is important, as a wrong diagnosis could mask the spread of an exotic disease. Prompt diagnosis is also important in containing outbreaks of vesicular stomatitis, which can restrict international trade. Etiology Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) {{is a member of}} the genus <b>Vesiculovirus</b> in the family Rhabdoviridae. The two major serotypes are New Jersey and Indiana. Currently, four viruses are known to cause vesicular stomatitis: vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSV-IN; formerly known as the Indiana 1 subtype of VSV), vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSV-NJ), vesicular stomatitis Alagoas virus (VSV-AV; formerly Indiana 3) and Cocal virus (formerly Indiana 2).

40|$|Abstract: Snakehead fish <b>vesiculovirus</b> (SHVV) is a {{negative}} strand RNA virus which can cause great economic losses in fish culture. To facilitate the study of SHVV-host interactions, the susceptibility of zebrafish embryonic fibroblast cell line (ZF 4) to the SHVV was investigated in this report. The results showed that high amount of viral mRNAs and cRNAs were detected at the 3 h post-infection. However, the expressions of the viral mRNAs and cRNA were decreased dramatically after 6 h post-infection. In addition, the expressions of interferon (IFN) and interferon-induced GTP-binding protein Mx were all up regulated significantly at the late stage of the infection. Meanwhile, the expressions of Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Melanoma OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 6236 differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA 5) were also all up-regulated significantly durin...|$|E
