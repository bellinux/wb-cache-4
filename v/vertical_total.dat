This offers a strobe backlight which can be easily turned on and off by the user. There is no control over the strobe timing or strobe length for the user, although third party utilities have been produced for this purpose. Newer firmware for the BenQ Blur Reduction monitors allow direct user control over the strobe pulse (timing) and strobe length (persistence) directly from the Service Menu. More customization is available by using a higher <b>Vertical</b> <b>Total</b> (from 1498-1502, depending on what does not cause errors), which effectively tricks the Mstar scaler into working with a larger blanking interval, as if the vertical screen size were longer.

The anomalous increase 15 days before the earthquake is significantly larger than the solar-terrestrial background noise, and is thus considered to be probably related to the earthquake...|$|E
