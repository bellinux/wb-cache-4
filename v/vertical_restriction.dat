40|$|In the 1970 s {{motion picture}} studios {{increased}} {{their use of}} blind bidding and non-refundable guarantees {{in an attempt to}} reduce the risks associated with producing a small number of large budget films. However, theater owners claimed that blind bidding and guarantees shifted risk to them and increased the likelihood of bankruptcy, since they were required to bid for the right to exhibit a movie without seeing it first. In response to the lobbying of theater owners, twenty-four states passed laws between 1978 and 1984 that banned blind bidding, while seven states also banned non-refundable guarantees. This paper provides the first empirical analysis of the conflicting claims made by theater owners and movie studios about the impact of these laws on the survival rates of independent theaters, admission prices, and delays in the release of movies. We find that the laws were not only ineffective in keeping theater owners at risk of bankruptcy from exiting the market; they may have been even detrimental to those theater owners converting theaters to multiplexes at that time. blind-bidding, motion picture industry, <b>vertical</b> <b>restriction,</b> state intervention...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>vertical</b> price <b>restrictions</b> like Recommended Retail Prices (RRP) and Resale Price Maintenance (RPM), {{together with}} a retailer’s unit discount when purchasing the good from the manufacturer. We study how retailer’s buyer power affects {{the nature of the}} <b>vertical</b> price <b>restriction</b> occurring in equilibrium. A bit unexpectedly, it emerges that buyer power has got a non—monotonic relation with welfare: when it is either small or very large, welfare is at its lowest level. When buyer power is at an intermediate level, society is better off. The following trade—off explains these results: on the one hand, RPM eliminates double marginalization; on the other hand, to convince the retailer to accept it, a higher unit discount must be given. Our analysis suggests that antitrust authorities should take buyer power into account when assessing welfare effects of <b>vertical</b> price <b>restrictions,</b> and should be open to deal with its non—monotonic relation with welfare.

By eliminating retail price flexibility, RPM facilitates the detection of deviations but reduces profits and increases the short-run gains from a deviation. Overall, RPM can facilitate collusion and it reduces total welfare whenever firms choose to adopt it. Antitrust; Collusion; Resale Price Maintenance; Vertical Restraints...|$|R

It does not critique the identified policy objectives as such, but it does critique the underlying economic principles through which they are interpreted to assess whether the US and EU legal positions on the hardcore restrictions are logically justifiable. As such, two chapters are dedicated to the identification of the objectives of US antitrust policy and EU competition policy, respectively. This is done through analysis of their legal development, and political and historical context. They conclude that the promotion of consumer welfare has become the sole objective of US antitrust policy, but that EU competition policy has retained a multifaceted set of objectives, including the protection of market integration and the promotion of effective competition, as well as the welfare objectives the EU has adopted more recently. The final chapter assesses whether the US and EU legal positions on the hardcore <b>vertical</b> <b>restrictions</b> are logically justified by the policy objectives of each jurisdiction identified in the previous chapters. It considers the development of the legal positions in detail, and goes on to critique the economic analysis of vertical restraints under which the restrictions have been considered. It concludes that the EU justifies its absolute prohibition of both hardcore restrictions under its multifaceted set of competition policy objectives, but that the US can only logically justify its rule of reason for ATP under the sole objective of consumer welfare, while minimum RPM should have continued to be subject to per se illegality.

When these firms win (lose) their own ET case, they experience a statistical significant stock price gain (loss).

40|$|Vertical mergers {{are mostly}} {{perceived}} {{in the literature}} {{as a way of}} reducing production and transaction costs. However, <b>vertical</b> <b>restrictions</b> or raising rivals’ costs (RRC) are taken into great consideration by the antitrust authorities as potential consequences of vertical integration. The case of the French tuna industry seems of particular relevance to look at causes of vertical integration and the implications on competition within the industry. In 1994, a major fishing and transportation company has been taken over {{by a member of the}} French tropical tuna oligopoly. This company was previously supplying fish for all the canneries without earning extra profits. Since the institutional change, trade has been diverted and the company is now making substantial profits. With regard to this case study, one could hardly conclude that one of the oligopolists has developed such a strategy to intentionally raise its rivals’ costs. Efficiency and security of supply still provide a good explanation of the vertical integration decision. Nonetheless, uncertainty has been transferred from a competitor to the others after the acquisition. Whenever a risk of shortage occurs, uncertainty is increasing for the rivals, and the supplying costs too. Beyond the contribution of this case study to the conditions under which RRC strategy is rational for vertical integration decisions, the consequences for the French antitrust policy are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Territorial {{restrictions}} {{long have}} been the subject of intense policy debate. The central issue in this debate has been whether such distribution arrangements are deployed tor efficiency or anticompetitive purposes. The authors add to the debate by broadening the existing conceptualization ot business efficiency and providing evidence of the im-portance of efficiency considerations in the decision to deploy restrictions. In the past, efficiency often has been viewed narrowly, in terms of giving distributors incentives to provide free-rideable services. The authors show that information asymmetry and transaction costs also represent important efficiency-based explanations of territorial restrictions. With regard to anticompetitive concerns, their results show that manufacturers are more likely to use territorial restrictions when they face competition ex ante. Ultimately this may reduce interbrand competition. From a public policy perspective, their pattern of results supports the current rule of reason treatment of territorial re-strictions in the United States. At the same time it questions the current European policy of per se illegality. M arketing decisions are often the focus of regulationand public policy debate. Marketers have a longtradition of informing the public policy discussion in these areas with unique knowledge of current practices, theories, and data. For example, the debates on predatory pricing (Guiltinan and Gundlach 1996), product liability (Morgan 1982; Sheffet 1983), gray market activity (Cross, Stephans, and Benjamin 1990; Duhan and Sheffet 1988), and advertising to children (Goldberg 1990; Pollay et al. 1996; Roedder, Sternthal, and Calder 1983) have all bene-fited from research in marketing.

40|$|The {{requirement}} that an antitrust plaintiff show market power in {{rule of reason}} cases has an uninspiring history and unconvincing justifications. Such a requirement has never been adopted by the Supreme Court, and is currently imposed by only the Seventh and Fourth Circuits. Indeed, the requirement was never imposed very widely, despite frequent claims to the contrary. More significantly, the Seventh Circuit cases that initially established the requirement, and that continue to be cited for it, did so with misleading citations to cases from other circuits. Furthermore, the justifications that have been offered for the requirement have generally been either theoretically valid but unconnected to litigation, or empirically based but both implausible and unsupported. Still, {{the imposition of a}} market power requirement responds to valid concerns about antitrust litigation. Weak cases are brought, and it would be desirable to dismiss them at an early stage, without the expense of a full-blown rule of reason analysis.

40|$|Abstract: The {{geometry}} {{and evolution of}} normal fault terminations were studied in Tithonian limestones exposed on a vertical cliff in the French SE-Basin. The rocks consist of mainly lime-stone layers alternated with thin clayey interlayers. All studied fault zones die out vertically into bed-perpendicular veins striking approximately parallel to the fault. Displacement decreasing to zero towards the fault tip is accommodated horizontally by bed-parallel opening of calcite veins, and vertically by bed-perpendicular localized compaction. The latter mechanism leads the clayey interlayers to be thinned and in places completely pushed out, and enhances pressure solution in bed-parallel seams. The respective thicknesses of the limestone layers and clayey inter-layers, and the ratio between local displacement amount and bed thickness influence the geome-tries of the fault termination and of the steps between slip surfaces. Relatively thick clayey interlayers localize low-angle slip surfaces and may impede the vertical propagation of the slip surface. <b>Vertical</b> fault <b>restriction</b> is also related to thick limestone layers, which are deflected and affected by outer arc extensional fractures, localized pressure solution and dilational jogs con-necting adjacent propagating slip surfaces. However, beds keep their continuity if thicker than the local displacement amount. Where the local displacement {{is larger than the}} layer thickness, lime...|$|R

Tune scan measurements clearly show resonances produced by the lattice magnets and by some of the insertion devices. Touschek scattering depends on the 3 -dimensional electron density and the spins of the colliding particles. In transfer function type experiments these dependencies have been used to observe the effect of resonant transverse and longitudinal beam excitations. Loss monitors allow to detect excited head-tail and higher longitudinal modes which are invisible in the center of mass motion. Another application is the detection of the resonant destruction of the spin polarization of the ensemble of electrons. This is used routinely in order to determine the beam energy with high accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{analysis}} of industrial organization implicitly assumes that firms sell directly to final consumers. However, many firms do not sell directly to the final consumers, but rather use intermediaries, such as wholesalers and retailers to distribute their products. The presence of such intermediaries affects significantly market outcomes. In particular, the contracts between manufacturers and retailers may significantly affect market outcomes, e. g. volumes and prices. Characteristic for these contracts is that they may contain <b>vertical</b> restraints, <b>restrictions</b> on what the retailers may do once they have acquired the products for resell. Another characteristic feature of these contracts {{is that they are}} typically devised by sophisticated contracting parties, who have strategic objectives. The reason for manufacturers, or upstream firms to impose vertical restraints on retailers, or downstream firms is that the actions of the downstream firms affect the upstream firm’s profits. While vertical restraints may affect the profitability of the contracting parties, they may also affect other agents, such as consumers and suppliers. In this dissertation I focus on three distinct aspects of vertical relations. I look at how providers of payment cards affect competition between retailers, through the no surcharge rule; how suppliers can expand their output by financing the establishment of new retailers; and how buyer alliances can extract surplus from suppliers through the use of market share contracts. Common to these essays is the strategic behavior by agents on one level affecting market outcomes at another vertical level...|$|R
