The crescent and star symbolizes progress and bright future respectively.|$|E

Quotation marks are not as often used for direct quotes.

50|$|The base colour is pale grey to dark white, which darker <b>vertical</b> <b>bars</b> {{of varying}} width. There {{seem to be}} two main pattern varieties. The first type {{consists}} of seven <b>vertical</b> <b>bars.</b> These bars are irregular, but more or less ragged on the edges. The bars can be so wide as to make the overall colour virtually black, dark brown or dark maroon. The second type consists of four thin dark <b>vertical</b> <b>bars.</b> This leaves the fish with an overall pale colour. There are always two lines radiating from the eye, a thick one towards the rear, reaching {{the edge of the}} opercle, with a thinner one down but slanted backwards. Often the dividing line is thin and dark.|$|R
25|$|Tone, {{which had}} been {{indicated}} with an iconic line preceding the syllable, was now written one of two ways: with a similar iconic line following the syllable and anchored to a <b>vertical</b> <b>bar</b> (Chao's tone letters), or with more abstract diacritics written over the vowel (acute = high, macron = mid, grave = low), which could be compounded with each other.|$|E
25|$|In some {{situations}} the enemy located a reserve unit {{in line with}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>bar</b> of the 'L' forming a 'T' ambush. After the ambush was sprung, the enemy maneuvered his reserves to block the enemy line of withdrawal. The reserves either close assaulted or set up another ambush along the first linear obstacle to the immediate rear of the kill zone.|$|E
25|$|Up front, all 1958 Oldsmobiles {{received}} one of General Motors' heavily styled front fascias and quad-headlights. Streaking {{back from the}} edge of the headlights was a broad belt consisting of two strips of chrome on regular 88s, three strips on Super 88s, and three strips (top and bottom thin, inside thick) on 98s that ended in a point at mid-body. The bottom of the rear fender featured a thick stamping of a half tube that pointed forward, atop which was a chrome assembly of four horizontal chrome speed-lines that terminated into a <b>vertical</b> <b>bar.</b> The tail of the car featured massive vertical chrome taillight housings. Two chrome stars were fitted to the trunklid.|$|E
40|$|AbstractVisual {{stimulus}} configuration {{can influence}} elementary visual processes. We provide empirical evidence to demonstrate this effect in stereoscopic depth discrimination. Two vertically aligned bars {{were presented in}} stereo such {{that one of them}} was closer to the human observer. Observers discriminated which of the two was closest. In the first, “occluded” condition, a horizontal bar, positioned closest in depth to the observer, was added to the display such that the two <b>vertical</b> <b>bars</b> perceptually completed to form a whole by connecting together behind the horizontal bar. In the second, control condition, the horizontal bar was placed furthest away from the observer such that there was a visible gap between the two <b>vertical</b> <b>bars,</b> which could no longer complete perceptually. We measured observers’ psychometric functions using the method of constant stimuli, and found that their discrimination sensitivity d′ was smaller when the two <b>vertical</b> <b>bars</b> perceptually completed than when they did not. We used a simple model to illustrate that when the two <b>vertical</b> <b>bars</b> perceptually completed, they also tended to be perceived as coplanar in the fronto-parallel plane. This consequence of completion made it more difficult to discriminate any difference in depth between the two <b>vertical</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|R

25|$|A slashed zero {{can be used}} to {{distinguish}} the number from the letter. The digit 0 with a dot in the center seems to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 displays and has continued with some modern computer typefaces such as Andalé Mono, and in some airline reservation systems. One variation uses a short <b>vertical</b> <b>bar</b> instead of the dot. Some fonts designed for use with computers made one of the capital-O–digit-0 pair more rounded and the other more angular (closer to a rectangle). A further distinction is made in falsification-hindering typeface as used on German car number plates by slitting open the digit 0 on the upper right side. Sometimes the digit 0 is used either exclusively, or not at all, to avoid confusion altogether.|$|E
25|$|Dual zone {{climate control}} was a {{standard}} feature across the WH range, as was 12-mode trip computer {{integrated into the}} instrument cluster. Caprice including rear roof mounted climate control and stereo controls for rear passengers- rear passengers were also provided with two headphone jacks in the rear parcel shelf and could listen to a different audio source to the front occupants. A rear flip down table was incorporated into the rear armrest, complete with storage pocket and cup holders. The exclusive-to-Caprice options included standard Howe leather seats, 260-watt 12-speaker DSP audio system, individual ignition key memory (not available in Statesman- stereo settings, seating position) for three drivers, upright Holden crest logo on the bonnet, chrome exterior door handles, as well as heated side view mirrors and auto dipping passenger side view mirror to avoid alloy wheel damage when reversing. Headlights could be set to automatically sense low light levels and turn on without driver input. Caprice featured a fine chrome <b>vertical</b> <b>bar</b> grille, while Statesman used a chrome matrix style front grille design, and lacked chrome exterior door handles.|$|E
25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front hood molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a <b>vertical</b> <b>bar</b> at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic bumper end caps with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo tape player radio and the rear wiper and washer. The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal valve cover of the previous years. A different head gasket was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|E
