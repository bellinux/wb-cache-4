5|$|In 1999, the Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca -color, exact scale {{facsimile}} of Codex Vaticanus. The facsimile reproduces {{the very}} {{form of the}} pages of the original manuscript, complete with the distinctive individual shape of each page, including holes in the <b>vellum.</b> It has an additional Prolegomena volume with gold and silver impressions of 74 pages.|$|E
5|$|Nuskhuri, like Asomtavruli, is {{also often}} highly stylized. Writers readily formed {{ligatures}} and abbreviations for nomina sacra, including diacritics called karagma, which resemble titla. Because writing {{materials such as}} <b>vellum</b> were scarce and therefore precious, abbreviating was a practical measure widespread in manuscripts and hagiography by the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, {{the driver}} of an X43 on the M60 {{motorway}} fell unconscious while the vehicle was moving. Irene King, a 47-year-old passenger, {{was able to take}} over control of the bus to prevent a serious accident. She won several awards for this action, including an award for Outstanding Bravery at the 2006 Pride of Britain Awards, a Vodafone Life Savers Award, a Royal Humane Society Testimonial on <b>Vellum,</b> a Chief Constable's Commendation.|$|E
5|$|The codex is in quarto, and now {{consists}} of 773 <b>vellum</b> folios (630 in the Old Testament and 143 in the New Testament), bound in four volumes (279 + 238 + 118 + 144 folios). Three volumes contain the Septuagint, Greek {{version of the}} Old Testament, with {{the complete loss of}} only ten leaves. The fourth volume contains the New Testament with 31 NT leaves lost. In the fourth volume 1 and 2 Clement are also missing leaves, perhaps 3.|$|E
5|$|The older {{writing was}} first noticed by Pierre Allix, a Protestant pastor. Jean Boivin, {{supervisor}} of the Royal Library, made the first extracts of various readings of the codex (under the notation of Paris 9) to Ludolph Küster, who published Mill's New Testament in 1710. In 1834–1835 potassium ferricyanide was used to bring out faded or eradicated ink, which {{had the effect of}} defacing the <b>vellum</b> from green and blue to black and brown.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{composition}} of the blazon is agreed to by both parties a final grant could then be created. This {{takes the form of a}} handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in <b>vellum</b> by a College artist and scrivener. The grant is then signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is always made for the College's own register.|$|E
5|$|Codex Zacynthius (designated by siglum Ξ or 040 in the Gregory-Aland numbering; A1 in von Soden) is a Greek New Testament codex, dated paleographically to the 6th century. First {{thought to}} have been written in the 8th century, it is a palimpsest—the {{original}} (lower) text was washed off its <b>vellum</b> pages and overwritten in the 12th or 13th century. The upper text of the palimpsest contains weekday Gospel lessons; the lower text contains portions of the Gospel of Luke, deciphered by biblical scholar and palaeographer Tregelles in 1861. The lower text is of most interest to scholars.|$|E
5|$|Formby {{has been}} the subject of five biographies as of 2014. In the late 1960s Harry Scott {{published}} his reminiscences of Formby, The Fabulous Formby, in 14 issues of The <b>Vellum,</b> the magazine of the George Formby Society; John Fisher published George Formby in 1975 before Alan Randall and Ray Seaton published their book in 1974 and David Bret produced George Formby: A Troubled Genius in 1999. The last of the five to be published was by Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard in 2011, It's Turned Out Nice Again!. There have also been two documentaries on British television, an edition of The South Bank Show in 1992, and Frank Skinner on George Formby in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script, preceded by prefaces, summaries, and concordances of Gospel passages. Today, {{it consists of}} 340 <b>vellum</b> leaves, or folios. The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets, called bifolios, which are folded in half to form two folios. The bifolios are nested inside {{of each other and}} sewn together to form gatherings called quires. On occasion, a folio is not part of a bifolio but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire. The extant folios are gathered into 38 quires. There are between four and twelve folios (two to six bifolios) per quire; the folios are commonly, but not invariably, bound in groups of ten. Some folios are single sheets, as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages. The folios had lines drawn for the text, sometimes on both sides, after the bifolios were folded. Prick marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages. The <b>vellum</b> is of high quality, although the folios have an uneven thickness, with some being close to leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent.|$|E
5|$|The Codex Vaticanus (The Vatican, Bibl. Vat., Vat. gr. 1209; no. B or 03 Gregory-Aland, δ 1 von Soden) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} extant manuscripts of the Greek Bible (Old and New Testament), one of the four great uncial codices. The Codex is named after its place of {{conservation}} in the Vatican Library, where it has been kept since at least the 15th century. It is written on 759 leaves of <b>vellum</b> in uncial letters and has been dated palaeographically to the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|The folios {{are made}} of <b>vellum</b> {{parchment}} primarily from calf skins, secondarily from sheep skins. (Tischendorf himself thought that the parchment had been made from antelope skins, but modern microscopic examination has shown otherwise.) Most of the quires or signatures contain four sheets, save two containing five. It is estimated that the hides of about 360 animals were employed for making the folios of this codex. As {{for the cost of}} the material, time of scribes and binding, it equals the lifetime wages of one individual at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} today comprises 340 folios and, since 1953, {{has been}} bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf <b>vellum,</b> and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest {{extension of the}} anti-classical and energetic qualities of Insular art. The Insular majuscule script of the text itself {{appears to be the}} work of at least three different scribes. The lettering is in iron gall ink, and the colours used were derived {{from a wide range of}} substances, many of which were imports from distant lands.|$|E
5|$|The Anthony Roll is {{a record}} of ships of the English Tudor navy of the 1540s, named after its creator, Anthony Anthony. It {{originally}} consisted of three rolls of <b>vellum,</b> depicting 58naval vessels along with information on their size, crew, armament, and basic equipment. The rolls were presented to KingHenry VIII in 1546, and were kept in the royal library. In 1680 Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys, who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book, which {{is now in the}} Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by William IV to his daughter, Mary Fox, who sold it to the British Museum in 1858; it is now owned by the British Library.|$|E
5|$|The fee for {{the grant}} of arms is due when the {{memorial}} is submitted, the amount being {{laid out in the}} Earl Marshal's Warrant. As of 1 January 2016 the fees for a personal grant of arms, including a crest is £5,875, a grant to a non-profit body is £12,375 and to a commercial company is £18,350. This grant however does not include a grant of a badge, supporters or a standard, their inclusion into the grant requires extra fees. The fees mainly go towards commissioning the artwork and calligraphy on the <b>vellum</b> Letters Patent, which must be done by hand and in a sense a work of art in itself, plus other administrative costs borne by the heralds and for the upkeep of the College.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{published}} by Ellis and White in November 1876, although the date appeared on the imprint as 1877. They issued a second edition in 1877 and a third in 1880. The book was brought out again in 1887 by Reeves and Turner, and in 1896 by Longman. In 1898, two years after Morris's death, a revised text {{was published}} by the Kelmscott Press in an edition limited to 160 paper copies and 6 <b>vellum</b> copies, with wood cuts by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. In 1910 Longman issued an edition in which some passages were replaced with prose summaries by Winifred Turner and Helen Scott. In 1911 the same firm reprinted the original version as volume 12 of The Collected Works of William Morris, with an introduction by May Morris; {{in the absence of}} a critical edition this is the one generally cited by scholars. In recent years Sigurd the Volsung has been frequently reprinted, sometimes in the Turner and Scott abridged version.|$|E
5|$|In January 1891, Morris began {{renting a}} cottage near to Kelmscott House, No. 16 Upper Mall in Hammersmith, which {{would serve as}} the first {{premises}} of the Kelmscott Press, before relocating to the neighbouring No. 14 in May, that same month in which the company was founded. Devoted {{to the production of}} books which he deemed beautiful, Morris was artistically influenced by the illustrated manuscripts and early printed books of Medieval and Early Modern Europe. Before publishing its first work, Morris ensured that he had mastered the techniques of printing and secured supplies of hand-made paper and <b>vellum</b> which would be necessary for production. Over the next seven years, they would publish 66 volumes. The first of these would be one of Morris' own novels, The Story of the Glittering Plain, which was published in May 1891 and soon sold out. The Kelmscott Press would go on to publish 23 of Morris' books, more than those of any other author. The press also published editions of works by Keats, Shelley, Ruskin, and Swinburne, as well as copies of various Medieval texts. A number of the Press' books contained illustrations provided by Burne-Jones. The Press' magnum opus would be the Kelmscott Chaucer, which had taken years to complete and included 87 illustrations from Burne-Jones. Morris still remained firmly in an employer relation with those working at the Press, although organised outings for them and paid them above average wages.|$|E
5|$|The Anthony Roll was {{originally}} {{a set of}} three separate <b>vellum</b> rolls. It exists today {{in the form of}} a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of 70cm (27 ½ inches) and a height varying from 79 to 96cm (31 to 37 ¾ inches). After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as Pepys 2991. The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the rolls. This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the Henry Grace à Dieu, Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls. The second roll, British Library Additional MS 22047, is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing.|$|E
25|$|Both Anglo-Saxon and Irish manuscripts have a {{distinctive}} rougher finish to their <b>vellum,</b> {{compared to the}} smooth-polished surface of contemporary continental and all late-medieval <b>vellum.</b> It appears that, in contrast to later periods, the scribes copying the text were often also the artists of the illuminations, and might include the most senior figures of their monastery.|$|E
25|$|Simple NUV sources {{can be used}} to {{highlight}} faded iron-based ink on <b>vellum.</b>|$|E
25|$|M 945 = <b>Vellum,</b> 193 leaves, 7½ × 5⅛ inches (192 × 130mm), with 63 miniatures, {{bound in}} 19th-century red velvet.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} Middle English prose {{version of}} Ipomedon, dating to the fifteenth century and found (incomplete) {{in the fifteenth century}} <b>vellum</b> MS Longleat 257.|$|E
25|$|The spacious margin allowed {{illuminated}} decoration to {{be added}} by hand. The amount of decoration presumably depended on how much each buyer could or would pay. Some copies were never decorated. The place of decoration can be known or inferred for about 30 of the surviving copies. It is possible that 13 of these copies received their decoration in Mainz, but others were worked on {{as far away as}} London. The <b>vellum</b> Bibles were more expensive, and perhaps for this reason tend to be more highly decorated, although the <b>vellum</b> copy in the British Library is completely undecorated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vellum</b> {{has been}} {{translated}} amongst others into German (by Hannes Riffel), Finnish (by Nina Saikkonen), French (by Florence Dolisi), Spanish (by Luis Gallego Tevar), Italian (by Stefania Di Natale) and Polish (by Anna Reszka).|$|E
25|$|The National Library of Wales {{has one of}} the {{two copies}} of the 1539 edition of Miles Coverdale's Great Bible, that were printed on <b>vellum</b> and {{illuminated}} throughout. The other copy is in the library of St. John's College, Cambridge.|$|E
25|$|Codex Marchalianus {{designated}} by siglum Q is a 6th-century Greek manuscript {{copy of the}} Greek version of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh or Old Testament) known as the Septuagint. The text was written on <b>vellum</b> in uncial letters. Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 6th century.|$|E
25|$|Parchment is {{a writing}} {{material}} made from specially prepared untanned skins of animals—primarily sheep, calves, and goats. It {{has been used}} as a writing medium for over two millennia. <b>Vellum</b> is a finer quality parchment made from the skins of young animals such as lambs and young calves.|$|E
25|$|Lady Tankerville {{amassed a}} large {{collection}} of exotic plants at Mount Felix. Emma Tankervilles collection {{was thought to}} be the largest in the London area. Specimens named after Lady Tankerville include the Nun's Orchid or Phaius tankervilleae. Artists were employed to create botanical drawings on <b>vellum</b> of the specimens.|$|E
25|$|The many {{tools and}} writing {{materials}} used throughout history include stone tablets, clay tablets, bamboo slats, papyrus, wax tablets, <b>vellum,</b> parchment, paper, copperplate, styluses, quills, ink brushes, pencils, pens, and many styles of lithography. It is {{speculated that the}} Incas might have employed knotted cords known as quipu (or khipu) as a writing system.|$|E
25|$|The way {{in which}} {{parchment}} was processed (from hide to parchment) has undergone a tremendous evolution based on time and location. Parchment and <b>vellum</b> are not the sole methods of preparing animal skins for writing. In the Babylonian Talmud (Bava Batra 14B) Moses writes the first Torah Scroll on the unsplit cow-hide called gevil.|$|E
25|$|The book {{comprises}} 348 {{leaves of}} <b>vellum.</b> Nearly {{a third of}} these are replacements. The book {{was designed to be}} easily carried: hence its pages are small, measuring 13.1 x 9.3cm. It contains 64 full-page miniatures and 140 text pages with decorated borders and small miniatures. Its binding, in dark red Morocco, dates from around 1896.|$|E
25|$|Although many Gutenberg Bibles {{have been}} rebound over the years, nine copies retain fifteenth-century bindings. Most of these copies were bound in either Mainz or Erfurt. Most copies {{were divided into}} two volumes, the first volume ending with The Book of Psalms. Copies on <b>vellum</b> were heavier and for this reason were {{sometimes}} bound in three or four volumes.|$|E
25|$|The National Library {{has many}} {{examples}} of books with fine bindings in its holdings. These include under-painted <b>vellum,</b> Victorian carved wood and papier-mâché bindings, French art nouveau bookbinding and bindings by Bernard C. Middleton and the Gregynog Press binder, George Fisher. In the late 1970s, the library acquired an archive recording {{the work of the}} Birdsall bindery, Northampton.|$|E
25|$|The {{sandstone}} used {{to sculpt}} the monuments is old red sandstone, a relatively soft stone that {{lends itself to}} detailed carving but is susceptible to erosion. The monuments {{are likely to have}} been worked with iron tools such as chisels, punches and hammers, together with hammerstones and wooden mallets. The sculpted designs may have been copied from painted <b>vellum</b> pattern books.|$|E
25|$|In 1804 the British {{cartographer}} William Frazer made a full {{reproduction of}} the map on <b>vellum.</b> Although the reproduction is exact, there are minor differences {{between it and the}} Venetian original. The Frazer reproduction is currently on display in the British Library in London. In this article, some images are from the Venetian edition and some are from the Frazer reproduction.|$|E
25|$|Ivory carvings, {{often for}} book covers, {{drew on the}} diptychs of Late Antiquity. For example, {{the front and back}} covers of the Lorsch Gospels are of a 6th-century Imperial triumph, adapted to the triumph of Christ and the Virgin. However they also drew on the Insular tradition, {{especially}} for decorative detail, whilst greatly improving on that in terms of the depiction of the human figure. Copies of the scriptures or liturgical books illustrated on <b>vellum</b> and adorned with precious metals were produced in abbeys and nunneries across Western Europe. A work like the Stockholm Codex Aureus ("Gold Book") might be written in gold leaf on purple <b>vellum,</b> in imitation of Roman and Byzantine Imperial manuscripts. Anglo-Saxon art was often freer, making more use of lively line drawings, and there were other distinct traditions, such as the group of extraordinary Mozarabic manuscripts from Spain, including the Saint-Sever Beatus, and those in Girona and the Morgan Library.|$|E
