The result is a forced <b>vortex</b> in the center surrounded by a free <b>vortex.</b> Because our purpose is to measure the angular velocity around the circular motion, Rankine’s combined model for the free <b>vortex</b> can be applied to our system.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{and experimental}} study {{of the interaction between}} an initially columnar <b>vortex</b> and a wrapped <b>vortex</b> loop was performed, which focused on the columnar <b>vortex</b> response to the <b>vortex</b> loop. This problem is motivated by applications involving three-dimensional <b>vortex</b> interaction with a solid body, where the secondary vorticity shed from the body rolls up into a series of loop-like structures that are advected away from the body by the primary <b>vortex.</b> As a secondary <b>vortex</b> loop wraps around a columnar <b>vortex,</b> it becomes entrained into the <b>vortex</b> core due to the self-induced velocity of the loop. The columnar <b>vortex</b> response as a secondary <b>vortex</b> loop moves close to and impacts upon its lateral core surface includes a combination of bending waves, waves of variable core area, and core shape deformation. If a <b>vortex</b> loop is sufficiently strong, its interaction with the columnar <b>vortex</b> is also accompanied by ejection of vorticity from the columanr <b>vortex,</b> sometimes leading to development of a traveling <b>vortex</b> breakdown...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{analytical}} method {{has been developed}} to predict the induced velocities at the tip <b>vortex</b> {{in the wake of}} a hovering helicopter rotor. The wake model in the analysis includes the blade bound <b>vortex</b> as well as a tip <b>vortex</b> and <b>vortex</b> sheet trailed from each blade. Standard, prescribed wake models were used to describe the geometry of the tip <b>vortex</b> and the <b>vortex</b> sheet. Curved <b>vortex</b> elements were used to model the tip vortices and the <b>vortex</b> sheets. The analysis was used to study the contribution from each wake component to the axial-induced velocity of the tip <b>vortex.</b> Results show a highly variable induced velocity at the tip <b>vortex</b> both before and after the first blade passage. However, the prescribed tip <b>vortex</b> models require a constant axial velocity of the tip <b>vortex.</b> This inconsistency between the prescribed axial velocity of the tip <b>vortex</b> and the velocity that the wake geometry induces on the tip <b>vortex</b> points to a limitation of the current prescribed tip <b>vortex</b> geometry models...|$|R

40|$|The point <b>vortex</b> {{has been}} used as a simple model for flows with circulation, and has been desingularized into <b>vortex</b> patches and <b>vortex</b> sheets. In this work, we {{investigate}} the steady states of a combination of these two formulations, the Sadovskii <b>vortex.</b> The Sadovskii <b>vortex</b> is a uniform patch of vorticity surrounded by a <b>vortex</b> sheet. Numerical continuation is used to follow families of solutions. In the limiting cases of the <b>vortex</b> patch and <b>vortex</b> sheet cases, we confirm previous research, and in the <b>vortex</b> patch case show new solutions. In the regime where both sources of circulation exist, we show the relationship between the <b>vortex</b> patch and <b>vortex</b> sheet solution families. The more complicated <b>vortex</b> patch solution families lead to the simpler <b>vortex</b> sheet solution family due to a splitting of the <b>vortex</b> patch families at bifurcation points in the presence of the <b>vortex</b> sheet. The more circular elliptical family remains attached to the family with a single pinch off, and this family extends all the way to the pure <b>vortex</b> sheet solutions. More elongated families below this one also split at bifurcation points, and these families do not exist in the <b>vortex</b> sheet regime. In the presence of surface tension, <b>vortex</b> patch shapes are deformed where the background straining flow is into the vortices. This leads to oscillations on the boundary, similar to those found by Tanveer (1986) for bubbles in Hele-Shaw cells. The pinch off cusp for the patch <b>vortex</b> becomes desingularized in the presence of surface tension, and no longer touches. The effects of surface tension on the <b>vortex</b> sheet and Sadovskii <b>vortex</b> shapes are shown to be similar but smaller...|$|R
40|$|Large eddy {{simulations}} () {{of aircraft}} wake <b>vortex</b> evolution in various turbulent and stably stratified atmospheric environments {{have been conducted}} with two different LES codes. Passive tracers are used to investigate exchange processes between the <b>vortex</b> cores, the <b>vortex</b> oval and its environment as well as redistribution processes along the <b>vortex</b> tubes. A post processing method is employed to identify the <b>vortex</b> center lines even in progressed states of <b>vortex</b> decay where the coherent <b>vortex</b> structure is getting lost. This method allows, for example, analyzing the circulation evolution of <b>vortex</b> rings, establishing statistics of <b>vortex</b> deformation, and revealing the mechanisms of the <b>vortex</b> bursting phenomenon. <b>Vortex</b> bursting {{is related to the}} collision of secondary vorticity structures propagating along the <b>vortex</b> lines. In neutrally and weakly stratified environments long-living <b>vortex</b> rings are observed where circulation decay proceeds in three phases.

Point <b>vortex</b> models are used in this paper to study the fluid dynamic mechanism in the interactions between trailing <b>vortex</b> pair and shear layers.

When a shear layer is below the <b>vortex</b> pair with the same sign as the left <b>vortex,</b> the right <b>vortex</b> descends less than the left <b>vortex.</b> When the same shear layer is above the <b>vortex</b> pair, the right <b>vortex</b> descends more.

40|$|The {{structure}} {{and behavior of}} a streamwise rib <b>vortex</b> in a direct numerical simulation of a time-developing three-dimensional incompressible plane mixing layer is examined. Where the rib <b>vortex</b> is being stretched, the vorticity vector is primarily directed in the <b>vortex</b> axial direction and the radial and azimuthal velocity distribution {{is similar to that}} of a Burger's <b>vortex.</b> In the region where the <b>vortex</b> stretching is negative, there is a change in the local topology of the <b>vortex.</b> The axial flow is decelerated and a negative azimuthal component of vorticity is induced. These features are characteristic of <b>vortex</b> breakdown. The temporal evolution of the rib <b>vortex</b> is similar to the evolution of an axisymmetric <b>vortex</b> in the early stages of <b>vortex</b> breakdown.

50|$|Nicked DNA can be {{the result}} of DNA damage or {{purposeful}} and carefully regulated biomolecular reactions carried out in the cell. DNA can be nicked by physical shearing, over-drying or enzymes.

Overdrying of DNA can also break the phosphodiester bond in DNA and result in nicks. Enzyme Nicking endonucleases can assist with this process A single-stranded break (nick) in DNA can be formed by the hydrolysis and subsequent removal of a phosphate group within the helical backbone. This leads to a different DNA conformation, where a hydrogen bond forms in place of the missing piece of the DNA backbone in order to preserve the structure.|$|E
5000|$|A {{method was}} {{published}} {{that can be}} used to produce different mean sizes of stable agglomerates of several metal, metal oxide, and polymer nanoparticles in cell culture media for cell toxicity studies. Different mean sizes of agglomerates are produced by allowing the nanoparticles to agglomerate to a particular size in cell culture media without protein, and then adding protein to coat the agglomerates and [...] "freeze" [...] them at that size. By waiting different amounts of time before adding protein, different mean sizes of agglomerates of a single type of nanoparticle can be produced in an otherwise identical solution, allowing one to study how agglomerate size affects toxicity. In addition, it was found that <b>vortexing</b> while adding a high concentration of nanoparticles to the cell culture media produces much less agglomerated nanoparticles than if the dispersed solution is only mixed after adding the nanoparticles.|$|E
5000|$|Solvents {{with higher}} boiling points {{such as water}} (100 °C at {{standard}} atmospheric pressure, 760 torr or 1 bar), dimethylformamide (DMF, 153 °C at the same), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 189 °C at the same), can also be evaporated if the unit's vacuum system is capable of sufficiently low pressure. (For instance, both DMF and DMSO will boil below 50 °C if the vacuum is reduced from 760 torr to 5 torr 1 bar to 6.6 mbar) However, more recent developments are often applied in these cases (e.g., evaporation while centrifuging or <b>vortexing</b> at high speeds). Rotary evaporation for high boiling hydrogen bond-forming solvents such as water is often a last recourse, as other evaporation methods or freeze-drying (lyophilization) are available. This {{is partly due to}} the fact that in such solvents, the tendency to [...] "bump" [...] is accentuated. The modern centrifugal evaporation technologies are particularly useful when one has many samples to do in parallel, as in medium- to high-throughput synthesis now expanding in industry and academia.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>vortex</b> lattice and <b>vortex</b> bound states in CsFe$_ 2 $As$_ 2 $ single crystals by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) under various magnetic fields. A possible structural transition of <b>vortex</b> lattice is observed {{with the increase}} of magnetic field, i. e., the <b>vortex</b> lattice changes from a distorted hexagonal lattice to a distorted tetragonal one at the magnetic field near 0. 5 T. We obtain some qualitative support from a simple calculation of the vortex-interaction energy.

50|$|After amplification, the {{emulsion}} from preceding step {{is broken}} using isopropanol and detergent buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X‐100, 1% (w/v) SDS), following {{with a series}} of <b>vortexing,</b> centrifuging, and magnetic separation. The resulted solution is a suspension of empty, clonal and non-clonal beads, which arise from emulsion droplets that initially have zero, one or multiple DNA template molecules, respectively. The amplified bead could be enriched in the following step. • Bead enrichmentThe enrichment of amplified beads is achieved through hybridization to a larger, low density, non-magnetic polystyrene beads that pre-loaded with a biotinylated capture oligonucleotides (DNA sequence that complementary to ePCR amplicon sequence). The mixture is then centrifuged to separate the amplified and capture beads complex from the unamplified beads. The amplified, capture bead complex has a lower density and thus will remain in the supernatant while the unamplified beads form a pellet. The supernatant is recovered and treated with NaOH which will break the complex. The paramagnetic amplified beads are separated from the non-magnetic capture beads by magnetic separation. This enrichment protocol is capable in enriching five times of amplified beads. • Bead cappingThe purpose of bead capping is to attach a “capping” oligonucleotide to the 3’ end of both unextended forward ePCR primers and the RDV segment of template DNA. The cap that being use is an amino group that prevents fluorescent probes from ligating to these ends and at the same time, helping the subsequent coupling of template DNA to the aminosilanated flow cell coverslip. • Coverslip arrayingFirst, the coverslips are washed and aminosilane-treated, enabling the subsequent covalent coupling of template DNA on it and eliminating any fluorescent contamination. The amplified, enriched beads are mixed with acrylamide and poured into a shallow mold formed by a Teflon-masked microscope slide. Immediately, place the aminosilane-treated coverslip on top of the acrylamide gel and allow to polymerize for 45 minutes. Next, invert the slide/coverslip stack and remove the microscope slide from gel. The silane-treated coverslips will bind covalently to the gel while the Teflon on the surface of microscope slide will enable the better removal of slide from the acrylamide gel. The coverslips then bonded to the flow cell body and any unattached beads will be removed.|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} found that optimum recovery of Chlamydia trachomatis in microdilution plate culture required multiple blind passages.

In the present study, the effect on recovery of the use of vials (as opposed to microdilution plates) and the effect of <b>vortexing,</b> sonication, or both were compared. Three different passage techniques were also evaluated. <b>Vortexing</b> or sonication resulted in equivalent recoveries. However, compared with <b>vortexing</b> alone, a combination of <b>vortexing</b> and sonication increased recovery from 95 (78 %) to 114 (94 %) of 121 positive specimens (P = 0. 002). In multiple-passage experiments, the combination of <b>vortexing</b> and sonication, compared with <b>vortexing</b> only, increased the proportion of isolates recovered with no more than a single passage from 81 to 96 %. Substitution of vials for microdilution plates increased recovery with only a single passage to greater than 96 %, irrespective of whether sonication was employed. The most sensitive technique for single-passage technique was one using blunt scraping of cell monolayers with passage of two monolayers to one. The sensitivity of cell culture for C. trachomatis is highly dependent on the technique(s) employed. However, the combination of sonication and <b>vortexing</b> of clinical specimens enhanced recovery in microdilution plates, and a single blind passage did so in both microdilution plates and vials.

30|$|With {{moderate}} and large surface friction, when a <b>vortex</b> near Taiwan, surface friction creates a strong northerly channel flow {{west of the}} <b>vortex.</b> A strong southerly flow also forms east of the <b>vortex,</b> because the slowdown <b>vortex</b> is being pushed by the easterly flow from behind. Meanwhile, the <b>vortex</b> deforms. The asymmetric <b>vortex</b> and the accompanying two high-wind zones rotate cyclonically, while the <b>vortex</b> moves westward. At first, the northerly channel flow is stronger than the southerly flow east of the <b>vortex,</b> and the <b>vortex</b> deflects southward. The <b>vortex</b> deflects northward, when the stronger velocity shows up {{to the east of}} the vortex; it retreats east when the westerly velocity south of the <b>vortex</b> is stronger than the easterly flow north of the <b>vortex.</b> Therefore, the <b>vortex</b> not only can deflect south or north, but also can form a loop. The mechanism is different from the tradition theory of channel flow or the inner core asymmetric flow come from mid-troposphere (Wu et al. 2015). If cyclonic circulation of a large <b>vortex</b> moves around the northern coast, it can induce a strong secondary circulation on the west of the Island. On the other hand, the secondary circulation is rather weak when it is caused by the flow passing over the CMR.|$|R

Biofilms were believed to protect constituent microorganisms from sanitizer treatment, provide a more suitable habitat for microorganisms, and become a site for genetic material exchanges between microorganisms.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of an isolated <b>vortex</b> perturbed by topographically forced Rossby waves is studied {{using the method}} of Contour Dynamics. For a single-contour <b>vortex</b> a distinct forcing threshold exists above which the wave breaks in a dynamically significant way, leading to a disruption of the <b>vortex.</b> This breaking is distinguished from the process of weak filamentary breaking described by Dritschel and classified here as microbreaking; the latter occurs in nondivergent flow even at very small forcing amplitudes but {{does not affect the}} <b>vortex</b> in a substantial manner.
