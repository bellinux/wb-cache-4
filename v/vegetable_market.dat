5|$|By this time, the tollhouse was proving {{inadequate}} as {{the seat}} of local government and between 1407 and 1413 it was demolished, along with an adjoining site which had housed a <b>vegetable</b> <b>market,</b> {{and was replaced by}} a new Guildhall.

The Guildhall cost between £400–£500 to build. (As it was built primarily using pressed labour, modern equivalents of the building costs are virtually meaningless. The annual income of the city council at the time the Guildhall was built was around £120.) The eastern face of the Guildhall was built in a distinctive black and white checked design, representing the exchequer. The undercroft of the tollhouse was retained for use as a dungeon, while a new basement served as a lock-up from the opening of the Guildhall until the 1980s.|$|E
