5|$|A <b>viral</b> <b>genome,</b> {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid type, {{is almost always}} either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.|$|E
5|$|The eleven dsRNA strands {{remain within}} the {{protection}} of the two protein shells and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase creates mRNA transcripts of the double-stranded <b>viral</b> <b>genome.</b> By remaining in the core, the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses called RNA interference that are triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA.|$|E
5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small <b>viral</b> <b>genome.</b>|$|E
40|$|When {{grown at}} 39. 5 degrees C, BHK- 21 C- 13 cells {{transformed}} by A gene mutants of polyoma virus contain viral sequences that are predominantly associated with cellular DNA pelleted in the Hirt lysis procedure. At this temperature, in {{cells that are}} inducible for viral DNA replication (Folk, 1973), {{the majority of the}} <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> are covalently joined with cellular DNA's containing repetitious sequences. Upon a shift to 31 degrees C, free <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> appear and are replicated.

40|$|Cells {{producing}} type C (avain sarcoma virus) or type B (mouse mammary tumor virus) RNA tumor viruses contain {{small amounts}} of RNA complementary to the <b>viral</b> <b>genomes.</b> The negative strands are complementary to at least 30 to 45 % of the <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> and are found as RNA-RNA duplexes in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells and in mature virions...|$|R
40|$|Much of the HSV- 1 {{life cycle}} {{is carried out}} in the cell nucleus, {{including}} the expression, repli-cation, repair, and packaging of <b>viral</b> <b>genomes.</b> <b>Viral</b> proteins, as well as cellular factors, play essential roles in these processes. Isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) was developed to label and purify cellular replication forks. We adapted aspects of this method to label <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> to both image, and purify replicating HSV- 1 genomes for the identifi-cation of associated proteins. Many viral and cellular factors were enriched on viral ge-nomes, including factors that mediate DNA replication, repair, chromatin remodeling, transcription, and RNA processing. As infection proceeded, packaging and structural com-ponents were enriched to a greater extent. Among the more abundant proteins that copuri-fied with <b>genomes</b> were the <b>viral</b> transcription factor ICP 4 and the replication protein ICP 8. Furthermore, all seven viral replication proteins were enriched on <b>viral</b> <b>genomes,</b> along with cellular PCNA and topoisomerases, while other cellular replication proteins were not de-tected. The chromatin-remodeling complexes present on <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> included the INO 80, SWI/SNF, NURD, and FACT complexes, which may prevent chromatinization of th...|$|R
5|$|Complex: These viruses {{possess a}} capsid that is neither purely helical nor purely icosahedral, {{and that may}} possess extra {{structures}} such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the <b>viral</b> <b>genome</b> into the cell.|$|E
5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the <b>viral</b> <b>genome</b> and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E
5|$|Like DNA, RNA {{can carry}} genetic information. RNA viruses have genomes {{composed}} of RNA that encodes {{a number of}} proteins. The <b>viral</b> <b>genome</b> is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell. Viroids are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase.|$|E
40|$|The {{arrangement}} and localization of <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> integrated in RSb cells {{were analyzed by}} molecular biological techniques. The RSb cell line was established from human embryonic fibroblasts transformed by sequential infection of Rous sarcoma virus and Simian virus 40 (SV 40). SV 40 DNA used for analyses was obtained by molecular cloning. The copy numbers of integrated <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> were estimated by dot blot hybridization. The arrangement of integrated <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. Chromosomal locations of the genome were studied by in situ molecular hybridization. Most of the integrated <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> lack 1. 14 kb (about 20 % of SV 40 DNA) from the late transcription region which encodes the viral core proteins. The integrated defective 4. 1 Kb genome is partially repeated in the host DNA. RSb cells contain the whole large T antigen-coding sequence, and the large T antigen may {{play a major role}} in the transformation of this cell line. Results of the dot blot hybridization and in situ hybridization indicate that RSb cells contain about 10 copies of <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> per cell and that these genomes are integrated in at least 4 sites of the host chromosomes. These results along with others suggest that there is no unique integration site of SV 40 DNA in human cells...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMetagenomics has {{revealed}} {{the existence of}} numerous uncharacterized viral lineages, which {{are referred to as}} viral "dark matter. " However, our knowledge regarding <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> is biased toward culturable viruses. In this study, we analyzed 1, 600 (1, 352 nonredundant) complete double-stranded DNA <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> (10 to 211 Â kb) assembled from 52 marine viromes. Together with 244 previously reported uncultured <b>viral</b> <b>genomes,</b> a genome-wide comparison delineated 617 genus-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for these environmental <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> (EVGs). Of these, 600 OTUs contained no representatives from known viruses, thus putatively corresponding to novel viral genera. Predicted hosts of the EVGs included major groups of marine prokaryotes, such as marine group II Euryarchaeota and SAR 86, from which no viruses have been isolated to date, as well as Flavobacteriaceae and SAR 116. Our analysis indicates that marine cyanophages are already well represented in genome databases and that one of the EVGs likely represents a new cyanophage lineage. Several EVGs encode many enzymes that appear to function for an efficient utilization of iron-sulfur clusters or to enhance host survival. This suggests that there is a selection pressure on these marine viruses to accumulate genes for specific viral propagation strategies. Finally, we revealed that EVGs contribute to a 4 -fold increase in the recruitment of photic-zone viromes compared with the use of current reference <b>viral</b> <b>genomes.</b> IMPORTANCE Viruses are diverse and play significant ecological roles in marine ecosystems. However, our knowledge of genome-level diversity in viruses is biased toward those isolated from few culturable hosts. Here, we determined 1, 352 nonredundant complete <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> from marine environments. Lifting the uncertainty that clouds short incomplete sequences, whole-genome-wide analysis suggests that these environmental genomes represent hundreds of putative novel viral genera. Predicted hosts include dominant groups of marine bacteria and archaea with no isolated viruses to date. Some of the <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> encode many functionally related enzymes, suggesting a strong selection pressure on these marine viruses to control cellular metabolisms by accumulating genes...|$|R
5000|$|Viral DNA is {{an example}} of {{extrachromosomal}} DNA. Understanding <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> is very important for understanding the evolution and mutation of the virus. Some viruses, such as HIV and oncogenetic viruses, incorporate their own DNA into the genome of the host cell. [...] <b>Viral</b> <b>genomes</b> can be made up of single stranded DNA (ssDNA), double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and can be found in both linear and circular form.|$|R
5|$|DNA viruses : The genome {{replication}} of most DNA viruses {{takes place in}} the cell's nucleus. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or â more usually â by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. However, viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the <b>viral</b> <b>genome</b> must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Thus, {{the genome}} {{enclosed}} within the viral particle {{can be used}} as messenger RNA and immediately translated by the host cell. On entry, the virus hijacks the cell's translation machinery, causing inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in favor of virusâspecific protein production. Unlike the host cell's mRNAs, the 5'end of poliovirus RNA is extremely longâover 700 nucleotidesâand highly structured. This region of the <b>viral</b> <b>genome</b> is called internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and it directs translation of the viral RNA. Genetic mutations in this region prevent viral protein production. The first IRES to be discovered was found in poliovirus RNA.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the <b>viral</b> <b>genome</b> in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe genomes of a {{large number}} of highly diverse novel {{circular}} DNA viruses from a wide range of sources have been characterised in recent years, including circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that share similarities with plant-infecting ssDNA viruses of the family Geminiviridae. Here, we describe six novel circular DNA <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> that encode replication-associated (Rep) proteins that are most closely related to those of either geminiviruses or gemycircularviruses (a new group of ssDNA viruses that are closely related to geminiviruses). Four possible <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> were recovered from Bromus hordeaceus sampled in New Zealand, and two were recovered from B. hordeaceus and Trifolium resupinatum sampled in France.

5|$|Oral {{polio vaccine}} (OPV) is an {{attenuated}} vaccine, {{produced by the}} passage of the virus through non-human cells at a sub-physiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the <b>viral</b> <b>genome.</b> Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine. Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.|$|E
5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex {{viruses that}} have an unusual morphology. The <b>viral</b> <b>genome</b> is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid {{is surrounded by a}} membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope. In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Eckard Wimmer's {{group at}} SUNY Stony Brook succeeded in synthesizing {{poliovirus}} from its chemical code, producing the world's first synthetic virus. Scientists first converted poliovirus's published RNA sequence, 7741 bases long, into a DNA sequence, as DNA {{was easier to}} synthesize. Short fragments of this DNA sequence were obtained by mail-order, and assembled. The complete <b>viral</b> <b>genome</b> was then assembled by a gene synthesis company. This whole painstaking process took two years. Nineteen markers were incorporated into the synthesized DNA, {{so that it could}} be distinguished from natural poliovirus. Enzymes were used to convert the DNA back into RNA, its natural state. Other enzymes were then used to translate the RNA into a polypeptide, producing functional viral particle. The newly minted synthetic virus was injected into PVR transgenic mice, to determine if the synthetic version was able to cause disease. The synthetic virus was able to replicate, infect, and cause paralysis or death in mice. However, the synthetic version was between 1/1,000th and 1/10,000th as lethal as the original virus.|$|E
40|$|International audienceViral {{particles}} {{are much more}} abundant than cells and viral genes outnumber cellular ones in the biosphere. Cellular genomes also harbour many integrated viruses whereas cellular genes are rare in <b>viral</b> <b>genomes.</b> The gene flux from virus to cell is thus overwhelming if compared with the opposite event. Novel viral genes continuously arose during replication/recombination of <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> in the virocell. These genes can become 'cellular genes' when <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> integrate into cellular ones. Together with the arm race between viruses and cells, this explains why viruses have {{played a major role}} in shaping cellular gene contents. Several documented cases show that viruses have been involved in the emergence of evolutionary innovations. This gives credit to hypotheses suggesting that viruses have played an important role in the formation of modern cells...|$|R

25|$|For lytic {{replication}} to occur, the <b>viral</b> <b>genome</b> must be linear. The latent EBV genome is circular, {{so it must}} linearize in {{the process}} of lytic reactivation.

40|$|Several metagenomic {{projects}} have been accomplished or are in progress. However, in most cases, it is not feasible to generate complete genomic assemblies of species from the metagenomic sequencing of a complex environment. Only {{a few studies have}} reported the reconstruction of bacterial genomes from complex metagenomes. In this work, Binning-Assembly approach has been proposed and demonstrated for the reconstruction of bacterial and <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> from 72 human gut metagenomic datasets. A total 1, 156 bacterial genomes belonging to 219 bacterial families and, 279 <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> belonging to 84 viral families could be identified. More than 80 % complete draft genome sequences could be reconstructed for a total of 126 bacterial and 11 <b>viral</b> <b>genomes.</b> Selected draft assembled genomes could be validated with 99. 8 % accuracy using their ORFs. The study provides useful information on the assembly expected for a species given its number of reads and abundance.

40|$|More {{than a dozen}} large DNA viruses {{exceeding}} 240 -kb genome size {{were recently}} discovered, including the âgiantâ mimivirus with a 1. 2 -Mb genome size. The detection of mimivirus and other large viruses has stimulated new analysis and discussion concerning the early evolution {{of life and the}} complexity and mechanisms of evolutionary transitions. This paper presents analysis in three contexts. (i) Genome signatures of large viruses tend to deviate from the genome signatures of their hosts, perhaps indicating that the large viruses are lytic in the hosts. (ii) Proteome composition within these <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> contrast with cellular organisms; for example, most eukaryotic genomes, with respect to acidic residue usages, select Glu over Asp, but the opposite generally prevails for the large <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> preferring Asp more than Glu. In comparing Phe vs. Tyr usage, the <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> select mostly Tyr over Phe, whereas in almost all bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, Phe is used more than Tyr. Interpretations of these contrasts are proffered with respect to protein structure and function. (iii) Frequent oligonucleotides and peptides are characterized in the large <b>viral</b> <b>genomes.</b> The frequent words may provide structural flexibility to interact with host proteins...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that host cells exert intrinsic mechanisms to control nuclear replicating DNA viruses. This cellular response involves nuclear antiviral factors targeting incoming <b>viral</b> <b>genomes.</b> Herpes simplex virus- 1 (HSV- 1) is the best-studied model in this context, and it was shown that upon nuclear entry HSV- 1 genomes are immediately targeted by components of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and the nuclear DNA sensor IFI 16 (interferon gamma inducible protein 16). Based on HSV- 1 studies, together with limited examples in other viral systems, these phenomena are widely believed to be a common cellular response to incoming <b>viral</b> <b>genomes,</b> although formal evidence for each virus is lacking. Indeed, recent studies suggest that the case may be different for adenovirus infection. Here we summarize the existing experimental evidence for the roles of nuclear antiviral factors against incoming <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> to better understand cellular responses on a virus-by-virus basis. We emphasize that cells seem to respond differently to different incoming <b>viral</b> <b>genomes</b> and discuss possible arguments for and against a unifying cellular mechanism targeting the incoming genomes of different virus families...|$|R
