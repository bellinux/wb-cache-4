40|$|Abstract. Hot judder {{characteristics}} of a <b>ventilated</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> system are discussed. Three dimensional finite element models of the ventilated disc, pads and pistons are created, and a fully coupled thermo-mechanical analysis of the hot judder phenomenon of the disc brake system is performed using SAMCEF. The brake dynamo test is carried out according to the high speed judder test mode. The evolution of the temperature distribution on the disc surface is described, and the hot spot generation process is investigated. The simulation results such as the maximum disc temperature, BTV are compared to {{the data from the}} dynamo test, and the reliabilities of the analysis technique and simulation model presented in this paper are verified...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that automobile brakes can generate {{several kinds of}} noises. Among them is squeal, a noise in the 1 - 15 kHz range. It is commonly accepted that brake squeal is initiated by instability due to the friction forces, leading to self excited vibrations. To predict the onset of brake instability, a modal analysis of the prestressed structure can be performed on an improved dynamic finite element model of <b>ventilated</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> with friction coupling. An unsymmetric stiffness matrix {{is a result of}} the friction coupling between the brake pad and disc; this may lead to complex eigenfrequencies. The complex eigenvalue method (Unsymmetric solver) used to analyse mode shapes associated with the predicted natural frequency. Creating the element of Matrix 27 between the ventilated disc and pad was very important in studying the squeal of the coupled <b>ventilated</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brake.</b> The results demonstrated that the FEM for the coupled ventilated rotor and pad showed a good interaction between the non-linear contact and the linear modal analysis. Furthermore, the unsymmetric solver showed that the modes of the coupled disc-pad contained two types of mode. The first type was normal mode, which did not contain an imaginary part while the second type was complex mode that contained real and imaginary parts. Moreover, complex eigenvalue analysis predicted always more unstable modes than the number of squeal frequencies that really occur in the brake system. The maximum squeal index was observed at mode 16 and at frequency of 4083 Hz with instability of 480 sec- 1. However; the tendency of instability (TOI) for the system at contact stiffness of 1 GN/m was 59 that gave the lowest instability of the system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{numerical}} {{investigation of the}} automotive <b>ventilated</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> rotor. Disc brakes operate {{on the principle of}} friction by converting kinetic energy into heat energy. The main objective of a disc brake rotor is to store this heat energy and dissipate it as soon as possible. This work is carried out in a area where there is very limited understanding. Commercial CFD code FLUENT was used for carrying out the simulations with the rotor rotating in still air. Only one passage and blade were simulated as all the rotor passages were identical. Uniform temperatures were used on the rotor to simulate the braking condition. Sixteen different blade angle sets were simulated and the range of blade angles having the best aero-thermal performance were identified using mass flow rate, rate of heat dissipation and temperature uniformity as performance metrics. The effect of rotational speed and rotor temperature (corresponding to various braking conditions) on the aero-thermal performance was evaluated. The rotor speed and temperature were observed to have significant effect on the rotor performance. The number of blades in the <b>ventilated</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> rotor was also varied and was observed {{to have an impact on}} the aero-thermal performance of the disc brake rotor. Detailed design changes like inlet chamfer, blade leading edge rounding, and variable thickness blade and passage aspect ratio were incorporated. All these changes did have an effect on the aero-thermal performance of the disc brake rotor. The inlet chamfer and the leading edge rounding improved both the rate of heat transfer and the temperature uniformity. The variable thickness blade and the lower aspect ratio passage improved the temperature uniformity of the rotor...|$|E

40|$|Disc brakes {{work on the}} {{principle}} of friction by converting kinetic energy into heat energy. The key objective of a disc brake rotor is to accumulate this heat energy and dissipate it immediately. The effect of rotational speed on the aero-thermal performance is assessed. The rotor speed is observed to have substantial effect on the rotor performance. The heat dissipation and thermal performance of ventilated brake discs intensely be influenced by the aerodynamic characteristics of the air flow through the rotor passages. In order to investigate the aero-thermal performance of the <b>ventilated</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> at several altered driving speeds of the vehicle, the simulations were carried out at 3 different rotational speeds of 44 rad/s 88 rad/s and 120 rad/s. The semi-automatic geometric model is created using the package Solid Works and the mesh for the model is done using ICEM CFD and the Post processing of the results is done using FLUENT- 14. 5. The results are discussed and presented in detail...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Braking is {{a process}} which {{converts}} the kinetic energy of the vehicle into mechanical energy which must be dissipated {{in the form of}} heat. The disc brake is a device for deaccelerating or stopping the rotation of a wheel. A brake disc (or rotor) usually made of cast iron or ceramic composites, is connected to the wheel and/or the axle. Friction material in the form of brake pads (mounted on a device called a brake caliper) is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically or electromagnetically against both sides of the disc to stop the wheel. The present research is basically deals with the modeling and analysis of solid and <b>ventilated</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> using Pro-E and Ansys. Finite element (FE) models of the brake-disc are created using Pro-E and simulated using ANSYS which is based on the finite element method (FEM). In this research Coupled Analysis (Structural & Thermal analysis) is performed in order to find the strength of the disc brake. In structural analysis displacement, ultimate stress limit for the design is found and in thermal analysis thermal gradients, heat flow rates, and heat fluxes to be calculates by varying the different cross sections, materials of the disc. Comparison can be done for displacement, stresses, nodal temperatures, etc. for the three materials to suggest the best material for FSAE car...|$|E
