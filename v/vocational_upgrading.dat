40|$|Abstract: In recent years, Chinese higher {{vocational}} education reform has made great achievements. However, physical education reform, as {{one part of the}} higher {{vocational education}}, lags far behind other curriculum reforms. Along with the rapid development of {{higher vocational education}} in our country, the number of higher vocational colleges has become larger than that of undergraduate colleges. But, quite a few higher <b>vocational</b> colleges are <b>upgraded</b> from secondary <b>vocational</b> schools. Although they still belong to the institutions of the higher learning, the educational ideas and positioning of them are totally different from those of undergraduate colleges. So the teaching reform of physical education must change based on the new situation of higher vocational physical education teaching environments. Through the analysis about the present situation of higher vocational colleges, the author puts forward the idea and thoughts of education reform as below. ...|$|R

Writing at the time, social theorist Ștefan Zeletin suggested that Negulescu's plan was daring and innovative, if heavily indebted to Germanic models and not fully responsive to actual social needs.

Another part of his program, on which he could agree with the PNL shadow minister, Angelescu, was the Romanianization of Transylvanian schools, particularly those catering to Hungarians, and the secularization of faith schools. Negulescu wrote that he considered the measure imperative, because of the schools' alleged role in spreading Hungarian irredentism. However, he was lenient toward expressions of Hungarian resentment, vetoing a government clampdown on Hungarian nationalist protesters, and speaking out in Senate in favor of political tolerance; he suggested that Hungarians had reason to view the Treaty of Trianon as a collective shock.|$|R
40|$|The recent Smithers {{critique}} {{of the role of}} the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) has opened up the debate about the effectiveness of this system for achieving the current goals of <b>upgrading</b> <b>vocational</b> studies and reforming the 14 - 19 curriculum. It is argued that, although Smithers is broadly correct in his attack on the NCVQ, there are some areas of ambiguity and also ways in which the critique fails to capture the full scope of the problems. The nature and full implications of the inappropriateness of the NCVQ enterprise is illustrated through an examination of the main weaknesses of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) and the competence-based education and training (CBET) strategy which underpins them and, in particular, by reviewing some specific problems of learning and assessment and the findings of a number of recent critical studies. In view of the seriousness of these shortcomings of the NCVQ system it is suggested that perhaps the only genuine solution to the current difficulties lies in the recommendations of the 1993 National Commission on Education report for the abolition of the present system of academic and vocational qualifications...|$|R

30|$|A {{limited amount}} of {{research}} has targeted vocational work-life competence. A small-scale comparative study of the regulation, organisation and use of CPD for vocational teachers (especially hairdressers) in England, Wales and Norway found a rather mixed picture (Lloyd and Payne 2012). In England and Wales, there are well-established opportunities for <b>vocational</b> teachers to <b>upgrade</b> their craft skills; these opportunities are partially dependent on a requirement of 30  h of ‘hands-on’ CPD. The conditions of vocational teachers’ CPD in Norway are variable and flexible. However, the opportunities for vocational teachers {{to keep up with}} their trade are rather limited {{because of a lack of}} replacement teachers and the fact that Norwegian vocational teachers have permanent employment and work full-time (in contrast to English and Welsh teachers, who work part-time in temporary employment). However, the study found that although the Norwegian vocational teachers lacked current skills in their trades, they requested more CPD related to teaching, even though there was more access to this type of CPD. Lloyd and Payne relate the Norwegian vocational teachers’ interest in developing their teaching competence to their responsibility for shaping the content of their courses, while the framework in England and Wales is more prescriptive and focuses on competence-based learning.|$|R

The Bank suggested that Portugal needed not only to train high level technicians but also middle level personnel (on a yearly basis: 1400 technicians with short cycle post-secondary education, 500 agricultural technicians and 6000 middle level managers). Subsequently, the government passed Decree-Law 397/77 of 17 September, which established a numerus clausus for every university study programme and eliminated the threat to the new short vocational education programs – that without reducing the supply of engineering jobs, graduates of the technician training institutes would find employment too scarce. The World Bank was critical of the erratic policies toward the existing technical institutes, and of the excessive enrolment in university engineering programs and the lax approach on managing vacancy quotas, and raised the issue of diseconomies of scale in the system, suggesting that there were too many institutions with small dimensions. The government replied to the Bank’s demands with Decree-Law 513-T/79, which established a network of polytechnic institutes, including Higher Schools of Education.

40|$|UnrestrictedIn 1996, the Ministry of Education in Taiwan {{adopted a}} policy to allow {{technical}} and vocational junior colleges to become four-year colleges.

After a decade, there were still {{a great number of}} lecturers who remained at the same rank. This study aimed to learn from un-promoted lecturers and their administrators about the lecturer’s experiences with changing work expectation and the lecturer’s difficulties with promotion. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 32 lecturers and 10 administrators at two private <b>upgraded</b> <b>vocational</b> higher institutions.; Seven barriers were found for lecturer’s difficulties in conducting research and getting promoted to higher rank and there was much agreement in the categories mentioned by lecturers and administrators. The seven barriers identified were inadequate research support such as research equipment, funding, library database, and research assistants; work adjustment from teaching and service to teaching, research and service due to changing workload; barriers of publishing in prestigious international journals due to inadequate research and English skills; difficulty of using the authoring of specialized publications and technical reports to earn a promotion to associate professor due to unclear expectations from the Ministry of Education; longer time frame required to earn a doctorate in the humanities and social sciences versus in other specialized disciplines; age, especially in that lecturers over 50 had less tolerance of long hours of research and study; and family responsibility, such as taking care of small children and sick parents for lecturers of both genders.; It was further found that both the lecturers and the administrators perceived the lecturers should be mainly responsible for the success of their promotion to higher rank because the institutions had policies in place to encourage lecturers to promote to higher rank. Though both the administrators and the lecturers perceived lecturers’ barriers to promotion as less related to problems such as inadequate research equipment and funding and more related to personal problems such as age and family responsibility, there are still some improvements the institutions can make to increase the promotion rates for all lecturers. The recommendations provided in this study can not only be helpful in improving lecturers’ promotion rates but can also enhance mutual understanding between institutions and lecturers...|$|R
