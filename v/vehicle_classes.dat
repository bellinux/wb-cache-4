5|$|The new Holden WB {{commercial}} vehicles and the Statesman WB limousines {{were introduced in}} 1980. However, the designs, based on the HQ and updated HJ, HX and HZ models from the 1970s were less competitive than similar models in Ford's lineup. Thus, Holden abandoned those <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes</b> altogether in 1984. Sales of the Commodore also fell, {{with the effects of}} the 1979 energy crisis lessening, {{and for the first time}} the Commodore lost ground to the Ford Falcon. Sales in other segments also suffered when competition from Ford intensified, and other Australian manufacturers: Mitsubishi, Nissan and Toyota gained market share. When released in 1982, the Camira initially generated good sales, which later declined because buyers considered the 1.6-litre engine underpowered, and the car's build and ride quality below-average. The Camira lasted just seven years, and contributed to Holden's accumulated losses of over A$500million by the mid-1980s.|$|E

Eight units inherited Routemasters: CentreWest, East London, Leaside, London Central, London General, London Northern, London United and South London. During this time, following the failure and premature withdrawal of heralded replacement <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes</b> such as the Daimler Fleetlines, the Routemasters that had not yet been disposed of saw their lives extended for use until privatisation. Where new route tenders called for Routemaster operation, these were leased from London Buses.|$|E
500|$|The {{cancellation}} of the GCV {{is the second time}} in 15 years an Army program to replace the Bradley has failed. [...] FCS ran from 1999 to 2009, with the Manned Ground Vehicles portion for replacing several armored <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes</b> costing [...] "hundreds of millions" [...] of dollars out of $20 billion total. [...] From 2010 to 2014, the Army spent over $1 billion on the GCV. [...] Although there was criticism that vehicle weight could not be kept at a reasonable level while meeting its size, weight, and power requirements, the Army maintains the official reason for the cancellation was budgetary pressures. [...] BAE Systems and General Dynamics will each receive $50 million in FY 2015 to continue technology development.
