40|$|PURPOSE: To {{test whether}} the k-space {{acquisition}} strategy used by fast-spin-echo (FSE) {{is a major}} source of blurring in carotid wall and plaque imaging, and investigate an alternative acquisition approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of echo train length (ETL) and T(2) on the amount of blurring was studied in FSE simulations of vessel images. Edge sharpness was measured in black-blood T(1) W and proton density-weighted (PDW) carotid images acquired from 5 normal volunteers and 19 asymptomatic patients using both FSE and multiple-spin-echo (Multi-SE) sequences at 3 Tesla (T). Plaque images were classified and divided in group α (tissues' average T(2) ∼ 40 - 70 ms) and group β (plaque components with shorter T(2)). RESULTS: Simulations predicted 26. 9 % reduction of <b>vessel</b> <b>edge</b> sharpness from Multi-SE to FSE images (ETL = 9, T(2) = 60 ms). This agreed with in vivo measurements in normal volunteers (27. 4 %) and in patient group α (26. 2 %), while in group β the loss was higher (31. 6 %). CONCLUSION: FSE significantly reduced <b>vessel</b> <b>edge</b> sharpness along the phase-encoding direction in T(1) W and PDW images. Blurring was stronger in the presence of plaque components with short T(2) times.

40|$|Demographic {{studies suggest}} that changes in the retinal {{vasculature}} geometry, especially in vessel width, {{are associated with the}} incidence or progression of eye-related or systemic diseases. To date, the main information source for width estimation from fundus images has been the intensity profile between <b>vessel</b> <b>edges.</b> However, there are many factors affecting the intensity profile: pathologies, the central light reflex and local illumination levels, to name a few. In this study, we introduce three information sources for width estimation. These are the probability profiles of vessel interior, centreline and edge locations generated by a deep network. The probability profiles provide direct access to vessel geometry and are used in the likelihood calculation for a Bayesian method, particle filtering. We also introduce a geometric model which can handle non-ideal conditions of the probability profiles. Our experiments conducted on the REVIEW dataset yielded consistent estimates of vessel width, even in cases when one of the <b>vessel</b> <b>edges</b> is difficult to identify.

40|$|AIMS—Quantification of retinal {{vascular}} {{change is}} difficult and manual measurements of vascular features are slow and subject to observer bias. These problems may be overcome using computer algorithms. Three automated methods and a manual method for measurement of arteriolar diameters from digitised red-free retinal photographs were compared.  METHODS— 60 diameters (in pixels) measured by manual identification of vessel edges in red-free retinal images were compared with diameters measured by (1) fitting vessel intensity profiles to a double Gaussian function by non-linear regression, (2) a standard edge detection algorithm (Sobel), and (3) determination of points of maximum intensity variation by a sliding linear regression filter (SLRF). Method agreement was analysed using Bland-Altman plots and the repeatability of each method was assessed.  RESULTS—Diameter estimations obtained using the SLRF method were the least scattered although diameters obtained were approximately 3  pixels greater than those measured manually. The SLRF method was the most repeatable and the Gaussian method less so. The Sobel method was the least consistent owing to frequent misinterpretation of the light reflex as the <b>vessel</b> <b>edge.</b>  CONCLUSION—Of the three automated methods compared, the SLRF method was the most consistent (defined as the method producing diameter estimations with the least scatter) and the most repeatable in measurements of retinal arteriolar diameter.

40|$|Acute ischemic events {{associated}} with atherosclerosis {{are most often}} caused by rupture or erosion of unstable plaques. Clinical {{studies have demonstrated that}} in-vivo multi- contrast MRI can characterize plaque morphology and composition to evaluate the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques. The standard protocol for carotid imaging uses the Double-Inversion-Recovery (DIR) Fast-Spin-Echo (FSE) pulse sequence to acquire black-blood 2 D high-resolution cross-sectional T, PDW and T 2 W images. With the addition of bright-blood Time-of-Flight images, it was demonstrated that in-vivo multi- contrast MRI could discriminate the major plaque components: lipid-rich necrotic core, intra-plaque haemorrhage, fibrous tissue and calcification. Given the nature and the large amount of multi-contrast MRI data, clinical studies of atherosclerosis would benefit from the availability of reliable and accurate automated techniques for image registration, segmentation and plaque classification. Recent multi-contrast MRI studies presented automatic plaque characterization methods that showed promising results under ex-vivo and in-vivo conditions. This thesis investigates some weaknesses in the current image acquisition and analysis techniques, which can affect the results of in- vivo MRI plaque characterization, and then proposes novel methods to advance the understanding of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries. An automated multi -contrast registration algorithm that corrects for misalignments between carotid images caused by patient motion using sub-pixel accuracy and different similarity metrics was developed and validated. This project also used an alternative in-vivo carotid imaging approach based on the DIR Multi-Echo-Spin-Echo (Multi-SE) pulse sequence that acquired a series of black-blood 2 D high-resolution cross-sectional images at different echo times. Quantitative T 2 maps and synthetic multi-contrast images of carotid arteries were calculated from the Multi-SE images. T 2 maps were automatically segmented and classified to provide in-vivo T 2 measurements of the main plaque components, while Multi-SE synthetic images were compared with FSE images to demonstrate that the FSE acquisition strategy causes a significant loss of <b>vessel</b> <b>edge</b> sharpness.

A masked observer marked individual RPD on IR images using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Using the macular volume scan (Cirrus, Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc, Dublin, CA), the RPE slab function was used to generate a C-scan of the most superficial choroidal vasculature. An independent masked grader created a topographic binary map of the choroidal vasculature by thresholding the en-face image, which was overlaid onto the IR map of RPD. For each IR image, ImageJ was used to generate a random set of dots as "control lesions". 17 eyes of 11 patients (78 ± 13. 7 years) with RPD were analyzed. The average number of RPD lesions identified on IR images was 414 ± 71. 5, of which 49. 6 ± 4. 3 % were located overlying the choroidal vasculature, compared to 45. 4 ± 4. 0 % in controls (p =  0. 014). 50. 4 ± 4. 3 % of lesions overlay the choroidal stroma, of which 76. 5 ± 3. 1 % were ≤ 3 pixels from the choroidal vessels. The percentage of RPD lesions located within ≤ 3 pixels from the choroidal vasculature was significantly greater than the percentage located ≥ 7 pixels away. (p< 0. 0001).

40|$|The {{segmentation}} of retinal {{blood vessels}} by digital color fundus images analysis {{is crucial for}} several medical diagnostic systems, such as the diabetic retinopathy early diagnosis.

This multi-agent approach is preceded by a preprocessing phase in which the fundamental filter is a Kirsch derivative improved version.

40|$|In {{the routine}} {{clinical}} setting, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is mostly performed using unspecific, low-molecular-weight gadolinium-based contrast agents. Because of {{their size and}} pharmacokinetic properties, these agents rapidly distribute into the extracellular space after IV injection. The rapid extravasation limits the use of unspecific agents for MRA with its rather long scan times that are needed to achieve high resolution. Because of these limitations, so-called blood pool contrast agents are needed for prolonged opacification of small vessels in high-resolution MR angiography, which {{is a prerequisite for}} evaluation of the coronary arteries. The blood pool contrast agent investigated in this study is VSOP-C 184, which belongs to the group of iron-oxide-based nanoparticles. This new agent differs from earlier particulate MR contrast agents that have so far undergone experimental or clinical testing in that the particles have a monomeric citrate coat and not a polymeric coat. This new coating is expected to improve both the effectiveness and tolerance of VSOP-C 184. In-vitro experiments and animal studies confirmed the expected favorable properties of VSOP-C 184 with regard to its effects on relaxavity, tolerance, and pharmacokinetic behavior, and these results justify further clinical investigation of the tolerance and effectiveness of VSOP-C 184. The aim {{of the present study was}} twofold: first, to investigate the tolerability of VSOP-C 184 in humans in a clinical phase 1 trial and, second, to determine whether this new blood pool contrast agent enables high-resolution imaging of the heart and coronary arteries. Tolerance of VSOP-C 184 was investigated in 18 healthy volunteers who were given the test drug at intravenous doses of 0. 015, 0. 045 or 0. 075 mmol Fe/kg (n = 5 per dose) or placebo (n = 1 per dose). The lowest dose was administered as a slow infusion and the other doses as an IV bolus. Before administration of the contrast agent and for up to 13 days at different time points after IV injection, the subjects vital parameters were determined, physical well-being was recorded, blood was sampled for clinical chemistry and relaxometry (0. 94 T), and urinalysis was performed. No serious adverse events were encountered during the study period. In the group receiving the highest dose of the contrast agent, one subject suffered a drop in blood pressure and another a decrease in oxygen partial pressure. Both effects were classified as nonserious adverse events but severe in intensity. The events were rated as being possibly associated with the study medication. In both cases, levels rapidly returned to normal without medical therapy. No relevant changes in vital or laboratory parameters were observed. As expected, there were transitional effects on iron metabolism which varied with the contrast dose administered. T 1 -relaxation time was shortened to less than 100 ms for 18 min in the group administered a dose of 0. 045 mmol Fe/kg versus 60 min in the group receiving 0. 075 mmol Fe/kg. In the phase Ib study, six healthy volunteers underwent coronary MRI at 1. 5 Tesla. First, the subjects were imaged with an unenhanced 3 D time-of-flight GRE sequence. Next, VSOP-C 184 was injected at a dose of 0. 045 mmol Fe/kg and the coronaries were imaged again with an inversion-prepared 3 D GRE sequence both during breath-hold and with the navigator technique. Quantitative analysis was done to determine contrast (signal difference-to-noise (SD/N) ratio), vessel demarcation (<b>vessel</b> <b>edge</b> definition, VED), and the diameter and length of the right coronary artery. In addition, the images were qualitatively evaluated. Differences were tested for significance using the Wilcoxon test for paired samples (p < 0. 05). In addition, data on the tolerance and safety of the test drug were recorded. Coronary MRA after administration of VSOP-C 184 yielded significantly higher SDNd ratios and VED both for the breath-hold sequence and for the navigator technique compared with unenhanced MRA. The diameter of the right coronary artery did not differ significantly between precontrast and postcontrast images. The length of the coronary arteries visualized was significantly longer after VSOP-C 184 administration than on the precontrast images. The qualitative scores assigned to the postcontrast images were higher for both techniques  breath-hold and navigator sequence  as compared with the precontrast images and the difference was significant for the navigator technique. In four of the six subjects, MRA using VSOP-C 184 enabled volumetric imaging of the entire heart and high-quality visualization of long segments of all three main coronary arteries. No relevant adverse effects were noted during the study and the observation period. In conclusion, the clinical phase I and phase Ib studies presented here show that the iron oxide particle preparation VSOP-C 184 is a well-tolerated blood pool contrast agent for MRA of the coronary arteries. The prolonged vascular opacification resulting from the long intravascular residence time of VSOP-C 184 enables imaging of the entire heart and the entire length of the three main coronary arteries in a single acquisition. These results justify further clinical development of VSOP-C 184 for magnetic resonance angiography of the coronary arteries...|$|E
40|$|Retina is {{the portion}} where many {{important}} eye diseases and systemic diseases manifest. By evaluating the retinal blood vessels, doctors can diagnose the primary stages of diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration, glaucoma etc which may {{eventually lead to}} blindness. The objective is to develop an algorithm that segments the retinal blood vessels {{in a short time}} and with high accuracy. But the low gray level contrast and dynamic range of the image make the blood vessel segmentation process very difficult. A new multiscale transform, Curvelet transform, is used for retinal image contrast enhancement. Since the blood vessels are distributed in various directions multistructure elements morphology is used to find the blood <b>vessel</b> <b>edges.</b> The false edges are removed by morphological reconstruction. A locally applied level dependent thresholding algorithm with connected component analysis and length filtering removes the remaining false edges after reconstruction step. The proposed algorithm, when experimentally applied on images from the DRIVE database, gave an accuracy of more than 97 % in less than 15 s, thus showing its effectiveness in retinal blood vessel segmentation...|$|R
40|$|The {{segmentation}} {{and analysis}} of blood vessels hasreceived much attention in the research community. Theresults aid numerous applications for diagnosis andtreatment of vascular diseases. Here we use level setpropagation with local phase information to capture theboundaries of vessels. The basic notion is that localphase, extracted using quadrature filters, allows us todistinguish between lines and edges in an image. Notingthat vessels appear either as lines or edge pairs, weintegrate multiple scales and capture information aboutvessels of varying width. The outcome is a “global”phase {{which can be used}} to drive a contour robustly towardsthe <b>vessel</b> <b>edges.</b> We show promising results in 2 D and 3 D. Comparison with a related method givessimilar or even better results and at a computationalcost several orders of magnitude less. Even with verysparse initializations, our method captures a large portionof the vessel tree. © 2009 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

40|$|Our {{application}} {{concerns the}} automated detection of vessels in retinal images to improve {{understanding of the}} disease mechanism, {{diagnosis and treatment of}} retinal and a number of systemic diseases. We propose a new framework for segmenting retinal vasculatures with much improved accuracy and efficiency. The proposed framework consists of three technical components: Retinex-based image inhomogeneity correction, local phase-based vessel enhancement and graph cut-based active contour segmentation. These procedures are applied in the following order. Underpinned by the Retinex theory, the inhomogeneity correction step aims to address challenges presented by the image intensity inhomogeneities, and the relatively low contrast of thin vessels compared to the background. The local phase enhancement technique is employed to enhance vessels for its superiority in preserving the <b>vessel</b> <b>edges.</b> The graph cut-based active contour method is used for its efficiency and effectiveness in segmenting the vessels from the enhanced images using the local phase filter. We have demonstrated its performance by applying it to four public retinal image datasets (3 datasets of color fundus photography and 1 of fluorescein angiography). Statistical analysis demonstrates that each component of the framework can provide the level of performance expected. The proposed framework is compared with widely used unsupervised and supervised methods, showing that the overall framework outperforms its competitors. For example, the achieved sensitivity (0 : 744), specificity (0 : 978) and accuracy (0 : 953) for the DRIVE dataset are very close to those of the manual annotations obtained by the second observer...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Vascular reconstructions are {{becoming}} challenging {{due to the}} comorbidity of the aging population and since the introduction of minimally invasive approaches. Many sutureless anastomosis devices {{have been designed to}} facilitate the cardiovascular surgeon's work and the vascular join (VJ) is one of these. We designed an animal study to assess its reliability and long-term efficacy. METHODS: VJ allows the construction of end-to-end and end-to-side anastomoses. It consists of two metallic crowns fixed to the extremity of the two conduits so that <b>vessel</b> <b>edges</b> are joined layer by layer. There is no foreign material exposed to blood. In adult sheep both carotid arteries were prepared and severed. End-to-end anastomoses were performed using the VJ device {{on one side and the}} classical running suture technique on the other side. Animals were followed-up with Duplex-scan every 3 months and sacrificed after 12 months. Histopathological analysis was carried out. RESULTS: In 20 animals all 22 sutureless anastomoses were successfully completed in less than 2 min versus 6 +/- 3 min for running suture. Duplex showed the occlusion of three controls and one sutureless anastomosis. Two controls and one sutureless had stenosis > 50 %. Histology showed very thin layer of myointimal hyperplasia (50 +/- 10 microm) in the sutureless group versus 300 +/- 27 microm in the control. No significant inflammatory reaction was detected. CONCLUSIONS: VJ provides edge-to-edge vascular repair that can be considered the most physiological way to restore vessel continuity. For the first time, in healthy sheep, an anastomotic device provided better results than suture technique...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{assisted}} vascular repair {{is a new}} optimized technique {{based on}} the use of ICG-infused chitosan patch to close a vessel wound, with or even without few supporting single stitches. We present an in vivo experimental study on an innovative end-to-end laser assisted vascular anastomotic (LAVA) technique, performed with the application of ICG-infused chitosan patches. The photostability and the mechanical properties of ICG-infused chitosan films were preliminary measured. The in vivo study was performed in 10 New Zealand rabbits. After anesthesia, a 3 -cm segment of the right common carotid artery was exposed, thus clamped proximally and distally. The artery was then interrupted by means of a full thickness cut. Three single microsutures were used to approximate the two <b>vessel</b> <b>edges.</b> The ICG-infused chitosan patch was rolled all over the anastomotic site and welded by the use of a diode laser emitting at 810 nm and equipped with a 300 mu m diameter optical fiber. Welding was obtained by delivering single laser spots to induce local patch/tissue adhesion. The result was an immediate closure of the anastomosis, with no bleeding at clamps release. Thus animals underwent different follow-up periods, in order to evaluate the welded vessels over time. At follow-up examinations, all the anastomoses were patent and no bleeding signs were documented. Samples of welded vessels underwent histological examinations. Results showed that this technique offer several advantages over conventional suturing methods: simplification of the surgical procedure, shortening of the operative time, better re-endothelization and optimal vascular healing proces...|$|R
