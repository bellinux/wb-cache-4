5000|$|Problems {{sometimes}} arise as to {{the exact}} legal status of a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> {{when there is a}} clear case of the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> existing in a [...] "" [...] between mild and severe overall impairment. Sometimes, even when in some ways severely impaired, a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> may still be competent enough to not be regarded by the relevant authorities as sufficiently childlike for long-term care. Guardianship is also a problem when the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> is completely without friends, family or acquaintances and legally-important matters (such as paperwork) must be properly filled out, but the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> is unable to understand what the paperwork contains or why it is important. In the United Kingdom, these situations are sometimes worsened by the Data Protection Act which prevents even some officials and/or appropriate adults from accessing the vulnerable adult's complete personal information for assistive purposes. Some countries solve these issues by getting the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> to sign power of attorney over to a relevant authority's representative, a solicitor providing the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> free legal help, or similar.|$|E

50|$|The Act closes a legal {{loophole}} that allows those jointly {{accused of the}} murder of a child or <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> to avoid prosecution by remaining silent or blaming each other; it puts a clear legal responsibility on adults who have frequent contact with a child or <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> to take reasonable steps of protection if they knew or should have known the child or <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> was at significant risk of serious physical harm from members of that household.|$|E

50|$|As {{defined in}} the psychology, {{sociology}} and social work fields, a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> is any person who lacks the absolute most basic (as distinct from mid-level or typical level) human life skills. A <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> is unable, rather than unwilling, to properly learn or properly maintain these skills, and is usually completely without, and unable to obtain, any family, friends, acquaintances or other assistive persons in their lives to offer education or assistance in these areas (see: abandonment). To be classed as vulnerable, the adult's circumstances must be unable to be altered or improved by the adult's own individual actions without direct assistance from a more typical adult. The <b>vulnerable</b> <b>adult</b> must also be shown to be, on some significant level, a risk {{to him or her}} self if assistance is not provided.|$|E
