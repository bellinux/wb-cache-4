Applying Bellamy's (Bellamy, R., 2004) concept of the lineages of citizenship to the case <b>of</b> <b>Montenegro,</b> this study explains how citizenship polices were used to manage the fragile political milieu within this weak and unconsolidated post-Yugoslav state. Further explanations for the restrictiveness <b>of</b> <b>Montenegro's</b> citizenship regime are based on the legacies of the different Yugoslav ‘citizenship constellations’. Yet {{as a consequence of the}} country's aspirations to join the European Union, the rigid citizenship regime <b>of</b> <b>Montenegro</b> remains permeable to international norms and influence. However, this ostensible normative elasticity does not make Montenegrin citizenship more liberal, as barriers for naturalisation remain high...|$|R
