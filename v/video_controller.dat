As shipped (i.e., without custom overclocking) it can emit these: 640×350 EGA; 640×480 VGA; 800×600 SVGA; 1024×768 XGA; 1280×720 720p HDTV; 1280×768 WXGA variant; 1280×800 WXGA variant; 1280×1024 SXGA; 1366×768 WXGA variant; 1400×1050 SXGA+; 1600×1200 UXGA; 1680×1050 WXGA+; 1920×1080 1080p HDTV; 1920×1200 WUXGA.|$|E
25|$|The 68000 and <b>video</b> <b>controller</b> {{took turns}} {{accessing}} DRAM every four CPU cycles during {{display of the}} frame buffer, while the 68000 had unrestricted access to DRAM during vertical and horizontal blanking intervals. Such an arrangement reduced the overall performance of the CPU as much as 35% for most code as the display logic often blocked the CPU's access to RAM. This made the machine run more slowly than several of its competitors, despite the nominally high clock rate.|$|E

5000|$|A typical Voodoo Graphics PCI {{expansion}} card {{consisted of a}} DAC, a frame buffer processor and a texture mapping unit, along with 4 MB of EDO DRAM. The RAM and graphics processors operated at 50 MHz. It provided only 3D acceleration and as such the computer also needed a traditional <b>video</b> <b>controller</b> for conventional 2D software. A pass-through VGA cable daisy-chained the <b>video</b> <b>controller</b> to the Voodoo, which was itself connected to the monitor. The method used to engage the Voodoo's output circuitry varied between cards, with some using mechanical relays while others utilized purely electronic components. The mechanical relays emitted an audible [...] "clicking" [...] sound when they engaged and disengaged.|$|E
