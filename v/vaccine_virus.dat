25|$|Present {{vaccination}} {{strategies for}} SIV {{control and prevention}} in swine farms typically {{include the use of}} one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the <b>vaccine</b> <b>virus</b> and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses. The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.|$|E
2500|$|Listeria monocytogenes, {{some species}} of Rickettsia, Shigella flexneri and other {{intracellular}} germs escape from phagocytic vacuoles by coating {{themselves with a}} capsule of actin filaments. L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri both generate a tail {{in the form of}} a [...] "comet tail" [...] that gives them mobility. Each species exhibits small differences in the molecular polymerization mechanism of their [...] "comet tailsÂ». [...] Different displacement velocities have been observed, for example, with Listeria and Shigella found to be the fastest. Many experiments have demonstrated this mechanism in vitro. This indicates that the bacteria are not using a myosin-like protein motor, and it appears that their propulsion is acquired from the pressure exerted by the polymerization that takes place near to the microorganism's cell wall. The bacteria have previously been surrounded by ABPs from the host, and as a minimum the covering contains Arp2/3 complex, Ena/VASP proteins, cofilin, a buffering protein and nucleation promoters, such as vinculin complex. Through these movements they form protrusions that reach the neighbouring cells, infecting them as well so that the immune system can only fight the infection through cell immunity. The movement could be caused by the modification of the curve and debranching of the filaments. Other species, such as Mycobacterium marinum and Burkholderia pseudomallei, are also capable of localized polymerization of cellular actin to aid their movement through a mechanism that is centered on the Arp2/3 complex. In addition the <b>vaccine</b> <b>virus</b> Vaccinia also uses elements of the actin cytoskeleton for its dissemination.|$|E
