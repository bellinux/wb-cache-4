Cerebral {{pressure}} autoregulation is {{an important}} neuroprotective mechanism that stabilizes cerebral blood flow when blood pressure (BP) changes In this study the authors examined the association between autoregulation and clinical factors. BR. intracranial pressure (ICP), brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO(2)), and outcome after pediatric severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). In particular we examined how the Status 01 : autoregulation influenced the effect of BP changes on ICP and PbtO(2) Methods In this prospective observational study. 52 autoregulation tests were performed in 24 patients with severe. TBI. The patients had {{a mean age of}} 6. 3 +/- 3. 2 years. and a postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6 (range 3 - 8). All patients underwent continuous ICP and MID, monitoring. and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was, used to examine the autoregulatory index (ARI) based on blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery after increasing mean arterial pressure by 20 % of the baseline <b>value</b> <b>Impaired</b> autoregulation was defined as an ARI = 0 4 The relationships between autoregulation (measured as both a Continuous and dichotomous variable), outcome, and clinical and physiological variables were examined using Multiple logistic regression analysis Results. Autoregulation was impaired (ART < 0 4) in 29 % of patients (7 patients). The initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was significantly associated with the ARI (p = 0. 02, r = 0. 32) but no other clinical factors were associated with autoregulation Status. Baseline values at the time of testing for ICP, PbtO(2), the ratio PbtO(2) /PaO 2, mean arterial pressure, and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity were similar in the patients with impaired or intact autoregulation. There was an inverse relationship between ART (continuous and dichotomous) with a chancle in ICP (continuous ARI, p 0. 005, dichotomous ARI, p = 0 02) : that is. ICP increased with the BP increase when ARI was low (weak autoregulation) The ART (continuous and dichotomous) was also inversely associated with a change in PbtO(2). (continuous ART. p 0. 002. dichotomous ARI, p = 0 02). The PbtO(2) increased when BP was increased in most patients, even when the ARI was relatively high (stronger autoregulation). but the magnitude of this response was still associated with the ART. There was no relationship between the ART and Outcome Conclusion. These data demonstrate the influence of the strength of autoregulation on the response of ICP and MO. to BP changes and the variability of this response between individuals The findings suggest that autoregulation testing may assist clinical decision-making in pediatric severe TBI and help better define optimal BP or cerebral perfusion pressure targets for individual patients.

40|$|International audienceMODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) {{satellite}} observations of fire size and ERA-Interim meteorological reanalysis {{are used to}} derive a relationship between burnt area and wind speed over the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe. The largest wildfire size does not show a strong response with respect to wind speed in Eastern Europe. In the Mediterranean, as intuitively expected, the burnt area associated with the largest wildfires is an increasing function of wind speed for moderate temperature anomalies. In situations of severe heatwaves, the relationship between burnt area and wind speed displays a bimodal shape. Burnt areas are large for low 10 m wind speed (lower than 2 m s− 1), decrease for moderate wind speed values (lower than 5 m s− 1 and larger than 2 m s− 1) and increase again for high wind speed (higher than 5 m s− 1). To explain such behavior we use a stochastic model of fire propagation, known as a probabilistic cellular automata. This model uses a probabilistic local rule to derive the total burnt area. The observed relationship between burnt area and wind speed can be interpreted in terms of percolation threshold above which the propagation in the model is infinite, which mainly depends on local terrain slope and vegetation state (type, density, fuel moisture). In Eastern Europe, the percolation threshold is never exceeded for observed wind speeds. In the Mediterranean Basin we see two behaviors. During moderately hot weather, the percolation threshold is passed when the wind grows strong. On the other hand, in situations of severe Mediterranean heatwaves, moderate wind speed <b>values</b> <b>impair</b> the propagation of the wildfire against the wind and do not sufficiently accelerate the forward propagation to allow a growth of wildfire size...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground and purposeTo analyze plasma adiponectin {{kinetics}} {{in patients}} with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) and its association with coronary flow reserve (CFR), an index of coronary microcirculatory function. MethodsA total of 96 consecutive patients with the first anterior STEMI treated by pPCI without heart failure were included. CFR was assessed on the 7 th day after pPCI. Plasma adiponectin was measured on admission before pPCI, and on the 2 nd and 7 th day after pPCI. ResultsAdiponectin concentration was the highest on admission, declined {{to the lowest level}} on the 2 nd day, and rose on the 7 th day remaining below admission <b>values.</b> <b>Impaired</b> coronary microcirculatory function (CFR< 2) was observed in 41 % of the patients. Adiponectin concentrations significantly positively correlated with CFR, and the strongest correlation was with the 2 nd day adiponectin (r= 0. 489, p< 0. 001). In multivariate models, adiponectin concentrations were independent predictors of impaired CFR [on admission: odds ratio (OR) 0. 175, confidence interval (CI) : 0. 047 – 0. 654, p= 0. 010; 2 nd day: OR 0. 146, 95 % CI: 0. 044 – 0. 485, p= 0. 002; 7 th day: OR 0. 198, CI: 0. 064 – 0. 611, p= 0. 005]. The best power to predict impaired CFR was the 2 nd day adiponectin. Delta values of adiponectin (differences between adiponectin concentrations) did not correlate with CFR. ConclusionsIn patients with the first anterior STEMI treated by pPCI plasma adiponectin concentrations before and after pPCI are strongly associated with CFR. Our results support the hypothesis that low adiponectin, especially during the early post-pPCI period, carries the risk for impaired coronary microcirculatory function in STEMI patients...|$|R
40|$|Decision-making {{capacity}} is {{an increasingly important}} medico-legal concept. The recent Mental Capacity Act employs a cognitive, process-based test of capacity, but in many psychiatric conditions pathological beliefs and <b>values</b> <b>impair</b> capacity even when the decision-making process is logically coherent. In such cases, capacity assessments implicitly rely on normative epistemic and evaluative standards. This raises a worry for the capacity test’s reliability, objectivity and tolerance of differences in beliefs and values. There is currently little conceptual research on capacity and the normative standards underpinning its assessment. This thesis makes an original contribution to research by employing a number of philosophical approaches to map out a conceptual terrain within which questions about the substantive standards of capacity assessment can be framed. Focusing {{on the nature of}} epistemic standards and third-person judgements about decision-making, the thesis examines the normative constraints determining what counts as a recognisable reason for a decision. It employs the theoretical apparatus of Davidson’s project of Radical Interpretation to explore the epistemology of interpretation, interrogating the conditions under which intentional attribution and the provision of reason explanations for behaviour are possible. It is contended that beliefs are intrinsically rational and intersubjective, and that judgements of irrationality are only possible against a background of shared belief between interpreter and observed agent. This view is defended against the objection that rationality is too stringent a constraint on belief. A misconception giving rise to this objection is then diagnosed. Drawing an analogy with Wittgenstein’s rule-following considerations, it is submitted that the constitutive normativity of belief need not be codified in order to exert a genuine constraint on intentional behaviour. Rather, the norms of belief ought to be construed as emerging from shared practice. This indicates that normative judgements are disciplined through expertise and experience, rather than adherence to abstract principles. Finally, the implications of these insights for conceptualising and assessing capacity are considered...|$|R

Thus, the present study aimed at evaluating a group of subjects suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis alone to investigate the presence of spirometric impairment and BHR both during and outside the pollen season. Methods: One-hundred rhinitics sensitized to pollen allergens only were evaluated during and outside the pollen season. Spirometry and methacholine bronchial challenge were performed. Results: Four rhinitics showed <b>impaired</b> <b>values</b> of FEV 1 without referred symptoms of asthma during the pollen season.

Fifty-four patients showed positive methacholine bronchial challenge both during and outside the pollen season. PD 20 /FEV 1 methacholine was lower during the pollen season than outside (P< 0. 05). In BHR positive patients, reduced values of FVC (P< 0. 05), FEV 1 (P< 0. 05), and FEF 25 – 75 (P< 0. 01) were significantly demonstrated in comparison with BHR negative rhinitics. There was a relationship between BHR degree and FEF 25 – 75 values only during the pollen season (P< 0. 001). Conclusions: This study evidences that an impairment of spirometric parameters may be observed also in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis alone during the pollen season. A high percentage of these patients had BHR. A close relationship between upper and lower airways is confirmed also in the model of pollen allergy.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to further penetrate the impact of pHPT on glucose, urate, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, known to be interrelated metabolic cardiovascular risk factors. DESIGN: Longitudinal study of patients with pHPT before and 1 year after surgical treatment. SETTING: Departments of Internal Medicine and Surgery, Lund University Hospital. SUBJECTS: One hundred and seventeen consecutive patients with pHPT referred to surgical treatment. At presentation. 11 patients had previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus. INTERVENTION: All patients were successfully operated for pHPT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting blood glucose and serum concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride and urate were determined before and 1 year after surgery. The concentration of LDL- and HDL-cholesterol was separately analyzed in 21 cases. These data as well as the systolic and diastolic blood pressure were related to intact PTH and ionized calcium at presentation. Glomerular filtration was separately measured pre-operatively and related to the urate values. RESULTS: While the mean value for glucose remained unchanged among 11 patients with previously diagnosed diabetes at presentation, a significant decrease of glucose from 5. 03 +/- 0. 13 to 4. 71 +/- 0. 08 mmol/L (P < 0. 05) was found among patients without known diabetes. Out of these patients, eight had diabetic glucose values at presentation, decreasing from 8. 35 +/- 0. 54 to 5. 10 +/- 0. 35 mmol/L (P < 0. 05), and 12 had glucose <b>values</b> indicating <b>impaired</b> glucose tolerance, decreasing from 5. 94 +/- 0. 06 to 5. 10 +/- 0. 38 mmol/L (P < 0. 05) after surgery.

However, male patients had significantly lower triglyceride levels at follow-up, 1. 16 +/- 0. 09 mmol/L compared to 1. 57 +/- 0. 14 mmol/L before surgery (P < 0. 05). Significantly lower triglyceride values were also found among patients with glucose <b>values</b> indicating <b>impaired</b> glucose tolerance at presentation. The LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio remained normal.

Those that retained more than 1. 4 % of the normal endonuclease activity were essentially normal in transformation; those with less than 1 % were defective. The transformation-defective end mutants appear to be blocked in the entry of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) since they carry out the prior step of binding DNA to the outside of the cell.

Research on the <b>value</b> of <b>impaired</b> cognition for psychosis prediction in at-risk samples, however, mainly relies on study-specific sample means of neurocognitive tests, which unlike widely available general test norms are difficult to translate into clinical practice. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the combined predictive value of at-risk criteria and neurocognitive deficits according to test norms with a risk stratification approach. Method: Potential predictors of psychosis (neurocognitive deficits and at-risk criteria) over 24 months were investigated in 97 at-risk patients. Results: The final prediction model included (1) at-risk criteria (attenuated psychotic symptoms plus subjective cognitive disturbances) and (2) a processing speed deficit (digit symbol test). The model was stratified into 4 risk classes with hazard rates between 0. 0 (both predictors absent) and 1. 29 (both predictors present). Conclusions: The combination of a processing speed deficit and at-risk criteria provides an optimized stratified risk assessment. Based on neurocognitive test norms, the validity of our proposed 3 risk classes could easily be examined in independent at-risk samples and, pending positive validation results, our approach could easily be applied in clinical practice in the future...|$|R

MethodsForty-three consecutive patients with congenital cardiac disease were included in this prospective study. Parameters of heart rate turbulence and heart rate variability were calculated from Holter electrocardiograms. In addition, serum brain natriuretic peptide levels were measured. A combined end point of sudden cardiac death or nearly missed sudden cardiac death was used.

On univariate analysis, both brain natriuretic peptide levels and parameters of heart rate variability and heart rate turbulence were associated with impaired prognosis. On multivariate analysis, pathologic heart rate turbulence was found to be the strongest independent risk stratifier (hazard ratio, 61. 5; P <. 001). ConclusionsImpaired cardiac autonomic nervous activity is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in congenital cardiac disease. Our results suggest that heart rate turbulence might be superior to established markers of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, such as heart rate variability. The combined use of heart rate turbulence, heart rate variability, and markers of neurohormonal activation, such as brain natriuretic peptide, might further improve the prognostic value...|$|R
40|$|The sick {{newborn infant}} is {{vulnerable}} to brain injury and impaired cerebral autoregulation is thought to contribute to this. Coherent averaging is a method of measuring the dynamic cerebral autoregulatory response that is particularly suitable for neonates. We used this method in combination {{with a measure of}} the gradient of the cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) response following transient blood pressure (BP) peaks to study dynamic autoregulation in infants undergoing intensive care. Term and preterm infants at high risk of neurologic injury were compared with a control group of infants, also undergoing intensive care. Simultaneous video-EEG, CBFV (using transcranial Doppler), and arterial blood pressure measurements were obtained intermittently during a study period of at least 2 h. Cerebral autoregulatory response curves were constructed for high risk and control groups. Intact cerebral autoregulation produces a characteristic response consisting of a brief period when CBFV follows arterial blood pressure but quickly returns to baseline <b>value.</b> An <b>impaired</b> autoregulatory response shows CBFV mirroring the arterial blood pressure curve closely. Thirteen high-risk infants, who also had seizures (10 term and 3 preterm) and 12 control infants (6 term and 6 preterm) were studied. Autoregulation was absent in high-risk term and preterm infants. It was also absent in preterm control infants. Term, neurologically healthy infants undergoing intensive care have an intact autoregulatory response. The constant passive response seen in high-risk infants may reflect the severity of the underlying neurologic disease. 7385...|$|R
40|$|To {{establish}} {{the effects of}} alpha-adrenoceptor blockade on dopamine-induced changes in renal hemodynamics and sodium excretion, dopamine dose-response curves were performed without and with pre-treatment with the selective postsynaptic alpha- 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin in normal volunteers and in patients with renal disease and moderately impaired renal function. Prazosin (1 mg p. o. every 4 h) in 7 volunteers did not significantly affect baseline <b>values</b> but <b>impaired</b> the response of effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and filtration fraction (FF) to infusions of dopamine in doses ranging from 0. 5 to 8 -mu-g/kg per minute and completely abolished the dopamine-induced increase in sodium excretion. In 7 patients with renal disease and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ranging from 38 - 85 ml/min pretreatment with prazosin did not affect baseline ERPF, GFR or FF or their response to dopamine infusion, but sodium excretion and its response to dopamine infusion were reduced (fractional excretion of sodium at baseline 1. 78 without and 0. 89 with prazosin pretreatment). We conclude that alpha- 1 -adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin abolishes the effects of exogenous dopamine on sodium excretion in normal man. Prazosin also impairs the renal vasodilatory action of dopamine. However, the effect on sodium excretion is {{not directly related to}} inhibition of dopamine-induced renal vasodilation since in patients with renal disease prazosin also markedly reduces sodium excretion but does not influence the renal hemodynamic effects of dopamine...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{saturation}} {{and carbon}} dioxide values should be monitored during high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV). Modern transcutaneous P 2 (Ptc 2) measurement allows the estimation of ventilation efficiency. We studied how tests of lung function could predict carbon dioxide elimination during HFJV. Lung function tests from 180 adult patients undergoing rigid bronchoscopy were analysed as factors affecting carbon dioxide elimination. The lung function test results showed a significant relationship with the efficiency of carbon dioxide elimination; the greatest impairment of carbon dioxide elimination was found in patients with combined abnormalities of lung function. Further factors associated with difficult carbon dioxide elimination were male gender and elevated body weight. Of the patients investigated, 72 % had normal carbon dioxide elimination, whereas in 23 % hypercapnia could be avoided only by increasing the driving pressure. The prevalence of abnormal preoperative lung function test results predicts (sensitivity 76 %, positive predictive <b>value</b> 27 %) <b>impaired</b> carbon dioxide elimination during jet ventilation and rigid bronchoscop...|$|R
40|$|The case of {{a patient}} with Crohn's disease {{complicated}} by progressive and irreversible encephalopathy, {{who had been on}} long-term total parenteral nutrition due to short bowel syndrome, is described. He initially experienced a disturbance of his vision, which was followed by various neurological symptoms during the next 3 years. These symptoms rapidly progressed until he finally developed consciousness disturbance. He also manifested erythrocytic macrocytosis, a low serum level of tri-iodothyronine and a high level of thyroxine. His blood levels of various trace minerals and vitamins were normal, except for selenium, which showed extremely low <b>values.</b> In addition, <b>impaired</b> plasma glutathione peroxidase activity was confirmed. After intravenous supplementation of selenium, macrocytosis, tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine values, and glutathione peroxidase activity all became normalized, yet he improved little neurologically. Our case suggests that long-term selenium deficiency may cause progressive and irreversible encephalopathy, and that careful monitoring of this mineral is necessary when an excessive period of total parenteral nutrition is being considered in the clinical setting...|$|R
40|$|Since insulin {{increases}} renal sodium reabsorption, hyperinsulinaemia in insulin-treated {{insulin-dependent diabetes}} mellitus {{might lead to}} sodium retention and, in turn, increase atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) values. We investigated ANF levels in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with and without hypertension. We infused saline (2 mmol/kg per 90 min) in nine normotensive controls, eight normotensive diabetics, seven hypertensive controls and six hypertensive diabetics during {{the imposition of a}} euglycaemic glucose clamp with an artificial pancreas. Baseline ANF values were higher in the normotensive and hypertensive diabetics than in the normotensive and hypertensive controls. During a sodium load the sodium excretion rate increased significantly in controls but not in the diabetic groups. The ANF pattern was similar, values being significantly increased in controls and unchanged in diabetic patients. We conclude that euglycaemic, slightly hyperinsulinaemic, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with and without hypertension are characterized by higher baseline ANF <b>values</b> and an <b>impaired</b> response to an acute saline load as shown by the sodium excretion rate and the plasma ANF concentration...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} to develop a strain {{analysis}} method to evaluate the left ventricular (LV) functions in type 2 diabetic patients with an asymptomatic LV diastolic dysfunction. Methods: Two groups (10 asymptomatic type 2 diabetic subjects and 10 control ones) were considered. All of the subjects had normal ejection fraction <b>values</b> but <b>impaired</b> diastolic functions assessed by the transmitral blood flow velocity. For each subject, based on cardiac MRI, global indexes including LV volume, LV myocardial mass, cardiac index (CI), and transmitral peak velocity, were measured, and regional indexes (i. e., LV deformation, strain and strain rate) were calculated through an image-registration technology. Results: Most of the global indexes did not differentiate between the two groups, except for the CI, LV myocardial mass and transmitral peak velocity. While for the regional indexes, the global LV diastolic dysfunction of the diabetic indicated an increased strain (0. 08 [*]±[*] 0. 044 vs. − 0. 031 [*]±[*] 0. 077, p[*]=[*] 0. 001) and a reduced strain rate (1. 834 [*]±[*] 0. 909 vs. 3. 791 [*]±[*] 2. 394, p[*]=[*] 0. 033) compared to the controls, moreover, the local LV diastolic dysfunction reflected by the strain and strain rate varied, and the degree of dysfunction gradually decreased from the basal level to the apical level. Conclusions: The results showed that the strain and strain rates are effective to capture the subtle alterations of the LV functions, and the proposed method can be used to estimate the LV myocardial function based on cardiac MRI...|$|R
