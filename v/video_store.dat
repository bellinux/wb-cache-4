5|$|Located {{within the}} hamlet are a defunct, former dairy creamery {{and the site}} of the former Gardiner {{railroad}} station. Built in 1881 and opened the following year, the creamery was one of the dairies that transported its products to New York City by way of the Wallkill Valley Railroad. It was originally the property of the Borden family, but closed in the 1920s, and has since been renovated as an apartment complex. The former Gardiner railroad station ceased operations when the rail line closed. It became a sporting goods store by 1981, a <b>video</b> <b>store</b> by the early 1990s, and an antique store by 1995. The station burned down on October10, 2002.|$|E
5|$|Quentin Tarantino {{had been}} working at Video Archives, a <b>video</b> <b>store</b> in Manhattan Beach, California, and {{originally}} planned to shoot the film with his friends on a budget of $30,000 in a 16mm black-and-white format, with producer Lawrence Bender playing a police officer chasing Mr. Pink. Bender gave the script to his acting teacher, whose wife gave the script to Harvey Keitel. Keitel liked it enough to sign as a co-producer so Tarantino and Bender would have an easier job finding funding; with his assistance, they raised $1.5 million. Keitel also paid for Tarantino and Bender to host casting sessions in New York, where the duo found Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth.|$|E

25|$|Citing {{contractual}} obligations to deliver an R rating, Warner Bros. digitally altered the orgy for the American release, blocking out graphic sexuality by inserting additional figures {{to obscure the}} view, avoiding an adults-only NC-17 rating that limited distribution, as some large American theaters and <b>video</b> <b>store</b> operators disallow films with that rating. This alteration antagonized film critics and cinephiles, as they argued that Kubrick had never been shy about ratings (A Clockwork Orange was originally given an X-rating). The unrated version of Eyes Wide Shut was released in the United States on October 23, 2007, in DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc formats.|$|E

25|$|People rely on compulsions as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on {{the context in which}} the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a <b>video</b> <b>store,</b> but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.|$|E

25|$|In Australia, {{the first}} Blockbuster store was opened in 1991 in Melbourne. In 1992, the Virgin Group and Blockbuster Inc {{entered into a}} joint venture to set up Australia's first Virgin Megastores in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. This lasted until Virgin sold its {{interest}} in the six stores to Blockbuster, which promptly rebranded them in 1993 as Blockbuster Music. In 1994 Australian store numbers rose to 54 with the acquisition of Major Video and Focus chains in both Victoria and South Australia. In 1995, the growth continued {{with the opening of}} the 100th <b>video</b> <b>store</b> in the country. By the end of 1998, Blockbuster Australia opened over 125 stores. In July 1998, Blockbuster Australia launched into franchising with the conversion of the former Video Flicks franchise group in Queensland, and the former Movieland group in Western Australia six months later. Also in 1998, the company sold its last two Australian Blockbuster Music stores in Pitt Street, Sydney, and Chapel Street, Melbourne to Brazin Limited, which incorporated them under its Sanity Entertainment brand. Throughout 1999 and 2000, Blockbuster Australia quickly expanded its franchise store network through the conversion of smaller groups and the granting of individual franchises. Before 2005, this was done through the acquisition of the Movies Plus Group and the conversion of some individual Movies 4U and Movieland outlets.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Brunner also {{represented}} neighbors {{of an adult}} <b>video</b> <b>store</b> that was being razed {{to make way for}} a McDonald's store in an affluent neighborhood.

[...] The Bexley, OH neighborhood hosts the Ohio Governor's Mansion and mansions once owned by Hustler publisher Larry Flynt and The Limited chairman Les Wexner. [...] She got citizens to appear before the zoning appeals board to attempt to stop the construction. The Citizens were unsuccessful in convincing the Board of Zoning Appeals to change their earlier decisions. [...] After the citizens were unsuccessful with the zoning board, they pursued remedy in the Franklin County Common Pleas Court. [...] In addition to the court proceedings, the citizens sought the attention of the City Council in attempt to preserve the neighborhood by keeping the <b>video</b> <b>store</b> from being converted into a McDonald's. [...] On April 7, 1995, Brunner gained a verdict for her clients that in the interest of avoiding traffic congestion and pedestrian dangers, the McDonald's would not be allowed to build. [...] The developer attempted to appeal the decision by obtaining friend-of-the-court briefs from surrounding municipalities. The Franklin County Appeals Court overturned the lower court ruling making way for the construction of the McDonald's. [...] Brunner's clients appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. [...] A few other cases against the developers remained in some lower courts. [...] However, these were unsuccessful. [...] After the lower court zoning victory, in May 1995, she was hired to oppose a [...] project.|$|E
