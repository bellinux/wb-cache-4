The barriers and challenges to economic application and to certification are presented and recommendations for accelerated development are outlined.

40|$|<b>Vehicle</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> shudder is sensitively felt by {{customers}} {{when the}} vehicle is driven at a low speed under drive away acceleration. The take-off shudder is complained of significantly by customers according to after sales statistics. Under an engine torque and half shaft angle, the drive-away shudder usually occurs during acceleration to a specific low speed, which makes the vehicle shakes severely. Aiming to provide a thorough investigation with possible design optimization of mounting system to reduce this lateral vibration, this paper focuses on a small car, the take-off shudder of which occurs at the speeds between 20 Km/h and 30 Km/h. A 12 Degree of Freedom (DOF) rigid body model will be established to simulate the engine and body system. The design of powertrain mounting system will be modified to achieve {{the reduction of the}} shudder level...|$|E
40|$|In-flight oxygen {{collection}} {{enables a}} significant reduction in takeoff gross weight of space launchers, thereby allowing airplane-like operations. This paper describes the development and tests of a compact rotary air separation device that constitutes a part of a functional oxygen collection plant. The experimental results are described in detail, demonstrating a consistent and long duration operation of the device yielding a high purity of liquid enriched air(96 % oxygen) while causing only very small pressure drops on the gaseous phase. The tests indicate that the height of a socalled ideal tray for the current device is around 1 to 2 cmof core foam material, which is an improvement of one order of magnitude compared with previous designs. The experimental results are scaled up and applied to two different two stage to orbit launch vehicles. It is shown that a complete oxygen collection plant for a subsonic collection phase would weigh around 4 tons and occupy approximately 6 m 3, which represents less than 1 % of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> weight and a specific mass and volume, respectively, of 450 kg/(kg/s) and 0. 67 m 3 /(kg/s) of liquid oxygen generated. For a supersonic collection, a much bigger collection plant is required due to a much higher oxygen production rate, and further improvements are required to reduce its system mass and volume despite a reduction in both specific mass and volume. © 2012 AIAA.

500|$|One area of {{development}} that Sinclair purposely avoided was battery technology. Electric vehicles powered by lead-acid batteries had once actually outnumbered {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles; in 1912 nearly 34,000 electric cars were registered in the U.S. However, the efficiency of internal combustion engines greatly improved while battery technology advanced much more slowly, leading to petrol and diesel-driven vehicles dominating the market. By 1978, out of 17.6 million registered vehicles on Britain's roads, only 45,000 were electric vehicles in day-to-day use and of those, 90% were milkfloats. Sinclair chose to rely on existing lead-acid battery technology, avoiding the great expense of developing a more efficient type.

40|$|The {{object of}} this design class was to design an earth-to orbit vehicle {{to replace the}} present NASA space shuttle. The major motivations for {{designing}} a new vehicle were {{to reduce the cost}} of putting payloads into orbit and to design a vehicle that could better service the space station with a faster turn-around time. Another factor considered in the design was that near-term technology was to be used. Materials, engines and other important technologies were to be realized in the next 10 to 15 years. The first concept put forth by NASA to meet these objectives was the National Aerospace Plane (NASP). The NASP is a single-stage earth-to-orbit air-breathing vehicle. This concept ran into problems with the air-breathing engine providing enough thrust in the upper atmosphere, among other things. The solution of this design class is a two-stage-to-orbit vehicle. The first stage is air-breathing and the second stage is rocket-powered, similar to the space shuttle. The second stage is mounted {{on the top of the}} first stage in a piggy-back style. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> horizontally using only air-breathing engines, flies to Mach six at 100, 000 feet, and launches the second stage towards its orbital path. The first stage, or booster, will weigh approximately 800, 000 pounds and the second stage, or orbiter will weigh approximately 300, 000 pounds. The major advantage of this design is the full recoverability of the first stage compared with the present solid rocket booster that are only partially recoverable and used only a few times. This reduces the cost as well as providing a more reliable and more readily available design for servicing the space station. The booster can fly an orbiter up, turn around, land, refuel, and be ready to launch another orbiter in a matter of hours...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT:The {{issue of}} the {{longitudinal}} stability of a WIG vehicle {{has been a very}} critical design factor since the first experimental WIG vehicle has been built.

The present work focuses on stability requirement for longitudinal motion from taking off to landing. The model of dynamics for a WIG vehicle was developed taking into account the aerodynamic, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and then was analyzed. Following with the longitudinal static stability analysis, effect of hydrofoil was discussed. Locations of CG, aerodynamic center in pitch, aerodynamic center in height and hydrodynamic center in heave were illustrated for a stabilized WIG vehicle. The present work will further improve the longitudinal static stability theory for WIG vehicle...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a visually based autopilot which is able to make an air <b>vehicle</b> automatically <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> cruise and land, while reacting appropriately to wind disturbances (head wind and tail wind). This autopilot consists of a visual control system that adjusts the thrust so as to keep the downward optic flow (OF) at a constant value. This autopilot is therefore based on an optic flow regulation loop. It makes use of a sensor, which is known as an elementary motion detector (EMD). The functional structure of this EMD was inspired by that of the housefly, which was previously investigated at our Laboratory by performing electrophysiological recordings while applying optical microstimuli to single photoreceptor cells of the insect’s compound eye. We built a proof-of-concept, tethered rotorcraft that circles indoors over an environment composed of contrasting features randomly arranged on the floor. The autopilot, which we have called OCTAVE (Optic flow based Control sysTem for Aerial VEhicles), enables this miniature (100 g) rotorcraft to carry out complex tasks such as ground avoidance and terrain following, to control risky maneuvers such as automatic <b>take</b> <b>off</b> and automatic landing, and to respond appropriately to wind disturbances. A single visuomotor control loop suffices to perform all these reputedly demanding tasks. As the electronic processing system required is extremely light-weight (only a few grams), it can be mounted on-board micro-air vehicles (MAVs) as well as larger unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) or even submarines and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). But the OCTAVE autopilot could also provide guidance and/or warning signals to prevent the pilots of manned aircraft from colliding with shallow terrain, for example...|$|R
