500|$|... "Born Free" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel Cerone and {{executive}} producer Melissa Rosenberg, and was directed by Michael Cuesta. Cerone and Rosenberg have written two previous episodes each, while this episode marked Cuesta's fifth time returning as director. Guest stars in this episode include Geoff Pierson, C. S. Lee, Mark Pellegrino, Christian Camargo, Judith Scott and Scott Atkinson. Rudy's apartment was set in Miami, Florida, however filming took place in Long Beach, California. The apartment was a brown, triangular apartment condo, so the producers altered its appearance; a false brick wall was {{placed in front of}} the garage entrance and a door was created. The producers also concealed a narrow door of the garage entrance with a potted plant, and added false window panes to the windows, concealing the existing <b>vertical</b> <b>blinds.</b> The shipping yard shown in the episode was set in the Port of Miami, yet filming took place in a port dock at the Port of Los Angeles. The scene was filmed in San Pedro, California, in a waterfront lot of Harbor Boulevard.|$|E

Unspecified changes made by Warnecke led to $4.2 million ($ in [...] dollars) in cost savings, however. These allowed certain items to be restored, such as the large hearing room, auxiliary area carpeting, <b>vertical</b> <b>blinds,</b> and the gymnasium equipment (now estimated to cost just $736,000 ($ in [...] dollars)). The cost savings also allowed the Architect of the Capitol to build a tennis court on the building's roof.|$|E

2500|$|By August 1978, actual {{construction}} costs were now $85 million ($ in [...] dollars) and {{were expected to}} top $122 million ($ in [...] dollars). The Senate approved a plan to spend another $54 million ($ in [...] dollars) on the structure, and cap costs at $135 million ($ in [...] dollars). [...] Initially, the House approved this plan. But when constituents bitterly complained, the House reversed itself on both counts. By 1979, construction estimates had soared to $179 million ($ in [...] dollars), and the General Accounting Office said it would rise to $230 million ($ in [...] dollars) without changes. In July 1979, the Senate agreed to cap costs at $137.7 million ($ in [...] dollars) after an acrimonious three-hour debate during which some senators suggested the building be torn down. The Architect of the Capitol ordered changes in the design to keep {{construction costs}} under the $137.7 million cap. These included elimination of a penthouse-level dining room, $906,000 ($ in [...] dollars) in furnishings for an interior gymnasium, oak paneling for each senator's office, dimmer switches for lights, a $400,000 ($ in [...] dollars) art gallery, $227,000 ($ in [...] dollars) in carpeting for auxiliary space, $167,700 ($ in [...] dollars) for <b>vertical</b> <b>blinds,</b> and $1.2 million [...] ($ in [...] dollars) for finishes and furnishings for a large central hearing room with hidden multimedia bays.|$|E
50|$|Stationary <b>vertical</b> <b>blinds</b> are {{hung in the}} doorways of some {{homes and}} {{businesses}} which generally leave the door open. Movement of the blind may signal a change in air flow, or someone entering the doorway. More commonly however, these <b>vertical</b> <b>blinds</b> are made of thick plastic. In the cold rooms of food businesses, this slows the heat leakage into the cold room. In warmer climates, <b>vertical</b> <b>blinds</b> discourage flies and some other insects from entering the building.In {{certain areas of the}} UK window blinds are used to disguise the fact that offices have PCs in them and are used as a burglary deterrent.|$|E

5000|$|Roman shades are a type {{of window}} {{covering}} used {{to block out the}} sun. Roman shades are different from standard window shade in that they stack up evenly when being opened; however, when they are open they are visibly smooth, not bumpy or ribbed like typical <b>vertical</b> shades or <b>blinds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term window blinds {{can also}} be used to {{describe}} window coverings generically—in this context window blinds include almost every type of window covering, i.e. shutters, roller blinds, cellular shades (also called honeycomb shades), wood blinds, roman blinds and of course, standard <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>blinds.</b> In the United Kingdom, awnings are sometimes called blinds or shades.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>blinds</b> became {{available}} in flat plastic (PVC), fabric, embossed PVC, faux wood materials, metal, wood and also S-curved slats. A more modern modification {{is to offer}} them with woodtrim at top and bottom- sometimes midway as well- and these are usually described as 'Japanese Vertical blinds' because they are often co-ordinated with Japanese style Shoji blinds using the same timber. <b>Vertical</b> <b>blinds</b> were most popular in the UK during the 1990s, since when sales have slowed as they lost popularity with a younger generation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>blinds</b> use a {{generally}} wider slat {{and one can}} pull a cord to stack the slats together, to one side, or to separate them in the centre and stack them on each end. The slats can be rotated via a rotating shaft in the upper head rail housing, which runs through independent geared carriers that convert the twisting of a tilt rail to a rotation of each individual slat in synchrony. The original <b>vertical</b> <b>blinds</b> were invented in Kansas City, Missouri by Edward Bopp and Fredrick Bopp, who held the original patent. The company name {{at the time was}} Sun Vertical. In the 1960s, the patent and company were sold.|$|E

60|$|Section 115. The ear (Sheet VII.) {{consists}} of an essential organ of hearing, and of certain superadded parts. The essential part is called the internal ear, and is represented in all the true vertebrata (i.e., excluding the lancelet and its allies). In the lower forms it is a hollow membranous structure, embedded in a mass of cartilage, the otic capsule; in the mammal the latter is entirely ossified, to form the periotic bone. The internal ear {{consists of}} a central sac, from which three semicircular canals spring. The planes of the three canals are mutually at right angles; two are vertical, the anterior and posterior (p.v.c.) vertical canals, and one is horizontal, the horizontal canal (h.c.). There are dilatations, called ampullae, at the anterior base of the anterior, and at the posterior base of the posterior and horizontal canals. Indirectly connected with the main sac is a spirally-twisted portion, resembling a snail shell in form, the cochlea. This last part is distinctive of the mammalia, {{but the rest of}} the internal ear is represented in all vertebrata, with one or two exceptions. The whole of the labyrinth is membranous, and contains a fluid, the endolymph; between the membranous wall of the labyrinth and the enclosing bone is a space containing the perilymph. Strange as it may appear at first, the entire lining of the internal ear is, at an early stage, continuous with the general epidermis of the animal. It grows in just as a gland might grow in, and is finally cut off from the exterior; but a considerable relic of this former communication remains as a thin, <b>vertical</b> <b>blind</b> tube (not shown in the figure), the ductus endolymphaticus.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} window blinds are Persian blinds, which consist of many {{horizontal}} slats, usually of metal or vinyl, connected with string {{such that they}} can be rotated to allow light to pass between the slats, rotated up to about 170 degrees to hide the light, or pulled up so that the entire window is clear. <b>Vertical</b> <b>blinds</b> consist of slats of stiffened fabric, plastic, or metal hanging by one end from a track; like the horizontal versions, the slats can be rotated 90 degrees to allow light to pass through or to fold up on one side of a door or window. <b>Vertical</b> <b>blinds</b> are very good at controlling how much natural or exterior light comes into a room, due to the ability of the slats to close tightly.|$|E
50|$|Some {{changes to}} the {{homestead}} have occurred. In October 1936 a fire started in a chip heater chimney in the homestead's ceiling and destroyed the ceiling and rafters of the bathroom on the western wing. There is evidence of a more recent fire in the laundry. The kitchen was changed from a wood stove with marble bench tops to a modern stove plus laminated bench tops in the 1960s. The small verandah in the service wing was enclosed as an eating area for Burton Persse and his family. The two original bathrooms have been altered; one was modernised and the other stripped and converted to an office by 1971. The wall between the former cook's room and the kitchen has been removed. In 1996 the roofing was noted as corrugated iron. However, Dods favoured flat iron roofing, and {{this appears to be}} the roofing in a photograph taken in 1919. The <b>vertical</b> timber <b>blinds</b> around the piazza, apparent in early photographs, have been removed.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{was to develop a}} simplified model to predict the heat transfer, both radiative and convective, in complex fenestration systems, including the effect of solar radiation. The systems of interest include windows with horizontal or <b>vertical</b> louvered <b>blinds,</b> roller blinds or curtains. However, the focus of the current work is on horizontal louvered blinds and roller blinds mounted adjacent to the indoor glazing surface. In this paper, empirical correlations for free convection in an asymmetrically heated channel (Roeleveld, 2007) are used to develop a simplified one-dimensional model of the heat transfer at an indoor glazing adjacent to a louvered blind. In this model, an energy balance is performed at the blind surface, using a mean blind temperature. The radiative heat exchange between the blind, window and room is calculated using a four surface grey-diffuse model, which is coupled to the convective heat transfer. The simplified model has been developed using experimental and numerical data (Collins, 2001 and Machin et al., 1998). Sample results are presented that illustrate the effect of blind slat angle, blind-to-window spacing, and absorbed solar heat flux on the heat transfer at the window surface...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{numerical}} study {{investigates the}} flow and heat transfer characteristics in a <b>vertical</b> square <b>blind</b> duct with the coolant fed by a tangential entry jet. The detailed Nusselt number (Nu) distributions over the five constituent {{walls of the}} blind duct are calculated at duct (jet) Reynolds numbers Re(Rej) of 5000 (20000), 7000 (28000) and 10000 (40000) us-ing the commercial CFD Star CD code. As an attempt to explore the buoyancy effect on heat transfer performances, three different heat fluxes, which vary the gravitational Grashof numbers (Grg) at the fixed Re, are imposed on each duct wall to vary the buoyancy levels. The jet-induced flow phenomena in the blind duct exhibit various heat transfer impacts on the five duct walls over which the different near-wall flow structures are generated. This is demonstrated by cross-examining the detailed Nu distributions and the area-averaged Nusselt number (Nu) over the five duct walls at the tested Re and Grg. The cross-plane swirls induced by the tangential entry jet together with the impinging jet flows considerably elevate the Heat Transfer Enhancement (HTE) performances in the blind duct. Within the parametric conditions simulated, the ratios of Nu to the Dittus-Boelter levels (Nu) over the jet wall, back wall, impingement wall, side wall and end wall are re-spectively raised to 3 - 5. 7, 2. 8 - 5. 6, 3 - 5. 8, 2. 7 - 4. 8 and 3. 1 - 6. 1; while the HTE ratios (Nu /Nu) over these duct walls con-sistently decrease as Re increases...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{observed}} in the nature that all creatures have evolved highly exclusive sensory organs depending on their habitat and the form of resources availability for their survival. In this project, a novel omnidirectional camera rig, inspired from natural vision sensors, is proposed. It is exclusively designed to operate for highly specified tasks {{in the field of}} mobile robotics. Navigation problems on uneven terrains and detection of the moving objects while the robot is itself in motion are the core problems that omnidirectional systems tackle. The proposed omnidirectional system is a compact and a rigid vision system with dioptric cameras that provide a 360 ° field of view in horizontal and <b>vertical,</b> with no <b>blind</b> spot in their site combined with a high-resolution stereo camera to monitor anterior field of view for a more accurate perception with depth information of the scene.

5000|$|In theaters, Cinerama {{film was}} {{projected}} from three projection booths arranged {{in the same}} crisscross pattern as the cameras. They projected onto a deeply curved screen, the outer thirds of which were made of over 1100 strips of material mounted on [...] "louvers" [...] like a <b>vertical</b> venetian <b>blind,</b> to prevent light projected to {{each end of the}} screen from reflecting to the opposite end and washing out the image. This was a big-ticket, reserved-seats spectacle, and the Cinerama projectors were adjusted carefully and operated skillfully. To prevent adjacent images from creating an overilluminated vertical band where they overlapped on the screen, vibrating combs in the projectors, called [...] "jiggolos," [...] alternately blocked the image from one projector and then the other; the overlapping area thus received no more total illumination {{than the rest of the}} screen, and the rapidly alternating images within the overlap smoothed out the visual transition between adjacent image [...] "panels." [...] Great care was taken to match color and brightness when producing the prints. Nevertheless, the seams between panels were usually noticeable. Optical limitations with the design of the camera itself meant that if distant scenes joined perfectly, closer objects did not (parallax error). A nearby object might split into two as it crossed the seams. To avoid calling attention to the seams, scenes were often composed with unimportant objects such as trees or posts at the seams, and action was blocked so as to center actors within panels. This gave a distinctly [...] "triptych-like" [...] appearance to the composition even when the seams themselves were not obvious. It was often necessary to have actors in different sections [...] "cheat" [...] where they looked in order to appear to be looking at each other in the final projected picture. Enthusiasts say the seams were not obtrusive; detractors disagree. Lowell Thomas, an investor in the company with Mike Todd, was still raving about the process in his memoirs thirty years later.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{horizontal}} blinds, <b>vertical</b> <b>blinds</b> {{are less}} likely to collect dust because they stand vertically. Since they draw to the side rather than lifting and lowering, they are easier and faster to operate. They operate better on doors and windows that also slide from side to side. In the 1970s there were few choices of fabric- usually beige or white, which had to have stiffener embedded to prevent fraying, rather like on roller blinds fabric but using a thicker textile.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhen {{square wave}} {{gratings}} are viewed binocularly with lower luminance or contrast in one eye, the individual {{bars of the}} grating appear to rotate around a <b>vertical</b> axis (Venetian <b>blind</b> effect). The effect has typically been thought to occur due to retinal disparities that result from irradiation and, therefore, are entirely entoptic. If so, the visual system should process disparities from a luminance or contrast disparity and a geometric disparity at the same rate. Studies of motion-in-depth using geometric disparities {{have shown that the}} visual system is unable to process depth cues when those cues are oscillated at frequencies greater than 5 Hz. By changing contrast (experiments one and two) and geometric (experiment three) disparity cues over time, the present study measured the frequency at which both the perception of motion-in-depth and the perception of depth diminish. The perception of motion-in-depth from contrast disparities decreased near 1. 1 Hz (experiments one and four) and the perception of depth from contrast disparities decreased near 1. 3 Hz (experiments one, two and four); both of which are lower than the frequency where depth from a geometric disparity diminished (near 4. 8 Hz in experiment three). The differences between the dynamics of depth from contrast and geometric disparities suggest that the perception arises from separate neural mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The microclimatic {{effect of}} bats {{roosting}} in bell holes (<b>blind</b> <b>vertical</b> cylindrical cavities in cave roofs) in Runaway Bay Caves, Jamaica, was measured {{and the potential}} impact of their metabolism on dissolution modelled. Rock temperature measurements showed that bell holes with bats get significantly hotter than those without bats during bat roosting periods (by an average of 1. 1 °C). The relationship is clearest for bell holes with more than about 300 g aggregate bat body mass and for bell holes that are moderately wide and deep, of W:D ratio between 0. 8 and 1. 6. Measurement of temperature decay after abandonment showed that rock temperature returns to normal each day during bat foraging periods. Metabolic activity from a typical population of 400 g bat (10 individuals) yields 41 g of CO 2, 417. 6 kJ of heat, and 35. 6 g of H 2 O in each 18 hour roost period, and could produce a water film of ~ 0. 44 mm, that is saturated with CO 2 at ~ 5 %. The resultant rock dissolution is estimated at ~ 0. 005 cm 3 CaCO 3 per day. The metabolic heat ensures that the focus of dissolution remains vertical regardless of geological controls. A typical bell hole 1 m deep may be formed in some 50, 000 years by this mechanism alone. Addition of other erosional mechanisms, such as direct bacterial bio-erosion, or the formation of exfoliative organo-rock complexes, would accelerate the rate of formation. The hypothesis is developed that bell holes are initiated and formed by bat-mediated condensation corrosion and are governed by geographic distribution of clustering bats and their roosting behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional seismic-reflection {{data are}} used in the {{analysis}} of submarine channel systems in the Espirito Santo Basin, Brazil. The exceptional quality of the studied data set allows the detailed documentation of the geometry, regional distribution, and statistical parameters of salt-related normal faults, and their effect on the Rio Doce Canyon system (RDCS). On the Espirito Santo continental slope, normal faulting was triggered during early halokinesis (stage A) but barely controlled the initial evolution of the RDCS, which incised the continental slope axially within a salt-withdrawal basin. However, in a second stage (stage B), crestal or radial faults controlled erosion over growing salt structures, whereas synclinal and channel-margin fault sets dissected overbank strata to the RDCS. In the later part of stage B, channel sinuosity decreased sharply in response to fault activity and associated sea-floor destabilization. <b>Vertical</b> propagation of <b>blind</b> faults was triggered in a third stage (stage C), in association with crestal collapse of buried salt anticlines and regional diapirism, but synclinal and channel-margin faults did not propagate vertically above a regional unconformity marking the base of stage C strata. Statistical analyses of observed fault sets demonstrate that synclinal faults are in average 2. 3 times longer than the crestal or radial types but record 60 % of the throw (average 83 m [272 ft]) experienced by the latter. In addition, the fault sets are shown to have contributed to local cannibalization of the sea floor, vertical stacking of channel-fill strata, and structural and depositional compartmentalization of potential reservoir successions. As a result, channel systems show marked differences in mean values for sinuosity, height, and width in relation to five main phases of channel development. The structural setting in the study area differs from productive areas offshore Espirito Santo (e. g., Golfinho field), west Africa, and Gulf of Mexico, revealing in distal parts of the Brazilian margin the existence of local controls on submarine channel architecture and structural compartmentalization prior to the main stages of diapirism...|$|R
