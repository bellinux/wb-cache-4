25|$|A {{high power}} factor is {{generally}} desirable in a power delivery system to reduce losses and improve <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> at the load. Compensating elements near an electrical load will reduce the apparent power demand on the supply system. Power factor correction may be applied by an electric power transmission utility to improve the stability and efficiency of the network. Individual electrical customers who are charged by their utility for low power factor may install correction equipment to increase their power factor so as to reduce costs.|$|E
25|$|In {{electromechanical}} regulators, <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> {{is easily}} accomplished by coiling the sensing wire {{to make an}} electromagnet. The magnetic field produced by the current attracts a moving ferrous core held back under spring tension or gravitational pull. As voltage increases, so does the current, strengthening the magnetic field produced by the coil and pulling the core towards the field. The magnet is physically connected to a mechanical power switch, which opens as the magnet moves into the field. As voltage decreases, so does the current, releasing spring tension or {{the weight of the}} core and causing it to retract. This closes the switch and allows the power to flow once more.|$|E
25|$|Regulators powered from AC power {{circuits}} can use silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) as {{the series}} device. Whenever the output voltage {{is below the}} desired value, the SCR is triggered, allowing electricity to flow into the load until the AC mains voltage passes through zero (ending the half cycle). SCR regulators have the advantages of being both very efficient and very simple, but {{because they can not}} terminate an ongoing half cycle of conduction, they are not capable of very accurate <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> in response to rapidly changing loads. An alternative is the SCR shunt regulator which uses the regulator output as a trigger, both series and shunt designs are noisy, but powerful, as the device has a low on resistance.|$|E

30|$|Medium voltage {{distribution}} networks {{with high}} penetrations of distributed generations (DGs) {{are facing the}} challenge of nodal <b>voltage</b> <b>regulations.</b> Generally, in traditional AC distribution networks, voltage profiles are maintained through controlling on-load-tap-change transformers [1], shunt capacitors [2] and circuit breakers [3]. In a hybrid AC/DC distribution network, coordinated regulations of converter-based controllable devices are highly demanded for voltage control.|$|R
25|$|Cascaded diode and {{capacitor}} stages can {{be added}} to make a voltage multiplier (Cockroft-Walton circuit). These circuits are capable of producing a DC output voltage potential up to about ten times the peak AC input voltage, in practice limited by current capacity and <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> issues. Diode voltage multipliers, frequently used as a trailing boost stage or primary high voltage (HV) source, are used in HV laser power supplies, powering devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) (like those used in CRT based television, radar and sonar displays), photon amplifying devices found in image intensifying and photo multiplier tubes (PMT), and magnetron based radio frequency (RF) devices used in radar transmitters and microwave ovens. Before the introduction of semiconductor electronics, transformerless vacuum tube receivers powered directly from AC power sometimes used voltage doublers to generate roughly 300VDC from a 100–120V power line.|$|E

500|$|Just to the north, the Rockaway Line gains {{two extra}} non-revenue tracks {{straddling}} the two revenue tracks. The western track {{is a test}} track, installed in 2001 and called the Far Rockaway Test Track, while the eastern track is used to relay shuttle trains. The western track extends around [...] or nearly 2 miles, while the eastern track is long enough for one full-length train (...) and ends at a bumper block. The test track was installed in 2001 by New York City Transit's Maintenance of Way Department to ensure that new cars have undergone necessary acceleration and braking tests before being put into revenue service. This was because NYCT needed to recover a greater amount of braking energy and reduce power demand peaks {{with the introduction of}} AC-motored cars with the capability for regenerative braking. A kinetic energy storage system with KESS technology was installed, and as a result, the <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> of the track improved. The system provides voltage support to the revenue tracks as well as reinforcing the voltage of the test track during the testing of new trains.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{relations}} among {{the parameters of}} the non-minimum phase for the Buck-Boost converter are studied. It is demonstrated that when the Buck-Boost converter works in Buck mode, the negative <b>regulation</b> <b>voltage</b> is determined by the converter with the pre-designed inductor and load as the duty ratio D 0. 382, and the duty ratio has a limited effect on the negative <b>regulation</b> <b>voltage</b> of the converter; when the Buck-Boost converter works in Boost mode，the negative <b>regulation</b> <b>voltage</b> is determined jointly by the converter with its pre-designed inductor, load and duty cycle, for which performs that the higher the output voltage is (i. e., the greater the duty ratio is) ，the more severe undershoot of the voltage will be.

The output voltage waveform of three-level diode-clamped converter has a signal distortion less than output voltage waveform of original twolevel converter.

2500|$|It is also {{possible}} to put the rectified waveform into a choke-input filter. [...] The advantage of this circuit is that the current waveform is smoother: current is drawn over the entire cycle, instead of being drawn in pulses at the peaks of AC voltage each half-cycle as in a capacitor input filter. [...] The disadvantage is that the voltage output is much lower – the average of an AC half-cycle rather than the peak; this is about 90% of the RMS voltage versus [...] times the RMS voltage (unloaded) for a capacitor input filter. [...] Offsetting this is superior <b>voltage</b> <b>regulation</b> and higher available current, which reduce peak voltage and ripple current demands on power supply components. [...] Inductors require cores of iron or other magnetic materials, and add weight and size. [...] Their use in power supplies for electronic equipment has therefore dwindled in favour of semiconductor circuits such as voltage regulators.|$|E
