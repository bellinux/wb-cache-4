40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between the individual and}} the State is discussed in this contribution. The argument is put forward that both the State and the individual are legal subjects endowed with legal subjectivity. In their relationship it must be accepted that the State is not only endowed with State sovereignty, but also that it prescriptively makes use of its authority. However, theirs is a legal relationship characterised by reciprocal rights and duties so that the balance point in their relationship must {{as a matter of course}} be determined legally. As an explanatory model the theory of public subjective rights, which is of German origin, is applied. This theory can serve only as a starting point, though, as it fails to address certain fundamental questions. The <b>viewpoints</b> <b>of</b> <b>authors</b> of the socalled Reformed Tradition will therefore be applied to elaborate on the theory. By adopting this approach it is endeavoured to explain that the {{relationship between}} the State and the individual may not be viewed as one characterised by the abuse of State authority or excessive individual claims against the State...|$|E
40|$|While {{strategic}} {{management has}} been the focus of much research since the 1960 s, there have been comparatively few studies on strategy practitioners, the human actors responsible for the process. These actors are often reduced to a set of observable demographic variables such as education level, work tenure, or job description. Consequently there is limited knowledge regarding strategy practitioners and, in particular, little is known about how they develop their practices, the knowledge and skills they use when engaged in strategic management. To address this gap in knowledge, this study, conducted within the strategy-as-practice (SAP) perspective, interviewed strategy practitioners identified by their peers as effective strategy practitioners. The responsive interviewing technique employed opened the so called ‘black box’, the subjective views of individuals, and allowed participants to reflect and, importantly, provide their meaning of what significantly influenced their strategic management practice development. Eighteen interviews were conducted and the analysis of the rich, deep data collected allowed an understanding of practice development from a practitioner’s perspective to emerge. The study revealed that this group of strategy practitioners see strategic management in holistic terms with a focus on organisational outcomes and not in a traditional, normative view which privileges the creation of a strategy. This contribution was not, however, a primary research outcome but participants view of strategic management impacted significantly on how they view themselves as strategy practitioners, the purpose of strategic management and, vitally, the practices they believe are needed to be effective. Within this context, the study shows that participants develop their practices idiosyncratically and learning from practice, notable literature and being involved with a broad range of people, were valued significantly in their practice development. It was through this meaning that participants were able to relate important aspects of their own development. This study contributes an empirical study to the SAP perspective that goes well beyond simple demographics in understanding how strategy practitioners develop their practices. In regards to research, the selection of strategy practitioners without considering their historical development has been identified as an area that may be problematic, especially for studies seeking to understand how strategy is practised. Business school education was not identified as a direct, meaningful contributor to participants’ development. This observation raises the interesting, and unresolved, question of the actual relationship between business schools and practice. The participants’ idiosyncratic career paths contributes to the <b>viewpoints</b> <b>of</b> <b>authors</b> who question whether the strategic management field should, or could, attain the status of a profession such as law or medicine...|$|E

The story is told from the <b>viewpoint</b> <b>of</b> the <b>author</b> recounting a festive season as a young boy in a fictionalised autobiographical style. In the first passage, Thomas searches for a nostalgic Western belief in Christmas past with the line, [...] "It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas", furthering his idyllic memory of childhood past by describing the snow as being better and more exciting then, than the snow that he experiences as an adult. The prose is comedic, with exaggerated characters used either for comedic effect, or to show how childhood memories are enlarged through youthful interpretation.|$|R
