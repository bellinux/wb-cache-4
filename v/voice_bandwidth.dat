However, the benefit of voice quality improvement through redundancy is reduced greatly in the case of consecutive loss of Skype packets. When Skype is running over wireless networks, the high likelihood of having consecutive packet loss in a noisy wireless environment could lead to an interesting scenario: using more bandwidth for a lower voice quality. In this thesis, we study the impact of the HARQ retransmission mechanism of WiMAX to the voice quality of Skype. Two key parameters for the HARQ mechanism of WiMAX (i. e. Maximum numbers of retransmission and the delay of sending ACK) and their interplay with voice quality are investigated in this research. While HARQ retransmission may reduce the redundancy usage in Skype, it introduces additional bandwidth usage during the retransmission.

While circuit-switched voice offers better quality, packet-switched voice offers better resource utilization due to its multiplexing and compression techniques {{that can be used in}} packet radio principle.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the problem space {{of developing a}} high quality, yet scalable multi-party voice communication service to the ever more popular Distributed Virtual Environments (DVE) exemplified by the Multiplayer Online Games (MOG). The social interactive experience of DVE users can be greatly enhanced if the users feel immersed in a realistic environment via high fidelity visual scenes, auditory scenes and haptics. While recognising the primary {{role played by the}} visual scenes and the consequent rapid progresses made in the field of computer graphics, in this thesis, we investigate the network delivery of live DVE user voices which will be an important supplement to the primary visual scenes in creating the sense of immersion for the DVE users. The Immersive Voice over IP (VoIP) service is characterised by the creation of an auditory scene for each user which is the personalised mix of all the voices within that user’s hearing range. Each constituent voice stream in an auditory scene is localised (directional placement) and distance-attenuated in accordance with the visual positions of corresponding users in the virtual world. We believe the auditory scenes created for Immersive VoIP will be much more conducive to the creation of users’ sense of immersion than the currently prevalent text-chat and mono VoIP applications. During our literature review, we first identified three key challenges faced by the Immersive VoIP service provider, i. e., the need to reduce respectively, the voice processing cost, the <b>voice</b> exchange <b>bandwidth</b> cost and the voice transmission latency. In view of the limited resources onboard the DVE clients (especially the wireless clients), the concept of server-rendered Immersive VoIP service is proposed which employs dedicated servers to complete the computationally expensive voice rendering tasks on behalf of the clients. Nevertheless, in exchange for the minimisation of client-side resource loads, a server processing scalability problem is created where each of the Auditory Scene Creation (ASC) servers could bear a prohibitively large processing load when supporting a large and dense user population. In the course of conducting subjective listening tests, we soon realised that the further away a listener is from the voice source, the greater is the voice localisation error which can be tolerated by the listener. This important result verifies the conjecture of distance-governed variable ii Abstract iii acceptable_localisation_error which allows the same localised voice to be shared between nearby listening users. This conjecture allows for siginifcant reductons in voice processing cost through the computational reuse of voice localisation results. In addition to considering the static Auditory Scene Creations, a mechanism known as the Transitional Deviation Reduction Algorithm has also been devised to address the issue that the Immersive VoIP users can be annoyed by more than 5 degrees of angular shifts between the voices localised at successive time instants with respect to the same speaking avatar. To ensure low voice latency for the latency-critical Immersive VoIP service, we propose a two_overlay_hops distributed server architecture. In this architecture, the voice transmission path between any pair of communicating avatars is always two overlay hops, i. e., from the speaking client to the assigned ASC server (1 st hop) then from the ASC server to the listening client (2 nd hop). As shown by our simulations results, this two_overlay_hops distributed server architecture is capable of significantly improving the voice transmission latency from the central server architecture and the prior distributed server solution devised in (Nguyen, 2006), especially for the challenging, yet realistic DVE scenario where there is a low level of correlations between the distribution of avatars in the DVE virtual world and the distribution of physical clients in the underlying geographically dispersed network. The objective of our server selection/assignment Linear Programming (LP) formulations is to obtain a balance between improving the voice transmission latency and mitigating the associated increases in the client-side <b>voice</b> upload <b>bandwidth</b> cost and the server-side voice processing cost. In particular, the Bandwidth Constrained Formulation reduces the client-side voice upload cost while still achieving a satisfactory level of latency performance by establishing a few ASC server sites which are very Latency Efficient, i. e., capable of meeting the acceptable_latency_constraints {{of a large number of}} communicating avatar pairs. However, the LP-based server assignment formulations were proven to be NP-hard and computationally expensive if executed in their original centralised format. Consequently, an alternative scheme was devised to divide the virtual world into equal size (measured in the number of avatar pairs enclosed) partitions so as to parallelise and distribute the execution of the server assignment formulations between different partitions. We examined the impact of avatar mobility in the virtual world on the performance of our distributed server assignment solutions, in particular the solution’s ability to balance Abstract iv between improving the voice latency and reducing the associated rises in client-side upload bandwidth cost. In our simulations, we found that the ASC servers need to be re-assigned at a regular frequency. Despite the significant scalability improvements made by our virtual world partitioning scheme, the optimised server assignment formulations, especially the complex, yet practical Bandwidth Constrained Formulation is still not scalable enough to meet the execution frequencies required for coping with avatar mobility. To this end, we have derived the Bandwidth Reduced Heuristic which offers much faster execution time than the optimal server assignment mechanism, at the expense of small performance loss in terms of both latency and client-side upload bandwidth cost. By combining our virtual world partitioning scheme with the Bandwidth Reduced Heuristic, we have produced a distributed server assignment solution which will enable the Immersive VoIP service to cope with frequent virtual world mobility for a wide range of DVE scenarios in terms of varying user population sizes and/or distribution densities. The only exception is a very sparse DVE which could require the ASC servers to be reassigned once per 60 - 70 seconds. Such a fast frequency is unrealistic considering the combined delays of server reassignment and handover. Consequently, a really sparse DVE with low intensity communication flows is probably best served by a simple Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) architecture with minimum management overhead rather than the client-server architectures...|$|R
40|$|The Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) {{is on its}} way to surpassing toll quality. Although VoIP shares its {{transmission}} channel with other communication traffic, today internet has a wider bandwidth than the legacy Digital Loop Carrier and voice could be digitized higher than traditional 8 kbps, to say 16 kbps. Thus, VoIP should not be limited by the toll quality. However, VoIP quality could go down, as a result of unpredictable traffic congestion and network imperfections. These two situations cause delay jitter and packet loss of VoIP. To overcome these challenges, there are ongoing works for service providers including but not limited to optimizing routing and adding more bandwidth. There are also works by developers at the user’s end, which includes compressing voice packet size and processing playout delay adapted to the network condition. While VoIP planning or off-line quality monitoring and control use overall quality measurements such as mean opinion score (MOS) or R-factor, the real-time quality supervision typically uses the network condition factors only. The control mechanism that is based on network quality could adjust the channel parameter by changing Codec and its parameters, and changing playout delay, etc. to minimize the loss of <b>voice</b> quality. As <b>bandwidth</b> plays a prominent role in IP traffic congestion, compressing the packet header is a possible solution to minimize congestion. Replacing a completed packet header with a smaller header will significantly reduce the packet header size. For instance, with a context, a compressed header will not consist of RTP header and, thus, could reduce 16 bytes from each packet. However, the primary question is how to deal with delay jitter calculation without time stamping. In this research, a delay jitter calculation for VoIP packet without timestamp has been provided. Compressing payload or using high compressing Codecs, is another major solution for preventing quality downgrade with limited bandwidth. The challenge with many Codec and the tradeoff between Codec quality and packet loss due to limited bandwidth has been addressed in this research with a summary of Codec quality evaluation and a bandwidth planning calculation. Although the E-model and its R-factor has been proposed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for VoIP quality measurement, with many network and Codec parameters, it could only be used for offline quality control. Since accessing a live traffic for monitoring live quality is somewhat impossible, at the client side, only packet loss and delay jitter matters. In this research, more in-depth investigation of adaptive playout delay based on jitter prediction has been carried out and recommended as the end user solution for quality improvement. An adaptive playout delay based on Markov model also has been developed in detail and tested with real VoIP network. This development has closed the gap between research and engineering.

It {{is very important that}} the radio resources are used in an efficient way allowing the networks to support as many users as possible. The three types of networks studied in this thesis are frequency hopping GSM networks, ad hoc multi-hop networks and WCDMA networks. One type of network with a promising future is ad hoc multi-hop networks. The users in this kind of networks communicate with each other without base stations. Instead the signal can be sent directly between two users, or relayed over one or several other users before the final destination is reached. Resources are shared by letting the users transmit in time slots. The problem studied is to minimize the number of time slots used, when the users broadcast. Two different optimization models are developed for assigning time slots to the users. A reduction of the number of time slots means a shorter delay for a user to transmit next time. The rapid growth of the number of subscribers in cellular networks requires efficient cell planning methods. The trend of smaller cell sizes in urban areas for higher capacity raise the need for more efficient spectrum usage. Since the infrastructure of a second generation cellular system, such as GSM, already exists, and the available bandwidth of an operator is limited, frequency planning methods are of utmost importance. Because of the limited bandwidth in a GSM network, the frequencies must be reused. When planning a GSM network the frequencies can not be reused too tightly due to interference. The frequency planning problem in a GSM network is a very complex task. In this thesis an optimization model for frequency assignment in a frequency hopping GSM network is developed. The problem is to assign frequencies to the cells in the network, while keeping the interference to a minimum. Different meta heuristic methods such as tabu search and simulated annealing are used to solve the problem. The results show that the interference levels can be reduced to allow a capacity increase. The demand for sending more information over the wireless communication systems requires more <b>bandwidth.</b> <b>Voice</b> communication was handled well by the second generation cellular systems. The third generation of mobile telecommunication systems will handle data transmissions in a greater extent. The last type of network considered in the thesis is a WCDMA cellular network. The aim is to schedule the transmission of packet data from the base station to the users. Scheduling models that maximize the utility are developed for both the downlink shared channel and the high speed downlink shared channel...|$|R
