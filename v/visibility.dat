Falling ash {{will reduce the}} <b>visibility</b> which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing <b>visibility</b> hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in <b>visibility.</b>|$|E

In astronomical imaging they are provided, for instance, by rotation modulationcollimators in X-ray imaging or by pairs of antennas in a radio interferometer.

40|$|We {{describe}} an interpolation/extrapolation procedure that recon- structs X-ray maps of solar flares using as input data sparse {{samples of the}} Fourier transform of the radiation flux, named <b>visibilities.</b> The algorithm is based on two steps: in the first step the performance of an interpolation rou- tine is optimized by representing the <b>visibilities</b> according to favorable coor- dinates in the frequency plane. In the second step two extrapolation schemes are introduced, respectively based on the projection and the thresholding of the Landweber iterative method. The procedure is validated against realistic synthetic <b>visibilities</b> and applied to experimental measurements provided by the NASA satellite Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the current}} {{opportunities}} for stellar atmospheric modeling is the interpretation of optical interferometric data of stars. Starting from the robust, open source ATLAS atmospheric code [1], we have developed a spherically symmetric code, SATLAS, as a new option for modeling stellar atmospheres of low gravity stars. The SATLAS code is tested against both interferometric observations of M giants by Wittkowski and collaborators, and spherically symmetric M giant NextGen models from the PHOENIX code. The SATLAS models predict interferometric <b>visibilities</b> that agree with the observed <b>visibilities</b> and with predicted <b>visibilities,</b> and the SATLAS atmospheric structures also agree with those from spherical PHOENIX models, with just small differences in temperature and pressure at large depths in the atmospheres...|$|R

5|$|The {{ash fall}} created some {{temporary}} major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. <b>Visibility</b> was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane {{was closed for}} a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor <b>visibility.</b> Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.|$|E

5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited <b>visibility</b> from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve <b>visibility,</b> noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' <b>visibility,</b> the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident.

40|$|Aims. We {{introduce}} an algorithm for the deconvolution {{of radio}} synthesis images {{that accounts for}} the non-coplanar-baseline effect, allows multiscale reconstruction onto arbitrarily positioned pixel grids, and allows the antenna elements to have direcitonal dependent gains. Methods. Using numerical L 1 -minimisation techniques established {{in the application of}} compressive sensing to radio astronomy, we directly solve the deconvolution equation using GPU (graphics processing unit) hardware. This approach relies on an analytic expression for the contribution of a pixel in the image to the observed <b>visibilities,</b> and the well-known expression for Dirac delta function pixels is used along with two new approximations for Gaussian pixels, which allow for multi-scale deconvolution. The algorithm is similar to the CLEAN algorithm in that it fits the reconstructed pixels in the image to the observed <b>visibilities</b> while minimising the total flux; however, unlike CLEAN, it operates on the ungridded <b>visibilities,</b> enforces positivity, and has guaranteed global convergence. The pixels in the image can be arbitrarily distributed and arbitrary gains between each pixel and each antenna element can also be specified. Results. Direct deconvolution of the observed <b>visibilities</b> is shown to be feasible for several deconvolution problems, including a 1 megapixel wide-field image with over 400, 000 <b>visibilities.</b> Correctness of the algorithm is shown using synthetic data, and the algorithm shows good image reconstruction performance for wide field images and requires no regridding of <b>visibilities.</b> Though this algorithm requires significantly more computation than methods based on the CLEAN algorithm, we demonstrate that it is trivially parallelisable across multiple GPUs and potentially can be scaled to GPU clusters. We also demonstrate that a significant speed up is possible through the use of multi-scale analysis using Gaussian pixels. Conclusions...|$|R
