50|$|However, {{sometimes}} editors will (confusingly) use {{the letter}} B to designate time code breaks on a <b>video</b> <b>tape.</b> If there is broken time code on a <b>video</b> <b>tape,</b> {{there will be}} two (or more) instances of a particular time code on the <b>video</b> <b>tape.</b> When re-capturing, it can be ambiguous as to which timecode is the right one. The letter B may indicate that the right time code is from the second set of timecode on the <b>video</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of the cometary meteoroids was studied by {{closed circuit television}} observing systems. Vidicon cameras produce basic data on standard <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> and enable the recording of the spectra of faint shower meteors, consequently the chemical study is extended to smaller particles {{and we have a}} larger data bank than is available from the more conventional method of recording meteor spectra by photography. The two main problems in using <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> meteor spectrum records are: (1) the <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recording has a much lower resolution than the photographic technique; (2) <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> is relatively new type of data storage in astronomy and the methods of quantitative photometry have not yet been fully developed in the various fields where <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> is used. The use of the most detailed photographic meteor spectra to calibrate the <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> records and to make positive identification of the more prominent chemical elements appearing in the spectra may solve the low resolution problem. Progress in the development of standard photometric techniques for the analysis of <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> records of meteor spectra is reported...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 24 - 25) The {{use of the}} <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recorder in {{the classroom}} is assumed to promote some educational objectives. Literature on the effects of <b>Video</b> <b>tape</b> and television in the classroom has been reviewed and the hypothesis developed that classes which use the <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recorder for motivation will achieve more than classes which do not. Three eighth grade American history classes were used as subjects for a test of this hypothesis. One class was allowed to use <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> equipment to present oral reports on slavery, the Civil War or World War II, based on independent research; two classes did not use <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> equipment for reports. Comparisons were made between the three classes' scores on written tests following presentation of the reports, their comments on questionnaires and notes from daily observation of the three classes by the teacher. The results show that the use of <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recording by the student is an effective motivational tool...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> {{operator}} (VT operator or VTR operator) cues {{and prepares}} video inserts into a program. A VT operator sets up and operates <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> equipment to record and play back the program, reads the program log to ascertain when {{to record the}} program, and when it airs. They also select sources, such as satellite or studio, for the program, and select the video recording equipment to use. They are heavily used in sports programming, and in all <b>video</b> <b>taped</b> productions, including television news programming, and sometimes sitcoms, if they are shot on <b>video</b> <b>tape),</b> they are also responsible for action replays and quickly editing highlights while a show is in progress. As the title suggests, <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> operators only work in <b>video</b> <b>taped</b> production. Although, VTR operator's still work on digital productions. It is a name that has just stuck to the playback operator. They can also be on set editors to give the director and director of photography {{the ability to see}} how what they shot cuts together.|$|R

50|$|Video {{technology}} was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) television systems, but several new technologies for video display devices have since been invented. Video was originally exclusively a live technology. Charles Ginsburg led an Ampex research team developing {{one of the first}} practical <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recorder (VTR). In 1951 the first <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recorder captured live images from television cameras by converting the camera's electrical impulses and saving the information onto magnetic <b>video</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R

Later, two color cameras were purchased from International Video Corporation, {{as well as a}} color <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> machine (albeit in a non-standard 1" [...] helical-scan format).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on a {{telephone}} survey to 15 professional wildlife damage control workers in 9 of the 10 Great Plains states. North Dakota was the only state that was not contacted. In this survey we asked the following five questions: 1. Do you have any <b>video</b> <b>tapes</b> on wildlife damage control? 2. How many counties are there in your state? 3. How many County Extension Offices have videocassette recorders (VCRs) ? 4. What is your opinion of <b>video</b> <b>tapes?</b> 5. Do you see a future for VCRs in wildlife damage control extension education? Another {{purpose of this}} presentation is to show you a review of short excerpts of some wildlife damage control extension education <b>video</b> <b>tapes.</b> Only 3 of 9 states currently have wildlife damage control <b>video</b> <b>tapes.</b> The 9 states represented in this survey contained about 763 counties.
