40|$|This study {{aimed to}} gain an insight in the {{performance}} of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) -based food safety management systems (FSMS) implemented in Japanese milk processing plants. Since 1995, Japan has a comprehensive approval system for food manufacturing establishments by evaluating {{the development and implementation of}} GHP and HACCP by the food manufacturing companies/operators. An FSMS-diagnostic instrument was applied to assess the level of the core control and assurance activities in the FSMS and to judge the risk level of the context wherein the companies operate. The data were collected in 13 dairy companies (mostly located around Tokyo area) and involved in-depth interviews performed (by the National Institute of Public Health) with responsible quality assurance persons of respective companies. The results revealed that the microbial food safety output was higher for companies with national HACCP approval. They have more advanced FSMS in combination with a less risky context. All Japanese companies scored high on technology-dependent activities (i. e. preventive measures and intervention processes), but less in managerial activities as monitoring and typical quality assurance activities as validation and verification of the FSMS. Japan has a detailed <b>vertical</b> <b>legislation,</b> leading to a “hazard-based” and ”legislation-based” FSMS compared to a “science- or risk-based” FSMS common in Europe...|$|E
40|$|The European Economic Community {{was created}} in 1957 when the six {{countries}} signed the Treaty of Rome. Its original goal has been to create a common market. The main instruments in achieving this goal could be defined as four freedoms: the free movement of labour, the free movement of services, the free movement of capital and the free movement of goods. The free movement of goods {{has been the most}} important segment for developing the food law. Although all Member States agreed generally about the free common market, in practice each of the states has been looking for and finding different ways of protecting its own markets. This tendency of Member States is evident through the development of European food law. The European food law development can be divided into two main phases: the first phase that was oriented on the market and the second phase with orientation on food safety and the market. There are two periods during the fi rst, market oriented phase: the period of harmonisation through <b>vertical</b> <b>legislation</b> and the period of harmonisation through horizontal legislation. In the second phase preceded by the ”White Paper on Food Safety“ of European Commission emphasis was on the high level of food safety in the area on the food law and not only on the development of a common market. Th e Regulation No 178, well known as General Food Law adopted in 2002, followed changes in the policy. The Food Act in Republic of Croatia based on the General Food Law entered into force only one year later...|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{know the}} {{horizontal}} and <b>vertical</b> synchronization of <b>legislation</b> on interfaith marriage in Indonesia. This study {{is a part of}} normative legal research which is projected to examine the harmonization of legislation regarding interfaith marriage. The current approach of this research is legislation approach (statue approach) in which the data was collected by reciting the literature of primary and secondary legal materials. The next to analysis the data, the researcher examined them through horizontal and vertical synchronization. And the last, the finding outs are : the first, it horizontally occurs discrepancies between the regulation No. 1 of 1974 on Marriage and the regulation No. 23 of 2006 on Demographic and Civic Administration. According to the marriage regulation, interfaith marriage is prohibited meanwhile Demographic and Civic Administration regulation allows it. The second, vertically, between the Marriage regulation of the Government Regulation No. 9 of 1975 and Presidential Decree No. 9 of 1991 already contained synchronization that prohibits interfaith marriage. However, the Cross Marriage Regulation No. 158 of 1898 occurred discrepancies in where Marriage regulation prohibits people to do the interfaith marriage, meanwhile according to the Cross Marriage Regulation, interfaith is not a barrier to marry...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between policy frames and actual policy outcomes {{and the role}} of ‘frame institutionalization’ has received some attention in the literature on environmental policy making (Jachtenfuchs and Huber 1993; Hayer 1993). This paper asks to what extent any of these frames is actually reflected in our empirical cases that pit environmental against economic objectives and how deeply and permanently institutionalized these frames have come. The next section explores the general EC institutional structure linking environmental integration to market integration, assuming that the general institutional framework will influence concrete policy experience. We define institutional structure to encompass organizational, procedural, and normative elements and analyze evidence of frame institutionalization with respect to these three dimensions. Two case studies follow. We selected these cases to represent the breadth of EC environmental policy, in order to uncover the impact of policy frames on the environmental area as a whole. We include waste policy, with its traditional media boundaries (concerns with soil as opposed to water and air pollution) and <b>vertical</b> layers of <b>legislation,</b> and the integration of environmental concerns into the Community’s agricultural policy, an issue area that has a horizontal dimension in other EC policy sectors. We assess whether these case studies give evidence of "frame institutionalization. " We conclude by highlighting the factors that undermine the formation of "thick" institutional structures which would support efforts to integrate environmental and economic policy objectives...|$|R
40|$|A {{new piece}} of European legislation, the Ecodesign Directive (2009 / 125 /EC) came into effect on 20 November 2009 and is to be {{implemented}} by Member States by November 20, 2010. This covers energy-using products under an earlier directive (the Energy using Products Directive) but also extends the range of products covered to include those which are related to energy use {{even if they do}} not actually use energy directly such as construction materials and fittings. So it covers 'any goods having an impact on energy consumption during use'. A product list is to be developed by the European Commission. Reduction in energy consumption is posited in the European Climate Change Programme (European Commission, 2006) and climate change is a priority in the Sixth Community Environment Programme (Decision No 1600 / 2002 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council). Climate change also now appears as an objective of the European Union in the Lisbon Treaty. Ecodesign is a key element of the European Commission's Integrated Product Policy and appears in the Commission Communication of 18 June 2003 'Integrated Product Policy - Building on Environmental Life Cycle Thinking'. It is also a key innovative aspect appearing in the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme. Building legislation on a life cycle approach is radical and novel given that most environmental impacts are regulated on a <b>vertical</b> basis where <b>legislation</b> is linked to the process rather than the product. This paper argues that the best way forward for achieving sustainability is to revolutionise the regulatory process by adopting a life cycle approach to the environmental impacts of products as the basis for legislation. It examines the impact of the Ecodesign Directive and seeks to evaluate {{the pros and cons of}} such an approach...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{transport}} sector {{is critical to}} the performance of various sectors of the economy both trade in goods and services hinges on an efficient and reliable transport services sector. South Africa has undertaken limited commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in the {{transport sector}}. South Africa's transport sector in general is controlled by the government through state owned firms. The transport sector is competitive relative to Africa, however, relative to developed economies, the transport sector lags behind in terms of efficiency and cost (DBSA, 2012). Inefficiencies result in increased transaction costs and impede the overall competitiveness and economic performance of the country. The transport sector and other services sectors in general are mainly governed by domestic legislation. Barriers to trade in services may be located in laws and regulations of individual economies often referred to as behind the border measures such as license, technical, educational, registration and local ownership requirements and as such are more difficult to address than barriers to goods. (Hartzenberg, 2012). To identify these measures it is important to undertake an assessment of the legislation governing sector. This study analyses both <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>legislation</b> governing the sector. This study aims to assess the level of liberalisation of South Africa's transport sector to gauge the presence of trade restrictive measures in the sector that would limit access, establishment and or operation by foreign service suppliers. This is done through an analysis of domestic legislation governing the transport sector and its related sub - sectors. This effectively entails a comparison between actual commitments as reflected in South Africa's GATS schedule of specific commitments and applied policy as reflected in legislation. Data from such a study provides valuable technical information to trade negotiators regarding the policy space available allowing them to develop and formulate informed negotiating positions. The methodology employed in this study is adapted from the World Bank's Regulatory Assessment of Services, Trade and Investment (RASTI) and has been adapted for purposes of this study. A country, prior to engaging in a services negotiation should conduct an assessment of the level of liberalisation of each service sector to gauge its competitive strengths and weaknesses. Such an assessment entails an assessment of the country's regulation to determine if such regulation is overly burdensome {{to the extent that it}} inhibits competition and trade in services in an economy. Once such an assessment is concluded, a large number of countries have found that domestic regulatory reforms are necessary for effective participation in services negotiations. (Molinuevo & Sáez, 2014). The importance for such assessments often referred to as audits, have been confirmed as the most effective way of ensuring that regulations are not restrictive of trade. (Molinuevo & Sáez, 2014). Moreover, periodic regulatory audits serve the purpose of identifying discriminatory measures and minimising discriminatory effects that have the effect of increasing costs and discriminating against foreign service suppliers. A comparison of the liberalisation of South Africa's transport sector in terms of the actual commitments (as reflected in the GATS services schedule) against the applied domestic regulation is an important exercise in view of the discussions at the WTO level about the liberalisation of services and at a regional level in view of South Africa's regional and continental aspirations to promote regional integration. The transport sector has been identified as a priority sector in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA) invol ving, COMESA, E AC and SADC. In the TFTA negotiations, even though the first phase focused on trade in goods, the second phase will address trade in services, including transport services. Negotiations in SADC based on the Protocol on Trade in Services are ongoing and wil l include transport services. A study of this nature is important for undertaking and formulating negotiating positions for trade in services and may be replicated across various service sectors...|$|R
