40|$|Vendor {{selection}} of a telecommunications system is an important problem to a telecommunications company as the telecommunications system is a long-term investment for {{the company and the}} success of telecommunications services is directly affected by the vendor selection decision. Furthermore, the vendor {{selection of}} a telecommunications system is a complex multi-person, multi-criteria decision problem. The group decision-making process can be improved by a systematic and logical approach to assess priorities based on the inputs of several people from different functional areas within the company. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) can be very useful in involving several decision-makers with different conflicting objectives to arrive at a consensus decision. In this paper, an AHP-based model is formulated and applied to a real case study to examine its feasibility in selecting a vendor for a telecommunications system. The use of the proposed model indicates that it can be applied to improve the group decision making in selecting a vendor that satisfies customer specifications. Also, it is found that the decision process is systematic and that using the proposed AHP model can reduce the time taken to select a vendor.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{outsourcing}} {{has become a}} widespread phenomenon. Many outsourcing process frameworks have been proposed to support this development. A typical outsourcing process consists of five phases – preparation, <b>vendor</b> <b>selection,</b> transition, managing relationship, and reconsideration. This paper focuses on the <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> phase. The tendency of outsourcers to engage in more collaborative and relational oriented outsourcing arrangements is discussed with comparison to the formal non-collaborative (transactional) relationships. The chosen outsourcing relationship (collaborative vs. non-collaborative) will influence the process of selecting a vendor. A general framework for the <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> process consisting of several stages is proposed.

40|$|Decision {{making of}} <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> in {{construction}} procurement has been addressed {{as a crucial}} process not only in conventional construction project, but also in Industrialised Building System (IBS) project. The existence of high number of vendor and criteria, and the fragmentation of construction process have increased the difficulties of construction <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> process. This situation created a decision making dilemma for construction companies to select the right IBS vendor that fulfils the project needs. Thus, a decision making tool is recommend for this purpose. This paper discusses a decision making technique called Multi Attributes Decision Making (MADM) and set of criteria used in literature for construction <b>vendor</b> <b>selection.</b> As an initial step to develop a decision model, past studies were analysed to gather the related IBS <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> criteria. It is identified that the selection criteria can be categorize into cost, quality, service, buyer and vendor relationship, assurance supply, payment term, and past performance.

In this context, <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> {{is a critical}} factor affecting outsourcing performance. It has furthermore been determined as a multiple criteria decision making problem. Despite a large set of literature, previous studies of <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> have predominantly focused on factors regardless the firm size. However, {{an increasing number of}} small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have participated in selecting foreign vendors during last decades. Nevertheless, rather less is known about this phenomenon and especially on what basis SMEs select offshore vendors. The current paper aims to investigate SMEs’ <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> by looking into the three dimensions: driving forces, <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> criteria and <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> methods. A multiple-case study and an explorative research approach are applied in this paper. Empirical findings are compared and analyzed against the results found in literature review. Evidently, the qualitative research indicates that SMEs prefer to focus on core selection criteria and simple methods rather than complex statistical models.

Due {{to the wide}} variety of criteria and vendor available, the <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> process for a specific project needs is becoming more difficult. The need of decision aid for <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> in other areas is widely discussed in previous research.

40|$|Material {{suppliers}} {{can play}} a very large role {{in the success of}} manufacturing firms. While Porter (1979) described suppliers as a competitive force, Childe (1998) recognised them as business partners in the extended enterprise. Given their importance it is reasonable to expect the appropriate resources and methodologies are employed in selecting the best suppliers. In addition to purchasing professionals, <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> processes should involve multifunctional teams to identify the most appropriate selection criteria or key performance criteria that proposed new suppliers may be measured against. This thesis contends that for many firms the Â¿reality does not match the rhetoricÂ¿. While firms may have <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> procedures in place they are often generic and ineffective. The procedures do not offer metrics important to the firm, does not engage stakeholders within the firm such as quality, logistics and engineering and are not value adding.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{straightforward}} model for selecting slightly non-homogeneous vendors. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper the use of the interval data envelopment analysis (DEA) is suggested. The bounds of intervals are constant and can be obtained by various estimation techniques. The interval DEA model provides for the decision making units (DMUs) with missing values a lower and an upper bound of their efficiency score corresponding to their most favorable and unfavorable option. Findings - Employing the proposed method for selecting slightly non-homogeneous vendors largely reduced practical difficulties for <b>vendor</b> <b>selection.</b> This method does not exclude any <b>vendor</b> from the <b>selection</b> problem. For all the vendors it provides bounds of the efficiency scores depended on the particular data values that the vendors with missing data assign within the intervals so to maximize their efficiency score. Practical implications - The proposed model considers a slightly non-homogeneous situation for <b>vendor</b> <b>selection.</b> The proposed approach is driven by multiple criteria. The joint consideration of multiple criteria in a slightly non-homogeneous environment helps managers select vendors using a comprehensive approach that goes beyond just purchase costs.

Data-processing firms subcontract labor-intensive portions of data services to offshore providers in South and East Asia and Eastern Europe.

Despite the high failure rates, no study has examined the offshore <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> process in the geospatial industry. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the list of key offshore <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> criteria and the efficacy of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for ranking the criteria that North American geospatial companies consider in the offshore <b>vendor</b> <b>selection</b> process.

The SMEs expressed their preferences for one criterion over another by pairwise comparisons, which served as input to the AHP procedure. The results showed that the quality of deliverables was the top ranked (out of 26) factors, instead of the price, which ranked third.
