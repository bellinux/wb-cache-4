Participants: Employment-related information needs were identified via a series of focus group consultations with clients, clinicians, and employment specialists (n= 23). Methods: Focus group discussions were guided by a common semi-structured interview schedule. Results: Several categories of information need were identified: countering incorrect beliefs about work; benefits of work; disclosure and managing personal information; impact of earnings on welfare entitlements; employment service pathways; job preparation, planning and selection; and managing illness once working.

40|$|Introduction: This paper explores {{what happens}} to young people with {{psychosis}} who have competitive employment when they first engage in treatment. Method: 11 of 39 (28 %) of programme participants of an individual placement and support programme who received <b>vocational</b> <b>assistance</b> under the Job in Jeopardy funding were identified. A prospective observational design {{was used to evaluate}} programme outcomes over a minimum of 6 months. Results: It is of interest that the majority of young people who were at risk of losing their job and were receiving assistance did not manage to sustain employment. At the completion of data collection only two people continued to be engaged in competitive employment. Conclusion: Although the sample is very small, {{there appears to be a}} clear trend demonstrating that being engaged in competitive employment at the point of experiencing a first episode of psychosis does not protect an individual against losing that job. It is evident that staff involved with this group of clients need to assist those with employment to maintain it.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} self-report scale of {{subjective}} experiences of illness perceived to impact on employment functioning, {{as an alternative}} to a diagnostic perspective, for anticipating the <b>vocational</b> <b>assistance</b> needs of people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders. Method: A repeated measures pilot study (n = 26, n = 21) of community residents with schizophrenia identified a set of work-related subjective experiences perceived to impact on employment functioning. Items with the best psychometric properties were applied in a 12 month longitudinal survey of urban residents with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (n = 104; n = 94; n = 94). Results: Construct validity, factor structure, responsiveness, internal consistency, stability, and criterion validity investigations produced favourable results. Work-related subjective experiences provide information about the intersection of the person, the disorder, and expectations of employment functioning, which suggest new opportunities for vocational professionals to explore and discuss individual assistance needs. Conclusion: Further psychometric investigations of test-retest reliability, discriminant and predictive validity, and research applications in supported employment and vocational rehabilitation, are recommended. Subject to adequate psychometric properties, the new measure promises to facilitate exploring: individuals 2 ̆ 7 specific subjective experiences; how each is perceived to contribute to employment restrictions; and the corresponding implications for specialized treatment, vocational interventions and workplace accommodation...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To compare {{employment}} {{functioning and}} disability {{among people with}} bipolar affective disorder in comparison to adults with schizophrenia. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted {{using data from the}} Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing 1997 - 1998. Participants were aged 18 - 64 years with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of either bipolar affective disorder (BPD, n = 156) or schizophrenia (n = 385) and were community residents with either outpatient or short-stay inpatient status. The survey began by screening 5, 710 people for psychosis, hence the sample consists mostly of bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Those with BPD were examined both in aggregation with and in contrast to people with schizophrenia on 24 independent variables covering demographic, clinical, and functioning characteristics with respect to two employment status variables and a global rating of social and occupational functioning. Results: The unadjusted and fully adjusted models revealed key functioning differences between BPD and schizophrenia. Adjusted correlates of employment functioning unique to people with BPD were: age, course of disorder, insight into positive symptoms, impairment attributed to medication, family history of schizophrenia, lifetime substance dependence, and lifetime repeated use of illicit or non-prescription drugs. Conclusions: The population-level correlates of employment functioning among people with BPD warrant special attention when providing both clinical and <b>vocational</b> <b>assistance.</b> Employment functioning in both BPD and schizophrenia is partly explained by demographic, clinical and functioning correlates, which can be independent of global assessments of social and occupational functioning...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, a variety of {{programs}} {{have been developed to}} link the seriously mentally ill (SMI) homeless population to the mainstream mental health service system through assertive outreach and case management. Despite previous findings indicating a positive relationship between linkage intervention and residential outcomes, {{little is known about the}} long-term effectiveness of the linkage effort beyond the termination of an intervention program. This study examines the extent to which linkage to services predicts public shelter utilization among SMI homeless persons. ^ The analysis of this study is based on 475 participants of the ACCESS (Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports) national demonstration project in Philadelphia from 1993 to 1998. This study integrated client-level survey interview data and case manager service delivery records during the ACCESS period with administrative data on public shelter use for 24 months following the termination of ACCESS. Cox proportional hazard model and Tobit model examined the effects of the type and amount of case management services contacted and the presence of the therapeutic alliance between ACCESS participants and case managers on the rates of shelter entries and exits, and the length of shelter stay. ^ The study found that use of <b>vocational</b> <b>assistance,</b> housing assistance, and other supportive services was associated with shelter entry, whereas use of mental health services and other supportive services was associated with shelter exit. The length of shelter stay was predicted by use of mental health services, housing assistance, and other supportive services. With the exception of housing assistance use, service use was associated with positive outcomes in public shelter utilization. No empirical relationship was, however, identified between the presence of therapeutic alliance and shelter use. ^ The findings suggest that the service linkage intervention of the ACCESS program could reduce shelter utilization beyond the intervention period. This study also discusses implications for future research and service delivery in order to improve the residential outcomes of SMI homeless persons. ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{overlapping}} {{issues have}} {{given rise to}} this study: the need for assessment instruments to use with Spanish-speaking Latinos and the need for normative data on current and future Spanish-language instruments. Numerous career assessment instruments exist for the English-speaking population. These instruments may be administered on computer-based systems or in paper and pencil format, but few instruments exist for use with the Spanish-speaking population. Holland's Vocational Identity Scale is widely used both as a screening instrument to assess the need for <b>vocational</b> <b>assistance</b> and as an outcome measure in studies of counseling effects. To examine the feasibility of using this English-language instrument with a Spanish-speaking population, a translation of the English- language instrument was prepared, internal consistency of the translated scale was scrutinized, and explorations of the construct validity of the instrument were undertaken. Norms based on a Spanish speaking sample were produced. An overarching question for this study was whether a Spanish translation of My Vocational Situation, which contains the Vocational Identity scale, would yield similar results in terms of reliability and correlations with other variables as the English-language version. The study focused on two additional questions pertaining to the translated scale: To what degree does Identity have a positive correlation with other measures of psychological adjustment? Do groups presumed to be higher in Vocational Identity (more educated persons, persons higher in age) score higher than groups presumed to be lower in vocational identity? Data were collected via the Internet. Measures included Spanish-language versions of four established instruments: My Vocational Situation, Career Decision Self-Efficacy Short Form (CDSE-SF), Hope Scale, and the Neuroticism Scale of Goldberg's International Personality Item Pool. A new experimental scale devised for the present research, Latino Barriers, was also included. Items for each measure were subjected to internal consistency item analyses. Most Spanish language scales were satisfactory based on the item analysis, but one item in the translated Neuroticism scale was deleted. Analysis of the reliability of the measures revealed that the Spanish-language version of the Vocational Identity scale had an alpha of. 86 which was comparable to reliability with the English version for high school students (á =. 86) and for college students and workers (á =. 89) (Holland, Gottfredson, & Power, 1980). Correlations of the translated Vocational Identity scale with other instruments imply that it provides a measure of vocational adjustment with a psychological meaning {{similar to that of the}} English language Vocational Identity scale. It appears appropriate to apply the translated instrument in research and practical applications while continuing to study its psychometric properties and practical utility with Spanish speaking persons...|$|E

40|$|Over 100 {{family members}} were interviewed—individually and in focus groups—to gain a picture of their lived {{experience}} and their perspective on reform of Ontario 2 ̆ 7 s mental health system. The thesis looks at needs of families in two ways. ﬁrst, by examining the common themes of their experience with the mental health system and with supporting 2 ̆ 2 consumers 2 ̆ 2 in the community; and second, by asking families directly about their satisfaction with existing supports, and about needed additional supports. Focus group {{participants were asked to}} make suggestions about innovative models to meet unmet need, and about how families could participate more fully in the mental health system as a 2 ̆ 2 stakeholder 2 ̆ 2. The results provided a picture of families‘ needs and strengths, on an individual and collective basis. Common themes which emerged pertained to a number of different aspects of family experience. First of all, the research documented the struggle to 2 ̆ 2 engage 2 ̆ 2 the mental health system, families found various barriers and facilitating factors in interpreting the presence of a mental health problem, looking for potential sources of help, and then actually accessing supports from the formal mental health care system. The thesis showed the sometimes dire consequences when help was not forthcoming, or was altogether inaccessible. Secondly, family experience with institutional care was documented, showing a wide divergence of perceptions of quality. Negative perceptions were associated with the intimidating hospital atmosphere, criticisms of the medical model, and instances of neglect and abuse. Positive (or ambivalent) perceptions were associated with family respite, 2 ̆ 2 stabilization 2 ̆ 2 and improvement of the consumer, and speciﬁc instances of humane or perceptive care giving. Also, several barriers to families’ goal of informed, active involvement with care were shown, along with successful strategies of becoming involved. Next, families described several themes pertaining to their relative 2 ̆ 7 s transition to the community, and his or her connection with ongoing community resources Descriptions of the actual transition process revealed, again, lack of family involvement, instances of premature discharge (with questionable hospital motives), and lack of assistance with the transition to community life, including connection to ongoing resources. Families made speciﬁc comments about the existence and appropriateness of housing, vocational support, income maintenance, and social support. A common theme here was families‘ criticism that supports were designed in such a way to prevent integration in the different aspects of community life. Various struggles which family members faced on a day to day basis were documented, including disruption of daily work routines, of social and family life, of future hopes and plans, and of the mental health of other family members. The thesis also documented ways in which people had adapted to and changed their situation for the better. Personal resources, and assistance from family support groups were significant in this regard. Satisfaction ratings of existing supports revealed that families on the whole were somewhere between 2 ̆ 2 neutral 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 somewhat satisﬁed 2 ̆ 2 with formal resources They were 2 ̆ 2 somewhat satisﬁed 2 ̆ 2 with informal resources, such as the support of family and friends. Ratings of needed new resources, as inferred by frequency of listings, revealed that <b>vocational</b> <b>assistance,</b> information/referral, and housing were top priority for family members. Quantitative and qualitative material was then synthesized to give a broader context to family needs. The qualitative themes indicative of need (for example, lack of information about available resources) were matched with appropriate quantitative ratings, thus providing an indication of urgency of the need, then, key recommendations were included which were made by families as to how that need could or should be met. A ﬁnal section provides a dynamic picture of needs by showing how each changes {{in the course of the}} families’ experience with different components of the mental health system, and how each changes as individual and collective family strengths manifest themselves...|$|E

25|$|A {{government}} decree of March 1982 {{sought to}} provide greater employment {{security for the}} increasing number of workers on part-time and fixed-term contracts by restricting the circumstances in which employers could use such labour (this was largely to ensure that permanent employees were not displaced by cheaper and more easily dismissed part-time workers). The law set out to ensure that such workers receive the same benefits as full-time workers and trade unions were given statutory rights to institute legal proceedings against employers or temporary work agencies if the provisions of the new law were evaded. That same year, the government passed legislation to ensure the full, legal eligibility of women for all civil service posts and an active policy was adopted to encourage them to come forward for promotion. In 1981, legislation was passed which permitted the establishment of local private radio stations. In March 1982, a “Special Statute” was granted to Corsica, which set the territory apart legally from other regions and provided it with additional state subsidies and greater autonomy over cultural, social, economic, and educational policies. Various measures were also introduced to improve conditions for migrants. A new drive began in 1981 to encourage local authorities to establish programmes including literacy programmes, housing schemes, and the setting up of young people’s and women’s groups, and in 1983 France ratified the Council of Europe’s Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers. The Association Law of 1981 allowed foreigners {{for the first time to}} form associations in France under the same rules that governed citizens, and these new immigrant associations were thereafter eligible to receive public funding. New policies removed the French language requirements of immigrants to run for seats in employee institutions, and foreign workers became eligible for the first time to sit on important industrial relations councils known as the Conseils des Prud’hommes. In 1982, an existing programme to assist the repatriation of Algerian nationals was replaced by a system offering a choice between <b>vocational</b> training, <b>assistance</b> to set up a small business and a repatriation grant.|$|R
50|$|Nigeria {{continued}} {{its efforts to}} protect trafficking victims in 2009. Police, customs, immigration, and NAPTIP officials systematically employed procedures to identify victims among high-risk persons, such as young women or girls traveling with non-family members. Data provided by NAPTIP reflected a total of 1,109 victims identified and provided assistance at one of NAPTIP’s eight shelters throughout the country during the reporting period; 624 were cases of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation and 328 for labor exploitation. Various government agencies referred trafficking victims to NAPTIP for sheltering and other protective services: immigration referred 465; police referred 277; Social Services referred 192; and the State Security Service referred nine. Shelter staff assessed the needs of victims upon arrival and provided food, clothing, shelter, recreational activities, and instruction on various skills, including vocational training; psychological counseling was provided to only the most severe cases. While at NAPTIP’s shelters, 70 victims received <b>vocational</b> training <b>assistance</b> provided by government funding. NAPTIP estimated the government’s 2009 spending on its shelter facilities to be $666,000. The 2003 Trafficking in Persons Law Enforcement and Administration Act provides for treatment, protection, and non-discriminatory practices for victims. The law specified no trafficking victim could be detained for any offense committed {{as a result of}} being trafficked. During the reporting period, the government took steps to relocate victims’ quarters a considerable distance from detention areas for trafficking offenders, greatly reducing the possibility traffickers could exert undue influence over their victims. Victims were allowed to stay in government shelters for six weeks. If a longer time period was needed, civil society partner agencies were contacted to take in the victim. Officials encouraged victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of traffickers, and victims served as witnesses in all of NAPTIP’s successful cases. Victims could theoretically seek redress through civil suits against traffickers, or claim funds from a Victims’ Trust Fund set up in 2009 through which assets confiscated from traffickers are transferred to victims. The Trust Fund committee is chaired by the Minister of Justice and meets four times per year. The government provided a limited legal alternative to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution - short-term residency that cannot be extended.|$|R

Although not engaged in destructive activities, over half were living with their family members who supported them financially and emotionally. Most were unemployed and had been so for a long time. Others worked sporadically and frequently changed residences.
