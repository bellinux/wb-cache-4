5|$|Although high {{waves and}} severe northeasterly gusts were noted from 6to 7September 1804 at St. Augustine, Florida and {{eight of the}} nine <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> the local port were {{rendered}} unfit for use, the town proper largely escaped damage.|$|E

5000|$|CCGS Brant was a Canadian Coast Guard <b>vessel</b> <b>in</b> service between 1928 and 1966. Stationed on the East Coast of Canada, Brant was {{deployed}} as a navigation aids tender. Brant was {{the last}} coal-burning <b>vessel</b> <b>in</b> Canadian government service.|$|R

5|$|Most shipwrecks {{involved}} ships over 20 {{years in}} age. A glut of ships {{of this age}} occurred in the 1980s, caused by an overestimate {{of the growth of}} international trade. Rather than replace them prematurely, shipping companies were compelled on cost grounds to keep their aging <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> service.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{collisions}} frequently {{occur in}} Tsushima Strait {{and result in}} damaging all of whales, passengers, and vessels, hence the Japanese Coast Guard has started visual recordings of large cetaceans in Tsushima Strait to inform operating <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> the areas.|$|E

50|$|The first USS Sabalo (SP-225) was a United States Navy patrol <b>vessel</b> <b>in</b> {{commission}} from 1917 to 1919. Following World War I, Sabalo {{was sold}} to private interests before returning to service as a patrol <b>vessel</b> <b>in</b> World War II, {{this time with the}} Royal Canadian Navy, renamed Cougar. Returning to private ownership following the war, the <b>vessel</b> sank <b>in</b> a hurricane in 1950.|$|R

5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of double hull has been more of an economic than a purely architectural decision, some argue that double-sided ships receive less comprehensive surveys and suffer more from hidden corrosion. In spite of opposition, double hulls became a requirement for Panamax and Capesize <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} court-martial at Port Royal on 3 September {{ruled that}} a sudden change in the current after dark had caused the loss. The board acknowledged that Pamplin had sailed in a judicious manner and exonerated him and his officers from blame both {{for the loss of}} Lowestoffe and the <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> convoy.|$|E
5|$|A post-war German study faulted U-68s commander, Kptlt. Güntzel, {{for failing}} to follow {{established}} procedures for dealing with neutral-flagged <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> order to avoid decoy ships like Farnborough. According to the report, Güntzel had broken almost all the rules when approaching Farnborough. However, Kommodore Hermann Bauer, {{the commander of the}} German High Seas Fleet U-boats, in his post-war memoirs, reports Güntzel was an inexperienced captain and had not, contrary to usual practice, been first sent to sea under a more experienced U-boat captain to gain knowledge.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Kellner {{suggested}} that the large crests of the pterosaur Tapejara, {{as well as other}} species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size. There is no evidence of extra blood <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> the crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the other}} {{missions}} that Connecticut Wing currently performs is the Long Island Sound Patrol (LISP) program. LISP flies patrol missions across Long Island Sound {{during the summer}} months in coordination with the United States Coast Guard to provide more immediate assistance to <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> distress. The Wing was credited with numerous finds and saves in the year following its inception in summer 2007, and plans are in effect to continue the program.|$|E
5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in blood <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> {{the skin of the}} feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E

5|$|As First Sea Lord, Battenberg was {{responsible}} to the First Lord for {{the readiness of}} the fleet and the preparation of naval strategy, {{as well as the}} development of a scheme for state insurance of merchant <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> times of war, which was to prove essential in preventing prohibitive insurance rates that would have stifled British trade.|$|E
5|$|Between July and December 1941, the {{garrison}} received 8,500 reinforcements. After years of parsimony, much equipment was shipped. By November, {{a backlog of}} 1,100,000 shipping tons of equipment intended for the Philippines had accumulated in U.S. ports and depots awaiting <b>vessels.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the Navy intercept station in the islands, known as Station CAST, had an ultra secret Purple cipher machine, which decrypted Japanese diplomatic messages, and partial codebooks for the latest JN-25 naval code. Station CAST sent MacArthur its entire output, via Sutherland, the only officer on his staff authorized to see it.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> state rituals and ceremonies. This {{and the belief that}} ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the fact, finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} in 1867 until 1895, when she was removed from front-line service {{to serve as a}} training ship. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871, the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Jachmann. Engine trouble, however, plagued the ship and two of the other three <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> the squadron; as a result, they made only two sorties from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade. Neither resulted in combat.|$|E
