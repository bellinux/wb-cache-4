The bed dimension is 800 × 2000 × 12 mm in wide, height, and depth directions, respectively, filled with 12, 210 spherical granular particles of diameter of 12 mm. The particles are loaded onto the bed from nine fixed points equally spaced {{at the top and}} discharged from a 120 mm wide orifice {{at the bottom of the}} bed. By tracking particle trajectories and analyzing them via probability density function, a Gaussian-form dispersion of particles in the horizontal direction is shown. The results are validated by experimental observations. For mechanical analysis, an ideal but general geometrical model of particle dispersion is proposed. It explains the mechanism of Gaussian distribution and the feature of narrow band configuration of particle dispersion successfully. It improves the understanding of particle dispersion characteristics of gravity-driven slow particle flow, and provides a way to estimate the performance of particle-bed reactor...|$|E

Laminar filling of the silo with layers of various moisture content (8 and 16 % w. b.) was applied.

During the 10 -day study cycle, oat temperature increased up to 45 Ã‚Â°C, that of triticale to 39 Ã‚Â°C and rye to 25. 5 Ã‚Â°C.

Higher temperatures were obtained when the lower layer had 8 % w. b. moisture content and the upper - 16 % w. b., but lower temperatures were observed when placement was reversed. The highest temperatures were noted at the border between layers. Temperature of grain situated along the silo symmetry axis was higher than at its walls. The highest load values were obtained for triticale (3. 8 kPa), the lowest for oats (1. 88 kPa).

40|$|Few studies {{concern the}} {{prediction}} of the mass flow rate of a granular media discharged from a silo with a lateral orifice. However, this situation can have pratical interest considering a tank of granular material with a leak on its side. We studied experimentally the discharge of a <b>vertical</b> <b>silo</b> filled by spherical glass beads. We consider rectangular silos with a rectangular orifice. The impact of size, aspect ratio and position of the orifice {{and the effect of}} an additional air flow were studied. The measured parameters are the mass flow rate and the pressure along the silo, whereas the controlled parameters are the size of particles, and the flow rate of air. We identified two regimes of discharge according to the aspect ratio (of width to height) of the rectangular orifice. Increasing the air flow rate induces an increase of the granular media flow rate. Using a simple physical model to describe the grains and gas flow, we put in evidence the role played by the air pressure gradient at the outlet. Then we compared the experimental results with continuum Navier-Stokes simulations with the granular μ(I) -rheology. We showed that the continuum μ(I) -rheology describes well our discharge flow of granular media from silos, taking into account the effect of the position of the orifice as well as the coupling with the gas flow...|$|E
40|$|Wheat (Australian Standard White) with a {{moisture}} content of 10. 2 % was fumigated with carbonyl sulphide (COS) at a calculated application rate of 24. 14 g m- 3, {{in a sealed}} concrete <b>vertical</b> <b>silo</b> (3512 m 3, 2500 t wheat) located at Nevertire, NSW, Australia. The COS was applied as a liquid via {{the top of the}} silo and released 2 m below the grain surface. The application of 84. 5 kg of COS was completed within 30 min. With 2 h of recirculation using a 0. 4 kW fan, the in-silo concentrations of COS achieved equilibrium with a concentration variation less than 5 % of the mean. After a two-day exposure period, the COS concentration in the silo remained at 29 g m- 3. The concentration×time product (Ct) was then 1900 g h m- 3, and this achieved complete kill of all life stages of mixed-age cultures of Sitophilus oryzae, Rhyzopertha dominica, Tribolium castaneum and Trogoderma variabile. After 2 -days exposure, the silo was aired overnight with an aeration fan (25 kW) resulting in a COS in-silo concentration of below 4 ppm. This is 2. 5 times lower than the Australian Experimental Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 10 ppm. Residues of COS in the wheat declined to below the Australian Experimental Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) of 0. 2 mg kg- 1 after overnight aeration. The COS was not detected in any outloading samples at concentrations above the detection limit (0. 05 mg kg- 1). The workspace and environmental levels of COS were monitored during application, fumigation, aeration and outloading. The levels of COS and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) were less than the detection limit of 0. 1 ppm, which was 100 times lower than the TLV of 10 ppm.

40|$|The correct {{structural}} design of storage silos for granular solids {{depends on the}} lateral and vertical stresses that are exerted by the stored solids on the silo walls. Standard {{structural design}} specifications are reported in international design codes as Eurocode EN 1991 - 4 : 2006 [1] and in related national standards. The estimate of the load that acts on a <b>vertical</b> <b>silo</b> wall is usually performed by applying the Janssen [2] method of differential slices, which requires {{the evaluation of the}} horizontal to vertical stress ratio or the lateral pressure ratio, K. An experimental device for the measurement of the horizontal to vertical stress ratio had been purposely built and tested for fine and cohesive solids [3]. With powder testing the source of error in measurement procedure for powder flow properties may arise from different sources and, in particular from a) the story of the powder sample or b) some forces not properly accounted in the measurement, such as those due to unduly neglected frictions. Proper measurement procedures should determine measurement conditions in which both sources of errors are minimized or appropriately accounted for. For example, for the developed device [3], it was found that that a twisting action on the lid of the cylindrical powder cell was able to produce reliable repeatable results, by possibly minimizing both the effect of the powder history and of the uncounted powder friction on the cell lid. In order to asses on the possible sources of errors in the proposed experimental procedures a large set of experiments was carried out by using model material made of Glass spheres (6 mm), plastic spheres (5 mm), steel spheres (2 mm). Comparison on the scatter {{of the value of the}} vertical to horizontal stress ratio obtained within a single experiment at different load values and the scatter of data between different sets of experiments it can be concluded that with these materials the largest source of error is due to unpredictable differences in the internal structure of the particulate materials. Furthermore, the comparison between the Coulomb representation of the flow properties of the particulate solids and the Mohr representation of the state of stress in the device obtained by assuming the vertical and the horizontal stress as principal stresses confirms the hypothesis that the condition of incipient internal shear of the material is reached by showing Mohr circles tangent to the yield locus. This conditions confirms that the proposed measurement procedure is in fact able to minimize the effects of the lid friction on the sample. Well known hysteresis effects in the unloading part of the experiments are also observed in our experiments and reported. It is verified that, for the tested material, no memory of the previous compression experiment is found only in the case in which the complete sample unloading is reached between the two subsequent experiments.
