Agagianian {{was the only one of}} these four from the Curia, and represented the Eastern Catholic Churches. He had a special role in the preparation of the missionary decree Ad gentes and Gaudium et spes, the Constitution on the Church in the Modern World.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{following}} the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularisation, and for liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962. In 2012, the 50th anniversary of <b>Vatican</b> <b>II,</b> an assembly of the Synod of Bishops discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics in the developed world. Benedict resigned due to advanced age in 2013, the first pope to do so in nearly six hundred years.|$|E
5|$|The Stonyhurst Officer Training Corps {{assembled}} for {{the first}} time on 16 October 1900, in the Ambulacrum, overseen by The First Volunteer Battalion, the East Lancashire Regiment who gave instruction in drill and musketry. The original uniform was scarlet with a white piping and slouch hat, which was changed to khaki before the First World War. The Corps was granted the honour of representation at the Coronation of 1910 and sent members to the Royal Review at Windsor in 1911. It also appeared on parade annually for the spectacle of the Corpus Christi celebrations until the practice became obsolete after <b>Vatican</b> <b>II.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of <b>Vatican</b> <b>II’s</b> handling of the theme of obedience, conducted {{from the standpoint of}} systematic theology. It is not a study of the development of ideas about obedience {{during the course of the}} Council; it treats Vatican Il 1 s documents as a finished corpus, using earlier magisterial statements as historical background against which to discern shifted emphases in the theology presented by the Council. In Chapter I we establish obedience as a pivotal idea in relation to which the co-ordination of <b>Vatican</b> <b>II's</b> ecclesiology, anthropology, and doctrine of God may be examined. Chapters II-V consider the place of obedience in the Council's ecclesiology; we find obedience correlated with a view of authority rooted in the concept of the ‘invitatory sign'. This view modifies the formerly predominantly jurisdictional emphasis in the Catholic perception of authority, by integrating jurisdiction more closely with kerygma and sacrament. However, although the jurisdictional element of authority is thus modified and relativised, it remains important. We find that <b>Vatican</b> <b>II's</b> ideal of obedience is generally logically consistent with its view of authority, but is not necessarily socially plausible. In matters of doctrine, issues are made more complex still by the Council's shift in epistemology. This, together with the fresh kerygmatic and sacramental perspectives, made it inevitable that infallible teaching should prove contentious after the Council. Chapter VI forms a bridge: The implications of <b>Vatican</b> <b>II’s</b> concept of ecclesiastical obedience for anthropology and the doctrine of God are drawn out. In Chapter VII we test hitherto unexamined passages from the documents against these implications. Generally, we find broad theoretical consistency throughout <b>Vatican</b> <b>II’s</b> presentation of the divine-human relationship in all its 'moments', of which obedient Church membership is one. The extent of this consistency, together with remaining tensions, are summarised in the Postscript...|$|R

5|$|Italy, {{being one}} of Catholicism's seminal nations, {{has a long history}} of music for the Roman Catholic Church. Until {{approximately}} 1800, it was possible to hear Gregorian Chant and Renaissance polyphony, such as the music of Palestrina, Lassus, Anerio, and others. Approximately 1800 to approximately 1900 was a century during which a more popular, operatic, and entertaining type of church music was heard, to the exclusion of the aforementioned chant and polyphony. In the late 19th century, the Cecilian Movement was started by musicians who fought to restore this music. This movement gained impetus not in Italy but in Germany, particularly in Regensburg. The movement reached its apex around 1900 with the ascent of Don Lorenzo Perosi and his supporter (and future saint), Pope Pius X. The advent of <b>Vatican</b> <b>II,</b> however, nearly obliterated all Latin-language music from the Church, once again substituting it with a more popular style.|$|E
25|$|Following <b>Vatican</b> <b>II,</b> the {{perception}} that Marian devotions had decreased was expressed by several authors. Other authors have indicated that the continued strength of devotion to Mary within Catholicism following <b>Vatican</b> <b>II</b> has been manifested in multiple forms worldwide. Examples of this are the increase in Marian pilgrimages at major Marian shrines {{and the construction of}} major new Marian Basilicas since <b>Vatican</b> <b>II.</b>|$|E
25|$|Marian devotions {{were the}} {{hallmark}} of the pontificate of Pope John Paul II and he reoriented the Catholic Church towards the renewal of Marian veneration. In March 1987 he went further than Paul VI in extending the Catholic views on Mary beyond <b>Vatican</b> <b>II</b> by issuing the encyclical Redemptoris Mater. Rather than being just a new presentation of the Marian views of <b>Vatican</b> <b>II,</b> Redemptoris Mater was in many aspects a re-reading, re-interpretation and further extension of the teachings of <b>Vatican</b> <b>II.</b>|$|E
