50|$|The {{courtship}} display involves steep dives with folded wings with swoops up in a U {{shape into}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>stall.</b> They build a platform nest, 3 to 4 feet wide, on a tall tree overlooking a steep valley. One or two white eggs which are blotched in brown and mauve may be laid during the nesting season between January and April. The nest site may be reused year after year.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vertical}} stabilizer often employs a small fillet or [...] "dorsal fin" [...] at its forward base which helps {{to increase the}} stall angle of the vertical surface (thanks to vortex lift) and to prevent a phenomenon called rudder lock or rudder reversal. Rudder lock occurs when the force on a deflected rudder (in a steady sideslip) suddenly reverses as the <b>vertical</b> stabilizer <b>stalls.</b> This may leave the rudder stuck at full deflection with the pilot unable to recenter it. The fillet is sometimes called a dorsal fin.|$|R
25|$|Air Midwest Flight 5481, a Beechcraft 1900D, on 8 January 2003. On takeoff from Charlotte/Douglas International Airport, it pitched {{up into a}} <b>vertical</b> ascent and <b>stalled,</b> only 37 {{seconds later}} smashing into a US Airways hangar, despite the captain {{applying}} full elevator down. There were 21 fatalities. The NTSB {{found out that the}} plane had been overweight and that during maintenance, the tension turnbuckles that governed elevator movement had been set incorrectly by an inexperienced mechanic. This caused the elevators to lose control upon takeoff.|$|R
5000|$|The West Hollywood Blondes was a {{professional}} wrestling tag team consisting of Lenny Lane and Lodi. During their later careers in World Championship Wrestling, they were billed as [...] "brothers". The team formed in 1999 as a parody of the original Hollywood Blonds. Their gimmick saw them entering the ring wearing glitter and licking Blow Pops. In the ring, they also devised a unique <b>stalling</b> <b>vertical</b> suplex, flying crossbody combination. After being removed from television by Turner Broadcasting System Standards and Practices, the team briefly reformed as Standards and Practices, a satirical reference to the S&P of Turner, before disbanding in 2001.|$|R
40|$|The present paper aims {{to provide}} {{aerodynamic}} design guidelines for an aircraft dorsal fin, obtained using CFD RANS technique. A parametric aerodynamic investigation about dorsal fin length, height, sweep angle, and planform {{area has been}} performed in order to evaluate the effects of geometric variations on the dorsal fin and vertical tail aerodynamic behavior in sideslip conditions. More than 30 dorsal fin geometries have been investigated, mounted on a typical large turbopropeller fuselage with a vertical tail. Main results {{show that there is}} no effect of the dorsal fin up to 20 ° of sideslip angle. At higher angles, the <b>vertical</b> tail <b>stalls</b> and the flow field around the empennage is strongly influenced by two vortices generated by the dorsal fin intersection with the fuselage (primary vortex) and with the vertical tail (secondary vortex). The stall phenomenon appears around 35 ° of sideslip angle. Moreover, dorsal fin slightly reduced fuselage instability. Finally, some wind tunnel tests have been performed on two dorsal fin geometries to validate the numerical analyses. Experimental tests have shown a good agreement with CFD simulations and have given useful qualitative indications on the aerodynamic behavior of the vertical tail at high angles of sideslip, with and without dorsal fin...|$|R
50|$|The {{first to}} notice a problem was Eldar, who {{observed}} that the plane was banking right. Shortly after, the flight path indicator changed to show the new flight path of the aircraft as it turned. Since the turn was continuous, the resulting predicted flight path drawn on screen was a 180-degree turn. This indication {{is similar to the}} indications shown when in a holding pattern, where a 180-degree turn is intentional to remain in one place. This confused the pilots for nine seconds. During this confusion, the plane banked past a 45-degree angle to almost 90 degrees (steeper than it was designed for). The A310 cannot turn this steeply while maintaining height, and the plane started to lose altitude quickly. The increased g-forces on the pilots and crew made it extremely difficult for them to regain control. The autopilot (which no longer controlled the ailerons) used its other controls in a bid to compensate, pitching the nose up and increasing thrust. The plane began to stall. The autopilot, unable to cope, disengaged and its display went blank. To recover from the stall, an automatic system lowered the nose and put the plane into a nosedive. The reduced g-forces enabled the captain to re-take his seat. The co-pilot then managed {{to pull out of the}} dive, but over-corrected, putting the plane in an almost <b>vertical</b> ascent, again <b>stalling</b> the plane, which fell out of the sky into a corkscrew dive. Though the captain and the co-pilot regained control and leveled out the wings, their altitude by then was too low to recover, and the plane crashed at high vertical speed, estimated at 70 m/s. All 75 aboard were killed.|$|R
