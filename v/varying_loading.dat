40|$|Graduation date: 1987 To apply {{accurate}} {{procedures of}} structural analysis {{that are now}} available, the behavior of nailed joints in light-frame wood buildings under long-term loads needs to be studied. Such a behavior can best be evaluated by testing specimens under constant loads, which requires relatively simple testing arrangements. To provide for a practical use of the constant-load test results, theoretical models were developed that predict the behavior of nailed joints under <b>varying</b> <b>loads</b> that are subjected to wood structures in service. Existing models and principles were used to develop five new general models, all of which account for the nonlinear viscous-viscoelastic behavior of nailed joints. The models incorporated the modified superposition principle and strain hardening principle. Heaviside function and Fourier series were also incorporated to describe <b>varying</b> <b>loads</b> that can be either discrete or mathematically defined continuous function. To develop experimental data needed for the formulation and verification of the models developed, joints made of Douglas-fir lumber, plywood and 6 d nails were tested under four constant and four <b>varying</b> <b>loads.</b> The experimental data for constant loads were used to formulate specific theoretical models which were further modified for <b>varying</b> <b>loads.</b> The comparison between the predicted and the corresponding test results shows a very good agreement for all the specific models. The models that include the modified superposition principle are the most accurate and the simplest to apply to nailed joints under discrete load functions. Fourier series representation of varying-load functions shows a great potential for practical applications, because it can represent the service loads more accurately than the discrete approximation. The specific models presented are limited {{to the type of}} joints used in this investigation. Other types of joints need to be tested under constant loads to develop appropriate equations that describe their creep behavior under <b>varying</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R
