5|$|The {{interiors}} of churches were often more elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, {{like the ones}} surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, created in the mid-fifteenth century, elaborately depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, are considered {{some of the finest}} in the Gothic style. Monumental effigies began to appear in churches from the thirteenth century and they were usually fully coloured and gilded. Many were founders and patrons of churches and chapels, including members of the clergy, knights and often their wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to brass etchings, they continued to be produced {{until the end of the}} Medieval period, with the largest group dating from the fifteenth century, including the very elaborate Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas. Sometimes the best continental artists were employed, as for Robert I's elaborate tomb in Dunfermline Abbey, which was made in his lifetime by the Parisian sculptor Thomas of Chartres, but of which only fragments now survive. The greatest group of surviving sculpture from this period are from the West Highlands, beginning in the fourteenth century on Iona under the patronage of the Lordship of the Isles and continuing until the Reformation. Common motifs were ships, swords, harps and Romanesque <b>vine</b> <b>leaf</b> tracery with Celtic elements.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} design used during this great period owes {{much of its}} {{interest}} to the now obsolete custom of directly employing the craftsman and his men, instead of the present-day habit of giving the work to a contractor. It is easy to trace how those bands of carvers traveled about from church to church. In one district the designer would employ a particular form and arrangement of <b>vine</b> <b>leaf,</b> while in another adjoining quite a different style repeatedly appears. The general scheme was of course planned by one mastermind, but the carrying out of each section, each part, each detail, was left to the individual workman. Hence that variety of treatment, that endless diversity, which gives a charm and interest to Gothic art, unknown in more symmetrical epochs. The Gothic craftsman appreciated the cardinal fact that in design beautiful detail does not necessarily ensure a beautiful composition, and subordinated the individual part to the general effect. He also often carved in situ, a practice seldom if ever followed in the present day. Here and there one comes across the work of long years ago still unfinished. A half-completed bench-end, a fragment of screen left plain, clearly show that sometimes at least the church was the workshop.|$|E

6000|$|It appears then, {{not only}} from natural principles, but from the highest of all authority, that {{thorough}} knowledge of the lowest details is necessary and full expression of them right, even in the highest class of historical painting; {{that it will not}} take away from, nor interfere with, the interest of the figures; but, rightly managed, must add to and elucidate it; and, if further proof be wanting, I would desire the reader to compare the background of Sir Joshua's [...] "Holy Family," [...] in the National Gallery, with that of Nicolo Poussin's [...] "Nursing of Jupiter," [...] in the Dulwich Gallery.

Its trunk, in both sculptures, forms the true outer angle of the palace; boldly cut separate from the stone-work behind, and branching out above the figures so as to enwrap {{each side of the}} angle, for several feet, with its deep foliage. Nothing can be more masterly or superb than the sweep of this foliage on the Fig-tree angle; the broad leaves lapping round the budding fruit, and sheltering from sight, beneath their shadows, birds of the most graceful form and delicate plumage. The branches are, however, so strong, and the masses of stone hewn into leafage so large, that, notwithstanding the depth of the undercutting, the work remains nearly uninjured; not so at the Vine angle, where the natural delicacy of the vine-leaf and tendril having tempted the sculptor to greater effort, he has passed the proper limits of his art, and cut the upper stems so delicately that half of them have been broken away by the casualties to which the situation of the sculpture necessarily exposes it.

The treatments included: (1) well-irrigated control: re-irrigation when the soil moisture tension reached 15 kPa; (2) regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) : re-irrigation 4 to 7 days after reaching a soil moisture tension of 15 kPa; (3) fixed partial root-zone wetting (FPRW) : one part of the root system was re-irrigated when the soil moisture tension reached 15 kPa; and (4) alternate partial root-zone wetting (APRW) : one part of the root system was re-irrigated when the soil moisture tension reached 15 kPa, and every week the irrigated part was switched.

Perhaps {{we go along}} to visit our friends {{at the other end}} of the village, where there is always a good welcome and a good talk, and perhaps some pickled oysters and white wine to close the evening. Or a dance is {{organised}} in the dining-room, and the piano exhibits all its paces under manful jockeying, to the light of three or four candles and a lamp or two, while the waltzers move to and fro upon the wooden floor, and sober men, who are not given to such light pleasures, get up on the table or the sideboard, and sit there looking on approvingly over a pipe and a tumbler of wine. Or sometimes--suppose my lady moon looks forth, and the court from out the half-lit dining-room seems nearly as bright as by day, and the light picks out the window-panes, and makes a clear shadow under every <b>vine</b> <b>leaf</b> on the wall--sometimes a picnic is proposed, and a basket made ready, and a good procession formed in front of the hotel. The two trumpeters in honour go before; and as we file down the long alley, and up through devious footpaths among rocks and pine-trees, with every here and there a dark passage of shadow, and every here and there a spacious outlook over moonlit woods, these two precede us and sound many a jolly flourish as they walk. We gather ferns and dry boughs into the cavern, and soon a good blaze flutters the shadows of the old bandits' haunt, and shows shapely beards and comely faces and toilettes ranged about the wall. The bowl is lit, and the punch is burnt and sent round in scalding thimblefuls. So a good hour or two may pass with song and jest. And then we go home in the moonlight morning, straggling a good deal among the birch tufts and the boulders, but ever called together again, as one of our leaders winds his horn. Perhaps some one of the party will not heed the summons, but chooses out some by-way of his own. As he follows the winding sandy road, he hears the flourishes grow fainter and fainter in the distance, and die finally out, and still walks on in the strange coolness and silence and between the crisp lights and shadows of the moonlit woods, until suddenly the bell rings out the hour from far-away Chailly, and he starts to find himself alone. No surf-bell on forlorn and perilous shores, no passing knell over the busy market-place, can speak with a more heavy and disconsolate tongue to human ears. Each stroke calls up a host of ghostly reverberations in his mind. And as he stands rooted, it has grown once more so utterly silent that it seems to him he might hear the church-bells ring the hour out all the world over, not at Chailly only, but in Paris, and away in outlandish cities, and in the village on the river, where his childhood passed between the sun and flowers.|$|E

40|$|Vineyards {{containing}} vines affected with grapevine leaf {{stripe disease}} (GLSD), {{one of the}} diseases of the esca complex, suffer losses in grape yield and quality every growing season. To examine the relation between GLSD foliar symptoms and levels of phytoalexins in grapevine, phytoalexin levels were monitored in the leaves of symptomatic, asymptomatic/diseased, and healthy grapevine leaves, at various growth stages, in two vineyards in Italy, over four growing seasons. At the same time, the leaf symptoms of the vines at some of those growth stages were recorded in each vineyard and in each growing season. The compounds extracted and identified were: trans -resveratrol, trans -pterostilbene, trans-ε-viniferin and trans-δ-viniferin. The most common phytoalexin found was resveratrol. Amounts of all the phytoalexins were generally greater in symptomatic leaves than in asymptomatic/diseased or healthy leaves. In symptomatic leaves, resveratrol levels were greatest at pre-bunch closure, and peaks in pterostilbene occurred at the same time. Leaves of each category (symptomatic, asymptomatic/diseased, healthy) had lower amounts of these compounds at veraison and generally higher amounts at the stages of harvesting and/or the softening of berries. It seems therefore that the formation and pattern over time of the phytoalexins {{was linked to the}} growth stage of the <b>vines.</b> <b>Leaf</b> symptoms never occurred before pre-bunch closure, but became much more common from veraison to harvest.
