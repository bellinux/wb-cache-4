40|$|In {{this work}} {{we have tried}} to solve several {{problems}} that involve scalar and <b>vectorial</b> <b>image</b> information lying on the plane or on 3 D surfaces. We will present and discuss four novel algorithms devised to solve those problems: tracking of objects in movies, tracking of regions on deforming 3 D surfaces, restoration of damaged pictures, removal of objects from images, and solving of PDE's on implicit surfaces for denoising, texture synthesis and flow visualization. Examples are shown and future lines of research are suggested, both to improve performance and to extend the present techniques to new applications. iii Contents...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for automatic neural image analysis in immunostained vertebrate retinas. We present {{a useful tool}} for cell quantification avoiding the lost of information of traditional binary techniques in automatic recognition of images. The application is based on the extension of the mathematical morphology to colour images. In the paper, we define the basics and more complex morphological operations to <b>vectorial</b> <b>image</b> processing. We propose and demonstrate a colour image reconstruction by geodesic transformations. In addition, we adapt the morphological segmentation of greyscale image to the segmentation of multispectral images of retinas of monkeys.

It adapts the Max-tree image representation to accommodate color and other <b>vectorial</b> <b>images.</b> The proposed method introduces three {{new ways of}} transforming the color image into a gray scale image that is filtered using conventional methods. Three new color reconstruction mechanisms are also proposed. The best method improves color fidelity {{by as much as}} 15 %. The perfomance of six attribute filters are also compared on a jpeg compression operation. ...|$|R

The generic framework {{is based on}} a supervised learning formulation which leads to reduced orderings. A training set for the background and another training set for the foreground are needed as well as a supervised method to construct the ordering mapping. In particular, we consider here a kriging-based vectorial ordering. This supervised ordering may then used for the extension of mathematical morphology to <b>vectorial</b> <b>images.</b> Application of morphological processing to hyperspectral image illustrates the performance of proposal operators...|$|R

It is based on a study conducted by Braillenet for enriching the Helene’s digital library with technical contents. By analysing publishing guidelines, transcribers’ work in specialized centres and main relief printing formats, this work presents thoughts on how to analyse a graphical content, how to produce <b>vectorial</b> <b>images,</b> the main steps for preparing digital image files that could be downloaded and printed, how to index these files into the DAISY book, and finally make them accessible...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDynamic PET imaging {{enables the}} study of {{radiotracers}} concentration kinetics along time. However, PET images suffer from limited spatial resolution, low signal-to-noise ratio, and time dependent contrast between tissues, making segmentation of biological volumes difficult. Deformable models are of great interest due to their inherent boundary continuity, but their applications to PET images still remains challenging due to high sensitivity to noise. To address these limitations, we propose a method to perform 3 -D+time dynamic PET image segmentation using parametric active surfaces based on a gradient of the <b>vectorial</b> <b>image.</b> This method takes advantage of both spatial and temporal consistency of the signal along the acquisition. We validate our method using GATE Monte Carlo simulations and compare it with single frame based active surface models. We show significant improvement of several figures of merit...|$|E
40|$|The Material Point Method (MPM) was {{implemented}} {{to predict the}} mechanical behavior of the cellular arrangement of biological tissues. The choice of this method was motivated by its ability to easily account for the actual and complex morphology of bioproducts at the cellular level {{and to deal with}} large deformations. The <b>vectorial</b> <b>image</b> processing facilities provided by the custom software MeshPore allow such a procedure to be easily applied to microscopic images. In this work, the morphology of the cellular structure is observed using an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM). Our MPM model has been adapted to model the collapse of the cellular structure due to a negative water pressure inside the cell lumens. The simulations illustrate how the cellular morphology, resulting from the formation of radial lines of cells, induced a collapse mainly in the tangential direction of wood. The computed deformation in the tangential direction is roughly five fold the radial one. Finally, we discuss how the same modeling chain of tools, from image to computed results, could be applied to other bio-products, namely the cellular structure of fruits or vegetable...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{qualitative}} shape recognition and matching {{of objects in}} designs is presented in this paper. The approach consists of a reference-points information approach of the qualitative description of shapes considering qualitatively their angles, relative side length, concavities and convexities, and types of curvatures of the boundary. The shapes recognised are regular and non-regular closed polygons that can have curve segments and curvilinear shapes. Moreover the shapes can contain holes. To describe shapes with holes, topological and qualitative spatial orientation aspects are considered in order to relate the hole with its container. Each object is described by a string containing its qualitative distinguished features (symbolic representation), {{which is used to}} match the object against others. The paper also describes how this method can be used in industrial design by explaining an application. Given a file with different objects (representing tiles) and a <b>vectorial</b> <b>image</b> design of a ceramic tile mosaic border, the application recognises which tile in the file belongs to the border design and indicates its position and rotational angle to place the tile in the correct position of the border design. This qualitative method provides several advantages over traditional quantitative representations. The main advantages are the reduction of computational costs and the managing of uncertainty (two manufactured tiles are not geometrically identical, but they represent the same tile in the design) ...|$|E

This conversion system first extracts the different streams contained in PDF files (text, bitmap and <b>vectorial</b> <b>images)</b> and then applies different components in order to express in XML the logically structured documents. Some of these components are traditional in Document Analysis, other more specific to PDF. We also present a graphical user interface in order to check, correct and validate {{the analysis of the}} components.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to apply genuine hyperspectral math-ematical {{morphology}} to extract spatial structures according to their spectral nature. To achieve this objective, a novel ap-proach for vectorial ordering is introduced in this paper. The proposed ordering is based on a supervised framework which requires a reference spectrum for the image background and, at least, another reference spectrum for the image target. This supervised ordering may then used for the extension of math-ematical morphology to <b>vectorial</b> <b>images</b> and in particular, we focus here on the application of morphological processing to hyperspectral images, illustrating the performance with real examples...|$|R
40|$|A {{non-linear}} {{digital filter}} {{is presented in}} this paper: this filter aims at extending the concept of scalar rank-ordering {{in the case of}} multichannel images. The filter is based on two steps: 1) a transformation from a p-dimensional steps to a onedimensional space by means of a space filling curve; 2) a scalar median filtering step. Results which demonstrate the advantages and the good restoration computational performances of the filter are shown. 1. INTRODUCTION The nonlinear image processing techniques have known a more increasing development in last years, thanks to the availability of a large amount of data with such a characteristic. Noise filtering and enhancement of <b>vectorial</b> <b>images</b> and of multispectral remote-sensing data are example of applications where vectorial information must be processed. Moreover, the more sophisticated image processing methods are in many canes applicable only to the scalar case. In order to apply these techniques to the vectorial case the correlati [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Roussos and Maragos {{proposed}} {{a method for}} image interpolation in "Reversible interpolation of <b>vectorial</b> <b>images</b> by an anisotropic diffusion-projection PDE. " An earlier version was also published in conference paper (Roussos and Maragos, "Vector-Valued Image Interpolation by an Anisotropic Diffusion-Projection PDE," 2007). Given a discretely sampled image v, the method finds an image u such that v(n) = (h * u) (n), for all n in Z 2, where h is the (assumed known) point spread function and * denotes convolution. The method is inspired by tensor-driven diffusion works of Tschumperlé and Weickert. Roussos and Maragos propose interpolation by evolving a diffusion equation to steady state, dt u = P 0 (div(T gradient(u)), where T is a tensor determined from image structure tensor and the diffusion is orthogonally projected {{to agree with the}} observed data. This diffusion is based on the general anisotropic diffusion model proposed by Weickert. The method can be applied to grayscale, color, or general vector-valued images...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel variational segmentation algorithm designed to split an image in two regions {{based on their}} intensity distributions. A functional is proposed to integrate the unknown probability density functions of both regions within the optimization process. The method simultaneously performs segmentation and non-parametric density estimation. It does not make any assumption on the underlying distributions, hence it is flexible and {{can be applied to}} a wide range of applications. Although a boundary evolution scheme may be used to minimize the functional, we choose to consider an alternative formulation with a membership function. The latter has the advantage of being convex in each variable, so that the minimization is faster and less sensitive to initial conditions. Finally, to improve the accuracy and the robustness to low-frequency artifacts, we present an extension for the more general case of local space-varying probability densities. The approach readily extends to <b>vectorial</b> <b>images</b> and 3 D volumes, and we show several results on synthetic and photographic images, as well as on 3 D medical data. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceY. Meyer has {{recently}} introduced an image decomposition model to split an image into two components: a geometrical component and a texture (oscillatory) component. Inspired by his work, numerical {{models have been}} developed to carry out the decomposition of gray scale images. In this paper, we propose a decomposition algorithm for color images. We introduce a generalization of Meyer's G norm to RGB <b>vectorial</b> color <b>images,</b> and use Chromaticity and Brightness color model with total variation minimization. We illustrate our approach with numerical examples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recently total {{variation}} (TV) regularization {{has been}} proven very successful in image restoration and segmentation. In image restoration, TV based models offer a good edge preservation property. In image segmentation, TV (or vectorial TV) helps to obtain convex formulations of the problems and thus provides global minimizations. Due to these advantages, TV based models have been extended to image restoration and data segmen-tation on manifolds. However, TV based restoration and segmentation models are difficult to solve, due to the nonlinearity and non-differentiability of the TV term. Inspired {{by the success of}} operator splitting and the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) in 2 D planar image processing, we extend the method to TV and <b>vectorial</b> TV based <b>image</b> restoration and segmentation on triangulated surfaces, which are widely used in computer graphics and computer vision. In particular, we will focus on the following problems. First, several Hilbert spaces will be given to describe TV and vectorial TV based variational models in the discrete setting. Second, we present ALM applied to TV and <b>vectorial</b> TV <b>image</b> restoration on mesh surfaces, leading to efficient algorithms for both gray and color image restoration. Third, we discuss ALM for vectorial TV based multi-region image segmentation, which also works for both gray and color images. The proposed method benefits from fast solvers fo...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new mask imaging algorithm {{that is based on}} the source point integration method (or Abbe method). The method presented here distinguishes itself from existing methods by exploiting the through-focus imaging feature of the Extended Nijboer-Zernike (ENZ) theory of diffraction. An introduction to ENZ-theory and its application in general imaging is provided after which we describe the mask imaging scheme that can be derived from it. The remainder of the paper is devoted to illustrating the advantages of the new method over existing methods (Hopkins-based). To this extent several simulation results are included that illustrate advantages arising from: the accurate incorporation of isolated structures, the rigorous treatment of the object (mask topography) and the fully <b>vectorial</b> through-focus <b>image</b> formation of the ENZ-based algorithm. ?IST-Optics Research GroepApplied Science...|$|R

40|$|A {{phenotype}} recognition {{model was}} developed for high throughput screening (HTS) of engineered Nano-Materials (eNMs) toxicity using zebrafish embryo developmental response classified, from automatically captured images and without manual manipulation of zebrafish positioning, by three basic phenotypes (i. e., hatched, unhatched, and dead). The recognition model was built {{with a set of}} <b>vectorial</b> descriptors providing <b>image</b> color and texture information. The best performing model was attained with three image descriptors (color histogram, representative color, and color layout) identified as most suitable from an initial pool of six descriptors. This model had an average recognition accuracy of 97. 40 ± 0. 95 % in a 10 -fold cross-validation and 93. 75 % in a stress test of low quality zebrafish images. The present work has shown that a phenotyping model can be developed with accurate recognition ability suitable for zebrafish-based HTS assays. Although the present methodology was successfully demonstrated for only three basic zebrafish embryonic phenotypes, it can be readily adapted to incorporate more subtle phenotypes. © 2012 Liu et al...|$|R
