50|$|The {{sequential}} shunt unit (SSU) {{is designed}} to coarsely regulate the solar power collected during periods of insolation—when the arrays collect power during sun-pointing periods. A sequence of 82 separate strings, or power lines, leads from the solar array to the SSU. Shunting, or controlling, the output of each string regulates the amount of power transferred. The regulated <b>voltage</b> <b>setpoint</b> is controlled by a computer located on the IEA and is normally set to around 140 volts. The SSU has an overvoltage protection feature to maintain the output voltage below 200 V DC maximum for all operating conditions. This power is then passed through the BMRRM to the DCSU located in the IEA. The SSU measures 32” by 20” by 12” and weighs 185 pounds.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{designed}} a simple system to investigate empirically the image contrast of tapping-mode {{atomic force microscopy}} (TMAFM). We modified the cantilever tips with protein molecules (bovine serum albumin or goat anti-biotin antibody) and used these protein-modified cantilevers to scan poly-L-lysine films and antibody layers deposited on mica in air under ambient conditions. We also investigated the effects of manipulating the <b>setpoint</b> <b>voltage</b> in this system. It was found that extra topographic features with a patchlike appearance were introduced into the TMAFM images of both the poly-L-lysine and antibody films when scanned with the protein-modified tips, even at initial preset setpoints, and were superimposed on the topography of the samples. The surface coverage of the patchlike features in the TMAFM images changes significantly with the <b>setpoint</b> <b>voltage</b> in a reversible and nonlinear manner. These are believed to arise from the surface indentation of the sample or from the structural deformation of the proteins at the tip induced in TMAFM imaging. Interestingly, it was observed in the experiment that no structural alteration or damage was discernible on the sample surface, even after continuous scanning with the protein-modified tips {{for a long period}} of time, with varying <b>setpoint</b> <b>voltage.</b> This study provides experimental evidence that cantilever tips modified with protein molecules or, under certain circumstances, even unmodified tips introduce extra topographical features (i. e., artifacts) and enhance the image contrast of TMAFM imaging of soft materials, which is dependent on their mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|A {{complete}} laboratory breadboard {{version of}} a ion engine power converter was built and tested. This prototype operated on a line voltage of 80 - 120 Vdc, and provided output ratings of 1100 V at 1. 8 kW, and 250 V at 20 mA. The high-voltage (HV) output voltage rating was revised from the original value of 1350 V {{at the beginning of}} the project. The LV output was designed to hold up during a 1 -A surge current lasting up to 1 second. The prototype power converter included a internal housekeeping power supply which also operated from the line input. The power consumed in housekeeping was included in the overall energy budget presented for the ion engine converter. HV and LV output <b>voltage</b> <b>setpoints</b> were commanded through potentiometers. The HV converter itself reached its highest power efficiency of slightly over 93 % at low line and maximum output. This would dip below 90 % at high line. The no-load (rated output voltages, zero load current) power consumption of the entire system was less than 13 W. A careful loss breakdown shows that converter losses are predominately Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) conduction losses and HV rectifier snubbing losses, with the rectifier snubbing losses becoming predominant at high line. This suggests that further improvements in power efficiency could best be obtained by either developing a rectifier that was adequately protected against voltage overshoot with less snubbing, or by developing a pre-regulator to reduced the range of line voltage on the converter. The transient testing showed the converter to be fully protected against load faults, including a direct short-circuit from the HV output to the LV output terminals. Two currents sensors were used: one to directly detect any core ratcheting on the output transformer and re-initiate a soft start, and the other to directly detect a load fault and quickly shut down the converter for load protection. The finished converter has been extensively fault tested without failure. The finished converter has been packaged suitable for use as a laboratory prototype for further testing. The finished converter is readily transportable. An article on design issues for high voltage converters for ion engines is included as an attachement...|$|R

40|$|One {{increasingly}} popular approach to integrate distributed generation (DG) energy sources into an electrical grid system, is to assemble them into microgrids which then {{connect to the}} main utility grid at a single or multiple points of connection. A microgrid can also operate as a standalone islanded network which is physically disconnected from the grid. During island mode the generated power of each DG unit must be carefully controlled to ensure reliable power distribution and modular operation. Droop control is commonly used for this purpose, commanding individual voltage magnitude and frequency for each DG unit to achieve balanced active and reactive power sharing. A droop controller involves several stages of processing, particularly output power calculation and updating the <b>voltage</b> command <b>setpoint.</b> These stages contribute to a time delay defined in this paper as the droop response time (DR time), which can vary between multiple DG units because of different designs and controller implementations. This paper explores the effect of differences in droop controller response times {{on the ability of}} a microgrid to balance its commanded DG generations with its required load profile. It is shown that unequal droop response times can substantially degrade the power sharing dynamics and the modularity of the microgrid...|$|R

The system is capable of depositing at rates between < 0.001 nm/s and > 0.5 nm/s measured {{at a distance of}} 100 mm for Cu clusters. The deposition rate achieved depends on a number of parameters, which includes the material {{and the size of the}} clusters deposited. In our case, in the deposition we applied one bias voltage between the substrate (negative) and the chamber, and for this reason we only working with the positive ions. The size of the nanoparticles was controlled through the variation in (1) gas flow (Ar and He), (2) partial pressure, (3) magnetron power, and (4) zone condensation length. These parameters were varied to produce particles of different sizes onto Si substrates. The latter choice was taken for purposes of analysis in a SEM, Nova 200 Nanosem. The average size of the nanoparticles was monitored in situ from the synthesis conditions by a linear quadrupole to measure the mass distribution and to act as a mass filter.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this master thesis is to design a power plant controller for a photo- voltaic (PV) power plant. In a first stage, the current situation {{of the status of}} the electrical grid is analysed. The electrical network structure is moving from a conventional system (with centralized power generation, unidirectional power ows, easy control) to a smart grid system consisting on distributed generation, renewable energies, smart and complex control architecture and al- gorithms, bidirectional power ow, etc. Some of the issues regarding the integration of renewable power plants are identified. The increase of renewable penetration into the electrical system can produce instabilities in terms of voltage and frequency. So that, the operation of these power plants must have grid support functionalities. To design a power plant controller for providing PV plants with the capacity to give the required grid support, it is necessary to use a model of a PV power plant. So that, the modelling of the PV power plant is presented. This model contemplates the PV cell, the PV array, the power electronics (PV inverter) and the associated control, the grid layout as well as ancillary devices as FACTS, capacitor banks or energy storage. Once the power plant is modelled, a central controller is designed to coordinate all the PV plant devices in order to deliver the desired active and reactive power to the grid. The controller is capable to perform the following functions: active and reactive power <b>setpoints,</b> <b>voltage</b> and frequency droops, power factor control and ramp rate limitations. These actions are the required by most of the grid codes. The power plant controller is validated with the support of simulations. After that, it has been identified the active power ramp rate problem when the plant is not equipped with auxiliary generation: when the available active power decreases suddenly (for example due to the clouds passing over the PV plant), the ramp rate limitations of active power cannot be respected. So, the installation of an energy storage system has been studied. Considering the PV plant with energy storage system, two control strategies for limiting the active power ramp rate are analysed. After that, possible effects that communication delays can produce are studied and a little modification the controller is proposed in order to improve the PV plant operation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{behaviour}} {{of two different}} control structures of automatic voltage regulators of synchronous machines equipped with static excitation systems. These systems have a fully controlled thyristor bridge that supplies DC current to the rotor winding. The rectifier bridge is fed by the stator terminals through a step-down transformer. The first control structure, named ""Direct Control"", has a single proportional-integral (PI) regulator that compares stator <b>voltage</b> <b>setpoint</b> with measured voltage and acts directly on the thyristor bridge`s firing angle. This control structure is usually employed in commercial excitation systems for hydrogenerators. The second structure, named ""Cascade Control"", was inspired on control loops of commercial DC motor drives.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show the {{interaction}} of a composite of a periodic or aperiodic signal and intrinsic electrochemical noise with the nonlinear dynamics of an electrochemical cell configured to study the corrosion of iron in an acidic media. The anodic <b>voltage</b> <b>setpoint</b> (V- 0) in the cell is chosen such that the anodic current (I) exhibits excitable fixed point behavior {{in the absence of}} noise. The subthreshold periodic (aperiodic) signal consists of a train of rectangular pulses with a fixed amplitude and width, separated by regular (irregular) time intervals. The irregular time intervals chosen are of deterministic and stochastic origins. The amplitude of the intrinsic internal noise, regulated by the concentration of chloride ions, is then monotonically increased, and the provoked dynamics are analyzed. The signal to noise ratio and the cross-correlation coefficient versus the chloride ions' concentration curves have a unimodal shape indicating the emergence of an intrinsic periodic or aperiodic stochastic resonance. The abscissa for the maxima of these unimodal curves correspond to the optimum value of intrinsic noise where maximum regularity of the invoked dynamics is observed. In the particular case of the intrinsic periodic stochastic resonance, the scanning electron microscope images for the electrode metal surfaces are shown for certain values of chloride ions' concentrations. These images, qualitatively, corroborate the emergence of order {{as a result of the}} interaction between the nonlinear dynamics and the composite signal...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of {{voltage control}} methods for maximizing end-of-grid wind farm {{capacity}} uses the Kalbarri Wind Farm {{as a base}} study case. The weakness of end-of-grid feeders {{is that they have}} relatively high resistance and reactance, which lead to high real and reactive power losses and low power transfer capability. This thesis report provides summaries of the voltage control algorithms from the simplest to the most complex algorithm. The parameters of the Kalbarri Wind Farm elements are based on the documents provided by Verve Energy. This thesis investigates the voltage control algorithm including the use of a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) with the wind farm in order to stabilise the grid voltage. The voltage control algorithm study cases are based on the Kalbarri Network Model, and its system simulations are carried out by using DIgSILENT PowerFactory software. The first voltage control algorithm is a wind turbine with fixed power factor which is the simplest voltage control algorithm. The second voltage control algorithm is the wind turbine with fixed power factor combined with a STATCOM, with the STATCOM using the isochronous voltage control method. The STATCOM size required for this voltage control algorithm is so large that it makes the system uneconomic. In order to improve it, the third voltage control algorithm uses a ± 1 MVAr STATCOM. At the same time, an upstream voltage regulator controls the STATCOM within a ± 0. 8 MVAr range. The upstream voltage regulator does the remote control, since there is communications between the upstream regulator and the STATCOM. The fourth voltage control algorithm is built on the third algorithm with the STATCOM using the droop voltage control method. The upstream regulator indirectly controls the Point of Connection (PoC) voltage by using the Line Drop Compensation (LDC) to keep STATCOM within a ± 0. 8 MVAr Range. In the fourth voltage control algorithm, the LDC is used {{to take the place of}} the communications in the third algorithm. The ‘WindFREE’ wind turbine option is also considered in this thesis report, which means the wind turbine is equipped with the feature of providing reactive power under the ‘no wind’ conditions. The dynamic voltage control algorithm with the STATCOM using a variable <b>voltage</b> <b>setpoint,</b> as used in Kalbarri is evaluated. Future works that could be a continuation of this topic are proposed and the thesis report includes a summary of case studies...|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{generation}} (DG), i. e. generation {{connected to}} the low and medium voltage distribution network (DN), has been increasing a lot during recent years. Thus the traditional assumption of a unidirectional power flow and a voltage decrease along the distribution feeders is no longer valid in all operation conditions. Voltage control in these networks is often limited to the on-load tap changer at the high voltage/medium voltage substation. Thus keeping the voltage at the customer connection point, which is an important quality criterion for electricity supply, within the limits may become a challenge. Since most of the available voltage band is assigned to the voltage decrease caused by the load, {{only a small part}} is available for a voltage rise from DG power injection. To overcome this limitation, traditionally the network has to be reinforced, which is always a solution but quite expensive. Coordinated voltage control is introduced as an alternative to avoid or postpone network reinforcement. The proposed algorithm receives actual voltage measurements from electricity meters at the customer connection points. The <b>voltage</b> <b>setpoint</b> at the substation and the reactive and active power output of the DG units are then adjusted to keep the voltage within the limits. Thereby the voltage band is used more efficiently and as a last option, the active power output from the DG units may temporarily be limited and some energy spilled. The voltage control scheme has been verified by power flow simulations of an existing DN in Sweden using real time series for consumption, photovoltaics and wind generation. It turned out that the need for active power curtailment is low even for large DG penetration if applying coordinated voltage control. Next, a passive DN has been turned into an active DN by introducing coordinated voltage control in a field test. The main objective has been to test the effect of asynchronous measurements from electricity meters and DG units and the impact from the communication. Control with asynchronous measurement turned out to be possible and curtailment has been reduced considerably. As coordinated voltage control uses active power curtailment as a last option to keep the voltage within the limits, it is, especially for the DG developer, important to estimate, to what extent curtailment will be utilised. Based on this data DG developers have to decide, if they would prefer a more expensive connection, which is able to always transfer the maximum DG output, i. e. a firm connection, or if they prefer to accept some temporary restrictions, if it is at a lower cost and faster available. Power flow simulations could be used to determine the expected curtailment. They are exact but they require a lot of input data and are time consuming, especially for calculations over large time series. Therefore a 5 -Step-Method, which is fast, simple-to-apply and needs only a reduced set of input data, has been developed. The 5 -Step-Method can be applied to calculate the expected curtailment for a DG unit with a predefined nominal output at a given location. However, the method could also be applied to determine the maximum nominal DG output at a given location, if a predefined amount of curtailment can be accepted. To verify the 5 -Step-Method, it is applied on DG connections in a generic test system. The obtained results are quite close to the ones from power flow calculations for the considered scenarios. The results for the expected curtailment calculated by the 5 -Step-Method are however not conservative compared to power flow calculations, i. e. showing a larger amount of curtailment, for all scenarios. Finally the necessary steps for implementing coordinated voltage control and non firm DG connections are summarized both for distribution network operators and DG developers...|$|E
