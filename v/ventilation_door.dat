5000|$|Falls {{of ground}} {{dominated}} the causes at 72, machinery, transportation and mining accidents caused 70 {{and the remainder}} were classed as general. [...] Of the falls of ground, approximately two thirds were on the deep gold mines, {{a reflection of the}} extreme pressure at depth and continual movement of the country rock. Amongst the machinery, mining and transportation fatalities were working on grizzlies without safety belts, working below loose rock in ore passes, getting crushed by that deadly combination of a loco and a <b>ventilation</b> <b>door</b> frame (the clearance between the two is only a few inches) and working on running conveyors, all direct contraventions of safety instructions. Drilling into misfires was also mentioned, a clear example of sloppy and unsafe mining.|$|E
50|$|The Lackawanna Coal Mine is {{a museum}} and retired coal mine located in McDade Park in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Visitors board a mine car and descend the #190 slope into the Clark Vein of coal. At {{the foot of}} the shaft the {{visitors}} begin an hour-long guided tour through the main gangway of the mine and stop at various points to discuss different aspects of the anthracite mining industry. Visitors then leave the Clark Vein via a rock tunnel and stop in the Dunmore #1 Vein. Once in the Dunmore #1, transportation and mining in a fault room are discussed. As the tour continues down the rock tunnel the group stops at the peg shanty to meet the fire boss and discuss his role in mining operations. The tour then continues on to the Dunmore #2 Vein and discusses working in small veins of coal, air doors and their role in <b>ventilation,</b> <b>door</b> boys or nippers, second means of exit from the mine and company store. The tour concludes where the miners ended their final days within the mine in November 1966.|$|E
50|$|On May 12, 1942, a {{locomotive}} cable short-circuited {{at the same}} time as a malfunction with one of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>doors,</b> and it caused a methane explosion and collapsing roofs. Fifty-six men total were killed in the blast.|$|R
50|$|Boys in the Pits: Child Labour in Coal Mines is a 2000 book by Robert McIntosh, {{published}} by McGill-Queen’s University Press. The {{book is about}} child labour in Canada in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with special reference {{to the history of}} boys, aged 8 to 15, who worked in coal mines. These boys worked underground, leading horses along subterranean roads, manipulating <b>ventilation</b> <b>doors,</b> helping miners cut and lift tons of coal, and filling wagons with freshly mined coal. Robert McIntosh is an employee at the National Archives of Canada.|$|R

5000|$|Work to sink Elsecar Low Colliery started around 1840 {{but took}} 6-8 years to {{complete}} and the first significant coal was mined in 1848 when 1000 tonnes a day was being extracted (4). [...] The major difficulty was the penetration of water into the workings and dealing with large amounts of firedamp. [...] The colliery had two shafts, a winding shaft and a smaller diameter pumping shaft for draining the colliery. The colliery suffered a significant accident on 21 December 1852 when a firedamp explosion killed 10 miners and injured 12. The inquiry found that the explosion had been caused by reckless behaviour of the colliers; a <b>ventilation</b> <b>door</b> had been propped open which resulted in firedamp accumulating and some colliers using unguarded safety lamps. Earl Fitzwilliam's mine superintendent, Benjamin Biram was criticised by the inquiry for absence of printed rules in the colliery, inadequate maintenance of lamps and poor supervision of the workforce but the judge praised the ventilation arrangements in the pit which prevented extensive loss of life.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Turnout Drift Operating Envelope Calculation is to {{identify}} the design parameters of the typical turnout drift and advance the preliminary design of the typical turnout drift. The scope of this calculation requires the turnout drift geometry be identified in sufficient detail to provide input to develop a typical turnout drift design. This turnout drift design strategy {{will be used to}} develop a preliminary turnout drift design for each distinct grouping of turnout drift type. The calculation will define the operating envelope of the relevant interfaces such as the turnout drift invert and the <b>ventilation</b> <b>door.</b> This information will be used to describe the space allocation of the turnout drift components and operating equipment. The turnout drift is an elemental component of the subsurface repository design layout. Other elemental components are the emplacement drift, the access mains, the exhaust mains, and ventilation shafts. This calculation will describe the fundamental dimensions and geometry of a turnout drift and will serve as a basis for subsequent detailed design...|$|E
5000|$|On 4 July 1838, a {{flash flood}} at the Huskar Pit near Silkstone in Yorkshire caused {{the deaths of}} 26 {{children}} aged from seven to 17 who were drowned while trying to escape. The disaster led to a public outcry and subsequent Royal Commission led by Anthony Ashley Cooper. Until the Mines and Collieries Act 1842 was passed prohibiting boys under ten {{years of age and}} all women and girls from working underground in coal mines, it was common for women and children to work shifts of 11 or 12 hours underground. Children as young as five or six worked as trappers opening and closing <b>ventilation</b> <b>doors</b> before becoming hurriers, pushing tubs of coal to the shaft bottom.|$|R
50|$|A storm door {{is a type}} of {{door that}} is {{installed}} in front of an exterior access door to protect it from bad weather and allow <b>ventilation.</b> Storm <b>doors</b> generally have interchangeable glass panels and window screen panels to provide visibility and prevent flying insects from entering the home.|$|R

5000|$|Lord Ashley {{headed the}} royal {{commission}} of inquiry which investigated the conditions of workers especially children in the coal mines in 1840. Commissioners visited collieries and mining communities gathering information sometimes against the mine owners' wishes. The report, illustrated by engraved illustrations and the personal accounts of mineworkers was published in May 1842. Victorian society was shocked to discover that children, as young as five or six worked as trappers, opening and shutting <b>ventilation</b> <b>doors</b> down the mine before becoming hurriers, pushing & pulling coal tubs and corfs. Lord Ashley deliberately appealed to Victorian prudery, focussing on girls and women wearing trousers and working bare breasted {{in the presence of}} boys and men which [...] "made girls unsuitable for marriage and unfit to be mothers". Such an affront to Victorian morality ensured the bill was passed.|$|R
5|$|David Watts Morgan {{was born}} in Skewen, Wales, in 1867 to Thomas and Margaret Morgan. He was educated at Skewen Elementary School {{until the age of}} eleven, when he began work as a pit boy, helping miners with the less strenuous work such as manning <b>ventilation</b> <b>doors.</b> At the age of {{seventeen}} he was employed as a coal miner in Ynyshir in the Rhondda. In 1880 Watts Morgan became a checkweighman at the newly opened National Colliery in Wattstown, a responsible position that involved tallying the weight of coal extracted by each miner when it reached the surface. During his time at Wattstown he took evening classes to become a mining engineer. He never practised once qualified, but the knowledge he gained was useful to him in his role as the leader of several mine rescues, and gave him a practical knowledge that informed his later political life.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{experiments on}} the use of lightweight concrete in the density range of 100 Ib/ft 3 for liners in underground mines. Three test sections were completed: a monolithic, portal-type structure with integral walls and arch constructed aboveground; an underground test section constructed in a mine drift using plywood forms; and a second section constructed in a drift using an air-supported formwork. The lightweight concrete in the two underground test sections was placed using piston pumps and a slickline. Fiber reinforcement was added to the concrete in the mine sections without any apparent problems with either pumping or placement of the concrete. In another experiment, the Bureau and Hecla Mining Co., Mullan, rD, used lightweight concrete in the density range of 25 Iblfe to replace timber blocking in a raise preparation structure. Other experiments are described in which low-density, lightweight concrete blocks were produced for mine <b>ventilation</b> <b>doors,</b> stoppings, and barricades. Other mine uses reviewed include pillars and collapsing beams. An advantage of low-density concrete is that it will display up to 50 % deformation at a constant yield stress. These hlllovative concepts in deformable concrete lining systems will aid mine operators by decreasing capital and maintenance costs, increasing the available space in underground haulageways, and providing productivity gains and improved resource recovery in the soft, caving, squeezing, or bursting grollnu conditions often found in deep mines...|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} was erected {{as a small}} cottage type hospital that incorporated the pavilion plan ward with other facilities including an office, surgery, dispensary and a store within the one main building. At its inception the hospital comprised a brick building with a shingle roof with its main section housing a ward that accommodated six beds. To promote cross <b>ventilation,</b> French <b>doors</b> were located along {{the northern and southern}} sides of the main ward, with a verandah encircling three sides of the ward. Each of the beds was positioned between each set of French doors to ensure that the patients were afforded adequate ventilation.|$|R
50|$|By August 1953 head {{engineer}} Picard had an almond-green prototype {{delivered to}} Madrid for dry condition testing, ultimately experiencing only five flat tires and a generator failure after 2200 km. Subsequently, Lefaucheux ordered engineers {{to test a}} Dauphine prototype directly against a Volkswagen Beetle. The engineers determined that noise levels were too high, interior <b>ventilation</b> and <b>door</b> sealing were inadequate and most importantly, the engine capacity was insufficient at only four CV (748 cc). The four-cylinder engine was redesigned to increase its capacity to 845 cc by increasing the bore to 58 mm, giving the car a new informal designation, the 5CV. By 1954 a second series of prototypes incorporated updates, using the older prototypes for crash testing.|$|R
50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 19th century demand for coal {{increased}} rapidly for domestic and industrial consumption as steam was used to power factories and steam ships. It was won in what were intolerable conditions. Coal was got by hand, hewers using picks and shovels in mines lit by candles. Children as young as five years of age sat in complete darkness opening <b>ventilation</b> <b>doors</b> for hurriers, women and boys who hauled tubs of coal to the shaft bottom. Some coalowners used bonds, paying signing-on fees to the colliers who worked in their coal pits for a year or had to pay a considerable forfeit if the contract was broken. The coalowners used the bond system as a tool for enforcing discipline and fending off the ability of workers to join together to fight for better pay and conditions. The Combination Acts of 1799 made unions illegal. Some coal owners, including William Hulton, paid their workers with tokens or vouchers that could only be redeemed in their company shops, a practice outlawed by the passing of the Truck Act 1831. Wages were poor and coal owners introduced a system of fines to enforce discipline. The Duke of Bridgewater paid eight shillings (40p) for a six-day working week with shifts of 12 to 15 hours and fined those who were late half a crown. The wages amounted to a few pence more than given in Poor Law relief and miners worked to keep out of the workhouse. William Hulton reputedly paid the poorest wages in Lancashire and was hostile to permitting his workforce the right to free assembly.|$|R

40|$|A {{method to}} bridge the gap between {{research}} and practice, as far as estimation of the building envelope Heat Loss Coefficient is concerned, is to perform measurement of indoor temperature profiles during unoccupied periods when the solar heat gains are sufficient to reach significant indoor-outdoor temperature differences. An observation of indoor temperature profiles was conducted during summer 2014 in a passive house located in Belgium. The observation includes periods with and without occupancy. Occupants were asked to describe their behavior regarding windows opening, closing of external blinds, opening of internal doors. Electric devices were listed and the electricity consumption profile was characterized during occupancy and no occupancy. A calibration process is performed in order to reproduce the global heat balance of the whole building and the zone by zone heat balance. The calibrated model provides an estimation of the Building Heat Loss Coefficient.

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: Quality of life (QoL) {{for elderly}} {{residents}} {{of care and}} attention (C&A) homes has become an important consideration given the increasingly aging population. Due {{to the number of}} hours such residents spend indoors, the quality of the facilities can contribute to their day to day QoL. This study investigates the effect of facilities management (FM) on the QoL of Chinese elderly people living in C&A homes. Design/Methodology/Approach: A survey of perceived satisfaction with the components of FM and QoL was carried out with a sample of residents. A total of 18 FM components and five QoL domains, including physical health, independence, psychological health, social relationships and living environment, as well as overall QoL were identified. Findings: The findings show that; (1) physical health is influenced by accessibility, doors and windows and signage; (2) independence can be improved by enhancing accessibility, water supply, lighting and ventilation; (3) accessibility, water supply, distance and doors and windows all predict psychological health; (4) social relationships are improved by lighting and ventilation; (5) distance impacts positively on living environment and (6) overall QoL is predicted by lighting, <b>ventilation,</b> accessibility, <b>doors</b> and windows, handrails, recreation and signage. Originality/Value: The study recommends that designers and facilities managers review the micro-climate settings to harness available natural lighting and ventilation, introduce bimetallic strips to the heating systems to maintain a suitable water temperature and install large, easy to understand and graphic signage for straightforward wayfinding in C&A homes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The need {{to reduce}} carbon {{emissions}} and fuel poverty has led to increased building envelope air tightness, intended to reduce uncontrolled ventilation heat losses. Ventilation strategies in dwellings still allow the use of trickle ventilators in window frames for background ventilation. The extent to which this results in “healthy ” Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in recently constructed dwellings was a concern of regulators in Scotland. This paper describes research to explore this. First a review of literature was conducted, then data on occupant interactions with <b>ventilation</b> provisions (windows, <b>doors,</b> trickle vents) gathered through an interview-based survey of 200 recently constructed dwellings, and measurements made on a sample of 40 of these. The main measured parameter discussed here is CO 2 concentration. It was concluded after the literature review that 1000 ppm absolute was a reasonable threshold to use for “adequate ” ventilation. The occupant survey {{found that there was}} very little occupant interaction with the trickle ventilators e. g., in bedrooms 63 % were always closed, 28 % always open, and in only 9 % of case...|$|R
