50|$|An Open General Licence (OGL) {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> {{issued by}} a {{government}} to its domestic suppliers. In most countries, they are the licences with minimal restrictions. This is to be contrasted with other licences such as the Open General Trade Control Licence in the UK which put restrictions on the amount or type of goods or services being exported.|$|R

50|$|Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council {{extended}} the Oil-for-Food Programme for 180 days beginning at 00:01 EST on 1 December 2001.

It also {{stressed the need for}} Iraq to co-operate with previous Security Council resolutions and the need for a comprehensive settlement {{on the basis of the}} resolutions. The resolution also appealed for all countries to co-operate in the submission of applications and issue <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>licences</b> so that humanitarian aid could reach the Iraqi population as soon as possible.|$|R
50|$|The resolution, {{drafted by}} France and the United Kingdom, called upon all states to {{continue}} to co-operate in the prompt submission of applications and issue <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>licences</b> which would facilitate the transit of humanitarian supplies. It also appealed to countries to take all appropriate measures to ensure that humanitarian supplies reached the Iraqi people as soon as possible. An attempt by China and Russia to write into the resolution language that would have identified the United Nations sanctions as the sole cause {{of the situation in}} Iraq was defeated as Council members were informed that Iraq had made US$8.6 billion profit from oil sales in the previous six months.|$|R
50|$|Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council {{adjusted}} the Goods Review List {{and procedures for}} its implementation.

It would conduct a review of the measures within 90 days and {{before the end of the}} current extension of the Oil-for-Food Programme, while the Committee established in Resolution 661 was also requested to conduct reviews. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was instructed to develop consumption rates and use levels for chemicals and medications specified in the annexes of the resolution within 60 days. Finally, the resolution appealed to all states to co-operate in the timely submission of technically complete applications and the issuing <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>licences.</b>|$|R

Of the seven compliance activities we identified, three differ for licensed exports compared with country-based license exemptions.

With the sculpture on temporary display in its Great Court, the delay on the export allowed the British Museum enough time to raise the remaining £662,297 through a public appeal, and thus to acquire it permanently.

The report highlighted {{the fact that the}} illicit arrangements were being concluded on the very day when a ban on hardwood timber exports from Sierra Leone was to take effect, and Vice President Sumana is seen, in the video footage, assuring the journalists that implementation of the ban was being [...] "delayed". Sumana later reportedly admitted to Al Jazeera that Mansaray and Konte were well known to him, but that he knew nothing about their collection of cash on his behalf. Sierra Leone's cabinet was reported to be meeting in special session about the Al Jazeera sting operation.|$|R

The British government refused a permanent <b>export</b> <b>licence,</b> but a temporary <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> was granted in 2005 for 6½ years, and the painting went on display at the National Gallery of Ireland.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to provide better insight into the {{internationalization}} process of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Using a five-year panel dataset and a relatively new technique, DEL analysis, the predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>export</b> stage concept <b>of</b> Cavusgil's innovation-related internationalization model (the I-model) is examined This stage theory conceptualizes the internationalization process using five stages: a domestic marketing stage, a pre-export stage, an experimental involvement stage, an active involvement stage, and a committed involvement stage. In addition, the time period to be considered in moving from one stage to another is explicitly tested. The results suggest within certain limits that Cavusgil's stage theory holds for European manufacturing SMEs. According to the considered time frame, the results are slightly in favor of a two year-period...|$|R

In 1205 he was again one of the keepers of the royal fleet along the south coast. William was in charge of the 17 ships based in Romney, Rye, Shoreham, Southampton, Winchelsea, and Exeter, while the rest of the fleet came under Cornhill's control. In the same year, he was also in charge of naval spending for the attempted invasion of France, which in June alone totalled over 470 pounds. [...] William surrendered custody of Taunton Castle to Peter de Taraton in July and was in charge of purchasing the royal wine in August. No further naval duties are recorded until November, when along with Cornhill he was responsible for assessing the ports.|$|R

40|$|We argue that, {{under certain}} {{conditions}} described by a sunk cost hysteresis model, firms consider exports {{as a substitute for}} domestic demand. This is valid also on the macroeconomic level where the switch from the domestic market to the export market and vice versa takes place in a smooth manner. Areas of weak reaction <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> to changes in domestic demand are widened by uncertainty. Our econometric model for six euro area countries suggests domestic demand and capacity constraints as additional variables for export equations. We apply the exponential and logistic variant of a smooth transition regression model and find that domestic demand developments and uncertainty are relevant for short-run export dynamics particularly during more extreme stages of the business cycle. A substitutive relationship between domestic and foreign sales can most clearly be found for France, Greece and Ireland (ESTR model) and France, Portugal and Italy (LSTAR model), providing evidence of the importance of sunk costs and hysteresis in international trade in these EMU member countries. What is more, our empirical results are robust to the inclusion of a variable measuring European policy uncertainty. In some cases (Italy, Greece and Portugal) the results underscore the empirical <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>export</b> hysteresis under uncertainty model...|$|R
