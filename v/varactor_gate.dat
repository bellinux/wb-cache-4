40|$|Varactor (variable reactor) {{is a key}} {{component}} extensively used in various microwave applications including voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). Ordinary CMOS varactors make use of pn junction diode that suffers from low quality factor (Q factor) and limited tuning range which are not desirable for high spectral purity and wide frequency tuning range VCO. The design of a <b>gated</b> <b>varactor</b> on thin-film SO 1 technology offers an experimentally highest Q factor of 14 which made a {{two to three times}} improvement to that of the conventional varactors. The fabrication of the SO 1 <b>gated</b> <b>varactor</b> requires no special treatment to available SOI fabrication process. In this thesis, the capacitance-voltage characteristic on the giga-hertz range was investigated. Moreover, the effects of the gate length and gate bias to the performance of the <b>gated</b> <b>varactors</b> were studied. A proposed SOI <b>gated</b> <b>varactor</b> fabrication process flow was introduced. A similar varactor structure was also fabricated on 0. 35 μm bulk CMOS technology which demonstrated a maximum Q factor of 22 at 2 GHz operating frequency. To analyse the performance of this <b>gated</b> <b>varactor</b> on circuit application, an LC-tank VCO with two control terminals operated at 2 GHz using 0. 35 μm bulk CMOS technology was fabricated. The VCO achieved a SSB phase noise of - 87 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset from the carrier frequency and a wide tuning range of over 300 MHz...|$|R

40|$|Abstract— 0. 13 - m radio {{frequency}} (RF) CMOS devices with multifinger gate structure have been fabricated {{by the standard}} logic process, and the measured effective gate-length is 80 nm. Ex-tensive RF characterization {{has been done to}} obtain cutoff fre-quency (), associated power gain cutoff frequency (max), min-imum noise figure (min), output power (out), and power added efficiency (PAE) for RF circuit design and to explore the op-timized gate layout in terms of the extracted RF device parame-ters. Our important finding to be reported in this paper is that an optimized unit finger width () exists by trade-off among, max min out, and PAE. Under fixed total width to achieve the same current drivability (), the smaller and the larger finger number () leads to higher max but lower due to trade-off between gate resistance () and parasitic gate capaci-tance. As for min complicated by and, counter-balance between parasitic gate capacitance and leads to nearly constant min w. r. t. various splits of (). Regarding out and PAE, of 4 m and of 18 is the optimized layout param-eter, which offers the maximum out of around 11 dBm and PAE of 30. 5 % at 5. 8 GHz. The performances of accumulation-mode MOS <b>varactors</b> with different <b>gate</b> layout structures are also investigated in this report. Since the same area <b>varactors</b> with different <b>gate</b> layout may result in different parasitic resistance and fringing ca-pacitance, which will affect the capacitance tuning range and the associated-factor.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{thin-film}} SOI <b>gated</b> <b>varactor</b> {{based on a}} gated pin diode structure achieves a nominal capacitance of 7 pF with a sensitivity of 5 pF/V through the anode-cathode voltage. A third terminal (Gate) provides an additional tuning flexibility and offers a 1 pF/V sensitivity. S-parameter measurement reveals a Q of 14. The process is done without any modification to an industrial SOI CMOS process. The nominal capacitance can be varied with different gate bias. The cross-section of a possible P-type structure of the thin-film SOI <b>gated</b> <b>varactor</b> is shown in Fig. 1, which is originated from a PMOSFET {{with one of the}} P + region replaced by N + region. The thin film thickness t si of the varactor is 0. 1 m, T ox = 0. 37 m and t ox = 105. The total effective capacitance emanates from the P + /N junction capacitance C PN and the MOS gate capacitance C g (See Fig. 2), that is, C eff = C PN //C g, which decreases with increment of the reverse bias V d. The channel length is 0. 9 m and the total channel width is 3000 m for several pico-farads of the capacitance. To achieve maximum area efficiency, a multi-finger gate is adopted in this paper, which fits in a compact area of less than 20 m by 300 m. In addition to the structure shown in Fig. 1, we have also fabricated devices of Ntype and devices with a shorter channel length of 0. 75 m for both types. The variation of the depletion region shown in Fig. 2 visualizes the trend of the change of capacitance with reversed bias (V d). The boundaries of depletion region act as two "plates" of a capacitor with one "plate" closer to the P + side and the gate (fixed), and the other "plate" closer to the N + side (varies with V d). As V d increases, the depletion region extends towards the N + side so as to increase the effect [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose new {{oscillator}} architecture (VCO 2) and we compare it with a simple oscillator (VCO 1). We describe the design {{and implementation of the}} differential LC-VCO for wireless applications. In this work we develop an analytical framework for determining the best VCO for a high-frequency synthesizer design based on the constraints of the application. We show methods for reducing the phase noise in LC-VCO. We describe the optimization of phase noise performance. We examine the effect of the choice of MOS varactor on the performance of a CMOS negative resistance oscillator. The three most common MOS varactor structures (inversion, accumulation, and <b>gated</b> <b>varactor)</b> are well studied. The design of both VCOs was implemented in a standard 0. 35 μm CMOS process. The VCO 2 is utilized in this study because of its low phase noise.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} a portable digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) by using two-input NOR gates as a digitally controlled varactor (DCV) in fine-tuning delay cell design. This novel <b>varactor</b> uses the <b>gate</b> capacitance difference of NOR gates under different digital control inputs {{to establish a}} DCV. Thus proposed DCO can improve delay resolution 256 times better than a single buffer design. This study also examines different types of NOR/NAND gates (2 -input or 3 -input) for DCV. The proposed DCO with novel DCV can be implemented with standard cells, and thus it can be ported to different processes in short time. Furthermore, the final circuit layout can be generated using an auto placement and routing (APR) tools. A test chip demonstrates that LSB resolution of the DCO can be improved to 1. 55 ps with standard 0. 35 - m 2 P 4 M CMOS digital cell library. The proposed DCO has good performance in terms of fine resolution, high portability, and short design turnaround cycle compared with conventional DCO designs.

40|$|Abstract—The {{influence}} of the gate doping type of the MOS var-actor on frequency tuning, phase noise, and frequency sensitivity to supply-voltage variations of a fully integrated inductance-capac-itance voltage-controlled oscillator (LC-VCO) is presented. Three varactors in multifinger layout with shallow trench isolation (STI) are compared. The polysilicon gate is either entirely n- or p-doped or the fingers have alternating n and p doping. Differences in ca-pacitance and quality factor are shown. Two identical VCOs with the <b>varactors</b> having n <b>gates</b> or np gates are realized. Homogenous doping increases the VCO tuning range to 1. 31 GHz (20 %) in comparison to 1. 06 GHz (15 %) obtained by mixed doping. How-ever, mixed doping has the advantages of more linear VCO fre-quency tuning, lower close-in phase noise, and reduced maximum sensitivity to variations in supply voltage. Several varactor param-eters are introduced. They allow prediction of the {{influence of}} var-actors on the performance of a given VCO. With a current con-sumption of only 1 mA from a supply voltage of 1. 5 V, both VCOs show a phase noise of 115 dBc/Hz at 1 -MHz offset from a 4 -GHz carrier and a VCO figure of merit of 185. 3 dBc/Hz.
