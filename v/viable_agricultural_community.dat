40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{instrumented}} historical climatological data, historical ephemera (e. g. letters, newspapers, literature) can provide valuable, yet unstructured and fragmentary, information on the extreme events of the past. They can also show us how societies perceived and adapted to their environmental settings. As we look towards a future of uncertain climatic conditions, possibly characterised by more frequent extreme events, such sources may inform strategies of adaptation. The Welsh colony in Patagonia, Argentina was founded in 1865. Colonists were used to Wales?s temperate climate, ample rainfall and small rivers and so the first decades were marked by unexpected adaptation to an alien environment of climatic extremes (droughts and floods). Creation of river diversions and irrigation resulted {{in the development of}} a <b>viable</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>community</b> and represented successful, rapid adaptation. Due to strong cultural links between Patagonia and Wales, the colonial settlement history is well known. The emergent society?s perception of floods and droughts and their new alien landscape is less well examined, however. Archival research of letters, autobiographies and creative writing by Welsh Patagonians allows us to analyse historical perceptions of the extent, impact and management of climatic extremes as well as to extend the record of hydrological extremes beyond the instrumented record. Preliminary results presented in this paper show that the first settlers perceived the new landscape in the context of the environment of Wales with which they were more familiar (e. g. ?similar to that which I have seen in Wales?) and with Welsh mythology (e. g. the flooding of Cantre?r Gwaelod). The binary nature of human-river relationships is clearly evident: flooding was particularly prevalent in the crucial early years immediately following colonisation and at the turn of the twentieth century but the harnessing of the river for irrigation allowed the establishment of a flourishing agricultural community.

40|$|Social {{pressures}} to regulate agriculture's use of environmental resources have been building {{for many years}} and show no signs of abating. While the <b>agricultural</b> and environmental <b>communities</b> can react to these events in many ways, perhaps the most promising avenue for resolving joint agricultural and environmental disputes lies with negotiated regulations mediated by governmental agencies. When first conceived by Commons, negotiated regulation was seen as a way to achieve both efficient and equitable dispute resolution by directly using the preferences, skills, and operational knowledge of stakeholders. This approach should be attractive to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>community</b> because it provides an opportunity to educate environmental groups about the complexities facing modern agriculture. It also assures that private business interests are considered in the development of regulations, and should result in regulations that give dynamic flexibility to the way environmental standards are achieved. In today's litigious society, negotiated regulations may also reduce many transaction costs associated with agricultural and environmental issues, particularly those associated with contract development and enforcement. Ultimately, negotiated regulations may be the best hope for satisfying the dual social objectives of a clean environment and an economically <b>viable</b> <b>agricultural</b> sector. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{consequences}} of implementing a local policy regime that potentially enables a <b>viable</b> <b>agricultural</b> sector to operate within environmental limits. The Lake Taupo Nitrogen Trading Programme is an exemplar cap and trade regime located in New Zealand. It is the only cap and trade programme, to date, in which a limit on non-point source nitrogen discharges is applied at both the watershed and the farm levels. This study uses a landscape approach to assess {{the effects of this}} cap and trade implementation in order to achieve a rich understanding of the changes in land-use and farm practices that have occurred, the driving forces involved, and the five landscape paths that have evolved. The study finds that the cap and trade regime is insufficient on its own to achieve a <b>viable</b> <b>agricultural</b> sector in the regulated area. Investigation at different landscape scales, for instance, showed that factors such as the lack of low-nitrogen mitigations and land-uses, the gatekeeping role of the OVERSEER® programme and the perceived effect of nitrogen sales on land values discouraged on-farm innovation and nitrogen trading. These and other drivers have led some landowners to make adjustments that may not have been expected under a cap and trade regime, and some of these potentially make a negative contribution to developing a <b>viable</b> <b>agricultural</b> sector. The latter include: semi-retirement, investment outside of farming, reductions in productive capacity without apparent reinvestment, and relocation of part of the farm outside of the regulated area. Adjustments that may make a positive contribution include: secondary processing on farm, farm amalgamations, and investment in higher value land-uses (dairying, dairy support and carbon forests). Some farmers that have opted for business as usual were reluctant to sell nitrogen because of the potential negative effect on land values and the ability to sell, and so further significant land-use change as a result of trading nitrogen currently appears unlikely. Overall, land-use change that may make a negative contribution to a <b>viable</b> <b>agricultural</b> sector occurred on 42 % of the land in the study area while changes that may contribute positively to a <b>viable</b> <b>agricultural</b> sector occurred on 32 % of the land. Business as usual is estimated to have occurred on 25 % of the study area. As a consequence, it currently appears that the future landscape trajectory for pastoral land in the Catchment is one of reduced production. Thus, complementary research and technology policies, and the capacity to find new ways of making a living from rural land, are essential additions to a cap and trade regime in order for a <b>viable</b> <b>agricultural</b> sector to operate under environmental limits...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} one of a series {{resulting}} from institutional analysis of photovoltaic (PV) acceptance. It reports the results of a study of institutional factors influencing acceptance of center-pivot irrigation in the Nebraska <b>agricultural</b> <b>community.</b> Center-pivot irrigation (CP) was an interesting topic for study because (1) it was a major recently introduced technological innovation in agriculture which (2) had potentially detrimental attributes [...] water and energy intensity. A brief historical review of the introduction and acceptance of center-pivot irrigation in the Nebraska <b>agricultural</b> <b>community</b> is presented. Institutions which were a likely part of this institutional arena relative to CP introduction and acceptance were identified. Their likely responses were hypothesized, then data collected regarding actual response. Three broad conslusions are drawn. First, there were definite, even controlling institutional influences in the acceptance of CP in the Nebraska <b>agricultural</b> <b>community.</b> Second, acceptance was facilitated in the Nebraska <b>agricultural</b> <b>community</b> because the innovation differentiation process yielded secondary attributes of CP that met prevailing social orders [...] productivity, automation, and felt need. Third, the innovation differentiation process for CP in the Nebraska <b>agricultural</b> <b>community</b> yielded both transformation and disconnection of detrimental attributes, creating the circumstances for attribute redefinition in the first instance and another innovation in the second instance.
