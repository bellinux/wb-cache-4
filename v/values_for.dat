In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles {{is that it is}} mathematically impossible to obtain precise <b>values</b> <b>for</b> both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable <b>values</b> <b>for</b> momentum, and vice versa.|$|E

Important changes {{have been made in the}} UK to the appraisal stage of the procurement process, raising the likelihood of PFI being chosen when it is most likely to deliver <b>value</b> <b>for</b> money. While PFI has evidently performed well in the construction phase, the UK experience suggests a number of prerequisites <b>for</b> achieving <b>value</b> <b>for</b> money in the operational phase. Good contract management is needed to ensure that the risk transfer paid for actually sticks.

40|$|Public private {{partnerships}} (PPPs) are procurement models used in {{the provision}} of public infrastructures and involving private, as opposed to public, finance. The PPP model differs from the traditional public procurement model in this sense and in the unprecedented degree to which the private sector is involved. All things being equal, the rationale for choosing a PPP instead of a traditional public procurement model is if it provides a better <b>Value</b> <b>for</b> Money. As a result, a crucial issue to address is to find the key drivers of <b>Value</b> <b>for</b> Money in PPP projects and most importantly, to analyze the relationships between those key drivers and the complex notion of <b>Value</b> <b>for</b> Money. This study is based on a large overview of the literature together with contributions of informal interviews and my own opinions.
