40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{issues related to}} the {{spectral}} parameters (mass and width) of unstable particles in lattice calculations. Using a solvable model, the Lee Model, we show that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, which is the spectrum measured from the Euclidean correlation functions in lattice simulations, need not be the same as the energy at which the scattering phase passes through π/ 2. It is in general also different from the real part of the actual pole position for the S-matrix element. These three quantities are close to one another only when the resonance is narrow. We also investigate the volume dependence of the so-called spectral weights for the energy eigenstates which can be obtained in lattice simulations. The volume dependence of this quantity helps to distinguish between one-particle and two-particle states in lattice calculations. Within the Lee model, we verify that this is indeed the case when the so-called <b>V-particle</b> is stable. For an unstable <b>V-particle</b> (resonance), this method is only applicable for narrow resonances. We argue that this conclusion should also be qualitatively correct in general theories like QCD...|$|E

Also the whole argumentation itself was not com-plete and exhaustive enough to get full insight into the nature of the <b>V-particles.</b> In view of these points, we wiII here supplement the previous letter with some more general con-siderations, while adding to our knowledge the experimental results of American groupS 3) in so far as they are accessible to us. Of the various properties of the <b>V-particles</b> which are known to us, the most remarkable seems to be their large yield and long life, two apparently contradicting properties on the basis of simple detailed balance consideration. They suggest that production and decay are not inverse processes and/or some kind of selection rules (in a very general sense) are at work in the decay reaction. On the other hand, among what are not yet clarified ex-perimentally, there are such important things as the iderttification of the decay products of the <b>V-particles</b> and their decay modes.

Since no other crucial evidences are known (such as the mode of V produc-tion), we are led to a wide variety of possible interpretations if we wiII take all these points into account, and they can be recommended or disfavored only after a closer examination.

This thesis {{is the first}} to result from operation of the 48 " magnet cloud chambers at the California Institute of Technology. The apparatus is not described here in any detail. The techniques used to measure track curvatures and the positions of points inside the chambers are discussed in detail as is the analysis of the possible errors in these quantities. A formula is derived for computing the momentum of a particle from its measured curvature on the film. It includes corrections for the nonaxial components of the magnetic field and the effect of the conical projection involved in the photography. A method for correcting approximately for the variation of the magnetic field along the track is also presented. A summary of the dynamics of the two-body decay of a neutral <b>V-particle</b> is presented. A discussion of the uses of plots of [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ] for a two-body decay is included. The dynamics of some simple three-body decays are discussed. The distribution of the momenta of one of the decay products is derived, including only the effects of the density of states in phase space.

40|$|In {{a set of}} 23, 000 cloud-chamber {{photographs}} taken {{in a study of}} penetrating showers, 134 examples of the decay of neutral V-particles, and 18 of the decay of charged V-particles, were observed. An analysis of the 152 examples leads to the following principal conclusions: (1) V-particles result from the impact of mesons and probably also of nucleons, upon nuclei. (2) V-particles are generally produced singly and not in pairs. (3) Two independent kinds of data, one based on measurements of angles and other purely spatial relationships, and the other based on measurements of momentum and specific ionization, lead to the conclusion that more than 80 percent of these neutral V-particles decayed by the production of a heavy positive and a light negative particle. The mass of the heavy positive particle in most instances was consistent with that of a proton, but in a few cases may have been somewhat less. The negative particle appeared most often to be a π-meson, although in a few cases a μ-meson was indicated. In about 7 percent of the cases, the positive particle was light and had a mass consistent with that of a π- or μ-meson. In these cases the mass of the negative particle was not well determined. So far, therefore, in these investigations, there is no direct evidence that a neutral <b>V-particle</b> decays into two π-mesons, or into a positive π-meson and a negatively charged proton, although a few cases may be so interpreted. (4) The data are consistent with the assumption of a two-body decay for a majority of the neutral V-particles, and therefore a rather extensive analysis is given based upon this assumption. (5) The energy release, or Q-value, of the decay of neutral V-particles was computed, on the assumption of a two-body decay, for those cases in which the production of a heavy positive particle was clearly indicated, and where momentum measurements were possible. On the assumption of a decay into a proton and a π- meson, the Q-values obtained ranged from 10 Mev to about 100 Mev. The great majority of cases however, may be described in terms of discrete Q-values at 35 ± 3 Mev, and 75 ± 5 Mev, although, of course, the data are consistent with distributions about these values. For the same set of cases, if the positive particle is assumed to be as light even as 1250 me, and/or the negative particle is assumed to be a μ-meson, the distribution of Q-values is not greatly changed, and the apparent necessity for at least two different Q-values remains. In those few cases mentioned in (3) above, in which the positive particle was light, and in which the mass of the negative particle was undetermined, the energy release, computed {{on the basis of a}} two-body decay, depends upon the assumed identity of the decay products, and is about 100 - 130 Mev for the assumption that two π-mesons are produced, about 50 - 80 Mev for a positive π-meson and a negative τ-meson, and about 30 - 80 Mev for a positive π-meson and a negative proton. (6) The rest mean lifetime of V 0 particles, which appear to yield protons and π [...] mesons as decay products, was found to be 1. 6 × 10 - 10 sec for 26 cases having Q-values greater than 50 Mev, and 2. 9 × 10 - 10 sec for 48 cases having Q-values less than 50 Mev, on the assumption of a two-body decay. In view of the rather poor statistics, the above two lifetimes are consistent with a single value, and lead to an average of 2. 5 ± 0. 7 × 10 - 10 sec. The above lifetimes are not appreciably changed if a multibody decay of the neutral <b>V-particle</b> is assumed. (7) The data are not adequate to distinguish conclusively between a two-body and a multi-body decay, and, therefore, a discussion is also given in terms of a variety of possible decay schemes of the neutral <b>V-particle...</b>|$|E

40|$|A new {{conjecture}} {{is proposed}} {{that there are}} two sorts of matter called s-matter and v-matter which are symmetric and whose gravitational masses are opposite to each other, although both masses are positive. Therefore, there are two sorts of symmetry breaking called V-breaking and S-breaking. In the S-breaking, s-particles get their masses and form s-galaxies etc., while v-fermions and v-gauge bosons are still massless and form v-SU(5) singlets. There is no interaction among the v-SU(5) color-single states except gravitation so that they distribute loosely in space, cannot be observed and cause space to expand with an acceleration. When temperature increases to the critical temperature because space contracts, masses of all particles are zero so that s-particles and <b>v-particles</b> transform from one to another and the gravitational mass density becomes negative. Consequently, space stop to contract and inflation must occur. After reheating, space first expands with a deceleration and then expands with an acceleration up to now. There is no space-time singularity. There are the critical temperature, the highest temperature and the least scale in the universe. A formula describing distance-redshift is obtained. A huge void is not empty, and is equivalent to a huge concave lens. The densities of hydrogen in the huge voids must be much less than that predicted by the conventional theory. The gravitation between two galaxies with distance long enough will be less than that predicted by the conventional theory. A black hole with its mass and density big enough will transform into a white hole. Primordial nucleosynthesis and CMB are explained.
