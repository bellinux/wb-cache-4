30|$|Kabeel et al. [33] used Al 2 O 3 {{nanoparticles}} {{with water}} inside a single basin solar still. Their {{results showed that}} using nanofluids improves the solar still water productivity by about 116 % and 76 % with and without operating the <b>vacuum</b> <b>fan.</b> The authors attributed this increment to the increase of evaporation rate inside the still. Utilizing nanofluid increases the rate of evaporation. In addition, due to this vacuum inside the still the evaporation rate increases further and the productivity increases compared with the still working at atmospheric conditions.|$|E
40|$|Radon remediarion is {{typically}} {{done with a}} sub-slab ventilation system. A primary cause of failure of these systems is due to an incomplete pressure field extension, which allows radon to continue to enter the building. More {{than half of the}} homes which WPB Enterprises mitigates, do not have a good gravel base under the slab. This Project investigated a techniquewhich extends the pressure field in tight soils from a single suction point by creating sub-floor tunnels using a commonly available 3000 psi pressure washer. This technique is a possible choice for mitigators dealing with non-rocky, tight soil and limited choices for suction hole locations. Tunneling under the slab was found to be able to double the existing strength of the pressure field but not to increase the pressure field extension significantly nor to consistently produce a vacuum where none existed before. The study made a comparison between using the water jet to increase the pressure Held extension versus using a high <b>vacuum</b> <b>fan</b> or adding an additional suction hole. Adding an additional suction hole compared favorable with installing a high <b>vacuum</b> <b>fan</b> and was a less expensive option. Both of these alternative options proved successful in mitigating dmcult tight soil houses while the water jet approach was not successful. This paper includes a description of the Project work which was done at three of the five residential houses in Pennsylvania, each having elevated radon levels due to poor sub-slab communication...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{most direct}} method of {{projecting}} or measuring {{the performance of}} an active soil depressurization (ASD) system is to measure the strength and extent of the pressure field established under the slab. The pressure field extension (PFE) can be determined during diagnostics to help design an ASD system and following installation to ascertain system performance. In schools, and other large buildings, these data are invaluable to provide a system which will mitigate the building without undue cost escalation. This paper presents EPAts experiences using PFE to design ASD systems for old and new schools, including instances where the data collected resulted in the installation of smaller systems than expected and selection of high <b>vacuum</b> <b>fans</b> instead of "normaltu mitigation fans. A central collection system for use under very large slabs is presented, and PFE data for a hospital under construction are presented...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{a system of}} machine vision and {{singulation}} was developed to separate paddy from rice and determine paddy husking and rice breakage percentages. The machine vision system consists of three main components including an imaging chamber, a digital camera, a computer equipped with image processing software. The singulation device consists of a kernel holding surface, a motor with <b>vacuum</b> <b>fan,</b> and a dimmer. For separation of paddy from rice (in the image), {{it was necessary to}} set a threshold. Therefore, some images of paddy and rice were sampled and the RGB values of the images were extracted using MATLAB software. Then mean and standard deviation of the data were determined. An Image processing algorithm was developed using MATLAB to determine paddy/rice separation and rice breakage and paddy husking percentages, using blue to red ratio. Tests showed that, a threshold of 0. 75 is suitable for separating paddy from rice kernels. Results from the evaluation of the image processing algorithm showed that the accuracies obtained with the algorithm were 98. 36 % and 91. 81 % for paddy husking and rice breakage percentage, respectively. Analysis also showed that a suction of 45 mmHg to 50 mmHg yielding 81. 3 % separation efficiency is appropriate for operation of the kernel singulation system...|$|E
40|$|Neonicotinoid {{insecticides}} (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam) and fipronil for maize (Zea mays L.) {{seed dressing}} have been claimed {{to play a}} role in honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) decline, since pneumatic precision drills used for sowing contribute to the dispersion of the abrasion dust produced by dressed seeds. The active ingredients (a. i.) can contaminate the environment and can lead to the exposure of operators and bystanders during sowing operations. To achieve a significant reduction of dust drift and to enhance the safety for the operators, CRA-ING studied and developed novel engineering solutions applicable to drills, based on an air-recycling/filtering system. In the first system, the air’s excess is forced outward through suitable filters placed on the modified lid of the seed hopper. It can be easily applied to commercial drills in use. The second system was specifically designed for new drills. It consists of a collector duct that receives the air expelled from the <b>vacuum</b> <b>fan</b> opening, creating constant pressure conditions. Part of the air is recycled into the seed hoppers, as the air in excess is directed outward through a single main filter. A third system, based on the second one, entails the use of an electrostatic filter to improve its efficiency. Moreover, to avoid the operator’s exposure to the dust during the seed loading, we show an integrated solution based on the use of a modified pre-charged plastic container that replace the drill’s hoppers. Preliminary tests ascertained the regular seed distribution with the drills equipped with the prototypes. Then, trials were carried out at fixed point and in field, for detecting the amounts of the drifted a. i., using commercial maize seed dressed with thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, clothianidin and fipronil. The test results show powder and a. i. drift reductions up to a maximum of 94. 5 % measured at ground level (with fipronil as a. i.) as a consequence of the use of the prototypes...|$|E

25|$|When {{electricity}} {{was first}} introduced into houses, it was primarily used for lighting. At that time, many electricity companies operated a split-tariff system where the cost of electricity for lighting was lower than that for other purposes.

40|$|Single Phase Induction Machines formthework {{horse of}} various fractional-power {{domestic}} and agricultural {{applications such as}} <b>vacuum</b> cleaners, <b>fans,</b> water pumps etc. They are often designed to be simple, rugged and low-cost. This work is aimed at using these single-phase induction machines for wider applications. A majority of single-phase induction machines are capacitor-start type of induction machines. These machines have two-stator windings {{in space and time}} quadrature. One of these windings is used only to start the machine. The possibility of using this passive winding as an active winding, functional throughout the machine operation, by simply retrofitting a run capacitor, has been discussed in this work. Consequently, this two-phase winding machine has been proposed {{to be used as a}} wind turbine generator coupled with power electronics. The suggested dc-link inverter single-phase induction machine system can be an economical generator system to provide for fractional horsepower applications as compared to the conventional and expensive permanent magnet generators. Computer simulation results have been used to confirm the analytical results of the proposed two-phase machine and wind-turbine generator system. Results of some preliminary experiments from a laboratory prototype of the two-phase motor have been presented...|$|R
30|$|The most {{efficient}} way found is to fully or partially cover the pond surface with a material made usually of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or polypropylene (PP). The pond cover serves {{as a way to}} capture the gas generated from anaerobic digestion. Covers are usually designed to extend through the pond’s perimeter where it is either placed in a trench or held in place by means of a concrete slab. After the biogas is captured, it is collected by perforated pipes located below the cover. From the pipes, the biogas is removed from the cover by a <b>vacuum</b> (e.g., centrifugal <b>fan)</b> (NIWA 2008). Several authors have recorded the application of covers to capture biogas in municipal wastewater treatment systems. DeGarie et al. (2000) discussed the implementation of a three-layer cover consisting of geomembrane, polyform, and HDPE in Melbourne (Australia). The biogas cover was placed on the anaerobic lagoons in the wastewater treatment plant. Shelef and Azov (2000) constructed a waste stabilization pond system in the Negev desert of Israel. The pond treatment system consisted of anaerobic ponds, stabilization ponds, rock filters, and stabilization reservoirs. The authors included a cover on the anaerobic pond.|$|R
