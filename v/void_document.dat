40|$|In November 2005, {{as part of}} an omnibus statute {{amending}} 11 different acts, the British Columbia {{government made}} several significant changes to BC 2 ̆ 7 s Land Title Act. The government announced that the changes to the title registration system would 2 ̆ 7 ensure immediate legal certainty of land title for a person acting in good faith, who unknowingly acquired a fee simple interest in the property through a forged transfer, provided the individual did not participate in the fraud 2 ̆ 7. In an effort to assuage fears of those who had acquired interests in a system that, if it needed to be fixed, had been somewhat less than secure, the government 2 ̆ 7 s information bulletin assured the public that BC’s registration system was 2 ̆ 7 already highly regarded 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 considered world-class 2 ̆ 7. The changes then were to be understood as improvements to what was already a good title registration system. Whatever its quality, the title registration system laboured with uncertainty over its central organizing principle. Did title registration in BC operate on the basis of immediate or deferred indefeasibility? The difference between the two principles lies in the security they provide the person who in good faith acquires an interest in land based on a <b>void</b> <b>document</b> such as a forged transfer instrument. Put simply, under immediate indefeasibility the registered owner of a fee simple interest is immune to a challenge that the registered owner acquired the interest {{on the basis of a}} void instrument. Under a deferred system the registered owner of a fee simple interest only holds indefeasible title if he or she is one step away from the fraudulent activity. A person who acquires an interest on the basis of a void instrument remains vulnerable to the claim of the person who has wrongfully deprived of his or her interest. The language in the government’s information bulletin – 2 ̆ 7 immediate legal certainty 2 ̆ 7 – suggests it intended to establish that BC’s title registration system rests on a foundation of immediate indefeasibility. If that were the intent, is that what the November 2005 amendments have done? Is it now unequivocally clear that BC operates on the basis of immediate indefeasibility? And if so, are property interests more secure as a result? This article reviews the previous sources of uncertainty in the Land Title Act, outlines the changes to it, and suggests their effect on those whose property interests are affected by fraudulent activity. It begins with a brief description of the manner in which the common law treated forged instruments purporting to transfer an interest in land and then outlines the nature of, and different approaches to, indefeasible title in title registration systems...|$|E
40|$|Query {{processing}} is {{an important}} way of accessing data on the Semantic Web. Today, the Semantic Web is characterized as a web of interlinked datasets, and thus querying the web {{can be seen as}} dataset integration on the web. Also, this dataset integration must be transparent from the data consumer as if she is querying the whole web. To decide which datasets should be selected and integrated for a query, one requires a metadata of the web of data. In this paper, to enable this transparency, we introduce a federated query engine called WoDQA (Web of Data Query Analyzer) which discovers datasets relevant with a query in an automated manner using <b>VOID</b> <b>documents</b> as metadata. WoDQA focuses on powerful dataset elimination by analyzing query structure with respect to the metadata of datasets. Dataset and linkset descriptions in <b>VOID</b> <b>documents</b> are analyzed for a SPARQL query and a federated query is constructed. By means of linkset concept of VOID, links between datasets are incorporated into selection of federated data sources. Current version of WoDQA is available as a SPARQL endpoint. 1...|$|R

Underpricing is unaffected by the grading process. However, stock price informativeness as proxied by idiosyncratic volatility increases significantly due to IPO grading process. Using a pseudo grading process we find that the grades are not mechanically derivable from publicly available information. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the view that credit rating agencies in emerging markets can potentially supply useful information of relevance to both retail and institutional investors...|$|R
50|$|By law, many {{transactions}} {{are required to}} be in writing. Because of expediency, many more {{transactions are}} put into writing. A written transaction is called an instrument. An instrument {{is a result of}} negotiations. Sometimes, an instrument may fail to express the intention of the involved parties. Rectification of such an instrument may become necessary. Help towards parties who want to have their documents (which are mistakenly executed) rectified, is provided in Chapter III of the Specific Relief Act. Closely related with documents mistakenly executed, is the category of documents which are at a later point found to be void or which become <b>void.</b> These <b>documents</b> ought to be cancelled. Chapter V provides relief from such kinds of documents. Also, there is a category of contracts which, for some reason or the other (e.g. lack of free consent) can be deemed voidable by the party which consent was not free. This party has the right to have the contract rescinded. Relief by way of rescission is provided by Chapter IV of the Specific Relief Act.|$|R
40|$|In the {{community}} of adoption and throughout its related literature, the needs and experiences of 2 ̆ 2 invisible 2 ̆ 2 or non-adopted children in transracial families have been largely overlooked. This study attempts to address that <b>void</b> by <b>documenting</b> the meaning and influences of transracial adoption {{in the lives of}} twelve non-adopted white adults who grew up with a transracially adopted brother or sister. The research used discourse analysis to document the narrative identities of the non-adopted siblings as they were enacted during interviews about transracial adoption. Five composite narrative identities are discussed, with distinctions made between those that were characterized as transracialized or un-transracialized. Transracialization is presented as a participant 2 ̆ 7 s active engagement with discourses of race and adoption in ways that may result in 2 ̆ 2 post-white 2 ̆ 2 identities in non-adopted siblings. Transracialization is discussed in terms of its benefit to members of adoptive families and the professionals who serve them, including social workers, psychotherapists, and educators.

40|$|The Bahamian {{archipelago}} covers over 5, 000 {{square miles}} of the Atlantic Ocean at the northwestern edge of the Caribbean Sea. In the Age of Sail, from the late 15 th to early 20 th centuries, these islands were on major sailing routes between the Caribbean, Central America, and Europe. Bahamians developed life-ways using their islands? location to their advantage. Archaeological evidence {{of the significance of}} shipping activity is quite lacking. This research aimed to help fill the <b>void</b> by <b>documenting</b> examples of ship graffiti throughout the Bahamas. Examples of ship graffiti were documented with photographs and tracings. The Bahamian examples all date to the 19 th and 20 th centuries, 100 years later than other examples from the Caribbean and North America. They are also unique in being incised into the stone surfaces of building walls, caves, stones on a hillside, even on a slate fragment. It is possible that ship graffiti were also engraved on wooden surfaces but these have not survived in the archaeological record. Images depict locally-built vessels such as sloops and schooners as well as larger, ocean-going vessels. Ship graffiti are at sites associated mainly with people of African heritage, another possible social grouping being persons of lower economic status. Graffiti details consistently indicate that the artists were familiar with ship construction and rigging. This analysis of ship graffiti gives some understanding of the significance of ships and shipping in the Bahamian economy...|$|R
40|$|Case {{management}} practices of appellate courts {{have a significant}} effect on the outcome of appeals. Decisions about which cases will receive oral argument, which will have dispositions written by staff attorneys in lieu of judges, and which will result in unpublished opinions exert a powerful influence on the quality of justice that can be obtained from the federal appellate courts. Despite their importance, there has been no in-depth review of the case {{management practices}} of the different circuit courts in the academic literature. This Article begins to fill that <b>void.</b> It first <b>documents</b> and analyzes the practices of five circuit courts, based on qualitative research in the form of interviews of appellate judges, clerks of court, court mediators, and staff attorneys. A thorough account of case management reveals the great extent to which these practices vary across circuits. The Article considers reasons for the variation, and asks whether such a lack of uniformity is problematic in a federal system. The Article concludes that disuniformity in case management practice is more defensible than in substantive and procedural law, but that current practice can and should be improved through increased transparency and information sharing between the circuits...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The anti-incontinence {{effect of}} {{desmopressin}} resides in its concentrating capacity and antidiuretic properties. We compared nighttime urine production on {{wet and dry}} nights in a highly selected study population of children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis associated with proved nocturnal polyuria who responded only partially to intranasal desmopressin. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 39 home recordings of nocturnal urine production and maximum voided volume in children 7 to 19 years old (median 8. 9) with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis with nocturnal polyuria who had a partial response to desmopressin. Nocturnal diuresis volume and maximum <b>voided</b> volume were <b>documented</b> at baseline (14 days) and during 3 months of followup. Results: Baseline nocturnal urine output (439 +/- 39 ml) {{was significantly higher than}} the maximum voided volume (346 93 ml, p < 0. 01). During desmopressin treatment nocturnal urine output on wet nights (405 +/- 113 ml) differed significantly from that on dry nights (241 +/- 45 ml). During treatment nocturnal urine output on wet nights did not differ from baseline values. Conclusions: Persistence of nocturnal polyuria on wet nights in partial desmopressin responders may be related to an insufficient antidiuretic effect. In addition to poor compliance and suboptimal dosing, the poor bioavailability of intranasal desmopressin may be a pathogenic factor. Further prospective studies are needed...|$|R

Dating of the city’s expansi-on north of the Strossmayer Street, location of the muro novo civitatis versus montem, as well as the regulation of streets by the Statute of Dubrovnik of 1272 are merely some of the issues discussed in this article. The area of the civitas as described by Constantine Porphyrogenitus (Ca-strum, St. Peter and Pustijerna), which existed on the peninsula {{in the middle of the}} tenth century, was being gradually joined to the opposite mainland - to-day’s Prijeko - by filling a deep, partly swampy bay. Filling of the marshland was an essential precondition for the city’s expansion to the north. By 1255, plots and houses north of the Strossmayer Street were already protected by the new city wall. Archival documents offer evidence for its ubication along today’s GučetićStreet.

40|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen a sharp {{increase}} in academic studies and public policy research concerned with the internationalization and performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). From this perspective, it is the influence of organizational and environmental characteristics on the internationalization process, as well as the effects of internationalization on firm performance, that have been the focus of scholars. Nevertheless, little is yet known of the internationalization determinants of SMEs in developing countries, and a lack of empirical evidence in the literature provides strong ground for this research. This study fills the <b>void</b> by <b>documenting</b> the relationships between organizational and environmental characteristics - specifically, entrepreneurial orientation, global mindset, network relationships and government support –internationalization, and firm performance. Notably, the study also distinguishes between the financial and non-financial performance of SMEs, which further adds to its significance. The specific objectives of the study were to: (1) investigate the effects of entrepreneurial orientation, global mindset, network relationships and government support on internationalization (2) analyze the effects of internationalization on firm performance and (3) examine the mediating effects of internationalization on the relationships between entrepreneurial orientation, global mindset, network relationships and government support, and firm performance. iv A quantitative survey methodology was applied using self-administered questionnaire to collect data from a sample of Malaysian SMEs involved in international business. The key informants were the owners or the highest ranking officers of the firms, who were the most knowledgeable about their firms’ characteristics, international operations and performance. The final 237 completed questionnaires yielded an effective response rate of 20 percent. Data collected were then analyzed using structural equation modeling to examine associative relationships among the three main constructs. The study has discovered several interesting findings which point to differences between international SMEs in developed and developing countries. First, contrary to earlier research in developed countries, current findings showed that entrepreneurial orientation, global mindset and network relationships were not positively related to internationalization. Second, a very strong positive relationship between government support and internationalization was observed here. Thus, unlike the situation in developed countries, government support has emerged as a more powerful determinant of internationalization than organizational characteristics among Malaysian SMEs. In addition, {{the results of this study}} have provided important empirical evidence for the positive effect of internationalization on both financial and non-financial performance of Malaysian SMEs. Internationalization also partially mediates the relationships between entrepreneurial orientation, global mindset, v network relationships and government support, and firm performance. Therefore, the current findings have emphasized internationalization as a key factor toward enhancing the performance of Malaysian SMEs. The study is expected to make a valuable contribution to knowledge of SME internationalization in developing countries, especially in the context that relates internationalization to organizational and environmental characteristics, and firm performance. It also has implications in the form of best practices for Malaysian SMEs. At the same time, it can provide directions for the government and policy-makers in their effort to develop policies and programs for the betterment of this particular business communit...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: verificar a incidência de cicatrizes renais em crianças com refluxo vesicoureteral primário, comparando com sexo, idade no diagnóstico, infecção febril, grau do refluxo e tipo de bactéria. MÉTODOS: estudo retrospectivo de 58 crianças, com idade entre dois meses a 11 anos, apresentando refluxo vesicoureteral primário, detectado pela uretrocistografia miccional, após episódio documentado de infecção urinária. Diagnóstico de cicatriz renal foi obtido pela cintilografia com DMSA cinco meses, no mínimo, após o tratamento da infecção urinária; em 40 crianças, o exame foi repetido após período de seis meses a seis anos. RESULTADOS: 45 crianças (77, 6 %) eram meninas e 13 (22, 4 %) eram meninos, 51, 7 % com idade menor ou igual a 2 anos. A incidência de cicatriz renal foi de 55, 2 %. Houve maior proporção significativa de cicatrizes renais no sexo feminino, na presença do sintoma febre e no refluxo dilatado (III, IV e V). Presença de febre e sexo feminino foram fatores de risco significativos na ocorrência de cicatriz renal (febre - OR= 6, 19, e sexo feminino - OR= 4, 12). Houve tendência da presença de cicatriz renal em maiores de 2 anos. O intervalo entre início dos sintomas e a primeira {{consulta}} foi maior nas crianças com cicatrizes renais. Novas cicatrizes renais foram observadas em 12, 5 %. CONCLUSÃO: a presença de febre e sexo feminino foram fatores de risco para presença de cicatrizes renais, principalmente no refluxo vesicoureteral dilatado. A alta incidência de cicatrizes renais neste estudo pode estar relacionada ao retardo do diagnóstico do refluxo vesicoureteral. OBJECTIVE: {{to determine}} the incidence of renal scars in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux taking into consideration the following variables: sex, age at diagnosis, febrile urinary infection, degree of reflux and bacteria specimen. METHOD: retrospective study of 58 children with age ranging from 2 months to 11 years, presenting primary vesicoureteral reflux detected by <b>voiding</b> cystourethrogram after <b>documented</b> episode of urinary tract infection. The diagnosis of renal scarring was obtained by dimercaptosuccinic acid scan 5 months after {{the treatment of the}} urinary infection; in 40 children the dimercaptosuccinic acid scan was performed again from 6 months up to 6 years after the treatment. RESULTS: 45 children (77. 6 %) were girls and 13 (22. 4 %) were boys, 51. 7 % were 2 years old or younger. The incidence of renal scarring was 55. 2 %. There was significant higher proportion of renal scars in girls, when the patients presented fever and dilated vesicoureteral reflux (III, IV, V). Fever and female sex were risk factors for the development of renal scars (fever - ODDS ratio = 6. 19 and female sex - ODDS ratio = 4. 12). There was a prevalence of renal scars in children over 2 years old. The interval between the beginning of the symptoms and the first medical visit was longer in the children with renal scars. New renal scars were observed in 12. 5 %. CONCLUSIONS: fever and female sex were risk factors for the presence of renal scars, mainly in the dilated vesicoureteral reflux. The high incidence of renal scars in this study may be related to delayed diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux...|$|R
