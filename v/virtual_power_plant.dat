We address <b>virtual</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> from an information technological, economic and legal perspective in order to enable decentralized sustainable generation. For the realization of <b>virtual</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> we draw on a peer-to-peer infrastructure with market coordination and legal coverage to manage the distributed generation units and we focus on the combination of power and heat. Based on our prototype for a decentralized market platform, we examine the economic and ecological impacts of an increasing pervasiveness of distributed generation and <b>virtual</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> as well as their potential influence on society. At the social level, we consider questions of local immission, but also of growing awareness for power issues. With regard to the ecology, we expect a reduction of overall primary energy demand resulting from reduced transmission and transformation losses and increased use of combined heat and <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> at a local level leading to a reduction of emissions. Finally, since local distributed generation makes more efficient use of primary energy and long-distance transport lines can be reduced, we expect lower costs for the complete system as well as reduced uncertainty with regard to amortization of investments.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{generation}} {{of renewable energy}} sources in the European grid has strongly increased. In 2005 eight times more energy was generated by RES compared to 1990. In the future the EU wants to promote the in-tegration of RES. Mainly the use of wind energy and biomass should be expanded.

50|$|The new {{paradigm}} of power system operation allows a multitude of DERs, including distributed generators, ﬂexible/controllable loads, and energy storage facilities, to be coordinated {{under the umbrella of}} Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). A VPP acts as an intermediary between DERs and the wholesale market and trades energy on behalf of DER owners who are not able to participate in the electricity market alone. In fact, the VPP aggregates the capacity of DGs, ESSs, and FLs to form a coalition of heterogeneous technologies in the hope of trading in the wholesale electricity market. The VPP behaves as a conventional dispatchable power plant in the viewpoint of other market participants, although it is indeed a cluster of many diverse DERs. Also, in the competitive electricity markets, a <b>virtual</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> acts as an arbitrageur by exercising arbitrage between diverse energy trading ﬂoors (i.e., bilateral and PPA contracts, forward and futures markets, and the pool).|$|E
