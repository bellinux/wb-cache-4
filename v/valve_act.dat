5000|$|On November 21, 2013, the United States Senate Judiciary Committee {{convened in}} a rescheduled Executive Business Meeting. The meeting was {{to discuss and}} {{possibly}} vote on moving forward with the Justice Safety <b>Valve</b> <b>Act.</b> Other related Acts include the S.1410, [...] "The Smarter Sentencing Act of 2013" [...] (Durbin, Lee, Leahy, Whitehouse) and S.1675, Recidivism Reduction and Public Safety Act of 2013 (Whitehouse, Portman). The Justice Safety <b>Valve</b> <b>Act</b> became one of many new bills to address prison overcrowding and the soaring cost to the American taxpayers. A quorum was not present at the meeting and the Chairman had to postpone discussion and possible vote on the Justice Safety <b>Valve</b> <b>Act.</b> The bills were held over by the Senate Judiciary Committee though the end of 2013 and January 2014. The bills were worked on to merge {{the language of the}} Smarter Sentencing Act (H.R. 3382/S. 1410) and the Justice Safety <b>Valve</b> <b>Act</b> (H.R. 1695/S. 619) along with a new bill, S. 1783 the Federal Prison Reform Act of 2013, introduced by John Cornyn (R-TX).|$|E
5000|$|The Justice Safety <b>Valve</b> <b>Act</b> of 2013 ( [...] in the House or [...] in the Senate) {{is a bill}} in the 113th United States Congress. [...] The {{bill would}} allow courts to impose {{criminal}} penalties below the statutory minimum sentences under certain circumstances.|$|E
50|$|The {{bill was}} {{introduced}} on July 31, 2013 by Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) {{and referred to}} the Judiciary Committee on October 20, 2013. It {{is related to the}} Justice Safety <b>Valve</b> <b>Act</b> of 2013, the Federal Prison Reform Act of 2013 (S. 1783) and others, in an effort to deal with the over-crowded, and under-funded, federal prison system.|$|E

5000|$|The Recidivism Reduction and Public Safety Act of 2013 is {{also known}} as [...] It was {{presented}} to the 113th Congress by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). The bill, along with others such as Justice Safety <b>Valve</b> <b>Act</b> of 2013 and The Smarter Sentencing Act of 2013, are aimed at improving over-crowded federal prison system and reducing re-entry, or Recidivism, of non-violent offenders. The bill was first introduced on November 7, 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The bill summary {{was written}} by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan {{division}} of the Library of Congress. It reads, [...] "Justice Safety <b>Valve</b> <b>Act</b> of 2013 - Amends the federal criminal code to authorize a federal court to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum if necessary to avoid violating federal provisions prescribing factors courts must consider in imposing a sentence. Requires the court to give the parties notice of its intent to impose a lower sentence and to state in writing the factors requiring such a sentence." ...|$|E
50|$|Leahy is {{currently}} the longest-serving Democratic Senator {{as well as the}} longest-serving U.S. Senator in the history of Vermont, and the current dean of his state's congressional delegation. Having been there since 1975, he is also the longest serving incumbent Senator following the death of Hawaii's Daniel Inouye, who had served from 1962 until his death in 2012. He is {{the former chairman of the}} Senate Judiciary Committee. The Senate Judiciary Committee worked extensively on prison reform with the introduction on a number of bills aimed at reforming the overcrowded prisons. The bills include: the Justice Safety <b>Valve</b> <b>Act</b> of 2013, The Smarter Sentencing Act of 2013, and the Public Safety Enhancement Act.|$|E
50|$|Counterbalance valves {{are in fact}} {{a special}} type of pilot {{controlled}} check valve. Whereas the check valve is open or closed, the counterbalance <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> {{a bit like a}} pilot controlled flow control.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{producers}} of two-stroke performance bikes fit {{them with the}} exhaust valve systems. These <b>valves</b> <b>act</b> to vary the height (and width) of the exhaust port thereby broadening power delivery over a wider rev range. Exhaust ports with fixed dimensions only produce usable power in a narrow rev range, which also affects fuel consumption and emissions.|$|R
50|$|These operate by {{the varying}} {{viscosity}} of liquids and gases and {{are designed for}} situations, such as fire truck hoses, {{where there is a}} large flow and a large quantity of air to be vented rapidly. A conical plug valve is spring-loaded. Flow around this <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> against spring pressure. Flow of liquid is sufficient to hold the valve against the spring, flow of air is not.|$|R
40|$|In 2013 Senators Richard Durbin (D-IL), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Mike Lee (R-UT) {{introduced}} the Smarter Sentencing Act to decrease mandatory minimum sentences for federal drug crimes and enlarge the existing safety valve for federal drug offenses. 1 The Smarter Sentencing Act reduces the statutory minimum sentence of specific federal drug offenses and permits judges {{to deviate from}} mandatory minimum sentences for controlled sub- stance offenses under certain circumstances. 2 Similarly in 2013, Senators Leahy and Rand Paul (R-KY), as well as Representatives Bobby Scott (D-VA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY), {{introduced the}} Justice Safety <b>Valve</b> <b>Act.</b> 3 The Justice Safety <b>Valve</b> <b>Act</b> would give judges more discretion in sentencing by permitting judges to sentence offenders below the mandatory minimum sentence when such sentence would not meet one of the requisite goals of punishment. 4 Both acts aim to deter crime through more efficient means while reducing federal prison expenditure and the federal inmate population...|$|E
25|$|Not all reefs in {{the past}} were formed by corals: those in the Early Cambrian (542–513 Ma) {{resulted}} from calcareous algae and archaeocyathids (small animals with conical shape, probably related to sponges) and in the Late Cretaceous (100–66 Ma), when there also existed reefs formed {{by a group of}} bivalves called rudists; one of the valves formed the main conical structure and the other, much smaller <b>valve</b> <b>acted</b> as a cap.|$|R

The- soft part of the animal (flesh) is encased by two shell valves protecting it. While the lower shell valve gets cemented to the substratum in natural beds, the upper <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> as a lid, to open and close, by a hinge mechanism connecting both valves. The margin of the shell valves usually remains agape permitting water to enter the interior which enables the animal to respire and also to feed by filtering the microscopic organisms in the water...|$|R
50|$|In some cases, a {{so-called}} bypass <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> as a relief valve by {{being used to}} return {{all or part of}} the fluid discharged by a pump or gas compressor back to either a storage reservoir or the inlet of the pump or gas compressor. This is done to protect the pump or gas compressor and any associated equipment from excessive pressure. The bypass valve and bypass path can be internal (an integral part of the pump or compressor) or external (installed as a component in the fluid path). Many fire engines have such relief valves to prevent the overpressurization of fire hoses.|$|R
50|$|With the {{descending}} aorta exposed, the surgeon applies a side clamp to the aorta, effectively pinching and isolating {{one side of}} the great vessel. Blood continues to flow to the body's lower half through the unisolated remainder of the aorta. A lengthwise slit is made through the pinched face, and the open end of the valved conduit is carefully sutured to the slit. Once the suture line is checked for leaks, the aortic partial side clamp is removed and the valved conduit fills with blood up to the bioprosthetic <b>valve.</b> The <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> as a check valve, thereby maintaining hemostasis.|$|R

50|$|Small {{automatic}} valves {{are available to}} fit individual radiators. As these need to operate in any orientation, they use a different mechanism rather than a float. The Aladdin HVC30 system uses a 'hygroseal' cartridge. This is a small disc of material that expands when wet and shrinks if warm and dry. A dry <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> as an air vent until a dribble of water passes through it and swells the cartridge. If the valve dries out again, it re-opens. A characteristic of these valves is that they function best on the hot delivery side of a radiator and may not open as vents unless the water supply is hot.|$|R
40|$|A {{gate valve}} {{can be used}} {{for a wide variety of}} fluids and {{provides}} a tight seal when closed. Gate Valves are designed to suit a wide range of applications in Refineries, Petro-chemical Complexes, Fertilizer Plants, Power Generation Plants (Hydro-electric, Thermal and Nuclear) Steel Plants and Allied Industries. They are made from high quality Carbon Steel Castings and embody design features that contribute to strength and durability. Gate valves are used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. Gate valves are so named because the part that either stops or allows flow of fluid through the <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> somewhat like the opening or closing of a gate and is called, appropriately, the gate. The objective of this paper is to perform a literature review on optimization of various mechanical parts...|$|R
50|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} engine was its central spindle <b>valve.</b> This <b>acted</b> as a multi-stage piston valve, controlling admission of steam into each of the compound cylinders. Unusually the valve worked within the hollow piston rod or trunk, {{rather than in the}} cylinder block or valvechest. This hollow piston rod linked all of the cylinders and was machined with ports.|$|R
50|$|A {{safety valve}} is a <b>valve</b> that <b>acts</b> as a {{fail-safe}} in a thermal-hydraulics plant. An example of safety valve is a {{pressure relief valve}} (PRV), which automatically releases a substance from a boiler, pressure vessel, or other system, when the pressure or temperature exceeds preset limits. Pilot-operated relief valves are a specialized type of pressure safety valve. A leak tight, lower cost, single emergency use option would be a rupture disk.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{reliable}} and safe operation of piping systems {{depends on the}} precision of parameter regulation of the conducting medium with a minimum energy expenditure. The authors analyzed the use of gate and wedge shut-off valves by operating organizations {{in the mode of}} regulation of parameters of working media. The unintended use of pipe fittings causes its rapid failure. The authors have developed, manufactured and tested shut-off and regulating devices that have broad capabilities in the implementation of the throughput characteristics and requiring to control a drive of a smaller capacity. When the device opens or closes the opening in the gate, a closed controlled <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> as a bypass, as in the flow of a working medium through an orifice the pressure is aligned in the inlet and outlet nozzles. After pressure equalization (reducing pressure drop), the gate is unloaded and its lifting and lowering require less power, while for the shut-off and regulating device with the electric drive, the latter step requires with lower power consumption. On the basis of the energy created by slide gate valves saving shut-off and regulating device with a wide implementation in the throughput characteristics, methods of its calculation and experimental research and rational parameters are defined...|$|R
40|$|The nuclear-encoded {{chloroplast}} NADP-dependent {{malate dehydrogenase}} (NADP-MDH) {{is a key}} enzyme controlling the malate valve, to allow the indirect export of reducing equivalents. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. T-DNA insertion mutants of NADP-MDH {{were used to assess}} the role of the light-activated NADP-MDH in a typical C 3 plant. Surprisingly, even when exposed to high-light conditions in short days, nadp-mdh knockout mutants were phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild type. The photosynthetic performance and typical antioxidative systems, such as the Beck–Halliwell–Asada pathway, were barely affected in the mutants in response to high-light treatment. The reactive oxygen species levels remained low, indicating the apparent absence of oxidative stress, in the mutants. Further analysis revealed a novel combination of compensatory mechanisms in order to maintain redox homeostasis in the nadp-mdh plants under high-light conditions, particularly an increase in the NTRC/ 2 -Cys peroxiredoxin (Prx) system in chloroplasts. There were indications of adjustments in extra-chloroplastic components of photorespiration and proline levels, which all could dissipate excess reducing equivalents, sustain photosynthesis, and prevent photoinhibition in nadp-mdh knockout plants. Such metabolic flexibility suggests that the malate <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> in concert with other NADPH-consuming reactions to maintain a balanced redox state during photosynthesis under high-light stress in wild-type plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} the solids {{circulation}} rate in circulating fluidized beds (CFB) {{can be obtained by}} means of a mechanical valve located {{at the bottom of the}} return leg. The <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> by provoking a pressure drop that depends on the degree of the opening. The aim of this work is to develop a predictive model for the pressure drop in a butterfly valve used as a control device for the solids circulation rate. A model has been developed and validated against experimental data obtained from a 0. 1 m id, 6 m high CFB using a group B powder. The equations proposed by, Jones and Davidson [D. R. M. Jones, J. F. Davidson, The flow of particles from a fluidised bed through orifices, Rheologica Acta 4 (1965) 180] and Cheng et. al. [L. Cheng, P. Basu, Solids circulation rate prediction in a pressurized loop seal, in: K. Chen (Ed.), Chemical Engineering Research and Design, vol. 76, 1998, p. 761] to predict the discharge rate of granular solid through orifices have been modified to account for the shape of the openings in the valve. A corrective parameter, which is based on the dimensionless hydraulic diameter of the valve opening, has been introduced. Very good agreement with the experimental data was obtaine...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{our project}} is to replace the PID {{instrument}} with virtual PID that has equal controlling capabilities as that of instrument. This designing is possible on software called LabVIEW developed by National Instruments. We also intend to use a DAQ card for interfacing with the hardware. This DAQ card is product of the same company National Instruments. The hardware is a Multiloop Trainer Kit mounted with a tank whose level has to be controlled using a feedback control loop. The flow of project execution is: The designed PID will be generating the necessary controlling electronic signal. This signal will be acquired by DAQ card. The DAQ card transfers it to the I to P converter which will convert the electrical pulses 4 - 20 mA into pneumatic signal 3 - 15 psig to actuate the control valve. This conversion take place as the control <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> on pneumatic signals only. The control valve controls the fluid flow to maintain the fluid level in tank. The tank is fitted with a capacitive level sensor and a transmitter. This assembly takes the level readings from tank and transmits it to the DAQ card. These values are called process values and are further processed into the designed PID. This way a closed loop system is formed...|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of two check valves assembled in series. This employs two operating principles: firstly one check <b>valve</b> will still <b>act,</b> even if the other is jammed wide open. Secondly the closure of one valve reduces the pressure differential across the other, allowing a more reliable seal and avoiding even minor leakage.|$|R
50|$|The siphon valve {{is simply}} {{based upon the}} siphon phenomenon. When the {{cross section of the}} channel is small enough, the liquid in the chamber is able to flow along the channel due to surface tension. Unlike {{hydrophilic}} or hydrophobic <b>valves,</b> surface tension <b>acts</b> as a pump in this model while centrifugal force acts as resistance instead.|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{efficiency}} and torque performance {{are two major}} challenges for highly downsized turbocharged engines. However, the inherent characteristics of the turbocharged SI engine such as negative PMEP, knock sensitivity and poor transient performance significantly limit its maximum potential. Conventional ways of improving the problems above normally concentrate solely on the engine side or turbocharger side leaving the exhaust manifold in between ignored. This paper investigates this neglected area by highlighting a novel means of gas exchange process. Divided Exhaust Period (DEP) is an alternative way of accomplishing the gas exchange process in turbocharged engines. The DEP concept engine features two exhaust valves but with separated function. The blow-down <b>valve</b> <b>acts</b> like a traditional turbocharged exhaust valve to evacuate the first portion of the exhaust gas to the turbine. While the scavenge valve feeding the latter portion of the exhaust gas directly into the low resistant exhaust pipe behaves similarly to valves in a naturally aspirated engine. By combining the characteristics of both turbocharged and naturally aspirated engines, high backpressure between the turbine inlet and the exhaust port is maintained in the blowdown phase while significant reduction of the backpressure could be achieved in the latter displacement phase. This is directly beneficial for pumping work and residual gas scavenging. Combustion phasing & stability and turbocharger efficiency could also benefit from such concept. This simulation study was carried out using a validated 1 D model of a highly downsized SI engine. Two degrees of freedom including the lift and {{the duration of the}} scavenge valve were optimized to achieve minimum BSFC. The potential for higher attainable BMEP was also briefly investigated at low engine speed...|$|R
5000|$|The 1838 law proved {{inadequate}} as steamboat disasters {{increased in}} volume and severity. The period from 1847 to 1852 {{was marked by}} an unusual series of disasters primarily caused by boiler explosions; however, many were also caused by fires and collisions. These disasters resulted in {{the passage of the}} Steamboat Act of May 30, 1852 (10 Stat. L., 1852) in which enforcement powers were placed under the United States Department of the Treasury, rather than under the United States Department of Justice as with the Act of 1838. The important features of the Steamboat Act were the requirement for hydrostatic testing of boilers and the requirement for a boiler steam safety <b>valve.</b> The <b>act</b> further required that both pilots and engineers be licensed by the local inspectors.|$|R

5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper <b>valve</b> often <b>acts</b> as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|R
50|$|Larger {{models with}} two front discs use a dual CBS System. The system was first {{installed}} in a Honda CBR1000F in 1993. Here, applied brake pressure at the front is also applied to the rear wheel and vice versa. If the front lever is applied, pressure is built up at 4 of the 6 pots in the 2 calipers at the front. A secondary master cylinder at the front wheel distributes remaining pressure to the rear wheel through a proportional control <b>valve</b> and <b>acts</b> on 2 of the 3 calipers. If strong brake force is applied at the rear wheel force is also distributed to 2 of the 6 pots of the front wheel. More modern dual CBS use front and rear calipers (and all pots) according to a preset load ratio of front to rear.|$|R
