We aimed to enhance diagnostic practices by quantifying <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> motion, recorded in nasendoscopy videos, using bespoke image processing to measure <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> movement symmetry. Materials & Methods: With patient consent, routine clinical video data of <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> motion were recorded using flexible fibre-optic nasendoscopy connected to a 25 frame per second camera. In this study, 3 normal cases and 3 unilateral palsies were examined. A sequence of video frames pertaining to abduction movements were manually selected and input into the custom software for automatic processing. The algorithm executes a novel framework to quantify <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> motion, with steps involving glottal area segmentation, estimation of motion between successive frames of delineated <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> edges and measurement of movement symmetry. Results: In the normal cases, the horizontal velocity of motion of one <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> was at least 80 % (± 0. 58 %) of the other. The unilateral paralysed <b>vocal</b> <b>cords</b> were found to achieve only 18 % (severe), 58 % and 59 % motion of the contralateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord.</b> Conclusion: The results demonstrate a technique to objectively quantify <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> movement. Future work involves a comparative study of the results with subjective clinicians’ rating of <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> motion, on a discrete 5 -point scale. This technique may potentially {{be used in the}} diagnosis of subtle <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> movement asymmetries and early reduction in <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> movement due to pathology, and to aid in the assessment of outcomes of post-surgical interventions...|$|R

We report how the lack of normal <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> tone during phrenic paced respiration can result in passive <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> collapse and produce obstructive symptoms. Methods: We describe a case of passive <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> collapse during phrenic nerve paced respiration in a patient with CCHS. As far as we know, this is the first report of this etiology of airway obstruction. The patient, a 7 -year-old with CCHS and normal waking <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> movement, continued to require nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) despite successful utilization of phrenic nerve pacers. On direct laryngoscopy, the patient’s larynx was observed while the diaphragmatic pacers were sequentially engaged. Results: No abnormal <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> stimulation was witnessed during engaging of either phrenic nerve stimulator. However, the lack of normal inspiratory <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> abduction during phrenic nerve-paced respiration resulted in <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> collapse and partial obstruction due to passive adduction of the <b>vocal</b> <b>cords</b> through the Bernoulli effect.

40|$|<b>Vocal</b> <b>cord</b> palsy {{can have}} myriad causes. Unilateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> palsy is common and {{frequently}} asymptomatic.

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{functions}} of the larynx is phonation, the production of sound. Phonation requires the <b>vocal</b> <b>cords</b> to be adducted (positioned towards the midline) {{so that they can}} meet and vibrate together as air is expelled between them. Physiologically, the glottis is closed by intrinsic laryngeal muscles such as the lateral cricoarytenoid, thyroarytenoid, and interarytenoid muscles. These muscles act on the arytenoid cartilages at the posterior ends of the <b>vocal</b> <b>cords</b> and are innervated by the left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves. Damage to these nerves results in <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> paralysis - the reduced mobility and inability to adduct one or both <b>vocal</b> <b>cords.</b> Many cases of <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> paralysis result from trauma during surgery.

MethodsThis prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. <b>Vocal</b> <b>cord</b> function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting (ropivacaine) and short-acting (prilocaine) anesthetic.

ConclusionLocal anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> paralysis in almost half of these patients. Because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3 %), a preoperative evaluation of <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis.

Methods: A total of 112 outpatient or hospital-ized adults with dysphonia resulting from postsurgi-cal or idiopathic unilateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> paralysis were identified who were injected as initial treatment within 1 year of onset of their paralysis.
