40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to derive a {{framework}} for quantifying the contribution of the most important economic <b>and</b> policy <b>variables</b> to the public sector deficit. The method involves behavioral relations, identities for some key macroeconomic <b>and</b> sector <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> an accounting <b>breakdown</b> of the consolidated public sector deficit. This allows one to compare the direct effects of various foreign and domestic economic shocks on the deficit with those arising from changes in policy-controlled variables. The method is useful for decomposing historical time series of public deficits according to their main determinants - and for carrying out simulation or projection exercises for the level and structure of future deficits.

"December 2012 "The basis {{of this study was to}} give each of three different school districts one of the three different surveys. A step-by-step timeline of the process this researcher used up until data collection is included to be helpful for others in analyzing this study and replicating it. This quantitative analysis explored perceptions teachers have about their principals leadership styles, transformational qualities, and job satisfaction as may be influenced by gender, years of experience and retention. Surveys were given from an online survey website to participating schools. Data was then collected and analyzed. Seven research questions attempted to answer questions from the actual surveys using three researcher-added independent <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> subscale <b>breakdown</b> scores. The intent of this meta-analysis was to help clarify and add to the existing depth of knowledge. A variety of statistical analyses were used to determine if differences existed between the independent variables relating to summary statistics, significances, <b>and</b> subs-scale <b>breakdown.</b> The three independent variables, added by this researcher, in many cases show differences in perceptions <b>and</b> subscale <b>breakdown</b> information. The main findings of this study indicate: 1. Gender of principal influences teacher perceptions. 2. Teacher Years of Experience influences their perceptions. 3.

Students of Arab politics are consequently examining how the Arab world fits with existing democratic transition paradigms. The main causal variables used in these paradigms pertain to domestic dynamics, however. Yet post authoritarian regime breakdown dynamics in the Arab world underscore the role of external variables in subsequent democratic transitions. Taking Libya and Bahrain as case studies, this thesis unpacks the role of these external variables. It takes external dynamics as the independent <b>variable</b> <b>and,</b> concomitantly, regime <b>breakdown</b> or maintenance as the dependent variable. A number of indicators are operationalized in a comparative examination of the two cases. The thesis argues that external dynamics are a double-edged sword: they play a determining role in Arab Spring uprisings, either in the direction of authoritarian regime breakdown or persistence. 1 bound copy: xiv, 84 leaves; 31 cm.

40|$|Adults {{who have}} not {{developed}} effective communication skills are at {{an increased risk of}} having unsuccessful relationships. Children of divorce are less likely to have communication behaviors modeled to them, resulting in undeveloped communication and therefore a higher likelihood to get divorced themselves. The purpose of this quantitative quasi-experimental study was to determine if there was an association between the successful transition to emerging adulthood and the development of communication behaviors among adults. The research question focused on whether successful transition through emerging adulthood positively discriminates communication patterns among adults, specifically using Gottman 2 ̆ 7 s framework of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse when controlling for gender and level of education. The sample consisted of 30 participants ages 25 to 30 years old, recruited from university participant pools. Arnett 2 ̆ 7 s definition of successful transition into adulthood (accepting responsibility for one 2 ̆ 7 s actions, independent beliefs, financial independence) was operationalized to collect data for the predictor variable. The Four Horsemen Questionnaire was used to garner data for the continuous dependent variable (maladaptive communication patterns). An analysis of variance indicated a significant relationship between maladaptive communication patterns and the transition into adulthood. Findings contribute to social change by helping emerging adults understand the impact of a successful transition into adulthood on communication behaviors. Using the developmental period of emerging adulthood to improve communication patterns may assist in mitigating divorce risk <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> relationship <b>breakdowns...</b>|$|R
40|$|Strength-duration curves for space-clamped squid axons, using {{square wave}} anode breaks as stimuli, {{established}} {{the existence of}} four distinct regions. For the average experimental axon {{the intersection of the}} first two regions, τ 1, occurs at about 7 msec. This agrees with computations based on the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) equations and corresponds to the accommodation time constant found previously for a linearly rising ramp, as given by the HH equations and as found experimentally. The second break in the curve, τ 2, at about 200 msec, and the third break, τ 3, at 1 sec, are far beyond the range of the HH equations and may be the counterpart in the excitability of the long time constants, which have been apparent from a number of other types of experiments. The regions of the curve before 1 msec and beyond 2 or 3 sec are quite <b>variable</b> <b>and</b> may represent <b>breakdown.</b> Rheobase increases in both experimental and computed axons when temperature is raised. In both experimental and computed axons τ 1 descreases slightly when the temperature is raised from 10 to 15 °C. At 20 and 25 °C, τ 1 of the experimental axon increases markedly...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{impurity}} particles on <b>variable</b> frequency pre-breakdown <b>and</b> <b>breakdown</b> behaviour of {{transformer oil}} has been investigated. Two types of particles were considered, those which were naturally {{present in the}} oil and those which were added, such as conducting copper and nonconducting selenium and silicon particles. Above a threshold stress and below a critical stress the particles formed bridges at frequencies between 20 Hz and 1000 Hz, when the gap length was below 1. 5 mm. The stress required for bridge formation depended on gap and frequency. Bridges sometimes contributed to bubble formation and spurious sparks, which occasionally led to a fully developed breakdown. However, if the stress was increased above the critical value the gap was cleared of particles <b>and</b> <b>breakdown</b> did not occur over a range of stresses higher than that at which spurious sparks have been observed. The breakdown strength {{as a function of}} frequency was dependent on the type and size of particles present in the liquid and on the gap setting. It was also found to depend on the gap used for conditioning the samples. Added particles lowered the breakdown strength at all frequencies and for highly purified liquid samples the breakdown strength was found to be less dependent on frequency. A post-breakdown glow discharge was observed at gaps greater than 200 microns and frequencies higher than 200 Hz. In the light of the pre-breakdown experimental results a mathematical model for the bridge formation process has been put forward. In this model the relaxation effect of the ion atmosphere of the oscillating particles which are considered as dipoles and Bjerknes' hydrodynamic forces are regarded as mainly responsible for controlling the activity of particles in oil subjected to electric stress...|$|R

40|$|The {{cross-country}} growth literature commonly uses aggregate economy datasets {{such as the}} Penn World Table (PWT) {{to estimate}} homogeneous production function or convergence regression models. Against the background of a dual economy framework this paper investigates the potential bias arising when aggregate economy data instead of sectoral data is adopted in macro production function regressions. Using a unique World Bank dataset we estimate production functions in agriculture and manufacturing for a panel of 41 developing and developed countries (1963 - 1992). We employ novel empirical methods which can accommodate technology heterogeneity, <b>variable</b> nonstationarity <b>and</b> the <b>breakdown</b> of the standard crosssection independence assumption. We focus on technology heterogeneity across sectors and countries {{and the potential for}} biased estimates due to aggregation and empirical misspecification, relying on both theory and empirical evidence. Using data for a stylised aggregate economy made up of agricultural and manufacturing sectors we confirm substantial bias in the technology coefficients and thus any total factor productivity measures computed. Our empirical findings imply that sectoral structure is of crucial importance in the analysis of growth and development, thus strengthening the recent revival of research on structural change in development economics...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Because the {{movement}} of stock prices is not only ubiquitous in financial markets but also crucial for investors, extensive {{studies have been done}} to understand the law behind it. In particular, since the financial crisis in 2008, researchers have a more interest in investigating large market volatilities in order to grasp changing market trends. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work, we analyze the breakouts <b>and</b> <b>breakdowns</b> of both the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in the US stock market and the Shanghai Composite Index in the Chinese stock market. The breakout usually represents an ongoing upward trend in technical analysis while the breakdown represents an ongoing downward trend. Based on the renormalization method, we introduce two parameters to quantize breakouts <b>and</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> respectively. We discover scaling behavior, characterized by power-law distributions for both the breakouts <b>and</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in the two financial markets with different power-law exponents, which reflect different market volatilities. In detail, the market volatility for breakdowns is usually larger than that for breakouts. Moreover, as an emerging market, the Chinese stock market has larger market volatilities for both the breakouts <b>and</b> <b>breakdowns</b> than the US stock market (a mature market). Further, the short-term volatilities show similar features for both the US stock market and the Chinese stock market. However, the medium-term volatilities in the US stock market are almost symmetrical for the breakouts <b>and</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> whereas those in the Chinese stock market appear to be asymmetrical for the breakouts <b>and</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The methodology presented here provides a way to understand scaling and hence volatilities of breakouts <b>and</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in stock price dynamics. Our findings not only reveal the features of market volatilities but also make a comparison between mature and emerging financial markets...|$|R
