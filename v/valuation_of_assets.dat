5|$|On 16 December 1908, {{less than}} a week after the {{committee}} made its announcement, the six towns informed the committee that an agreement had been reached and that a differential rating system for the next 20 years had been settled on. No <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> would be undertaken and that each town was responsible for discharging any outstanding loans as of 31 December 1907. At this point the committee redrafted the bill according to the terms agreed by the towns and it was passed by the House of Lords on 19 December 1908. Returned to the House of Commons the bill was passed by the Commons the same day, with Royal Assent being received on 21 December 1908. The Local Government Provisional Order (No. 3) Confirmation Act (8 Edw. 7 c.clxiv) came into force on 31 March 1910 with the new council consisting of 78 councillors representing 26 wards. The new council as one of their first actions voted Cecil Wedgwood to be the first mayor of the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent. Wedgwood had previously been appointed acting mayor (primarily to act as returning officer for the first municipal elections) by the Local Government Board. So as not to show bias towards any of the six town halls, the council held its inaugural meeting at the North Stafford Hotel. On 1 July 1925 the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent became the City of Stoke-on-Trent under letters patent from King George V dated 5 June 1925.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} governance standards are rights vote for {{who is on the}} board of directors for investors of labour and capital. A Draft Fifth Company Law Directive proposed in 1972, which would have required EU-wide rights for employees to vote for boards stalled mainly because it attempted to require two-tier board structures, although most EU member states have codetermination today with unified boards. The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 requires shareholders be able to make proposals, ask questions at meetings, vote by proxy and vote through intermediaries. This has become increasingly important as most company shares are held by institutional investors (primarily asset managers or banks, depending on the member state) who are holding [...] "other people's money". A large proportion of this money comes from employees and other people saving for retirement, but who do not have an effective voice. Unlike Switzerland after a 2013 people's initiative, or the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act 2010 in relation to brokers, the EU has not yet prevented intermediaries casting votes without express instructions of beneficiaries. This concentrates power into a small number of financial institutions, and creates the potential for conflicts of interest where financial institutions sell retirement, banking or products to companies in which they cast votes with other people's money. A series of rights for ultimate investors exist in the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003. This requires duties of disclosure in how a retirement fund is run, funding and insurance to guard against insolvency, but not yet that voting rights are only cast on the instructions of investors. By contrast, the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009 does suggest that investors in a mutual fund or ("collective investment scheme") should control the voting rights. The UCITS Directive 2009 is primarily concerned with creating a [...] "passport". If a firm complies with rules on authorisation, and governance of the management and investment companies in an overall fund structure, it can sell its shares in a collective investment scheme across the EU. This forms a broader package of Directives on securities and financial market regulation, much of which has been shaped by experience in the banking crisis of 2007–08. Additional rules on remuneration practices, separating depositary bodies in firms from management and investment companies, and more penalties for violations were inserted in 2014. These measures are meant to decrease the risk to investors that an investment goes insolvent. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 applies to other businesses selling financial instruments. It requires similar authorisation procedures to have a [...] "passport" [...] to sell in any EU country, and transparency of financial contracts through duties to disclose material information about products being sold, including disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with clients. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011 applies to firms with massive quantities of capital, over €100million, essentially hedge funds and private equity firms. Similarly, it requires authorisation to sell products EU wide, and then basic transparency requirements on products being sold, requirements in remuneration policies for fund managers that are perceived to reduce [...] "risk" [...] or make pay [...] "performance" [...] related. They do not, however, require limits to pay. There are general prohibitions on conflicts of interest, and specialised prohibitions on asset stripping. The Solvency II Directive 2009 is directed particularly at insurance firms, requiring minimum capital and best practices in <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets,</b> again to avoid insolvency. The Capital Requirements Directives contain analogous rules, with a similar goals, for banks. To administer the new rules, the European System of Financial Supervision was established in 2011, and consists of three main branches: the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, the European Banking Authority in London and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in Frankfurt.|$|E

The theoretical section includes a treatise on the status <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> (human capital) within the intellectual capital and the absence <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> in the financial statements which are coming to the conclusion that human assets should be incorporated as a separate item in net operating <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> the enterprise in DCF and EVA valuation methods. The dissertation analyzes various definitions of human capital and subsequently on the basis of specific design requirements derives definition <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> for the purposes <b>of</b> business <b>valuation.</b> The experimental section provides descriptions and analyzes of available methods/models for human assets (human capital) valuation. Subsequently, the derived modified income approach valuation for the direct <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> includes proposals for an allocation of revenues attributable to human <b>assets,</b> an incorporation <b>of</b> the quality element <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> assessment to a forecast of future revenues which are attributable to human assets and the specific discount rate for human assets. In the framework <b>of</b> indirect <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> (in DCF and EVA methods), the attention is aimed to a design of variant options of financial value <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> incorporation into the net operating assets (among others, these part also contains a proposal of a theoretical basis for determining <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> market value) and adjustments of economic reports: net operatig assets (NOA) and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT). The variant incorporation <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> into the NOA is analysed especially for the purpose of finding out changes in the distribution of the enterprise value between NOA and market value added and changes in the profitability of the invested capital compared to the situation when no financial value <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> is incorporated into the NOA. The final section is focused to a proposal of recommendations for human assets valuation. The recommendations include a part for the direct <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> (cost and revenue approach) and the indirect <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> human <b>assets</b> through DCF and EVA valuation methods...|$|R
