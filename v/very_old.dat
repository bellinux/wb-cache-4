5|$|A {{number of}} changes can occur to {{mitochondria}} during the aging process. Tissues from elderly patients show {{a decrease in}} enzymatic activity of the proteins of the respiratory chain. However, mutated mtDNA can only be found in about 0.2% of <b>very</b> <b>old</b> cells. Large deletions in the mitochondrial genome have been hypothesized to lead {{to high levels of}} oxidative stress and neuronal death in Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes <b>very</b> <b>old</b> museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede's {{surface is}} a mix of two types of terrain: <b>very</b> <b>old,</b> highly cratered, dark regions and {{somewhat}} younger (but still ancient), lighter regions marked with an extensive array of grooves and ridges. The dark terrain, which comprises about one-third of the surface, contains clays and organic materials that could indicate the composition of the impactors from which Jovian satellites accreted.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is {{generally}} mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. Half of cases go away in 10days and 90% in 15days. Severe complications, if they occur, are {{usually in the}} <b>very</b> <b>old,</b> the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} <b>very</b> <b>old</b> public houses, {{which have been}} {{continuously}} open, such as the Golden Cross in Princess Street, the Dun Cow in Abbey Foregate, and the King's Head in Mardol. The Golden Cross is reputed to be the oldest licensed public house in Shrewsbury and records show that it {{was used as an}} inn as far back as 1428. Its original name was the Sextry, because it was originally the sacristy of Old St Chad's Church.|$|E

5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the <b>very</b> <b>old</b> and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the <b>very</b> <b>old</b> (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the Russian flu.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} the Earth rotates is <b>very</b> <b>old,</b> dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E

5|$|Florence at {{the time}} of Leonardo's youth was the centre of Christian Humanist thought and culture. Leonardo {{commenced}} his apprenticeship with Verrocchio in 1466, the year that Verrocchio's master, the great sculptor Donatello, died. The painter Uccello, whose early experiments with perspective were to influence the development of landscape painting, was a <b>very</b> <b>old</b> man. The painters Piero della Francesca and Filippo Lippi, sculptor Luca della Robbia, and architect and writer Leon Battista Alberti were in their sixties. The successful artists of the next generation were Leonardo's teacher Verrocchio, Antonio del Pollaiuolo and the portrait sculptor Mino da Fiesole, whose lifelike busts give the most reliable likenesses of Lorenzo Medici's father Piero and uncle Giovanni.|$|E
5|$|For the French Byzantinologist Gilbert Dagron, Philip's Christianity is a legend—albeit a <b>very</b> <b>old</b> one—that intended, in a Late Roman/Early Byzantine context, {{to foster}} {{the idea of a}} Roman Empire that was Christian almost from the beginning, thereby melding Roman Imperial {{ideology}} and Christianism, and therefore offering a base for other later legends showing Roman emperors, beginning with Augustus , to be aware and/or sympathetic to Christian revelation, forming a legendary corpus that was brought together during the 6th century by the chronicler John Malalas.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the <b>very</b> <b>old</b> have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E

5|$|Nettlecombe Park is {{important}} for its lichen flora. Records suggest this site has been wood pasture or parkland for at least 400 years. There are some <b>very</b> <b>old</b> oak pollards which may be of this age or older. The oldest standard trees are over 200 years of age. The continuity of open woodland and parkland, with large mature and over-mature timber, has enabled characteristic species of epiphytic lichens and beetles to become established and persist. Many of the species in the park are now nationally scarce because this type of habitat has been eliminated over large areas of Great Britain. The park was notified as an SSSI in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eight}} or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula echo) of Mauritius has survived. The others {{probably}} all became extinct {{due to a}} combination of excessive hunting and deforestation. The cause and date of extinction for the Mascarene parrot itself is uncertain. In 1834, the German zoologist and author Carl Wilhelm Hahn published an often-cited account of a live Mascarene parrot in the possession of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The bird must have been <b>very</b> <b>old</b> at the time, and Hahn claimed an accompanying illustration was drawn after this specimen. The IUCN Red List accepts the 1834 account as the last mention of a live specimen.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the Mérens is closely linked to its {{homeland}} in the Pyrenees, {{as evidenced by the}} many myths and legends in which it plays a role. The origins of the Mérens are <b>very</b> <b>old,</b> and are commonly said to be lost in the mists of time. It is native to the upper valley of Ariege, near Andorra. The direct ancestor of the Mérens was probably in this valley during the Quaternary Period, approximately 15,000 years ago.

5|$|The {{idea that}} matter {{is made up}} of {{discrete}} units is a <b>very</b> <b>old</b> one, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation. Because of this, they could not convince everybody, so atomism was but {{one of a number of}} competing theories on the nature of matter. It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, as the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that could easily be explained using the concept of atoms.|$|E
