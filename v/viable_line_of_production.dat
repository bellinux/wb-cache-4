The main aim is to apply a methodology based in the principles and techniques of the lean manufacturing in order to improve the productivity in the process of plastic pipes manufacturing. To accomplish this aim, the problems presented in the manufacturing process were identified through an interview to the manager of the factory, selecting and prioritizing the problems to be eliminated or minimized.

50|$|The fifth {{condition}} for successful economic calculation is {{the existence of}} well functioning financial markets. Economic efficiency depends heavily upon avoiding errors in capital investment. The costs of reversing errors in capital investment are potentially large. This {{is not just a}} matter of rearranging or converting capital goods that are found to be of little use. The time spent reconfiguring the structure <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is time lost in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> consumer goods. Those who plan capital investment must anticipate future trends in consumer demand if they are to avoid investing too much in some <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and too little in other <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|R

Marginal utility theory predicts that a {{relatively}} high rate of profit attracts further investment, but each additional unit <b>of</b> <b>production</b> will generally tend to be of less utility (and therefore less value) to the market, causing the overall rate of profit to fall absent any technological innovation increasing productivity. The commodity in question will lose its appeal to investors, who will then invest in other, newer <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> offering higher returns.|$|R

Maintenance systems have improved a lot in recent years. Reliability Centered Maintenance {{has been one of the}} latest technologies in maintenance to which the world is turning. This technology has different indicators and all of the industries use them to compare similar units or periods, and also they use the results of these indicators for taking maintenance decisions.

The activities of entrepreneurs make prices more accurate {{in terms of how}} they represent the marginal utility of consumers. Prices act as guides to the planning <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Those who plan production use prices to decide which <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> should be expanded or curtailed.|$|R
