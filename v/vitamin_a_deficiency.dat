5|$|The {{value of}} eating a certain food to {{maintain}} health was recognized long before vitamins were identified. The ancient Egyptians knew that feeding liver {{to a person}} may help with night blindness, an illness now known {{to be caused by}} a <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The advancement of ocean voyages during the Renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and made illnesses from vitamin deficiency common among ships' crews.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{can occur}} {{as either a}} primary or a {{secondary}} deficiency. A primary <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency</b> occurs among children and adults who do not consume an adequate intake of provitamin A carotenoids from fruits and vegetables or preformed vitamin A from animal and dairy products.

25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{is common}} in {{developing}} countries but rarely seen in developed countries.

50|$|As the retinal {{component}} of rhodopsin {{is derived from}} <b>vitamin</b> <b>A,</b> <b>a</b> <b>deficiency</b> of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> causes a deficit in the pigment needed by rod cells. Consequently, fewer rod cells are able to sufficiently respond in darker conditions, and as the cone cells are poorly adapted for sight in the dark, blindness can result. This is night-blindness.|$|R

25|$|Golden rice is {{a variety}} of rice (Oryza sativa) {{produced}} through genetic engineering to biosynthesize beta-carotene, <b>a</b> precursor of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A,</b> in the edible parts of rice. It is intended to produce a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a shortage of dietary <b>vitamin</b> <b>A,</b> <b>a</b> <b>deficiency</b> which is estimated to kill 670,000 {{children under the age}} of 5 each year. Rice is a staple food crop for over half of the world's population, making up 30–72% of the energy intake for people in Asian countries, making it the perfect crop for targeting vitamin deficiencies.|$|R

25|$|Since carotenes are hydrophobic, {{sufficient}} fat must {{be present}} in the diet for golden rice (or most other vitamin A supplements) to alleviate <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency.</b> <b>Vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency</b> is usually coupled to an unbalanced diet (see also Vandana Shiva's arguments below). Moreover, this claim referred to an early cultivar of golden rice; one bowl of the latest version provides 60% of RDA for healthy children.

50|$|Zambia {{is one of}} 22 African {{countries}} with the highest burden of undernutrition in children under five, and Micronutrient deficiencies are common in Zambian children, as <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are present in 54% of children under 5, and anemia in 53%. A child’s nutritional status is influenced by access to food, care, and health, and poor feeding practices combined with illnesses such as intestinal parasites, diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and HIV/AIDS cause this high burden of undernutrition. Improving the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in mothers will help to improve the nutritional issues present in children and infants.|$|R
25|$|It is {{not just}} the total amount of {{calories}} that matters but specific nutritional deficiencies such as <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency,</b> iron deficiency or zinc deficiency can also increase risk of death.|$|E

25|$|Retinal {{dysplasia}} is an {{eye disease}} affecting the retina.

25|$|The major {{nutritional}} {{problems in}} slums are protein-energy malnutrition (PEM), <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency</b> (VAD), {{iron deficiency anemia}} (IDA) and iodine deficiency disorders (IDD).

25|$|Secondary <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency</b> is {{associated}} with chronic malabsorption of lipids, impaired bile production and release, and chronic exposure to oxidants, such as cigarette smoke, and chronic alcoholism. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin and depends on micellar solubilization for dispersion into the small intestine, which results in poor use of vitamin A from low-fat diets. Zinc deficiency can also impair absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin A because {{it is essential for}} the synthesis of the vitamin A transport proteins and as the cofactor in conversion of retinol to retinal. In malnourished populations, common low intakes of vitamin A and zinc increase the severity of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency</b> and lead physiological signs and symptoms of deficiency. A study in Burkina Faso showed major reduction of malaria morbidity with combined vitamin A and zinc supplementation in young children.|$|E
25|$|Global {{efforts to}} support {{national}} governments in addressing <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{are led by}} the Global Alliance for Vitamin A (GAVA), which is an informal partnership between A2Z, the Canadian International Development Agency, Helen Keller International, the Micronutrient Initiative, UNICEF, USAID, and the World Bank.

Here we demonstrate that the impaired re-sponses in VAD animals are corrected by a single intranasal application of retinyl palmitate with the vaccine. Results encourage the clinical testing of intranasal <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> supplements to improve protection against respiratory viral disease in VAD populations. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiencies</b> (VADs) and insufficiencies have beenlong-standing problems in the developing and developed worlds, particularly in situations of low socioeconomic status, prematurity, and disease (1, 2). The problem is related in part to poor diets but also to the inability of some individuals to process and transport <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> from the intestinal tract to target tissues. In young children, liver stores of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> are low, and in cases of disease, both serum retinol and retinol binding proteins (neces-sary for retinol transport) exist at extremely low concentrations.

40|$|This {{review of}} the micro-nutrient policy process in Zambia serves as a {{companion}} piece to two parallel studies in Malawi and South Africa. All three studies employ the Kaleidoscope Model of policy change to trace the causal forces leading to key micro-nutrient policy decisions {{in each of the}} three countries. After outlining the overall micronutrient policy process in Zambia, the study focuses on policy decisions affecting three micro-nutrients – iodine, iron and <b>Vitamin</b> <b>A.</b> Although iodine <b>deficiency</b> has dropped precipitously as a result of Zambia’s salt iodization mandate, progress in combatting iron and <b>Vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiencies</b> has proven more difficult. As a result, micro-nutrient policies have changed over time, in an effort to find effective tools for combatting these lingering micro-nutrient deficiencies and the considerable health risks they impose. The analysis in this paper traces the evolution of policies adopted through multiple iterations beginning in 1978 and running through to the present time. To supplement the voluminous published and grey literature on micro-nutrient status and policies in Zambia, the research team conducted semi-structured interviews with several dozen policy stakeholders in Zambia in June and July 2015 using a standardized interview guideWorking paperNon-PRIFPRI 2 DGO; PHN...|$|R
25|$|Vitamin A {{deficiencies}} generally {{occur as}} a result of fat-soluble vitamins deficiencies.

In these procedures, fat absorption is markedly impaired. There is also the possibility of a <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency</b> with use of the weight-loss medication orlistat (marketed as Xenical and Alli).|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency</b> in developing countries, there are efforts to produce genetically modified rice rich in β-carotene.

25|$|Contrary {{to earlier}} observations, recent studies {{emerging}} from some developing countries (India, Bangladesh and Indonesia) have strongly suggested that in populations in which <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> <b>deficiency</b> is common and maternal mortality is high, dosing expectant mothers can greatly reduce the maternal mortality rate. Similarly, dosing newborn infants with 50,000 IU (15mg) of vitamin A within 2 days of birth, can significantly reduce neonatal mortality.|$|E
