50|$|Prior {{to opening}} of the aortic valve, the red blood cells (erythrocytes) assume a random {{orientation}} (there is no blood flow in the aorta). When the electric current is applied from the outer electrodes, the current must circumference these red blood cells, therefore resulting in a higher <b>voltage</b> <b>measurement,</b> and thus, a lower conductivity. Shortly after aortic valve opening, the pulsatile blood flow forces the red blood cells to align in parallel with the blood flow. When the electric current is then applied, {{it is able to}} easily pass the red blood cells in the aorta resulting in a lower voltage, and thus, a higher conductivity. The change from random orientation to alignment of red blood cells upon opening of aortic valve generates a characteristic steep increase of conductivity or dZ(t) (corresponding to a steep decrease of impedance) - beat to beat.|$|E
50|$|SOC or State {{of charge}} is the {{equivalent}} of a fuel gauge for a battery.

Most SOC methods take into account voltage and current as well as temperature and other aspects of the discharge and charge process to in essence count up or down within a pre-defined capacity of a pack. More complex state of charge estimation systems take into account the Peukert effect which relates the capacity of the battery to the discharge rate.|$|E

Method We propose {{the use of a}} synchronized 3 D and 2 D view. In 3 D, the catheter will be guided optimally by assessing 3 D scar characteristics and its relation to the ventricular anatomy. In 2 D, a detailed assessment of the tissue can be made. We developed several 3 D visualization techniques, including volume rendering of the scar and myocardial surfaces colored according to the <b>voltage</b> <b>measurements.</b> We also visualized context structures in the heart. For the 2 D view, we proposed showing three adjacent slices simultaneously. To link the 3 D with the 2 D view, we added a linking plane and linking contours; the slice level shown in the 2 D view is indicated in the 3 D view. Results We evaluated our method via a case study during which we simulated the visual environment of an ablation procedure. The MRI-based volume rendering of scar tissue and the linking between the 3 D and 2 D views were both positively received.

An active power-line conditioner is a power electronic device {{which is designed to}} su. ppress the power-line distortions caused by the non-linear loads. Currently, the method of instantaneous power transformation is the most popular one for the active power-line conditioning control. This method uses the measurements of the power-line voltage and current to estimate the required harmonic compensation The method requires many hardware for the measurements and many computations. The high accuracy hardware for measurements are costly and many computations can introduce truncation errors. Also, this method is sensitive to the power-line <b>voltage</b> <b>measurements</b> and may introduce control errors [l]. A new simple transformation method is developed to overcome the:se difficulties. This control computes the correct harmonic compensation using the power-line current measurement only.
