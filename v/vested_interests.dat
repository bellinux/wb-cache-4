Russia had more <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea. Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain a grip on Georgia.|$|E

50|$|Various {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> on attitude strengths. In one such study, Crano and Sivacek visited a university in Michigan and gathered the results of a proposed drinking-age referendum. The referendum sought to increase the legal drinking age from 18 to 21. The respondents were divided into three categories: 1. high <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> (those who would be significantly and immediately affected as a result of the referendum), 2. low <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> (those who would be unaffected by the law change at the time of its inception), and 3. moderate <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> (those who fell between the first two extremes). Although 80% of the subjects were opposed to the referendum, their respective levels of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> clearly indicated that the strength of their attitudes significantly affected their resultant behaviors. Half of the highly <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> groups joined the anti-referendum campaign, but only a quarter of the moderately <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> group and an eighth of the low <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> group joined the campaign. These results support Crano's theory of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> and reinforce the implications and considerations of stake, salience, certainty, immediacy, and self-efficacy discussed above. It also proves the correlation between <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> and action, based on what level of involvement the three types of students were willing to participate in.|$|R
40|$|The <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> {{construct}} {{suggests that}} people act in attitudinally consistent ways on important issues of high hedonic relevance. Accordingly, vested individuals should endorse policies {{consistent with their}} attitudes. Symbolic politics holds self-interest unrelated to attitude and thus of little use. Three secondary analyses of national election data assessed the predictive utility of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> on policy-related issues. Consistent with expectations, Analysis 1 found <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> to be unrelated to policy endorsement. However, Analysis 2 disclosed that <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> significantly moderated attitude–endorsement consistency on beliefs regarding busing, health insurance, and government-guaranteed living standards. Analysis 3 investigated <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> effects across three national election surveys and six policy issues. Without exception, <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> significantly moderated the relationship between attitudes and policy endorsement. These results, obtained across {{a broad range of}} topics and respondents, suggest that <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> is an important moderator of consistency between attitudes and policy endorsement. © 2001 Elsevier Science (USA) Coinciding with the development of dual process models of attitude change in social psychology is the complementary consideration of the effect of personal relevance on the behavioral expression of attitudes and on attitude–criterio...|$|R
50|$|Crano {{conducted}} {{another study}} {{to prove that}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> may affect people's belief {{that a majority of}} a population will support their attitude on an issue. This bias is known as false-consensus or assumed-consensus effect. Under the guise of a public opinion survey, Crano created high and low <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> groups by identifying whether upper- or lower-classmen would pay a surcharge to subsidize lost funding from the government. The class who was selected to pay the surcharge had a high degree of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> while the student body not required to pay exhibited a lower degree of <b>vested</b> <b>interest.</b> The study then determined the participants estimate of what percentage of the student body would support their beliefs regardless of impact. Crano found that <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> influenced assumed consensus and students believed {{that a majority of the}} university's population would support their plight even though only half would be affected.|$|R

25|$|Veblen {{generalized}} {{the conflict}} between businessmen and engineers by saying that human society would always involve conflict between existing norms with <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> and new norms developed out of an innate human tendency to manipulate and learn about the physical {{world in which we}} exist. He also generalized his model to include his theory of instincts, processes of evolution as absorbed from Sumner, as enhanced by his own reading of evolutionary science, and pragmatic philosophy first learned from Peirce. The instinct of idle curiosity led humans to manipulate nature in new ways and this led to changes in what he called the material means of life. Because, as per the pragmatists, our ideas about the world are a human construct rather than mirrors of reality, changing ways of manipulating nature lead to changing constructs and to changing notions of truth and authority as well as patterns of behavior (institutions). Societies and economies evolve as a consequence, but do so via a process of conflict between <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> and older forms and the new. Veblen never wrote with any confidence that the new ways were better ways, but he was sure in the last three decades of his life that the American economy could, in the absence of <b>vested</b> <b>interests,</b> have produced more for more people. In the years just after World War I he looked to engineers to make the American economy more efficient.|$|E
25|$|Some people, {{including}} Steven M. Greer, {{have expressed}} cynicism {{that the general}} public might not be informed {{in the event of}} a genuine discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence due to significant <b>vested</b> <b>interests.</b> Some, such as Bruce Jakosky have also argued that the official disclosure of extraterrestrial life may have far reaching and as yet undetermined implications for society, particularly for the world's religions.|$|E
50|$|The {{respondents}} were grouped {{into the same}} three categories as the drinking age study: high, moderate, and low <b>vested</b> <b>interest.</b> The study found that those with {{the highest levels of}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> were significantly more inclined to take action based on their attitudes concerning the issue; that is, their resultant behaviors (signing the petition, joining the group, pledging multiple hours with the group) occurred much more consistently and prevalently than that of the other two <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> groups.|$|R
5000|$|There are two philosophies {{about the}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> of the {{inspectors}} {{in the product}} under review. On one hand, project personnel who have a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> in the work product under review have the most knowledge of the product and are motivated to find and fix defects. On the other hand, personnel from outside the projectwho {{do not have a}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> in the work product bring objectivity and a fresh viewpoint to the technical peer review team.|$|R
50|$|The {{factor to}} {{consider}} with <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> and its application towards attitude-consistent actions is attitude importance. Attitude (or issue) importance concerns not only matters of personal consequence, but also matters of national or international interest. While {{both of these}} can fall in line with each other, <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> and attitude importance are not the same. For example, consider the plight of an African nation that has been ravaged by an influenza epidemic. Although an individual in America may consider this objectively important, because of the low probability of personal consequence—i.e., <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> — his resultant behavior may not be indicative of his attitude towards the epidemic. In other words, since the issue is of little hedonic relevance to the perceiver, the amount of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> is low, and is therefore unlikely to produce attitude-consistent actions. Geographic distance and cultural differences are also a factor in attitude importance. Tragic circumstances {{halfway around the world}} or shocking behaviors by members of a culture different from the perceiver, will most likely never result in attitude change. The physical distance or cultural difference of an occurrence directly correlates to the <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> of the perceiver. Things too far away or customs perceived to be too strange will almost never trigger a <b>vested</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Vested</b> <b>interest</b> theory (VIT), first {{investigated}} {{on environmental}} risk, {{suggests that the}} hedonic relevance of an attitude object moderates relations between attitudes, intentions, and responses to danger. Emphasizing <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> may maximize impacts of risk communications. Study 1 (N= 215) assessed differences between inhabitants of two flood-risk areas in Italy on past experience, risk perceptions, concerns, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Objectively, higher risk areas' residents reported more experience, and greater perceived risk and concern, while no preparedness differences were found (both at "between cities" and "within city" levels). Study 2 (N= 444) looked at the moderating role of VIT-based risk communication messages {{on the relationship between}} <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> and behavioral intentions. Components of <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> moderate attitude-intention consistency, suggesting a new method of developing effective risk announcements. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

5000|$|The concept called <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> by Crano {{is called}} self-interest by Sears (1997). It seems that [...] "self-interest" [...] {{is the more}} widely {{recognized}} term. Self-interest involves either perceived or actual personal consequences. That is, Crano (1997) argues that <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> involves perceived personal consequences (p. 490), while Sears (1997, a critique of Crano) counter-argues that Crano's survey experiments define it objectively. Crano argues that <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> should have a moderating effect on attitudes. Sears argues that, actually, evidence for this is conflicting: The survey literature has rarely found significant effects of self-interest, while the experimental literature finds significant effects. The literature is concerned with salience only marginally; it is actually about strength of attitudes (i.e. how well they correlate with behavior). It is about salience inasmuch as anything [...] "strong" [...] is [...] "salient".|$|R
25|$|Many {{local and}} {{national}} governments have, for political interests, subverted efforts to remove, reduce or upgrade slums into better housing options for the poor. Throughout {{the second half of}} the 19th century, for example, French political parties relied on votes from slum population and had <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> in maintaining that voting block. Removal and replacement of slum created a conflict of interest, and politics prevented efforts to remove, relocate or upgrade the slums into housing projects that are better than the slums. Similar dynamics are cited in favelas of Brazil, slums of India, and shanty towns of Kenya.|$|E

But Smith overplayed his hand, and his boisterous rhetoric let Roosevelt isolate his opponents and identify them with the wealthy <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> that opposed the New Deal, strengthening Roosevelt for the 1936 landslide. By contrast, labor unions, energized by the Wagner Act, signed up millions of new members and became a major backer of Roosevelt's reelections in 1936, 1940 and 1944.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Vested</b> <b>{{interest}}</b> is {{the special}} interest in an existing system, arrangement, or institution for particular personal reasons, is a communication theory that seeks to explain how influences affect behavior. As defined by William Crano, <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> refers to the amount that an attitude object is deemed ally relevant by the attitude holder. In Crano's theory of <b>vested</b> <b>interest,</b> he states that [...] "an attitude object that has important perceived personal consequences for the individual will be perceived as highly vested. Highly vested attitudes will be functionally related to behavior". Simply put, when people have more at stake with {{the result of an}} object (like a law or policy) that will greatly affect them, they will behave {{in a way that will}} directly support or defy the object for the sake of their own self-interest.|$|R
