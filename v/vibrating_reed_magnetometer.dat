Experimental results are interpreted within the critical state model. Results deduced from <b>vibrating</b> <b>reed</b> technique are compared with ac susceptibility measurements. It is shown that both techniques give consistent results. The flux lines dynamic in high-Tc superconductors can-be studied using mechanical oscillator experiments [I] or ac susceptibility technique [2, 3]. In tliis paper, <b>vibrating</b> <b>reed</b> measurements on bulk YBa 2 Cu 307 -, polycrystals of different grain sizes are reported, and measurements on one polycrystalline sample using both techniques are compared. Using a critical-state model, important characteristics such as the critical current density and the activation energy associated with flux creep are determined for the intragranular contribution. 1. EXPERIMENTAL Sintered YBa 2 Cu 307 -, samples have been synthetized from oxydes (Y 203 and CuO) and carbonates (BaC 03) by a solid state sintering technique [4]. The three studied samples, have been sintered at 950 °C in air, for three different times, to achieve different grain sizes: 3 - 4 pm (sample I), 12 pm (sample 2) and 20 pm (sample 3).

As the distance between the two electrodes varies, the capacitance also varies and electric charge is forced {{in and out of the}} capacitor. The alternating current signal produced by the flow of this charge is amplified and used as an analogue for the DC voltage applied to the capacitor. The DC input resistance of the electrometer is determined solely by the leakage resistance of the capacitor, and is typically extremely high, (although its AC input impedance is lower).|$|R
