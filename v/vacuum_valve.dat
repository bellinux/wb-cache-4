5000|$|Eric Magnus Campbell Tigerstedt (August 4, 1887 [...] - [...] April 20, 1925) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} inventors in Finland at the beginning of the 20th century and has been called the [...] "Thomas Edison of Finland". He was a pioneer of sound-on-film technology and made significant improvements to the amplification capacity of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>valve.</b> Having seen a showing of the Lumière brothers' new motion picture technology as a 9-year-old boy in Helsinki in 1896, he was inspired to bring sound to silent pictures.|$|E
5000|$|Many years later, in 1914, his {{demonstration}} film Word and Picture {{was presented}} to a gathering of scientific dignitaries in Berlin, but his invention was never commercialised. In addition to improving the triode <b>vacuum</b> <b>valve,</b> he developed directional loudspeakers. Tigerstedt also predicted such future inventions as television and the mobile phone, and in 1917 he filed a patent for {{what he described as}} a [...] "pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone". Tigerstedt was awarded a total of 71 patents in several countries between the years 1912 and 1924.|$|E
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this boiler is that the field tubes are not rigidly {{attached}} to the boiler shell, but merely gasketed into place. The thickened ends of the tubes are formed to a taper and the tubeplate holes are reamed to match. A paper gasket is sufficient to seal the joint. Inspection or removal for replacement is thus simplified. As the boiler is always under greater pressure than the atmosphere, the tubes self-tighten under pressure and avoid leaking. Obviously the boiler must never be placed under vacuum, so a <b>vacuum</b> <b>valve</b> {{may need to be}} provided.|$|E

50|$|Tigerstedt stubbornly {{continued}} {{to grapple with}} the problems of the early vacuum tubes, which were inefficient, expensive and prone to breaking. His German colleagues told him that the vacuum tubes could not be developed further and that there could be no solution to the problem with the weakness of amplification. Tigerstedt, however, {{continued to}} experiment and eventually succeeded in substantially improving on the design of Lee De Forest, achieving much greater amplification than that of the original valves. Tigerstedt also patented his improvement of the triode <b>vacuum</b> <b>valve,</b> which consisted of improving the amplification by rearranging the electrodes cylindrically in the tube, changing the glass mold to prevent vacuum loss and using steel mirrors inside the tubes to prevent electrostatic interference. He had finally solved the most difficult practical problems of talking movies. It is worth noting that his achievement was purely experimental, as there were no prior experiments or mathematical models that he could have followed.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a novel rf waveguide <b>vacuum</b> <b>valve</b> is presented. The rf design {{is based on the}} use of TE 0 n modes of circular waveguides. In the device, the TE 01 mode at the input is converted into a mixture of several TE 0 n modes which provide low-loss rf power transmission across the <b>vacuum</b> <b>valve</b> gap, these modes are then converted back into the TE 01 mode at the output. There are a number of advantages associated with the absence of surface fields in the region of the valve: • Possibility to use commercially available vacuum valves equipped with two specially designed mode converter sections. • No necessity for an rf contact between these two sections. • Increased potential for high power rf transmission. This technology can be used for all frequencies for which vacuum waveguides are used. In rectangular waveguides, mode converters from the operating mode into the TE 01 mode and back again are necessary. Experimental results for the 30 GHz valves developed for the CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF 3) are presented showing in particular that the rf power transmission losses are below 1 %. The rf waveguide <b>vacuum</b> <b>valve</b> installed in CTF 3 has been tested with high power and is now in routine operation at power levels up to 40 MW and pulse length of 70 ns...|$|E
40|$|A Penning trap {{experiment}} for {{the determination}} of the g-factor of the bound electron in heavy highly-charged ions, ALPHATRAP, is under construction at the Max-Planck-Institute in Heidelberg MPIK. As a part of this experiment, a <b>vacuum</b> <b>valve</b> and an electromechanical switch were constructed and tested. ALPHATRAP will be connected to an electron-beam ion trap (EBIT) via a room temperature beam-line. Since trapping of highly-charged ions requires extremely good vacuum, in excess of 10 - 15 mbar, the external flow of the background gas from the room-temperature beam-line has to be reduced significantly. Therefore, a cryogenic <b>vacuum</b> <b>valve</b> was developed, which enables adequate storage times. The valve is manually actuated, and operates at cryogenic temperatures as well as in strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, for the image-current detection electronics a cryogenic electromechanical switch was developed. The switch is actuated by a piezoelectric element. Advantages compared to semiconductor devices are negligible leakage currents for the switch being in open position and negligible dielectric losses. The switch is designed as a single-pole single-throw switch and has a residual resistance of only 11 m. The designs and test results of the devices are presented...|$|E

40|$|Wake fields excited {{in a small}} gap of {{a vacuum}} chamber by ampere beams can have enough {{amplitude}} to heat the chamber. The electric component of these fields can be above the arcing limit. Usually flange connections in a vacuum chamber contain a vacuum gasket and an inner RF gasket. If a small gap occurs between the RF gasket and flange surface, wake fields can heat the flanges. The flanges are usually made of stainless steel, which efficiently absorbs RF power. Some flanges consist of two parts (like a <b>vacuum</b> <b>valve</b> flange) and are mechanically connected but have poor thermal contact. A temperature rise can lengthen the inner part of the flange and make firmer the thermal contact to the outer part of the flange. The heat will then flow to the outer part of the flange, which is air and water-cooled. This cooling lowers the flange temperature and the thermal contact becomes poor again. This “quasi ” periodic mechanism can explain the nature of temperature oscillations observed at several locations in PEP-II, the SLAC B-factory...|$|E
