One {{of the more popular}} stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this in turn results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti6Al4V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products <b>via</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> is currently much more economically competitive.|$|E

40|$|Herein, we {{describe}} {{a technique that}} facilitates percutaneous vascular access when the traditional method of achieving access is unsuccessful. For multiple reasons, gaining access to small vessels in pediatric patients is sometimes difficult. In instances of atrial, ventricular, or great arterial communications, a wire can be positioned from a vein or artery across the communications into an artery or vein to which access needs to be gained. This wire then serves as a target for vascular access. All pediatric patients who underwent cardiac catheterization at Mattel Children’s Hospi-tal from July 2003 through June 2006, and at Rady Children’s Hospital from July through December 2006, were considered for the wire-target technique when access could not be achieved in vessels of interest <b>via</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>methods.</b> Fifteen wire-target procedures were undertaken in 14 patients (ages, 4 d– 11 yr).
