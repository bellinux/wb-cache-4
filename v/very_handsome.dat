5|$|In 1915, {{at a party}} held in Athens by court marshal Theodore Ypsilantis, Alexander became re-acquainted {{with one}} of his {{childhood}} friends, Aspasia Manos. She had just returned from education in France and Switzerland, and was reckoned as very beautiful by her acquaintances. She was the daughter of Constantine's Master of the Horse, Colonel Petros Manos, and his wife Maria Argyropoulos. The 21-year-old Alexander was smitten, and was so determined to seduce her that he followed her to the island of Spetses where she holidayed that year. Initially, Aspasia was resistant to his charm; although considered <b>very</b> <b>handsome</b> by his contemporaries, Alexander had a reputation as a ladies' man from numerous past liaisons. Despite this, he finally won her over, and the couple were engaged in secret. However, for King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and much of European society of the time, it was inconceivable for a royal prince to marry someone of a different social rank.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though he}} was {{somewhat}} smaller and darker than the blond, blue-eyed Maywald, he looked <b>very</b> <b>handsome</b> in his fur-collared uniform coat and seemed every inch an officer and a gentleman. It never occurred to the newcomers to suspect such a man of being a murderer.|$|E
25|$|This elf is dwarfish in height, though <b>very</b> <b>handsome.</b> He {{explains}} that, at his christening, an offended fairy cursed him to dwarfish height (an {{example of}} the wicked fairy godmother folklore motif), but relented and gave him great beauty as compensation. Alberich features as a dwarf in the Nibelungen; the dwarfish height was thus explained.|$|E

25|$|Dabney Hovse is the {{smallest}} of Caltech's Houses. Residents of Dabney House {{are referred to as}} Darbs, a combination of the name of the House with a 1920s slang term darb, meaning something or someone <b>very</b> <b>handsome,</b> valuable, attractive, or otherwise excellent. Joseph B. Dabney, owner of the Dabney Oil Syndicate, was a trustee of California Institute of Technology. Dabney Hall of the Humanities, a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Dabney, is one of the four corner buildings of Caltech's central courtyard. It was built in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Related, yet {{different}} was {{the notion}} of male beauty. When a boy at young age {{turned out to be}} <b>very</b> <b>handsome,</b> he would be barred from heavy work, instead he would be pampered, his skin rubbed with oils, his hair meticulously taken care of, and so on. The idea was that in this way he would grow up to such a beauty that he would be irresistible to chief's daughters. Then a child of high rank would be born into the family, elevating the status of all.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy {{classified}} {{these ships}} as frigates, as they lacked the torpedo tubes {{needed for a}} destroyer classification. For those used to Admiralty-designed ships the Captains were unfamiliar: they had no break forward of the forecastle but instead had a graceful shear to deck-line from the forecastle to midship, and the Evarts had rakish cowls {{on top of the}} funnels. Those who served on these ships came to view these features as being <b>very</b> <b>handsome.</b> Amongst the differences with British-designed vessels were using bunks instead of hammocks and welds instead of rivets.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{surviving}} myths in which Zephyrus features most prominently is that of Hyacinth. Hyacinth was a <b>very</b> <b>handsome</b> and athletic Spartan prince. Zephyrus {{fell in love with}} him and courted him, and so did Apollo. The two competed for the young man's love, but he chose Apollo, driving Zephyrus mad with jealousy. Later, catching Apollo and Hyacinth throwing a discus, Zephyrus blew a gust of wind at them, striking Hyacinth in the head with the falling discus. When Hyacinth died, Apollo created the hyacinth flower from his blood. Apollo was furious, but Eros protected Zephyrus, as the act was committed in the name of love, on the condition that the wind god served Eros forever.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was born}} to a poor Saskatchewan family but became a {{successful}} amateur wrestler during the 1930s as well as engaging in many other sports. He debuted as a professional wrestler in 1946 for the New York wrestling territory following his serving in the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II. Hart was considered <b>very</b> <b>handsome</b> and a good in-ring performer, focusing on an amateur-like and technical style of wrestling, despite this and being popular in general he was not given major spotlight by the writers and after marrying his wife Helen Smith whom he met in New York, he moved back Canada and created his own promotion which would be known as Stampede Wrestling and took over the surrounding wrestling territory that covered most of western Canada. The territory {{would go on to}} become known as the Stampede territory thenceforth.|$|E
25|$|Her last serious {{love affair}} {{was with the}} Dutch-born actor Lou Tellegen, 37 years her junior, who became her co-star during her second American {{farewell}} tour (and eighth American tour) in 1910. He was a <b>very</b> <b>handsome</b> actor who {{had served as a}} model for sculpture Eternal Springtime by Rodin. He had little acting experience, but Bernhardt signed him as a leading man just before she departed on the tour, assigned him a compartment in her private railway car, and took him as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly good actor, and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles, such as Hippolyte in Phedre, where he could take off his shirt. At the end of the American tour they had a dispute and he remained in the United States while she returned to France. At first, he had a successful career in the United States, and married film actress Geraldine Farrar, but when they split up his career plummeted. He committed suicide in 1934.|$|E

Covered is it now for me with that abounding and interesting life of the generations then to come at the pair of preliminary flourishes ushering in the record of which I thus feel myself still assist.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the injury}} to her leg, she {{continued}} to go on tour every summer, when her own theater in Paris was closed. In June 1908, she made a 20-day tour of Britain and Ireland, performing in 16 different cities. In 1908–1909, she toured Russia and Poland. Her second American farewell tour (her eighth tour in America) began in late 1910. She took along a new leading man, the Dutch-born Lou Tellegen, a <b>very</b> <b>handsome</b> actor who {{had served as a}} model for the sculpture Eternal Springtime by Auguste Rodin, and who became her co-star for the next two years, as well as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly good actor, and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles such as Hippolyte in Phedre, where he could take off his shirt and show off his physique. In New York, she created yet another scandal when she appeared in the role of Judas Iscariot in Judas by the American playwright John Wesley De Kay. It was performed in New York's Globe Theater for only one night in December 1910 before it was banned by local authorities. It was also banned in Boston and Philadelphia. The tour took her to from Boston to Jacksonville, through Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, to Canada and Minnesota, usually one new city and one performance every day.|$|E
25|$|Another myth of {{the origin}} of the games is the story of Pelops, a local Olympian hero. The story of Pelops begins with Oenomaus, the king of Pisa, Greece, who had a {{beautiful}} daughter named Hippodamia. According to an oracle, the king would be killed by her husband. Therefore, he decreed that any young man who wanted to marry his daughter was required to drive away with her in his chariot, and Oenomaus would follow in another chariot, and spear the suitor if he caught up with them. Now, the king's chariot horses were a present from the god Poseidon and were therefore supernaturally fast. Pelops was a <b>very</b> <b>handsome</b> young man and the king's daughter fell in love with him. Before the race, she persuaded her father's charioteer Myrtilus to replace the bronze axle pins of the king's chariot with wax ones. Naturally, during the race, the wax melted and the king fell from his chariot and was killed. At the same time, the king's palace was struck by lightning and reduced to ashes, save for one wooden pillar that was revered in the Altis for centuries, and stood near what was to be the site of the temple of Zeus. Pelops was proclaimed the winner and married Hippodamia. After his victory, Pelops organized chariot races as thanksgiving to the gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the Olympic Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, a local hero, and he gave his name to the Peloponnese.|$|E
