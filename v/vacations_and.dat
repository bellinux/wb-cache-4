5|$|Along with {{purchasing}} specimens, many geologists {{visited her}} to collect fossils or discuss anatomy and classification.

William Buckland, who lectured on geology at the University of Oxford, often visited Lyme on his Christmas <b>vacations</b> <b>and</b> was frequently seen hunting for fossils with Anning. It was to him she made what would prove to be the scientifically important suggestion that the strange conical objects known as bezoar stones, were really the fossilised faeces of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs. Buckland would name the objects coprolites. In 1839 Buckland, Conybeare, and Richard Owen visited Lyme together so that Anning could lead them all on a fossil-collecting excursion.|$|E
