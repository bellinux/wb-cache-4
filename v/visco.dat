40|$|In many {{technical}} systems {{which are}} exposed to dynamic loading (oscillating excitation), it is required to reduce {{the reaction of the}} system Eigen dynamic due to durability, functionality or comfort. A widespread means of the Eigen dynamic reaction redaction is uncoupling/isolating the excitation source from the examined Eigen dynamic and damping of this reaction. For this purpose the elastomer (rubber) mounting is often used. The elastomer material shows a distinct elastic and less viscose behavior. For increasing of viscosity the elastomer is intermixed with, for example, carbon particulate matter. The system operation in <b>viscos</b> mode involves energy dissipation so that oscillation redaction is very efficient. An alternative to the rubber mounting with or without the additives is polymer mounting that exhibits in addition to elastic characteristic a distinctive <b>viscos</b> behavior. The polymer mounting is also convenient to isolating and damping of system oscillation exciting by environment or other technical systems in the neighborhood. Furthermore the viscoelastic material is the base of many smart materials. Thus smart materials mounting are often interest for active application. That is why we pursuit the investigation of mechanical properties of the viscoelastic material. We investigated viscoelastic behavior of polymer mounting at one degree of freedom oscillator in translating mode and estimated the frequency response of this dynamic system. Thereby, the stiffness-damping ratio is varied. We considered a numerical model of the one mass point oscillator with polymer mounting. Due to aperiodic damping behavior, we used to describe of this oscillator the fractional differential formulation. The fractional differential formulation is powerful to represent wide more dynamic behavior than the integer differential formulation. The amplitude and phase plot even depends on the derivative order of terms of the corresponding differential equation. In many cases the formulation by fractional differential equations is not pays off, because the accuracy achieved by ordinary differential equation is well enough.

40|$|Abstract—This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the investigation of the suitability of several empirical and semi-empirical drying models available in the literature to define drying behavior of viscose yarn bobbins. For this purpose, firstly, experimental drying behaviour of viscose bobbins was determined on an experimental dryer setup which was designed and manufactured based on hot-air bobbin dryers used in textile industry. Afterwards, drying models considered were fitted to the experimentally obtained moisture ratios. Drying parameters were drying temperature and bobbin diameter. The fit was performed by selecting the values for constants in the models {{in such a way that}} these values make the sum of the squared differences between the experimental and the model results for moisture ratio minimum. Suitability of fitting was specified as comparing the correlation coefficient, standard error and mean square deviation. The results show that the most appropriate model in describing the drying curves of viscose bobbins is the Page model. Keywords—Drying, moisture ratio, Page model, <b>viscos...</b>|$|R
40|$|Several design methods {{aimed at}} sizing the viscous dampers to be {{inserted}} in building structures {{have been proposed}} in the last decades.

The procedure requires the development of numerical simulations for the evaluations of the peak inter-storey velocity profiles, necessary for the evaluation of the non-linear damping coefficient. In the present paper analytical formulations for the maximum inter-storey velocity are used in order to update the original five-step procedure leading to a direct (i. e. fully analytical) procedure.

A parametric study is also conducted to investigate the optimum damping coefficient of the dampers for adjacent single storey connected buildings.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the salivary flow rate, pH and buffer capacity prior to the beginning of therapy and after 1 year from bracket placement using a simple and commercially available chairside saliva check kit. Methods: The study population consisted of 20 healthy patients (mean age, 16. 5 ± 4 years) scheduled for fixed orthodontic treatment. Salivary samples were taken just before bracket bonding (T 0; baseline assessment) and after 1 year of treatment (T 1; half-treatment assessment) using the GC Saliva-Check Kit (GC Corp., Leuven, Belgium). Results: No statistically significant difference was detected between T 0 and T 1 for the salivary parameters examined in the present study.

It has been proved that potato cultivars with field resistance (Lugovskoy) provide a protection level comparable to the effectiveness of modern fungicides. Plant extracts from Southern plants can be used as biopesticides in order to additionally suppress the development of late blight. For example, extracts of four species from Yemen (fam. Asteraceae: Psiadia arabica Jaup and Spach; fam. Lamiaceae: Lawsonia inermis L; Dodonea <b>viscos</b> L; Euryops arabicus Steud. ex Jaub and Spach) were capable of suppressing late blight development on potato.

30|$|Small craters on {{the melt}} pools of impact craters such as Giordano Bruno, Tycho, and King have {{different}} morphology with both primaries and typical secondaries (Plescia 2015), {{as they are}} much shallower, with irregularly shaped rims and small central mounds, and absence of well-developed ejecta (e.g., Fig.  4 b). On the contrary, craters that are formed on the normal ejecta deposits do not have such morphological characteristics (e.g., Fig.  3 b). The irregularly shaped craters formed on Tycho’s melt pools have much smaller depth–diameter ratios (~[*] 0.06) than those formed on the normal ejecta deposits (~[*] 0.12), and their interior wall slopes are also much shallower (~[*] 9 ° versus 21 ° on average; Plescia 2015). Plescia and Spudis (2014) interpreted these craters as self-secondaries (termed as palimpsests) that were formed after the emplacement, but before the solidification of the impact melt. This interpretation is supported by laboratory impact experiments into <b>viscos</b> targets (e.g., Bingham fluids such as cone mush), as the simulated craters have shallow depths, low rims, concentric rings, lobate margins, and central highs (Fink et al. 1981; Greely et al. 1980). It {{is also consistent with}} the fact that impact melt pools can have large solidification time {{for tens of thousands of}} years (e.g., Plescia and Spudis 2014). Therefore, it is likely that self-secondaries have been continuously accumulating on the continuous ejecta deposits, even after the melt pools have been ponded.|$|R
40|$|Volcanic landforms {{are common}} {{features}} of the New Zealand environment. They originate by two major processes: first, by the eruption of various magmas onto the Earth's surface creating {{a wide array of}} landforms; and second, by largely physical, {{and to a lesser extent}} chemical, weathering, which progressively erodes and greatly modifies the original landform. In the first process the landforms are constructional in origin. They vary principally according to the chemistry and gas content of the magmas that control the explosivity of an eruption and the <b>viscos</b> ity of lavas. Magmas are subdivided into four groups principally on the basis of the silica content of the eruptive materials (Table 3. 1). Many other properties vary with the silica content, including everything from the viscosity of lavas to their mineral content. For example, increasing the water content of magma decreases its viscosity, so that any resulting lava will flow more readily. However, the gas content of the magma is of prime importance. If it is low, relatively quiescent extrusion of lavas will form steep-sided domes (in high-viscosity rhyolites) or extensive lava fields (in low-viscosity basalts). If it is high, vesicles (bubbles) will form just prior to or during eruption and a violent explosion results. The principal landforms associated with these variables are identified in Table 3. 1. In the second process the constructional volcanic landforms become modified by erosional agents, particularly running water, glaciers, the sea and the wind. These are therefore destructional or erosional in origin. In this chapter, volcanic landforms are described according to their composition and subdivided as to whether they are constructional or erosional in origin...|$|R
