25|$|The year 1950 opened quite quietly over Australia, with a {{relatively}} inactive monsoon and generally <b>very</b> <b>cool</b> conditions further south. A major cyclone in {{the third week of}} January gave substantial rain to most of New South Wales and caused high winds that killed seven people, {{but it was not until}} February that the pattern of abnormal rainfall over NSW and Queensland became firmly established.|$|E

25|$|Low rate of {{evaporation}} {{from this}} <b>very</b> <b>cool</b> body of water result in little evaporation occurring. Hence, rain clouds are sparsely formed and very rarely do they form long enough for a continuous period of rain to be recorded. Australia's arid/semi-arid zone extends to this region. The absence of any significant mountain range or area of substantial height above sea level, results in very little rainfall caused by orographic uplift. In the east the Great Dividing Range limits rain moving into inland Australia.|$|E

25|$|Canaan Valley and {{surrounding}} areas were strongly {{impacted by the}} southward advance of glaciers some 15,000 years ago. Although the glaciers themselves did not extend into the area, this climatic change resulted in a <b>very</b> <b>cool,</b> moist environment that was forest-unfriendly. Later, as the ice receded, many cold-adapted plant species remained behind and survived due to the high elevation. Soon, however, this tundra-like vegetation was largely crowded out by the growth of an extraordinarily dense climax red spruce forest, intermixed with balsam fir and hardwoods.|$|E
25|$|In April, Parker {{made his}} first mistake with Presley's career. He had booked him into a four-week Las Vegas engagement, misjudging the {{reaction}} of the slightly older, more reserved audiences that Las Vegas attracted. While Presley was a hit among the youth of America, the middle-aged audiences found him to be something of an oddity. Some viewed him as a clown-like figure, wiggling his hips for screams like a monkey for peanuts, while others found his manner of performance vulgar and more suitable for late-night gentleman's clubs. After a <b>very</b> <b>cool</b> reception during his first few shows, Parker cut Presley's appearance to two weeks. Presley would later remember the event as one of the worst moments of his career.|$|E
25|$|The Loire river has a {{significant}} effect on the mesoclimate of the region, adding the necessary extra few degrees of temperature that allows grapes to grow when the areas to the north and south of the Loire Valley have shown to be unfavourable to viticulture. In addition to finding vineyards along the Loire, several of the river's tributaries are also well planted—including the Allier, Cher, Indre, Loir, Sèvre Nantaise and Vienne Rivers. The climate can be <b>very</b> <b>cool</b> with spring time frost being a potential hazard for the vines.

500|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{falls in}} the winter and early spring, while summer is punctuated with widely scattered thunderstorms. The autumn is usually cool and dry. Due to the altitude and dryness of the atmosphere, vigorous radiative cooling occurs throughout the year, and exceptional daily temperature variances are not uncommon.

It was always interesting, having read the books, watching this amalgamation of story lines happen. Benjen is sort of like the Coldhands character in that he's a slightly suspicious guy who is half-dead and half-alive with blue hands. I thought that was <b>very</b> <b>cool,</b> the way it happened. It was a nice marriage between the book and TV revelations rolled into one. I was very excited having him on set.

His appearance was aimed to evoke [...] "rural Americana", referencing values of self-reliance and ingenuity when facing hardship and deprivation. When writing the character of Joel, Druckmann initially took inspiration from Josh Brolin's portrayal of Llewelyn Moss in No Country for Old Men (2007), which he saw as [...] "very quiet, <b>very</b> <b>cool</b> under pressure". However, Baker's interpretation of Joel as a more emotional person evolved the character in a different way. Ultimately, the narrative became an exploration of how willing a father is to save a child; initially, Joel is willing to sacrifice himself, before evolving where he is willing to sacrifice his friends, until finally feeling that he would sacrifice all of humanity in order to save Ellie.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this work was to study cell {{viability}} {{as a function of}} cooling rate during freezing. Cooling rate strongly influences the viability of cells during cold thermal stress. One of the particularities {{of this study was to}} investigate a large range of cooling rates and particularly <b>very</b> rapid <b>cooling</b> rates (i. e., faster than 20000 degrees C min (- 1)). Four distinct ranges of cooling rates were identified. The first range (A(')) corresponds to <b>very</b> slow <b>cooling</b> rates (less than 5 degrees C min (- 1)), and results in high cell mortality. The second range (A) corresponds to low cooling rates (5 - 100 degrees C min (- 1)), at which cell water outflow occurs slowly and does not damage the cells. The third range (B) corresponds to rapid cooling rates (100 - 2000 degrees C min (- 1)), at which there is competition between heat flow and water flow. In this case, massive water outflow, which is related to the increase in extracellular osmotic pressure and the membrane-lipid phase transition, can cause cell death. The fourth range (C) corresponds to <b>very</b> high <b>cooling</b> rates (more than 5000 degrees C min (- 1)), at which the heat flow is very rapid and partially prevents water exit, which seems to preserve cell viability...|$|R
