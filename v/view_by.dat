5|$|Clifford's Tower {{played no}} part in the formal design of the prison, {{although}} the talus, or sloping edge of the motte, was cut away and replaced by a retaining wall to allow more space for the new prison building. The backyard of the Female Prison, concealed from public <b>view</b> <b>by</b> the new wall, was used for hangings from 1868 onwards. The Prison Act, 1877, reformed the English prison system, and York Castle gaol was passed into the control of central government the following year. It {{was used as the}} county prison until 1900, when the remaining prisoners were transferred to Wakefield Prison, and from then onwards the facility was used as a military prison instead.|$|E

5|$|Combs also {{formed the}} state's first Human Rights Commission {{and ordered the}} {{desegregation}} of all public accommodations in Kentucky.

In 1961, Combs was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Kentucky, and on February 17, 1962, he received an award from Keep America Beautiful for his work on cleaning up Kentucky's highways, including securing passage of a bill requiring that auto junkyards near major roadways be screened from <b>view</b> <b>by</b> fences.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} that the Court had accepted in Burton I). This time, the Court rejected the argument. The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this <b>view</b> <b>by</b> citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in contract law. The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of <b>view,</b> <b>by</b> defending Thermopylae, the Greeks {{were making the}} best possible use of their forces. As {{long as they could}} prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E

5|$|Grunge became commercially {{successful}} in the early 1990s, due to releases such as Nirvana's Nevermind, Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Superunknown, Alice in Chains' Dirt and Stone Temple Pilots' Core. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of rock music at the time. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from <b>view</b> <b>by</b> the late 1990s, they influenced modern rock music, as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into pop culture and added introspection and an exploration {{of what it means}} to be true to oneself. Grunge was also an influence on subsequent genres such as post-grunge (a derivative of grunge) and nu metal.|$|E
5|$|Minton's time on {{the court}} {{marked the end of}} a {{transitory}} period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications on the Supreme Court. The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court. Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair have noted that the federal courts have lost a valuable point of <b>view</b> <b>by</b> not having experienced legislators among their ranks.|$|E
5|$|Protestant writers at {{the time}} took a highly {{negative}} <b>view.</b> <b>By</b> the 17th century, Mary's persecution of Protestants had led to her sobriquet Bloody Mary. John Knox attacked her in his First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women (1558), and she was prominently vilified in Actes and Monuments (1563), by John Foxe. Subsequent editions of Foxe's book remained popular with Protestants throughout the following centuries and helped shape enduring perceptions of Mary as a bloodthirsty tyrant.|$|E

5|$|South India has two {{distinct}} styles of rock architecture, the Dravidian style of Tamil Nadu and the Vesara style of Karnataka. The temples considered of porches or mantapas preceding the door {{leading to the}} sanctum, gate-pyramids or gopurams, which are the principal features in the quadrangular enclosures that surround the more notable temples and pillared halls used for many purposes and are the invariable accompaniments of these temples. Besides these, a South Indian temple typically has a tank called the Kalyani or Pushkarni. The gopuram is a monumental tower, usually ornate {{at the entrance of}} any temple in Southern India. This forms a prominent feature of koils, Hindu temples of the Dravidian style. They are topped by the kalasam, a spherical stone finial, and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. The origins of the gopuram {{can be traced back to}} early structures of the Pallavas and by the twelfth century, under the Pandya rulers, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance, eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from <b>view</b> <b>by</b> the colossal size of the gopuram.|$|E
