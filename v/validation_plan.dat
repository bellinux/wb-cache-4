40|$|The New Millennium Program's first Earth-observing mission (EO- 1) is a {{technology}} validation mission. It is {{managed by the}} NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and is scheduled for launch {{in the summer of}} 2000. The purpose of this mission is to flight-validate revolutionary technologies that will contribute to the reduction of cost and increase of capabilities for future land imaging missions. In the EO- 1 mission, there are five instrument, five spacecraft, and three supporting technologies to flight-validate during a year of operations. EO- 1 operations and the accompanying ground system were intended to be simple in order to maintain low operational costs. For purposes of formulating operations, it was initially modeled as a small science mission. However, it quickly evolved into a more complex mission due to the difficulties in effectively integrating all of the <b>validation</b> <b>plans</b> of the individual technologies. As a consequence, more operational support was required to confidently complete the on-orbit validation of the new technologies. This paper will outline the issues and lessons learned applicable to future technology validation missions. Examples of some of these include the following: (1) operational complexity encountered in integrating all of the <b>validation</b> <b>plans</b> into a coherent operational plan, (2) initial desire to run single shift operations subsequently growing to 6 "around-the-clock" operations, (3) managing changes in the technologies that ultimately affected operations, (4) necessity for better team communications within the project to offset the effects of change on the Ground System Developers, Operations Engineers, Integration and Test Engineers, S/C Subsystem Engineers, and Scientists, and (5) the need for a more experienced Flight Operations Team to achieve the necessary operational flexibility. The discussion will conclude by providing several cost comparisons for developing operations from previous missions to EO- 1 and discuss some details that might be done differently for future technology validation missions...|$|R
40|$|As {{the role}} of {{computational}} models has increased, the accuracy of computational results has been of great concern to engineering decision-makers. To address a growing concern about the predictive capability of the computational models, this dissertation proposed a generic model validation framework with four research objectives as: Objective 1 &mdash to develop a hierarchical framework for statistical model validation that is applicable to various computational models of engineered products (or systems); Objective 2 &mdash to advance a model calibration technique that can facilitate to improve predictive capability of computational models in a statistical manner; Objective 3 &mdash to build a validity check engine of a computational model with limited experimental data; and Objective 4 &mdash to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed validation framework with five engineering problems requiring different experimental resources and predictive computational models: (a) cellular phone, (b) tire tread block, (c) thermal challenge problem, (d) constrained-layer damping structure and (e) energy harvesting device. The validation framework consists of three activities: <b>validation</b> <b>planning</b> (top-down), <b>validation</b> execution (bottom-up) and virtual qualification. The <b>validation</b> <b>planning</b> activity requires knowledge about physics-of-failure (PoF) mechanisms and/or system performances of interest. The knowledge facilitates to decompose an engineered system into subsystems and/or components such that PoF mechanisms or system performances of interest can be decomposed accordingly. The <b>validation</b> <b>planning</b> activity takes a top-down approach and identifies vital tests and predictive computational models of which contain both known and unknown model input variable(s). On the other hand, the validation execution activity takes a bottom-up approach, which improves the predictive capability of the computational models from the lowest level to the highest using the statistical calibration technique. This technique compares experimental results with predicted ones from the computational model {{to determine the best}} statistical distributions of unknown random variables while maximizing the likelihood function. As the predictive capability of a computational model at a lower hierarchical level is improved, this enhanced model can be fused into the model at a higher hierarchical level. The validation execution activity is then continued for the model at the higher hierarchical level. After the statistical model calibration, a validity of the calibrated model should be assessed; therefore, a hypothesis test for validity check method was developed to measure and evaluate the degree of mismatch between predicted and observed results while considering the uncertainty caused by limited experimental data. Should the model become valid, the virtual qualification can be executed in a statistical sense for new product developments. With five case studies, this dissertation demonstrates that the validation framework is applicable to diverse classes of engineering problems for improving the predictive capability of the computational models, assessing the fidelity of the computational models, and assisting rational decision making on new design alternatives in the product development process...|$|R

40|$|A {{thorough}} and unique thermal verification and model <b>validation</b> <b>plan</b> {{has been developed}} for NASA s James Webb Space Telescope. The JWST observatory consists of a large deployed aperture optical telescope passively cooled to below 50 Kelvin along with a suite of several instruments passively and actively cooled to below 37 Kelvin and 7 Kelvin, respectively. Passive cooling to these extremely low temperatures is made feasible {{by the use of}} a large deployed high efficiency sunshield and an orbit location a! !he L 2 Lagrange p~in!. Another enabling feature is the scale or size of the observatory that allows for large radiator sizes that are compatible with the expected power dissipation of the instruments and large format Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe) detector arrays. This passive cooling concept is simple, reliable, and mission enabling when compared to the alternatives of mechanical coolers and stored cryogens. However, these same large scale observatory features, which make passive cooling viable, also prevent the typical flight configuration fully-deployed thermal balance test that is the keystone to most space missions thermal verification plan. JWST is simply too large in its deployed configuration to be properly thermal balance tested in the facilities that currently exist. This reality, when combined with a mission thermal concept with little to no flight heritage, has necessitated the need for a unique and alternative approach to thermal system verification and model validation.
