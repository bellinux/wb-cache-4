Pickup roll presses normally have a <b>vacuum</b> <b>box</b> that has two vacuum zones (low vacuum and high vacuum). These rolls have {{a large number of}} drilled holes in the cover to allow the vacuum to pass from the stationary <b>vacuum</b> <b>box</b> through the rotating roll covering. The low vacuum zone picks up the sheet and transfers, while the high vacuum zone attempts to remove moisture. Unfortunately, at high enough speed centrifugal force flings out vacuumed water, making this less effective for dewatering. Pickup presses also have standard felt runs with Uhle boxes. However, pickup press design is quite different, as air movement is important for the pickup and dewatering facets of its role.|$|E

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{motives of}} the research undertaken here are twofold: to obtain {{a deeper understanding of}} the dewatering mechanisms at the forming section of a papermaking machine and to develop numerical models that describe the flow through forming fabrics. More comprehensive knowledge of dewatering in the forming section allows suggestions to be made for improvements that reduce the amount of energy used in the process without affecting the quality of the end product.   The objective of this thesis is to answer the following questions: How and why does rewetting occur at the high <b>vacuum</b> suction <b>boxes?</b> How does the structure of the forming fabric affect dewatering at the forming section? Is it possible to create accurate numerical models for forming fabrics, and can these be used to predict the dewatering behaviour of new types of fabrics?   Laboratory and pilot studies simulating high <b>vacuum</b> suction <b>boxes</b> were performed together with numerical modelling of the flow of air and water through both the forming fabric and the paper sheet.   The conclusion drawn from the pilot study is that rewetting significantly lowers the dryness of the paper sheet exiting the suction boxes. The phenomenon is extremely rapid and is most likely driven by capillary forces. The high speed at which this rewetting occurs makes it difficult to impede by placing the suction boxes closer to the couch pick-up: the solution is more likely to be the use of new and improved designs of the forming fabric. The structure of the forming fabric has been shown to affect the dewatering rate at certain conditions of vacuum dewatering, and can possibly be connected partly to the fact that fibres penetrate the surface of the fabric to varying degrees and partly to the flow resistance of the different fabric structures. Numerical models of high accuracy can be constructed and used to predetermine how new fabric designs would affect dewatering at the forming section.   This thesis quantifies aspects of dewatering such as rewetting and the influence of the forming fabric. Understanding these dewatering aspects further provides for the potential enhancement of energy efficiency in the forming section, and thereby the entire papermaking process. The forming fabric can play an important role in improving energy efficiency: rewetting after the high <b>vacuum</b> suction <b>boxes</b> occurs more rapidly than was previously known, so its design might be the only possible way of impeding it. The forming fabric can also improve the rate of dewatering: it is therefore likely that its design will be important in the next stage of developing energy efficiency and thereby play a part in achieving a more sustainable future.

40|$|A new rapid {{separation}} {{method that}} allows separation and preconcentration of actinides in urine samples {{was developed for}} the measurement of longer lived actinides by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and short-lived actinides by alpha spectrometry; a hybrid approach. This method uses stacked extraction chromatography cartridges and <b>vacuum</b> <b>box</b> technology to facilitate rapid separations. Preconcentration, if required, is performed using a streamlined calcium phosphate precipitation. Similar technology {{has been applied to}} separate actinides prior to measurement by alpha spectrometry, but this new method has been developed with elution reagents now compatible with ICP-MS as well. Purified solutions are split between ICP-MS and alpha spectrometry so that long- and short-lived actinide isotopes can be measured successfully. The method allows for simultaneous extraction of 24 samples (including QC samples) in less than 3 h. Simultaneous sample preparation can offer significant time savings over sequential sample preparation. For example, sequential sample preparation of 24 samples taking just 15 min each requires 6 h to complete. The simplicity and speed of this new method makes it attractive for radiological emergency response. If preconcentration is applied, the method is applicable to larger sample aliquots for occupational exposures as well. The chemical recoveries are typically greater than 90 %, in contrast to other reported methods using flow injection separation techniques for urine samples where plutonium yields were 70 - 80 %. This method allows measurement of both long-lived and short-lived actinide isotopes. 239 Pu, 242 Pu, 237 Np, 243 Am, 234 U, 235 U and 238 U were measured by ICP-MS, while 236 Pu, 238 Pu, 239 Pu, 241 Am, 243 Am and 244 Cm were measured by alpha spectrometry. The method can also be adapted so that the separation of uranium isotopes for assay is not required, if uranium assay by direct dilution of the urine sample is preferred instead. Multiple <b>vacuum</b> <b>box</b> locations may be set-up to supply several ICP-MS units with purified sample fractions such that a high sample throughput may be achieved, while still allowing for rapid measurement of short-lived actinides by alpha spectrometry...|$|E

40|$|Cerebral autoregulation is {{the process}} by which blood flow to the brain is {{maintained}} despite changes in arterial blood pressure. Experiments using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography allow rapid measurements of blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery. Measurements of this velocity and a subject's arterial blood pressure are used in the assessment of the dynamic cerebral autoregulatory response. Two mathematical models representing the dynamic cerebral autoregulation response as a feedback mechanism, dependent on pressure and flow respectively, are derived. For each model two parameters are introduced, a rate of restoration and a time delay. Solutions for both flow between fixed plates and flow in a rigid pipe are obtained using Laplace transform methods. In both cases solutions for the velocity are found for a general arterial blood pressure, allowing the model to be applied to any experiment that uses changes in arterial blood pressure to assess dynamic cerebral autoregulation. Velocity profiles are determined for the thigh cuff and <b>vacuum</b> <b>box</b> experiments, modelled as a step change and sinusoidal variation in pressure gradient in the middle cerebral artery respectively. The influence of the underlying heart and breathing cycles on measurements obtained from the <b>vacuum</b> <b>box</b> experiments is assessed, before results derived using the mathematical model with a flow dependent feedback mechanism are compared with data from the two experiments. The comparisons yield similar estimates for the rate of restoration and time delay suggesting that these parameters could be independent of the pressure change stimulus and depend only on the main features of the dynamic cerebral autoregulation process. The modelling also indicates that for imposed oscillatory variations in arterial blood pressure a small phase difference between the pressure and velocity waveforms does not necessarily imply impaired autoregulation. The ratio between the percentage variation in maximum velocity and pressure can be used, along with the phase difference, to indicate more accurately the nature of the autoregulatory response. Finally, the relationship between arterial blood pressure and pressure gradient in the middle cerebral artery is modelled using electrical analogue theory. The influence of this relationship on the autoregulation model for flow in a rigid pipe is investigated...|$|E

The temperature stabilized cryogenic cells with path lengths of 24. 29 and 20. 38 cm were constructed of oxygen free high conductivity (OFHC) copper and fitted with wedged ZnSe windows using vacuum tight indium seals. In operation, the temperature-controlled cooling by a closed-cycle helium refrigerator achieved stability of 0. 01 K. The unwanted absorption features arising from cryodeposits on the cell windows at low temperatures were eliminated by building an internal <b>vacuum</b> shroud <b>box</b> around the cell which significantly minimized the growth of cryodeposits. The effects of vibrations from the closed-cycle helium refrigerator on the FTS spectra were characterized. Using this set up, several high-resolution spectra of methane isotopologues broadened with nitrogen were recorded in the 1200 - 1800 per centimeter spectral region at various sample temperatures between 79. 5 and 296 K.

Coalescing in the primary fluid, these noble metals then migrate and eventually deposit on internal reactor surfaces. Since the bulk of these noble metal fission products are also energetically unstable they bring not only physical fouling, but heat and radiation from decay as well. The adherence forces of five of the seven principal radioactive foulants discovered during the MSRE were measured on six different potential structural materials by atomic force microscope force spectroscopy (AFM-FS). The noble metals studied were niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium, antimony and tellurium. Structural materials measured were Hastelloy-N, the primary structural metal of the MSRE; two steels, SS 316 L and F 91; commercially pure nickel and molybdenum; and silicon carbide. MSRs operate with surfaces free of passivating corrosion layers, so the measurements were conducted on bare metal surfaces. An argon ion gun chamber was constructed for removal of the oxide layers from mechanically polished substrate metals by sputtering. A combination <b>vacuum</b> chamber/glove <b>box</b> was crafted to accept the sputter polished substrates into a dry, inert environment where the force adhesion measurements were made. Data acquired in the last phase of the study partially demonstrated the concept. The measured particle-to-substrate attractive forces found antimony and tellurium to be generally more adherent to the bare metals than niobium or molybdenum. The finding is consistent with the fouling examined in the MSRE. If held, this correlation of laboratory measurement to actual fouling may aid the reactor designer in anticipating fouling to plan for the effects. Such knowledge would inform selection of plant materials, both for operating components such as flow detectors and heat exchangers, where fission product deposition would be undesired, and for processing components such as filters and metal collection systems, where adhesion would be preferred. by Reid S.
