40|$|The acyclic {{nucleoside}} phosphonates HPMPC (cidofovir), PMEA (adefovir), and PMPA (tenofovir) {{have proved}} to be effective in vitro (cell culture systems) and in vivo (animal models and clinical studies) against a wide variety of DNA virus and retrovirus infections: cidofovir against herpesvirus (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesviruses 6, 7, and 8), polyomavirus, papillomavirus, adenovirus, and poxvirus (variola virus, cowpox virus, vaccinia virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, and orf virus) infections; adefovir against herpesvirus, hepadnavirus (human hepatitis B virus), and retrovirus (human immunodeficiency virus types 1 [HIV- 1] and 2 [HIV- 2], simian immunodeficiency virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus) infections; and tenofovir against both hepadnavirus and retrovirus infections. Cidofovir (<b>Vistide)</b> has been officially approved for the treatment of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread) has been approved for the treatment of HIV infections (i. e., AIDS), and adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera) has been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Nephrotoxicity is the dose-limiting side effect for cidofovir (<b>Vistide)</b> when used intravenously (5 mg/kg); no toxic side effects have been described for adefovir dipivoxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, at the approved doses (Hepsera at 10 mg orally daily and Viread at 300 mg orally daily) ...|$|E
40|$|Immunocompromised {{patients}} may have severe forms of infections. Since {{there is an}} increasing number of patients maintained under immunosuppressive therapy, we will be confronted with increasing frequency with these infectious problems. Effective treatments will be of great value. The case is described of a renal transplant with a giant orf lesion, which continued growing instead of regressing spontaneously as is observed usually. The treatment options in such patients are limited. It was decided to treat the patient with the antiviral drug cidofovir (HPMPC, <b>Vistide.</b> Topical cidofovir treatment resulted in complete regression of the lesion.

40|$|Recurrent {{respiratory}} papillomatosis (RRP) {{is caused}} by a human papilloma virus (HPV). It is a rare, sometimes debilitating disease compromising voice and airway. RRP is characterized by a variable course of disease, potentially leading to frequent annual surgical procedures, the number of which may exceed a hundred during the life time. The therapy focuses on surgical removal of the mucosal lesions {{in order to keep the}} airway open and the voice satisfactory. Till now, there is no curative therapy for the virus infection in itself. As recurrent surgery alone has proven to be insufficient in many cases, adjuvant therapy is increasingly being used. One of the mainstays of adjuvant therapy is the administration of intralesional cidofovir (<b>Vistide</b> Ò).

40|$|Orf virus, {{a member}} of the Parapoxvirus genus, causes a {{contagious}} pustular dermatitis in sheep, goats, and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated the activity of (S) - 1 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propyl]cytosine (HPMPC; cidofovir; <b>Vistide)</b> against orf virus in cell culture and humans. We have evaluated a broad range of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) against several orf virus strains in primary lamb keratinocytes (PLKs) and human embryonic lung (HEL) monolayers. HPMPC, (S) - 9 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propyl]- 2, 6 - diaminopurine (HPMPDAP), and (R) - 9 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propoxy]- 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine (HPMPO-DAPy) were three of the most active compounds that were subsequently tested in a virus yield assay with PLK and HEL cells by virus titration and DNA quantification. HPMPC, HPMPDAP, and HPMPO-DAPy were evaluated for their activities against orf virus replication in organotypic epithelial raft cultures from differentiated PLK cells. At the highest concentrations (50 and 20 microg/ml), full protection was provided by the three drugs, while at 5 microg/ml, only HPMPDAP and HPMPC offered partial protection. The activities of the three compounds in the raft culture system were confirmed by quantification of infectious virus and viral DNA. These findings provide a rationale for the use of HPMPC and other ANPs in the treatment of orf (contagious ecthyma) in humans and animals. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Three acyclic {{nucleoside}} phosphonates {{are currently}} approved {{for clinical use}} against infections caused by cytomegalovirus (<b>Vistide),</b> hepatitis B virus (Hepsera), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (Viread). This important antiviral class inhibits viral polymerases after cellular uptake and conversion to their diphosphates, bypassing the first phosphorylation, which is required for conventional nucleoside antivirals. Small chemical alterations in the acyclic side chain lead to marked differences in antiviral activity and the spectrum of activity of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates against various classes of viral agents. We synthesized {{a new class of}} acyclic nucleoside phosphonates based on a 5 -phosphono-pent- 2 -en- 1 -yl base motif in which the oxygen heteroatom usually present in acyclic nucleoside phosphonates has been replaced with a double bond. Since the intrinsic phosphonate moiety leads to low oral bioavailability and impaired cellular penetration, we also prepared the hexadecyloxypropyl esters of the 5 -phosphono-pent- 2 -en- 1 -yl nucleosides. Our earlier work showed that this markedly increases antiviral activity and oral bioavailability. Although the 5 -phosphono-pent- 2 -en- 1 -yl nucleosides themselves were not active, the hexadecyloxypropyl esters were active against DNA viruses and hepatitis B virus, in vitro. Notably, the hexadecyloxypropyl ester of 9 -(5 -phosphono-pent- 2 -en- 1 -yl) -adenine was active against hepatitis B virus mutants resistant to lamivudine, emtricitabine, and adefovir...|$|E
40|$|There {{is concern}} that variola virus, the {{aetiological}} agent of smallpox, {{may be used}} as a biological weapon. For this reason several countries are now stockpiling (vaccinia virus-based) smallpox vaccine. Although the preventive use of smallpox vaccination has been well documented, little is known about its efficacy when used after exposure to the virus. Here we compare the effectiveness of (1) post-exposure smallpox vaccination and (2) antiviral treatment with either cidofovir (also called HPMPC or <b>Vistide)</b> or with a related acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogue (HPMPO-DAPy) after lethal intratracheal infection of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) with monkeypox virus (MPXV). MPXV causes a disease similar to human smallpox and this animal model can be used to measure differences in the protective efficacies of classical and new-generation candidate smallpox vaccines. We show that initiation of antiviral treatment 24 h after lethal intratracheal MPXV infection, using either of the antiviral agents and applying various systemic treatment regimens, resulted in significantly reduced mortality and reduced numbers of cutaneous monkeypox lesions. In contrast, when monkeys were vaccinated 24 h after MPXV infection, using a standard human dose of a currently recommended smallpox vaccine (Elstree-RIVM), no significant reduction in mortality was observed. When antiviral therapy was terminated 13 days after infection, all surviving animals had virus-specific serum antibodies and antiviral T lymphocytes. These data show that adequate preparedness for a biological threat involving smallpox should include the possibility of treating exposed individuals with antiviral compounds such as cidofovir or other selective anti-poxvirus drugs. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cidofovir (<b>Vistide)</b> is an {{antiviral}} marketed for {{the treatment}} of cytomegalovirus retinitis. Clinical efficacy has been reported with its broad antiviral spectrum that includes poxvirus, human papilloma virus and Herpes simplex. In immunodepressed patients, these infectious dermatoses are often recurrent and resistant. In an open study, we assessed the efficacy and clinical tolerance of cidofovir gel at 1 p. 100. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve HIV-infected adults were included. Cidofovir gel at 1 p. 100 was applied directly on the lesions, once a day, for two weeks on the molluscum and condylomas, four weeks on the warts and one week on the chronic herpes. RESULTS: Four patients presented with warts and 3 of them with verruca plana. In 2 of the verruca plana patients, regression was complete although relapse was observed. Two failures were noted. Local application of the gel was not tolerated by one patient suffering from condylomas of the penis. Four patients presented with molluscum contagiosum. Two complete regressions with strong local reaction and two partial regressions were observed. The latter two patients exhibited severe immunodepression, one of them subsequently received infusions of cidofovir. Two women suffering from vulvar and perianal herpes resistant to acyclovir were treated for one week with cidofovir gel at 1 p. 100 : no response was obtained. One of the patients stopped treatment because of local intolerance. A third, less immunodepressed, woman responded partially. COMMENTS: In HIV-positive patients, cidofovir in topical form appears to be indicated in extensive and confluent molluscum contagiosum. However, the effect occurs at the cost of local inflammation. The results are disappointing in papillomavirus lesions and in chronic acyclovir-resistant herpes ulcerations, efficacy is debatable...|$|E
40|$|Camelpox virus (CMLV) is {{the closest}} known virus to variola virus. Here {{we report on the}} anti-CMLV {{activities}} of several acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) related to cidofovir [(S) - 1 -(3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonomethoxypropyl) cytosine (HPMPC; <b>Vistide)</b> ] against two CMLV strains, CML 1 and CML 14. Cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assays performed with human embryonic lung fibroblast monolayers revealed the selectivities of the first two classes of ANPs (cHPMPA, HPMPDAP, and HPMPO-DAPy) and of the hexadecyloxyethyl ester of 1 -{[(5 S) - 2 -hydroxy- 2 -oxido- 1, 4, 2 -dioxaphosphinan- 5 -yl]methyl}- 5 -azacytosine (HDE-cHPMP- 5 -azaC), belonging to the newly synthesized ANPs, which are HPMP derivatives containing a 5 -azacytosine moiety. The inhibitory activities of ANPs against both strains were also confirmed with primary human keratinocyte (PHK) monolayers, despite the higher toxicity of those molecules on growing PHKs. Virus yield assays confirmed the anti-CML 1 and anti-CML 14 efficacies of the compounds selected for the highest potencies in CPE reduction experiments. Ex vivo studies were performed with a 3 -dimensional model of human skin, i. e., organotypic epithelial raft cultures of PHKs. It was ascertained by histological evaluation, as well as by virus yield assays, that CMLV replicated in the human skin equivalent. HPMPC and the newly synthesized ANPs proved to be effective at protecting the epithelial cells against CMLV-induced CPE. Moreover, in contrast to the toxicity on PHK monolayers, signs of toxicity in the differentiated epithelium were seen only at high ANP concentrations. Our results demonstrate that compounds belonging to the newly synthesized ANPs, in addition to cidofovir, represent promising candidates for the treatment of poxvirus infections. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|S) - 1 -(3 -Hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl) {{cytosine}} (HPMPC, Cidofovir, <b>Vistide)</b> is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with broad-spectrum activity {{against a}} wide variety of DNA viruses including herpesviruses [Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) and type 2 (HSV- 2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV- 6) and equine and bovine herpesviruses], papovaviruses [human polyoma virus and human papilloma virus (HPV) ], adeno-, irido-, hepadna-, and poxviruses. HPMPC has proved effective against these viruses in different cell culture systems and/or animal models. The mechanism of action of HPMPC is based upon the interaction of its active intracellular metabolite, the diphosphorylated HPMPC derivative HPMPCpp, with the viral DNA polymerase. HPMPCpp has been shown to block CMV DNA synthesis by DNA chain termination following incorporation of two consecutive HPMPC molecules at the 3 '-end of the DNA chain. HPMPC confers a prolonged antiviral action, which lasts for several days or weeks, thus allowing infrequent dosing (i. e. every week or every two weeks). This prolonged antiviral action is probably due to the very long intracellular half-life of the HPMPC metabolites, particularly the HPMPCp-choline adduct. In clinical studies, HPMPC has proved efficacious in the treatment of CMV retinitis, following both intravenous injection (3 or 5 mg/kg, every other week) and intravitreal injection (single dose of 20 micrograms per eye). Initial clinical trials also point to the efficacy of both systemic (intravenous) and topical HPMPC (1 % ointment) in the treatment of acyclovir-resistant HSV infections, and of topical HPMPC (ointment or injection) in the treatment of pharyngeal, laryngeal and anogenital HPV infections. HPMPC is now being pursued in the topical and/or systemic (intravenous) treatment of various infections due to CMV, HSV, VZV, EBV, HPV, polyoma-, adeno- and poxviruses. status: publishe...|$|E
