5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} of the <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface}} of the cell. This specificity restricts the <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E

5|$|The American robin is a known {{reservoir}} (carrier) for West Nile virus. While crows and jays {{are often}} the first noticed deaths in an area with West Nile virus, the American robin is suspected {{to be a key}} host, and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of the <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> humans. This is because, while crows and jays die quickly from the virus, the American robin survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit the <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> humans and other species.|$|E
50|$|The FGI-104 {{family of}} {{compounds}} act by inhibiting the protein TSG101, which transports newly replicated <b>viruses</b> <b>to</b> {{the exterior of}} an infected cell, and is required by many <b>viruses</b> <b>to</b> reinfect other cells. In pre-clinical studies FGI-104 {{has been shown to}} protect mice from Ebola virus disease.|$|R

5|$|An {{alternative}} view {{holds that}} unsafe medical practices in Africa during years following World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic, and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector {{that allowed the}} <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> adapt to humans and spread.|$|E
5|$|Another {{breakthrough}} came in 1931, {{when the}} American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza {{and several other}} viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. In 1949, John Franklin Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins grew polio virus in cultured human embryo cells, the first <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> be grown without using solid animal tissue or eggs. This work enabled Jonas Salk to make an effective polio vaccine.|$|E

50|$|Viral {{immunotherapy}} uses <b>viruses</b> <b>to</b> introduce specific antigens to the patient's immune system. Unlike traditional vaccines, {{in which}} attenuated or killed virus/bacteria {{is used to}} generate an immune response, viral immunotherapy uses genetically engineered <b>viruses</b> <b>to</b> present a specific antigen to the immune system. That antigen could be from any species of virus/bactera or even human disease antigens, for example cancer antigens.|$|R
50|$|Virotherapy is a {{treatment}} using biotechnology <b>to</b> convert <b>viruses</b> into therapeutic agents by reprogramming <b>viruses</b> <b>to</b> treat diseases. There are three main branches of virotherapy: anti-cancer oncolytic viruses, viral vectors for gene therapy and viral immunotherapy. In {{a slightly different}} context, virotherapy can also refer more broadly {{to the use of}} <b>viruses</b> <b>to</b> treat certain medical conditions by killing pathogens.|$|R
5|$|In December 2008, {{research}} by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin linked {{the presence of}} three specific genes (termed PA, PB1, and PB2) and a nucleoprotein derived from 1918 flu samples {{to the ability of}} the flu <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> invade the lungs and cause pneumonia. The combination triggered similar symptoms in animal testing.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antiviral}} drugs target {{different stages}} of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for the <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> become infectious. There is a class of drugs called protease inhibitors, which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning.|$|E
5|$|The disease runs most {{rampant in}} the {{subtropical}} conditions which encourage reproduction of its mosquito vectors among which Culex tarsalis is most significant. Mortality rates {{appear to be}} higher than those in other birds, causing local population losses of up to 72% in a single season. Because of this, American crows are a sentinel species indicating the presence of West Nile virus in an area. Crows cannot transmit the <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> humans directly.|$|E

5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> enter.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated <b>virus)</b> <b>to</b> shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E

50|$|Despite CBPV mainly infecting honeybees as {{they are}} its main host, the virus has also been found present in {{carnivore}} ants as well. This suggests that the ants serve as a “reservoir” <b>to</b> increase <b>virus</b> numbers <b>to</b> more easily infect bees in a nest or apiary environment. These viral reservoirs {{can also be seen}} in other biological relationships, such as mosquitoes carrying <b>viruses</b> <b>to</b> infect vertebrates and aphids carrying <b>viruses</b> <b>to</b> infect plants. Regardless, these carnivorous ants may become infected with CBPV by either eating dead infected bees or by independently collecting honeydew.|$|R

On Saturday morning, Murray {{finished}} his match, winning in three sets. Two hours later, Murray partnered Colin Fleming to win the doubles rubber. Murray had only beaten one top ten player on clay, Nikolay Davydenko, back in 2009, and was upset by Fabio Fognini, world No. 13, in straight sets, which took Great Britain to the deciding final rubber. However, James Ward was defeated by Andreas Seppi, also in straight sets, knocking Great Britain out of the Davis Cup.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe direct {{transmission}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) <b>viruses</b> <b>to</b> humans in Eurasia and subsequent disease has sparked research efforts leading to {{better understanding of}} HPAI virus transmission and pathogenicity in mammals. There has been minimal focus on examining the capacity of circulating low pathogenic wild bird avian influenza <b>viruses</b> <b>to</b> infect mammals. We have utilized a mouse model for influenza <b>virus</b> infection <b>to</b> examine 28 North American wild bird avian influenza virus isolates that include the hemagglutinin subtypes H 2, H 3, H 4, H 6, H 7, and H 11. We demonstrate that many wild bird avian influenza viruses of several different hemagglutinin types replicate in this mouse model without adaptation and induce histopathologic lesions similar <b>to</b> other influenza <b>virus</b> infections but cause minimal morbidity. These findings demonstrate the potential of wild avian influenza <b>viruses</b> <b>to</b> directly infect mice without prior adaptation and support their potential role in emergence of pandemic influenza...|$|R

5|$|Poliovirus uses two key {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, {{it is capable of}} surviving the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing the <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the virion surface can mutate to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
