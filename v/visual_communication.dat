5|$|Modern {{birds are}} known to {{communicate}} using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> has always been important in dinosaur biology. Reconstruction of the plumage color of Anchiornis huxleyi, suggest the importance of color in <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> in non-avian dinosaurs. The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the larynx and the latter through the unique syrinx, suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing trend}} among fashion {{companies}} in today’s society is to communicate their take on CSR, Corporate Social Responsibility. This trend {{stems from the}} consumers expressing demand that exceeds the products themselves. Due to this, CSR is becoming coherent in fashion companies’ business and business communication (Bartlett et al, 2011 : 6 - 12; Grafström et al, 2008 : 34 - 39).   The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate Acne Studios’ CSR efforts by examining their <b>visual</b> image <b>communication,</b> which is represented by their Instagram account. The study is built upon three questions of interest; (1)  Which, if any, aspects of CSR has Acne Studios chosen to work with? (2)  How does Acne Studios’ take on CSR reflect in their <b>visual</b> image <b>communication</b> on Instagram? (3) What is the message that Acne Studios is trying to convey with their <b>visual</b> image <b>communication?</b>   The theoretical framework of the study consists of: (1) Corporate Social Responsibility and; (2) Public Relations. Furthermore, three methods have been implemented: (1) a qualitative interview; (2) a quantitative content analysis; and (3) a qualitative semiotic analysis. The empirical material consists of an email interview with an employee at Acne Studios Headquarters and an analysis of the images from Acne Studios’ Instagram account.     The results from the interview reveal that the aspects of CSR that Acne Studios engage in are not conveyed in the company’s <b>visual</b> image <b>communication</b> on Instagram. The single CSR aspect that could be identified in both Acne Studios own image of their CSR efforts as well as in the company’s <b>visual</b> image <b>communication</b> on Instagram is that Acne Studios challenges the normative perspectives with regards to playing on masculinity/femininity. The study concludes that Acne Studios’ main message in their <b>visual</b> image <b>communication</b> on Instagram is to challenge normative perspectives in terms of gender roles. ...|$|R
5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and <b>visual</b> <b>communication,</b> and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
5|$|Siglas Poveiras are {{a form of}} proto-writing system, with a {{restricted}} number of symbols that were combined to form more complex symbols; these were used as a rudimentary <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> system, and as a signature to mark belongings. Merchants wrote them in their books of credit; fishermen used it in religious rituals by marking them {{in the door of}} Catholic chapels near hills or beaches; in the table of the church during marriage and in their tombstone; and also had magical significance, such as the São Selimão sigla, that {{could be used as a}} protecting symbol and not as family mark. Children used the same family mark with piques as a form of cadency. The youngest son would not have any pique and would inherit his father's symbol. The siglas are still used, though much less commonly, by some families; and are related with Viking traditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} {{their use in}} sexual display was first {{proposed}} by Davitashvili in 1961 and has gained increasing acceptance since. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship or in other social behavior, {{can be seen in}} the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. A 2006 study of the smallest Triceratops skull, ascertained to be a juvenile, shows the frill and horns developed at a very early age, predating sexual development and thus probably important for <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> and species recognition in general. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists for structures in modern species.|$|E

25|$|The use {{of vocal}} and <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> {{has been shown}} to vary by location, based on {{elements}} such as noise pollution and the amount of open space. For instance, populations living in large cities generally rely more on the visual signals, due to the generally louder environment with more areas without much visual restriction. However, in heavily wooded areas, vocal signals are used more often due to the relatively lower noise levels and a dense canopy restricting visual range.|$|E

25|$|The {{defensive}} {{behavior in}} S. septentrionalis often involves {{a large number}} of workers leaving the nest in order to display or attack with their stingers in response to a disturbance. Often, after the wasps leave the nest, they will display their gaster {{in such a way that}} it is perpendicular to the ground and the rest of their body; this behavior is defined as gaster-flagging. From a defensive standpoint, it is likely that gaster-flagging serves as a warning signal to predators that S. septentrionalis will engage in defensive stinging behavior if necessary. Likewise, gaster-flagging could potentially serve as a <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> method between other members of the colony in order to mobilize them in the presence of a threat.|$|E

25|$|Regaining {{contact with}} field {{artillery}} {{after the attack}} was considered essential, so that German counter-attacks could be engaged with shrapnel fire, to obstruct German troops as they concentrated for attack {{and to create a}} barrier against the survivors. Advanced posts pushed beyond the objective gave early warning of German attacks and forced then under cover, outside grenade-throwing range; the advanced posts could also be connected later. Communication was essential, all reports stressed the efficiency of telephones and some units advocated dispensing with <b>visual</b> <b>communication,</b> since the smoke and dust of battle made them invisible. Runners were the second most reliable means of maintaining contact between advanced troops, battalion and brigade headquarters. The Canadian Corps decided to use telephones, runners, pigeons and visual signals, given the unpredictable characteristics of the battlefield. Aeroplanes on contact-patrol had been found to be ineffective and more training of the infantry in contact-patrol liaison was recommended.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the typological {{similarity}} {{of the structures}} and the relatively short distance between them (ideal for <b>visual</b> <b>communication),</b> has led some {{to think that they}} were {{on opposite sides of the}} frontier line between the Kingdoms of León and Castile (in Salamanca there is a town names Zorita de la Frontera ("Zorita on the Border") in memory of those times). These fortresses were reinforced in the 12th and 13th centuries due to conflicts between the two kingdoms; but it appears that they are more plentiful on the Castilian side (near the Trabancos) than on the Leonese side (near the River Guareña). This has been seen as indicative of a certain independence on the part of the militia of the Community of Medina del Campo and surrounding areas, which was thereby forced to defend itself without outside help, while the Leonese side would have been able to rely on the help of Royal troops, and the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, billeted in Castronuño and Torrecilla de la Orden.|$|E
25|$|These {{soldiers}} {{fought in}} close-ranked rectangular or square formations, {{of which the}} smallest tactical unit was the 256 men strong syntagma or speira. This formation typically fought eight or sixteen men deep and in a frontage of thirty-two or sixteen men accordingly. Each file of 16 men, a lochos, was commanded by a lochagos {{who was in the}} front rank. Junior officers, one at the rear and one in the centre, were in place to steady the ranks and maintain the cohesion of the formation, similar to modern-day NCOs. The commander of the syntagma theoretically fought {{at the head of the}} extreme far-right file. According to Aelian, a syntagma was accompanied by five additional individuals to the rear: a herald (to act as a messenger), a trumpeter (to sound out commands), an ensign (to hold the unit's standard), an additional officer (called ouragos), and a servant. This array of both audial and <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> methods helped to make sure that even in the dust and din of battle orders could still be received and given. Six syntagmata formed a taxis of 1,500 men commanded by a strategos, six taxeis formed a phalanx under a phalangiarch.|$|E
