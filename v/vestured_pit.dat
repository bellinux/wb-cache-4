40|$|Vestures {{are small}} {{projections}} from the secondary cell wall associated with tracheary {{elements of the}} secondary xylem. They are usually associated with bordered pits and characterize various angiosperm families, including important timber species such as Dipterocarpaceae and Eucalyptus trees. The micromorphology and distribution of vestures is studied in 22 species representing all families within the order Myrtales based on light and scanning electron microscopy. Vestures are consistently present near the outer pit aperture of bordered vessel pits, suggesting the synapomorphic character of this feature for the entire order. It is unclear in which geological period this feature originated {{in the evolution of}} the pre-Myrtalean lineages. In some species vestures are associated with inner pit apertures, inner vessel walls, simple perforation plates, depressions of the cell wall, and bordered pits of tracheids or fibre-tracheids. A compact network of branched vestures almost completely filling the entire pit chamber is the most common <b>vestured</b> <b>pit</b> type in Myrtales, although considerable variation may occur within a wood sample. The micromorphology of vestures seems to some extent correlated with quantitative pit characters.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> in angiosperms is briefly reviewed. In some major clades, {{the character is}} of constant occurrence and thus very conservative; in others, it is more variable and apparently subject to both parallel origins and reversible losses. There is a striking correlation between the type of vessel perforation plate and <b>vestured</b> <b>pits.</b> Virtually all taxa with <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> have simple perforation plates. This correlation, together with contrasting ecological trends for scalariform perforation plates and <b>vestured</b> <b>pits,</b> has inspired functional hypotheses that <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> contribute to hydraulic safety. Whereas scalariform perforations may be instrumental in reducing the effects of freezing-induced embolisms in temperate to boreal and alpine regions, <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> {{seem to be a}} good candidate to facilitate embolism reversal in xeric and warmer regions with high transpiration rates. The presence of highly lignified structures within the pit chamber may influence hydraulic resistance, decrease vulnerability to cavitation, or help to repair embolism by compartmentalizing or affecting the contact angle of the convex air-water interface within intervessel pits. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> in secondary xylem reveals interesting patterns that may bear on hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships within eudicots. <b>Vestured</b> <b>pits</b> {{are found to}} be relatively widespread {{at the base of the}} eurosids I, eurosids II, and euasterids I, but the feature probably has been lost or originated independently in several more derived branches of these clades. <b>Vestured</b> <b>pits</b> characterise orders Myrtales and Gentianales sensu APG; other large monophyletic taxa that consistently show <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> include Malpighiaceae, Polygonaceae, Brassicaceae, and most Fabaceae.

Most vestures are small, unbranched and associated with the outer pit aperture of bordered intervessel pits. The feature {{is likely to have}} originated independently in the distantly related subfamilies Boraginoideae (tribe Lithospermeae) and Ehretioideae. The distribution of vestures in Ehretia agrees with recent molecular phylogenies: (1) species with <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> characterise the Ehretia I group (incl. Rotula), and (2) species with non-vestured pits belong to the Ehretia II group (incl. Carmona). The occurrence of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> in Hydrolea provides additional support for excluding this genus from Hydrophylloideae, since Hydrolea is the only species of this subfamily with <b>vestured</b> <b>pits.</b> Functional advantages of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> promoting parallel evolution of this conservative feature are suggested.

40|$|Bordered pits play an {{important}} role in permitting water flow among adjacent tracheary elements in flowering plants. Variation in the bordered pit structure is suggested to be adaptive in optimally balancing the conflict between hydraulic efficiency (conductivity) and safety from air entry at the pit membrane (air seeding). The possible function of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits,</b> which are bordered pits with protuberances from the secondary cell wall of the pit chamber, could be increased hydraulic resistance or minimized vulnerability to air seeding. These functional hypotheses have to be harmonized with the notion that the vestured or nonvestured nature of pits contains strong phylogenetic signals (i. e., often characterize large species-rich clades with broad ecological ranges). A literature survey of 11, 843 species covering 6, 428 genera from diverse climates indicates that the incidence of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> considerably decreases from tropics to tundra. The highest frequencies of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> occur in deserts and tropical seasonal woodlands. Moreover, a distinctly developed network of branched vestures is mainly restricted to warm habitats in both mesic and dry (sub) tropical lowlands, whereas vestures in woody plants from cold and boreal arctic environments are usually minute and simple. A similar survey of the frequency of exclusively scalariform perforation plates illustrates that the major ecological trend of this feature is opposite that of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits.</b> These findings provide previously undescribed insights suggesting that vessels with <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> and simple perforation plates function as an efficient hydraulic system in plants growing in warm environments with periodical or continuous drought stress. status: publishe...|$|R

Cunn. ex G. Don has been adopted as the test species to investigate the postharvest water relations of the genus Acacia. To understand potential constraints on K-h, xylem conduits in cut A. holosericea stems were anatomically characterised by light and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Vessels with simple perforation plates and tracheids were the principal water conducting cells. Bordered <b>vestured</b> intervessel <b>pits</b> were present in xylem vessel elements. The majority of conduits (89 %) were short at 1 - 5 cmlong. Only 2 % were 15 - 16 cmin length. Mean xylem conduit diameter was 77 +/- 0. 9 mu m and the diameter profile showed a normal distribution, with 29 % of diameters {{in the range of}} 70 - 80 mu m. Simple perforation plates can offer relatively low resistance to water flow. On the other hand, bordered <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> and short xylem conduits can confer comparatively high resistance to water flow. Overall, the presence of bordered <b>vestured</b> <b>pits,</b> together with a high proportion of short xylem conduits and high stomatal densities (232 +/- 2 mm(- 2)) on unifacial phyllodes, could contribute to early dehydration of A. holosericea cut foliage stems standing in vase water.

40|$|Twenty {{collections}} representing {{one species}} each of Symbolanthus and Tachia, and 17 species of Macrocarpaea were studied {{by means of}} light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Wood details show that the three genera form a coherent group; Tachia differs from the others {{in only a few}} minor characters. Because the species studied form a natural group, wood variations within Helieae offer the basis for correlations and interpretations with respect to habit and ecology. Diameter of stems studied proves to be an important variable that must be taken into account. Correlations with stem diameter include wider vessels in outer wood of wider samples. This would correspond to deeper penetration of reliable water tables by roots of helioid trees or large shrubs. Ray height decreases with increase in stem diameter, an indication of paedomorphosis. Rays of all species are paedomorphic in histology by virtue of relative paucity or even absence of procumbent cells in multiseriate rays. Pseusoscalariform lateral wall pitting of vessels is also a feature characteristic of paedomorphosis. The assemblage of paedomorphic features correlates well with the conclusion, reached by authors who used cladistic methods, that Gentianaceae other than Gentianeae are derived from suffrutescent prennials. The Mesomorphy Ratio, which incorporates three vessel features, correlates with leaf length and with stem diameter. All Helieae are mesophytic, but to various degrees. Septate fiber-tracheids, where present, are typically near vessels and form a substitute for or an addendum to vasicentric axial parenchyma as a mechanism for photosynthate storage. <b>Vestured</b> <b>pits</b> occur on lateral wall pits of vessels of all Helieae, but not on the fibertracheids. <b>Vestured</b> <b>pits</b> show diversity within Macrocarpaea, a feature of possible systematic significance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Vestured</b> <b>pits</b> {{are present}} on pits of {{secondary}} xylem vessels of all studied Echium species, roots {{as well as}} stems. Variations in vesturing presence do occur in the genus (across wide circular pit cavities; along margins of elliptical pit apertures; aggregated to various degrees; variously abundant), but these are difficult to define precisely and are related primarily to organography and ecology {{rather than to the}} taxonomic system. The Macaronesian species have been reported to form a single clade. Wood anatomical features other than vesturing are also closely keyed to species ecology and, in particular subclades, growth forms. Woodiness, exemplified by most species of the insular clade of Echium, has been claimed to have evolved as a mechanism to promote outcrossing on islands. This alleged indirect selection is questioned here. The bases for secondary woodiness on island areas are multiple and are reviewed here (lessened temperature and moisture extremes; retention of branches instead of reproducing by seed as a form of economy; lack of mammalian herbivores; superior dispersal and colonization abilities of less woody clades; ability to occupy geologically new or recently altered areas). These features may, individually and collectively, serve to increase the ability of species to become woody on islands. Vesture presence can be cited for some groups that have radiated well on Macaronesian islands (Boraginaceae, Brassicaceae) as well as on certain major land areas (Acacia and Eucalyptus on Australia all have <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> on vessels). Plant species can be viewed as having an umbrella of features relevant to woodiness and growth form, with thresholds in tolerance of cold, drought, etc. In an island environment, there is alleviation, moderation, and transcendence of these thresholds and restrictions so that survival of vegetative structures into the next growing season is achieved. Advantageous radiation into new growth forms is made possible by this extension of the growing season...|$|R

40|$|Part I: Systematic {{distribution}} of pit membrane thickenings and vesturesChapter 1 : The micromorphology of pit membranes in tracheary elements of Ericales: new records of tori or pseudo-tori?Intervascular pit membranes were examined within Ericales {{to determine the}} distribution and structure of torus-like thickenings. Forty-nine species representing 12 families of the order Ericales were investigated using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. They were compared with four species of Oleaceae to determine {{the true nature of}} the thickenings. Pit membranes with torus-like thickenings were observed in seven species of Ericaceae and were found to be amorphous, plasmodesmata associated structures with an irregular distribution. These pseudo-tori show major differences compared to true tori with respect to their distribution, ultrastructure and chemical composition. Genuine tori, which are strongly correlated with round pit apertures in narrow tracheary elements, were found in two species of Osmanthus (Oleaceae). The pseudo-tori found in some Ericaceae are considered to be similar to pit membrane thickenings previously recorded in Rosaceae. While true tori appear to be functionally significant in terms of efficiency and safety of water transport, the possible function of pseudo-tori could be associated with the role of plasmodesmata during differentiation of tracheids, fibre-tracheids or narrow vessels. Chapter 2 : Micromorphology and systematic {{distribution of}} pit membrane thickenings in Oleaceae: tori and pseudo-toriRecent studies on the functional significance of pit membranes in water conducting cells have renewed general interest in their micromorphology. At least two types of pit membrane thickenings have been described in angiosperm families, i. e. genuine tori and pseudo-tori. This study explores the distribution and morphology of pit membrane thickenings in 69 species and 23 genera within Oleaceae using light and electron microscopy. Torus-bearing pit membranes are confirmed for Osmanthus, and new records are reported for Chionanthus retusa, Picconia azorica, and P. excelsa, but not for the other species of Chionanthus studied. This intrageneric variation suggests that tori represent a plastic feature that has evolved more than once within the family as the result of functional adaptation to efficient and safe water transport. Pseudo-tori are observed in species of Abeliophyllum, Fontanesia, Forsythia, Jasminum, Ligustrum, Menodora, and Syringa. Based on structural differences, we state that tori and pseudo-tori can be distinguished as non-homologous features. Chapter 3 : Torus-bearing pit membranes in species of OsmanthusTorus thickenings of pit membranes are found not only in gymnosperms, but also in certain genera of eudicots. One such genus is Osmanthus. Wood from 17 species of Osmanthus was examined for tori. Fourteen species from three of the four sections investigated showed torus thickenings. Ten of the species represent new records. Only the three New Caledonian species of section Notosmanthus lacked tori. This observation in combination with other characters suggests us to separate this section from the remainder of the genus. Chapter 4 : The phylogenetic significance of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> in BoraginaceaeThe bordered pit structure in tracheary elements of 105 Boraginaceae species is studied using scanning electron microscopy to examine the systematic distribution of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits.</b> Forty-three species out of 16 genera show a uniform presence of this feature throughout their secondary xylem. Most vestures are small, unbranched and associated with the outer pit aperture of bordered intervessel pits. The feature is likely to have originated independently in the distantly related subfamilies Boraginoideae (tribe Lithospermeae) and Ehretioideae. The distribution of vestures in Ehretia agrees with recent molecular phylogenies: (1) species with <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> characterise the Ehretia I group (incl. Rotula), and (2) species with non-vestured pits belong to the Ehretia II group (incl. Carmona). The occurrence of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> in Hydrolea provides additional support for excluding this genus from Hydrophylloideae, since Hydrolea is the only genus of this subfamily with <b>vestured</b> <b>pits.</b> Functional advantages of <b>vestured</b> <b>pits</b> are suggested to promote parallel evolution of this conservative feature, although the exact hydraulic benefits of poorly developed vestures remain unknown. Part II: Development of pseudo-toriChapter 5 : The ultrastructure and development of pit membranes with plasmodesmata associated thickenings in xylem elementsRecent micromorphological observations of angiosperm pit membranes have extended the range of taxa with pseudo-tori in tracheary elements. Since developmental studies on pseudo-tori have only been conducted on Pyrus and Sorbus (Rosaceae), it is unclear whether all pseudo-tori in angiosperms develop in a similar way and whether they are homologous structures. We studied the ontogeny of pseudo-tori using transmission electron microscopy in four species belonging to four different orders of flowering plants: Malus yunnanensis, Ligustrum vulgare, Pittosporum tenuifolium, and Vaccinium myrtillus. The developmental patterns observed in these four species are similar. A primary thickening is formed when the secondary cell wall formation is initiated followed by the deposition of a secondary cap. After hydrolysis of the pit membrane, the cap becomes persistent, partially covering the pit membrane. Our observations do not fully corroborate the earlier ontogenetic studies in Rosaceae. The formation of the primary thickening in Pyrus and Sorbus is completed before the secondary cell wall formation is initiated, which is not the case in our study. This developmental difference questions the homologous nature of pseudo-tori throughout the flowering plants. Part III: Structure-function relationships of bordered pits in angiosperm vesselsChapter 6 : Wood anatomical features associated with cavitation resistance across 10 species of PrunusWood of 10 Prunus species that were hydraulically studied by Cochard et al. (2008) were examined to study structure-function trade-offs regarding vulnerability to drought-induced cavitation. A detailed study of hydraulically relevant characters is conducted using light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Vessel network characters are most important in explaining cavitation resistance (quantified as P 50 value). Strong relations are demonstrated between P 50 and vessel grouping indices (VG, VS), vessel contact characters (FC), and vessel dimension characters (DH, LV). The most drought resistant Prunus species in our study tend to show vessels that are less grouped and more solitary than the more vulnerable species. Our results support the theoretical model on vessel connectivity of Loepfe et al. (2007), but provide no evidence for Carlquists vessel grouping hypothesis. At the pit level however, we found a strong negative correlation between P 50 and the thickness of intervessel pit membranes, although this correlation was not found significant and was not supported in PCA. No other pit related character (including AP) was found to be related with P 50. This is surprising since the rare pit hypothesis, linking P 50 with AP, is was originally formulated based on observations in Rosaceae (incl. Prunus), this hypothesis could not be fully corroborated in our study. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{micromorphology}} of pits in {{tracheary elements}} was examined in 35 species representing 29 genera of Rosaceae and related families {{to evaluate the}} assumption that angiosperm pits are largely invariant. In most Rosaceae, pit membranes between fibers and tracheids frequently appear to have amorphous thickenings with an irregular distribution. Although these structures are toruslike under the light microscope, observations by electron microscopy illustrate that they represent ‘‘pseudotori’’ or plasmodesmata-associated thickenings. These thickenings frequently extend from {{the periphery of the}} pit membrane and form a cap-like, hollow structure. Pseudotori are occasionally found in few Elaeagnaceae and Rhamnaceae and appear to be related to species with fiber-tracheids and/or tracheids. True tori are strongly associated with round to oval pit apertures and are consistently present in narrow tracheary elements of Cercocarpus (Rosaceae), Planera (Ulmaceae), and ring-porous species of Ulmus and Zelkova (Ulmaceae). <b>Vestured</b> <b>pits</b> with homogenous pit membranes are reported for Hemiptelea (Ulmaceae).

The taxa examined share short vessel elements, exclusively simple perforation plates and <b>vestured</b> intervessel <b>pits,</b> i. e. the wood traits that are typical {{for many other}} genera of Papilionoideae. The loss of helical thickenings may {{be considered as a}} synapomorphy for Crotalarieae, with a reversal to this character state within Lotononis. Generally, the pattern of wood structure diversity within the Crotalarieae is related more to the growth habits of the plants and probably to environmental factors than to their taxonomy or phylogenetic relationships. All genera (except Crotalaria) and practically all species studied showed diagonal to dendritic arrangement of vessel groups, up to their fusion into large dendritic aggregations in Calobota species from arid (non-fynbos) regions. Some species from karroid scrubs (Calobota angustifolia, Calobota cytisoides) and fynbos (Aspalathus excelsa, Aspalathus linearis, Aspalathus nigra) show no dendritic vessel pattern, however. The banded axial parenchyma appears independently in three lineages of Crotalarieae, i. e. in Aspalathus+Wiborgia+Wiborgiella, Rafnia, and in crown species of Calobota.

In it, he gives a series of classifications of Malayan woods {{on the basis of}} anatomical features which can be seen by a hand-lens, he distinguishes 18 classes, notably woods with: ring-porous structure, exclusively solitary pores, multiple vessel-perforation, <b>vestured</b> (vessel) <b>pits,</b> scalariform intervessel pits, ripple marks, broad rays, uniseriate rays, septate fibres, distinctly bordered fibre pits, tanniferous tribes, latex tribes, horizontal canals, vertical canals, included phloem, mucilage or oil cells, silica inclusion, raphides...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: According to the {{air-seeding}} hypothesis, embolism vulnerability in xylem elements {{is linked}} directly to bordered pit structure and functioning. To elucidate the adaptive potential of intervessel pits towards fluctuating environmental conditions, two mangrove species {{with a distinct}} ecological distribution growing along a natural salinity gradient were investigated. Methods: Scanning and transmission electron microscopic observations were conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative characteristics of alternate intervessel pits in A. marina and scalariform intervessel pits in Rhizophora mucronata. Wood samples from three to six trees were collected at seven and five sites for A. marina and R. mucronata, respectively, with considerable differences between sites in soil water salinity. Key Results: <b>Vestured</b> <b>pits</b> without visible pores in the pit membrane were observed in A. marina, the mangrove species with the widest geographical distribution on global {{as well as local}} scale. Their thick pit membranes (on average 370 nm) and minute pit apertures may contribute to reduced vulnerability to cavitation of this highly salt-tolerant species. The smaller ecological distribution of R. mucronata was in accordance with wide pit apertures and a slightly higher pitfield fraction (67 % vs. 60 % in A. marina). Nonetheless, its outer pit apertures were observed to be funnel-shaped shielding non-porous pit membranes. No trends in intervessel pit size were observed with increasing soil water salinity of the site. Conclusions: The contrasting ecological distribution of two mangrove species was reflected in the geometry and pit membrane characteristics of their intervessel pits. Within species, intervessel pit size seemed to be independent of spatial variations in environmental conditions and was only weakly correlated with vessel diameter. Further research on pit formation and function has to clarify the large variations in intervessel pit size within trees and even within single vessels...|$|R
40|$|The {{climate of}} the top end of the Northern Territory is {{dominated}} by alternating wet and dry seasons. Trees of the Northern Territory have developed a variety of responses to this seasonal climate, including a range of leaf phenologies (evergreen, semi-deciduous, brevi-deciduous and deciduous). These phenological groups differ in their anatomical and physiological characteristics. This study investigated the relationship between vessel anatomy and susceptibility to drought induced xylem cavitations. Xylem vessel characteristics were compared among deciduous and evergreen species growing in seasonally dry forests near Darwin. Vessel diameter, vessel length, vessel element length, vessel density and pit membrane pore dimeters were measured in six evergreen and six deciduous species and one coniferous species. This study also examined the linkage between hydraulic conductance, vulnerability to xylem embolism and vessel diameter in deciduous and evergreen species. Deciduous species had {{a greater proportion of}} vessels with large diameters than did evergreen species. The mean vessel diameters in (branches, petioles and mid-ribs) were larger in deciduous species (50 μm ± 1. 7, 28 μm ± 1. 56, 28 μm ± 2. 1) than evergreen species (32 μm ± 0. 6, 18 μm ± 1. 2, 18 μm ± 1. 1). The mean pit membrane pores diameter in deciduous species (0. 49 μm± 0. 34) was larger than in evergreen species (0. 24. μm ± 0. 15). The average hydraulic conductivity in branch of deciduous species (0. 03 g m s- 1 MPa- 1) was larger than in evergreen species (0. 01 g m s- 1 MPa- 1). These results support the conclusion that since deciduous species only have to conduct water during the wet season, their large xylem vessels with large pit membrane pores, which confer relatively larger hydraulic conductivity do not expose the canopy to an unacceptably high risk of xylem cavitation. By contrast, evergreen trees must transport water during more extreme dry season conditions, when they would potentially be more susceptible to xylem embolism. To protect against this, they have developed vessels with generally smaller diameters and with small pit membrane pores or <b>vestured</b> <b>pits...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} wood anatomy as {{it relates}} to safranine solution penetration in Samanea saman, which belongs to the family Mimosoideae and is native to Bangladesh. The wood of this species was characterized by diffuse-porous vessels with simple perforations, alternate and opposite <b>vestured</b> intervessel <b>pits,</b> gums in heartwood vessels, vascicentric paratracheal axial parenchyma, lozenge-aliform, confluent prismatic crystals in fiber, and chambered axial parenchyma cells. Different anatomical features affect longitudinal and lateral liquid permeability. Herein microstructures that controlled liquid penetration are described and compared. We observed that ray cell lumen diameter, end-wall pit number and diameter, ray cell length, vessel number, and both vessel and fiber diameter and length affected the depth of liquid flow. Safranine solution formed a meniscus while traveling through different types of cells. Air trapped in capillaries blocked safranine solution penetration. Following a go-stop-go cycle, the speed of penetration slowly decreased over time. Key Words: Wood anatomy, hardwood, safranine solution, meniscus, capillary phenomeno...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for 11 collections of eight taxa. Diameter {{and length of}} tracheids are related to plant size, but populations in cooler locations have narrower and shorter tracheids than one would expect {{on the basis of}} plant size and age, and smaller tracheids are believed to be of selective value in these environments because of their resistance to embolisms. Vesturing is absent from tracheids in taxa from warmer localities but pronounced in colder places; this, too, is a probable mechanism for resistance to embolism formation. Helical thickenings are reported for one collection of T. insipida; these thickenings, otherwise known in the family only from Pseudowintera, may play a role similar to <b>vesturing.</b> Scalariform <b>pitting</b> on end walls of tracheids occurs during {{the first three years of}} secondary xylem formation, and may also occur after cambial trauma. Axial parenchyma is scarce to absent, and diffuse when present. Rays in Tasmannia wood have relatively few procumbent cells. A summary wood description for the family is presented, and a key to the eight genera is given. Although wood anatomy does contain some features of generic value, data from floral morphology, pollen structure, and leaf anatomy more strongly support the recognition of eight genera. Some species have very distinctive features, but genera are difficult to define; pending acquisition of chemical data, eight genera may be provisionally recognized. The only feature considered as a possible phylogenetic trend in wood within the family is an increased tendency for alternate pits to supplant scalariform pits on end walls of tracheids. Tracheids of Winteraceae demonstrate that scalariform pitting is pervasive and preserved in a flexible way; alternate pits are hypothesized to have been evolved in the family for increased wall strength. Ecological correlations, presented for the entirety of the family, are much like those shown within Tasmannia...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} pressure difference (DeltaP) on intervessel pit membrane porosity was studied in two angiosperm tree species with differing pit architecture. Fraxinus americana L. possesses typical angiosperm bordered pit structure while Sophora japonica L. exhibits well-developed <b>vestures</b> in intervessel <b>pit</b> chambers. It was hypothesized (a) that large DeltaP across intervessel pits {{would cause the}} deflection of pit membranes in the stems of F. americana resulting in significant increases in porosity and thus lower cavitation thresholds, and (b) {{that the presence of}} vestures would prevent the deflection of pit membranes in S. japonica. To determine if the porosity of pit membranes increased under mechanical stress, suspensions of colloidal gold, 5 nm and 20 nm in diameter, were perfused across intervessel pit membranes at DeltaP ranging from 0. 25 MPa to 6. 0 MPa. The effect of increasing DeltaP on membrane porosity was also tested by comparing air seeding thresholds (P-a) in stems perfused with water or a solution with lower surface tension. Air seeding and colloidal gold experiments indicated that pit membrane porosity increased significantly with DeltaP in F. americana. In S. japonica, increases in permeability to colloidal gold with DeltaP were small and maximum pore diameters predicted from P-a were independent of DeltaP, suggesting that vestures limited {{the degree to which the}} membrane can be deflected from the centre of the pit cavity. This provides the first experimental evidence that vestures reduce the probability of air seeding through pit membranes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Acacia holosericea A. Cunn. Ex G. Don (Velvet Leaf Wattle, Family Mimosaceae) is {{indigenous}} to Australia and holds promise as a novel cut foliage crop {{due to its}} silvery green silky phyllodes. Insufficient water uptake, possibly due to low stem hydraulic conductivity (Kh), is potentially responsible for early wilting and desiccation of phyllodes and limiting vase life. This study aimed to characterize the anatomy of stem xylem conduits and determine cation (K+ and Ca 2 +) mediated stem Kh. Differential localization of Ca 2 + in xylem vessels {{and the effects of}} KCl and CaCl 2 salts as cation contributors in vase solutions were also evaluated for their effects on cut foliage longevity. Anatomical characteristics of stem xylem conduits were studied using light, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Tracheids and vessels with simple perforation plates were the principal water conducting cells. SEM and TEM revealed bordered <b>vestured</b> intervessel <b>pits</b> in xylem conduits. Vestures were branched and coralloid-like structures. Xylem conduit lengths were assessed by ink perfusion. The majority of conduits (89 %) were short (1 to 5 cm), and only ~ 2 % were long (15 to 16 cm). Mean conduit diameter was 77 ± 0. 9 µm, with 29 % of conduits in the range 70 to 80 µm. Effects of S-carvone (0, 0. 318, and 0. 636 mM), a monoterpene inhibitor of wound-healing enzyme inhibitor found in caraway (Carum carvi) and dill (Anethum graveoleus) seeds, on several native Australian, non-proteaceous cut flower and foliage species including A. holosericea (Mimosaceae), Baeckea frutescens (Myrtaceae), Chamelaucium uncinatum cv. ‘Mullering Brook’ (Myrtaceae), and the non-native Chrysanthemum sp. cv. ‘Dark Splendid Reagan’ (Asteraceae) were examined. As comparator treatments regular recutting of stem ends and use of standard tap water (STW: 0. 7 mM CaCl 2, 1. 5 mM NaHCO 3, and 0. 05 mM CuSO 4 in vases) were tested. S-Carvone treatments significantly (P≤ 0. 05) extended the vase life of B. frutescens and C. uncinatum, constituting the first report of positive S-carvone effects on the vase life of Myrtaceous species. S-Carvone at 0. 318 and 0. 636 mM did not have antibacterial effects against Bacillus cereus (the main vase solution microbe) either in vitro or in the vase solution. Regular recutting of stem ends consistently improved all vase life parameters [viz. relative fresh weight (RFW), solution uptake, and vase life] in the three native species examined. STW had a positive effect on RFW and solution uptake only for A. holosericea cut foliage. Effects of di- and monovalent cations (Ca 2 + as CaCl 2 and K+ as KCl) on stem Kh of cut stem segments were studied. Abundance of Ca 2 + on pit membranes versus xylem lumen wall surfaces was investigated using a novel low vacuum (LV) SEM plus energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis technique. Both salts (0. 1, 1, 10, and 100 mM KCl or CaCl 2) did not significantly increase stem Kh compared to the corresponding deionised (DI) water controls (experiment 1). Highest increase in Kh was with KCl and CaCl 2 at 10 and 1 mM, respectively. Increases in Kh with 100 mM KCl and CaCl 2 were significant over DI water (experiment 2) for long (10 and 20 cm) and short (2 and 5 cm) stem segments, respectively. Increases in Kh of 1. 2 - and 2. 4 -fold for 100 mM KCl over DI water were found with increasing stem length from 2 to 20 cm. Kh decreased as stem segment length increased from 5 to 20 cm. However, contrasting results were found with 100 mM CaCl 2, where ΔKh was larger in shorter (2 cm) than longer (20 cm) segments. To prevent dislocation of ions and distortion damage to the specimens, stem pieces were first LV freeze-dried, and then carbon-coated, viewed under SEM, and analysed for elemental composition and distribution by EDX. However, the method could not identify specific calcium peaks in xylem vessels perhaps because background signals were too high, and tissue topography interfered with signal detection. Effects of KCl and CaCl 2 on vase life were also tested. RFW, solution uptake, and vase life were higher with 10 mM KCl and CaCl 2 in the vase solution than with 0, 1, and 100 mM. STW had a significant (P≤ 0. 05) positive effect on RFW and solution uptake rate when tested against deionised water, 10 mM KCl and 10 mM CaCl 2. Different combinations of 0. 05 mM CuSO 4, 10 mM CaCl 2, and 10 mM KCl were also tested as vase solutions. A significant positive effect on RFW and vase life was obtained with CuSO 4 alone, CaCl 2 alone, and CuSO 4 plus KCl. Only CuSO 4 and CaCl 2 gave a significant positive effect on solution uptake rate. None of the eight treatments tested showed a consistent effect on stomatal conductance or stem Kh. Overall, the research revealed that tracheids and vessels with simple perforation plates and bordered <b>vestured</b> intervessel <b>pits</b> are the principal water conducting cells in A. holosericea. LV-SEM-EDX technique was unable to assess the spatial distribution of Ca 2 + on xylem vessels, {{but this was the first}} attempt to apply this technique. Also, this is the first report on the extension of vase life of B. frutescens and C. uncinatum (Myrtaceous species) using S-carvone. In vase solutions, 0. 05 mM CuSO 4, 10 mM KCl plus 0. 05 mM CuSO 4 and 10 mM CaCl 2 should have positive influences on the water balance of A. holosericea cut foliage stems...|$|R
