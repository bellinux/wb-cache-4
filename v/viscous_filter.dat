40|$|A novel mode of {{operation}} for electrofiltration is presented. The newly developed operation procedure allows for cake removal without disassembling the chamber. Highly <b>viscous</b> <b>filter</b> cakes are discharged from the filtration chamber by inserting air which permits a rapid restart of the process. The cleaning time could be reduced from about 10 [*]min to a few seconds. The semicontinuous operation is liable to full automation and allows for cake discharge and filtration {{in a short period}} of time. In successive cycles was proved that the process efficiency is maintained using the same membrane. A fully continuous system can be accomplished by assembling several units in parallel in a single filtration press.

40|$|Electrostatic {{filtration}} media (electret) {{has been used}} in many applications due to its ability to efficiently collect submicron particles while maintaining a low pressure drop. Filter face velocities have ranged from 0. 01 - 0. 5 m/s in previous studies. However, in this study, measurements were conducted from 0. 5 - 2. 5 m/s, a region where Reynolds numbers range from 0. 05 - 0. 24. Within this regime, commonly used filtration theory is incomplete and does not predict performance of electret media, therefore data must be measured. Experimental measurements were conducted in various combinations of charge and neutralized filter media with aerosolized particles possessing the Boltzmann charge distribution or zero charge. Collection efficiency of the charged FiltreteTM media was significantly higher than the FiltreteTM which had been charged neutralized. As filter face velocity increased, however, collection efficiency decreased in the electret media. As filter face velocity increased for the neutralized media, collection efficiency increased due to inertial impaction. Particle bounce was assumed to occur with particles of aerodynamic diameter ≥ 400 nm. Electrostatic attraction, i. e. Coulombic, polarization and image forces were analyzed based on experimental data. The Coulombic force had the greatest effect on efficiency at all three filter face velocities, followed by the polarization force. The effect of image forces was negligible for all three filter face velocities. This study provides unique empirical data outside of the <b>viscous</b> <b>filter</b> flow regime, data which is useful in the design of, and performance prediction of, high volume commercial and industrial applications, such as HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. The data presented can be used to “validate” numerical models for filtration at moderate Reynolds numbers where data is scarce for electrostatically charged filtration.

40|$|Viscous {{morphological}} operators {{have shown}} very good performance in regularizing various image analysis {{tasks such as}} detection of intensity-varying boundaries and segmentation. This paper presents a novel formulation of viscous morphological operators as solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) of the hyperbolic type with level-varying speed. Efficient numerical algorithms are also developed to solve these PDEs and generate the viscous operations. It also generalizes the viscous operators by studying the class of intensity level-varying operators, of which special cases are intensity adaptive connected operators such as volume openings and <b>viscous</b> reconstruction <b>filters.</b> We present both theoretical aspects and applications of the above ideas. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} pretopological {{image filtering}} {{in the context}} of the General Adaptive Neighborhood Image Processing (GANIP) approach. Pretopological filters act on gray level image while satisfying some topological properties. The GANIP approach enables to get an image representation and mathematical structure for adaptive image processing and analysis. Then, the combination of pretopology and GANIP leads to efficient image operators. They enable to process images while preserving region structures without damaging image transitions. More precisely, GAN-based pretopological <b>filters</b> and GAN-based <b>viscous</b> pretopological <b>filters</b> are proposed in this paper. The viscous notion enables to adjust the filtering activity to the image gray levels. These adaptive filters are evaluated through several experiments highlighting their efficiency with respect to the classical operators. They are practically applied in both the biomedical and material application areas for image restoration, image background subtraction and image enhancement...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a 3 D {{morphological}} composition of transformations for brain extraction on brain Magnetic Resonance Images T 1 (MRI T 1) is presented. The proposal {{makes use of}} two morphological connected transformations, the lower leveling and a family of the <b>viscous</b> alternating sequential <b>filters</b> (VASFs). The properties of these operators-which consist in {{the control of the}} reconstruction process of a marker into the original image-, are exploited to segment the brain in 20 volumes of MRI T 1. The segmented brains are compared with respect to: i) the segmentations obtained from BET which is popular among the scientific community for segmenting the brain; and ii) manual segmentations. The computed indices indicate that the proposed transformation produces good results during its performance. The consumed time for the algorithm during the execution is acceptable and it can be implemented in Matlab...|$|R
50|$|To {{extract the}} alginate, the seaweed is broken into pieces and stirred {{with a hot}} {{solution}} of an alkali, usually sodium carbonate. Over {{a period of about}} two hours, the alginate dissolves as sodium alginate to give a very thick slurry. This slurry also contains the part of the seaweed that does not dissolve, mainly cellulose. This insoluble residue must be removed from the solution. The solution is too thick (<b>viscous)</b> to be <b>filtered</b> and must be diluted with a very large quantity of water. After dilution, the solution is forced through a filter cloth in a filter press. However, the pieces of undissolved residue are very fine and can quickly clog the filter cloth. Therefore, before filtration is started, a filter aid, such as diatomaceous earth, must be added; this holds most of the fine particles away {{from the surface of the}} filter cloth and facilitates filtration. However, filter aid is expensive and can make a significant contribution to costs. To reduce the quantity of filter aid needed, some processors force air into the extract as it is being diluted with water (the extract and diluting water are mixed in an in-line mixer into which air is forced). Fine air bubbles attach themselves to the particles of residue. The diluted extract is left standing for several hours while the air rises to the top, taking the residue particles with it. This frothy mix of air and residue is removed from the top and the solution is withdrawn from the bottom and pumped to the filter.|$|R
40|$|Author: Sosnick Lab, University of Chicago ### Description For protein concentration, gas {{pressure}} is applied directly to ultrafiltration cell. Solutes above the membrane's molecular weight (MW) cut-off are retained in cell, while water and solutes below the cut-off {{pass into the}} filtrate and out of cell. ![Table]([URL] "`Table 1 ") ### Membranes 1. YM 10 Ø 43 mm (for 8050), Amicon # 13622, 10 pack: $ 108 - YM 10 Ø 76 mm (for 8400), Amicon # 13642, 10 pack: $ 139 - **Prewash**: float membrane with glossy side down in beaker with distilled water for at least 1 hour changing water 3 times. All membranes are pretreated with glycerine to prevent drying, YM membranes are treated with sodium azide as a preservative. - **Cleaning**: rinse with 0. 1 M NaOH, followed by thorough flushing with distilled water. For strongly absorbed protein, soak in 0. 1 % protease solution and rinse thoroughly. - **Storage**: for reuse, store membranes in 10 % ethanol water solution at 4 °C. ### Assembly 1. Place membrane in holder, **shiny side up**; then place O-ring on top of membrane. Gently push O-ring down so that it contacts and seats membrane evenly in bottom of holder. **Handle membrane by its edges to avoid scratching or contaminating surface**. - Fit membrane holder into cell body, aligning tabs on sides of holder with slots in base of cell body. - Invert cell body and membrane holder; screw base firmly into bottom of cell body. A definite "stop" will be felt when base and body are fully engaged. Top of membrane holder will be flush with bottom of slots in cell body. - Push filtrate exit tubing onto exit spout of membrane support. - Place stirrer assembly into cell body. When properly installed, arms of stirrer assembly will rest on small ridge inside top of cell body. - Introduce sample into cell. - With a twisting motion, push cap down onto cell body, orienting gas inlet port on cap opposite filtrate exit port on holder. If cap assembly does not slide easily, lubricate O-ring lightly with petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to contact membrane!** - Set pressure-relief valve to horizontal (open) position. - Slide cell into retaining stand, fitting ring on cell base into hole in stand. Flattened edges on bottom flange of cap ensures that cell is inserted properly and prevents rotation of cell once inside stand. - Turn pressure-relief valve to vertical (closed) position. - Attach {{gas pressure}} line. ### Operation 1. Place cell on magnetic stirring table. - Connect inlet line to regulated gas pressure source (Nitrogen gas is recommended for pressurizing cell! Use of compressed air can cause large pH shifts due to dissolution of carbon dioxide. With sensitive solutions, oxidation can also occur, leading to other potential problems.) - Hold cell steady on the stirring table and pressurize according to instructions in membrane package. Generally ** 55 psi** (3. 7 kg/cm 2) is optimal, maximal 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) nitrogen gas pressure. Cap assembly moves upward, forming a secure lock with retaining stand once system is pressurized. - Turn on stirring table and adjust stirring rate until the vortex created is approximately one-third {{the depth of the}} liquid volume. - Monitor concentration. Do not allow retentate to run through. - Collect permeate. - Highly <b>viscous</b> solutions <b>filter</b> slowly, as do solutions containing particulate matter, such as colloids. Where the viscous agent (sucrose, glycerin, etc.) is to be removed, flow can often be increased by predilution. - **Prefilter or centrifuge** any solution containing particulate matter, such as cell debris or precipitates. - To maximize recovery of retained substances, continue stirring for a few minutes after depressurization. This will resuspend the polarized layer at the membrane surface. - When finished, turn off nitrogen pressure source and stirring table. - Vent pressure inside cell by slowly turning pressure-relief knob to horizontal position. Push cap down, then slide cell out from retaining stand. *Note: Overly rapid depressurization can cause the membrane to buckle up and rupture*. - Using a twisting motion, remove cell cap and the magnetic stirrer assembly. Always remove the cell top with the pressure-relief valve set to the horizontal (open) position. Removal in vertical (closed) position can create a partial vacuum which can rupture the membrane! Pour out solution. - Disassemble cell, then wash all components with a mild detergent/water solution, then rinse thoroughly. Caustic cleaning solutions may damage the anodized aluminum retaining stand. Leave ultrafiltration cell disassembled whenever it is unlikely to be used for several weeks. ### Limits - max. cell operating **pressure**: 75 psi (5. 3 kg/cm 2) - max. membrane operating pressure: 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) - pressure-relief valve preset: 90 psi (6. 3 kg/cm 2) - Although brief exposure to higher **temperatures** is possible, do not operate cell continuously above 85 °C (185 °F). - **pH** 2 to 10 - Do not use the following **chemicals**: Ketones (including acetone), Aromatic hydrocarbons (including toluene), Cellosolvers, Halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, Aliphatic esters, DMSO, Polar Aromatics. *Note:The spring in the pressure-relief valve is not compatible with 0. 1 N NaOH*. ### Sterilization Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cells can be autoclaved at 121 °C (250 °F) for 30 minutes. They are compatible with standard sterilizing gas mixtures, 70 % ethanol, isopropanol or 5 % formalin. **CAUTION**: Tighten the base partially before autoclaving. ### Maintenance - Replace O-rings {{at the first sign of}} damage or wear. - If installation or removal of cap assembly becomes difficult, lubricate cap O-ring with a small amount of petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to come in contact with membrane!** - Check stirrer periodically for rough edges that could possibly damage the membrane. - Replace transparent body immediately should it become cracked or crazed. ### Troubleshooting **Little or no filtrate obtained:** 1. Rotate pressure-relief valve to check for pressure. If not pressurized, check nitrogen source and regulator. - Make sure glossy side of disc membrane faces up. - If sample solution is highly viscous due to microsolutes, either dilute or diafilter to increase flow rate. - Check membrane holder and filtrate port for blockage. **Filtrate rate abnormally high:** 1. Check membrane for lesions, scratches, or roughness. - Make sure correct membrane type is being used. - Check stirrer assembly to ensure that stirring bar is not contacting the membrane surface. **Cell leaks:** 1. Be sure lower O-ring rests entirely on the membrane peripheral surface. - Check O-rings for nicks and cuts. - Make sure membrane support is seated properly, and that the base is screwed in firmly. - Make sure O-rings are not squeezed out of slots. - Check fittings on gas inlet tubing for correct order and position...|$|R
