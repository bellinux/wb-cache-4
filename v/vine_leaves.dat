5|$|Initially, as {{in some of}} the {{continental}} cathedrals, the interior was decorated with designs emphasizing the arch ribs and portal components. Even the brick was painted with red and white stripes. In the 15th century, frescos of figures in the Late Gothic style with decorative <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> were painted {{in various parts of the}} church. Traces of these have been found in the chancel and in the chapel which was originally dedicated to St Eric and St Olaf. Unfortunately, they have now been heavily restored. The frescos in the chancel were probably painted by Albertus Pictor's workshop.|$|E

25|$|The most {{remarkable}} feature is their decorative motifs roughly divided in six groups which complement each other: social simbols, religious simbols, images of posthumous kolo, figural images, clear ornaments, and unclassified motifs (mostly simbolic, geometrical, or damaged). Many of them remain enigmatic to this day; spirals, arcades, rosettes, <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> and grapes, lilium, stars (often six-pointed) and crescent Moons {{are among the}} images that appear. Figural images include processions of deer, horse, dancing the kolo, hunting, chivalric tournaments, and, most famously, {{the image of the}} man with his right hand raised, perhaps in a gesture of fealty.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} space has six-bay arcades with shafted piers, between the clerestory windows are canopied niches with archangels holding shields. The roof has traceried spandrels, the chancel has transomed windows, the sedilia {{is decorated with}} cusped arches and a frieze of <b>vine</b> <b>leaves.</b> The reredos is 15th century and contains seven ornamental canopied niches containing statues of 1933. Restorations were carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1856-57 and 1861–62 and by Sir Thomas Graham Jackson in 1894, the parapet and pinnacles are mostly Scott's work. De Brome's chapel has a two-bay arcade with continuous hollow chamfered arches with Perpendicular windows. The tall arch in this aisle, connecting with the tower is a 15th-century remodelling of a late 13th century window.|$|E
25|$|Greek cuisine is {{characteristic}} of the healthy Mediterranean diet, which is epitomized by dishes of Crete. Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients {{into a variety of}} local dishes such as moussaka, pastitsio, classic Greek salad, fasolada, spanakopita and souvlaki. Some dishes {{can be traced back to}} ancient Greece like skordalia (a thick purée of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), lentil soup, retsina (white or rosé wine sealed with pine resin) and pasteli (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki, grilled octopus and small fish, feta cheese, dolmades (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in <b>vine</b> <b>leaves),</b> various pulses, olives and cheese. Olive oil is added to almost every dish.|$|E
40|$|In this study, two dual {{sweet potato}} (Ipomoea batatas L.) cultivars (main plots) viz., SPN/ 0 and SP/ 93 / 23, differing in shoot {{morphology}} {{were subjected to}} vines and leaf harvests (sub-plots) under field conditions at Sokoine University of Agriculture, Horticultural Unit, Morogoro, Tanzania. The treatments were arranged in a split plot arrangement in RCBD using three replications during the 2003 / 2004 cropping season. The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the effect of removing <b>vines</b> and <b>leaves</b> on yield of marketable roots and <b>leaves.</b> <b>Vines</b> and edible <b>leaves</b> were progressively removed during the growing season. The control treatments consisted of single final removing of <b>vines.</b> <b>Vines</b> and <b>leaves</b> removal treatments were imposed monthly and bi-weekly commencing at 40 and 54 days from planting, respectively. Varieties differed in all the variables tested except average marketable root diameter. SPN/ 0 was characteristically superior in all the variables including marketable root yield. SPN/ 0 variety gave a relatively higher final yield of 12. 2 t ha - 1 fresh marketable roots, over the SP/ 93 / 23 variety, which gave 2. 9 t ha - 1. Among all four subplot treatments tested, there was no significant difference on number of slender roots, number of marketable roots, average marketable roots length, average marketable root diameter, total weight of <b>vines</b> and <b>leaves</b> and marketable root yield. However, significant difference (p<= 0. 05) among treatments of vines and leaf removal were obtained only on weight of fresh <b>vines</b> and <b>leaves.</b> Removing <b>vines</b> and <b>leaves</b> once per month starting 40 days after planting gave the highest weight of fresh <b>vines</b> and <b>leaves</b> of 6. 1 t ha - 1. The control treatment gave 11. 6 t ha - 1 of fresh marketable roots, which out yielded all the other three treatments. Results indicate that the yield decrease depends on time of starting topping and frequency of topping. Continuous removal of <b>vines</b> and <b>leaves,</b> starting at early stage reduced root yield though not significantly. The none topping of sweet potato gave relatively higher yield of fresh root tuber compared with other treatments. Removal of <b>vines</b> and <b>leaves</b> once per month starting 54 DAP is recommended for optimizing aerial fresh weight and marketable root yield...|$|R

25|$|This chapel (the first chapel on {{the right}} of the nave), begun on 1 April 1634, was overseen by the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Doctrine made up mostly of {{craftsmen}} and artisans. The main image in the altar piece is a late-16th-century painted wooden image of St. Anne with the Virgin Mary in her arms (an image known as Our Lady of the Doctrine, i.e., the Virgin Mary being indoctrinated by her mother). On the left and right side are late-17th-century sculptures of St. Joachim and St. Anne, parents of the Virgin Mary. Although built in the 17th century, the present decoration is typical of Portuguese Baroque (known as the “National Style” or “estilo national”) {{of the first half of}} the 18th century. The gilt woodwork (attributed to José Rodrigues Ramalho) covers the entire interior surface including the ceiling. It is characterized by popular Portuguese motifs – bunches of grapes, <b>vine</b> <b>leaves,</b> birds, and standing infants.|$|E
25|$|The {{wall of the}} mihrab {{is covered}} with 28 panels of white marble, carved and pierced, which have {{a wide variety of}} plant and {{geometric}} patterns including the stylized grape leaf, the flower and the shell. Behind the openwork hint, there is an oldest niche on which several assumptions were formulated. If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab but hardly a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817-838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862-863. Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel bentwood. Covered with a thick coating completely painted, the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylized five-lobed <b>vine</b> <b>leaves,</b> three-lobed florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background.|$|E
25|$|Screens {{made up of}} {{labyrinths}} {{of complicated}} joinery, consisting of multitudes of tiny balusters connecting hexagons, squares or other forms, with the flat surfaces constantly enriched with small carvings, are familiar to every one. In Cairo we also have examples in the mosque of Qous (12th century) of that finely arranged geometrical interlacing of curves with foliage terminations which distinguishes the Saracenic designer. Six panels in the Victoria and Albert Museum (13th century), {{and work on the}} tomb of the sultan Li Ghoury (16th century), show how deeply this form of decoration was ingrained in the Arab nature. Figure work and animals were sometimes introduced, in medieval fashion, as in the six panels just referred to, and at the hflpital du Moristan (13th century) and the mosque of El Nesfy Qeycoun (14th century). There is a magnificent panel on the door of Beyt-el-Emyr. This exquisite design is composed of <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> and, grapes of conventional treatment in low relief. The Arab designer was fond of breaking up his paneling in a way reminding one of a similar Jacobean custom. The main panel would be divided into a number of hexagonal, triangular or other shapes, and each small space filled in with conventional scroll work. Much of this simple flat design reminds one of that Byzantine method from which the Elizabethan carvers were inspired.|$|E

500|$|Sir Francis Dashwood built West Wycombe to entertain, {{and there}} has been much {{speculation}} on the kind of entertainment he provided for his guests. Judged against the sexual morals of the late 18th century, Dashwood and his clique were regarded as promiscuous; while {{it is likely that the}} contemporary reports of the bacchanalian orgies over which Dashwood presided in the Hellfire caves above West Wycombe were exaggerated, free love and heavy drinking did take place there. Dashwood often had himself depicted in portraits in fancy dress (in one, dressed as St Francis of Assisi toasting a statue of Venus), and it is his love of fancy dress which seems to have pervaded through to his parties at West Wycombe Park. Following the dedication of the West portico as the temple of Bacchus in 1771, Dashwood and his friends dressed in skins adorned with <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> and went to party by the lake for [...] "Paeans and libations". On another occasion, during a mock sea battle on the canal, the captain of the snow, [...] "attacking" [...] a battery constructed on the bank, was struck by the wadding of a gun and suffered an internal injury.

He died in 1781, bequeathing West Wycombe to his half-brother Sir John Dashwood-King, 3rd Baronet.|$|E
