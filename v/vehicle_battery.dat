25|$|Most {{transceivers}} {{installed in}} vehicles {{are designed to}} run on 12-16 VDC, and are generally powered by the starting battery in the vehicle. Because of the power demands placed on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>battery,</b> most mobile stations either do not include external amplifiers or include amplifiers with power outputs that are more modest than those commonly found in fixed stations.|$|E
25|$|OBD-II is an {{improvement}} over OBD-I in both capability and standardization. The OBD-II standard specifies the type of diagnostic connector and its pinout, the electrical signalling protocols available, and the messaging format. It also provides a candidate list of vehicle parameters to monitor along with how to encode the data for each. There is a pin in the connector that provides power for the scan tool from the <b>vehicle</b> <b>battery,</b> which eliminates the need to connect a scan tool to a power source separately. However, some technicians might still connect the scan tool to an auxiliary power source to protect data in the unusual event that a vehicle experiences a {{loss of electrical power}} due to a malfunction. Finally, the OBD-II standard provides list of standardized DTCs. As a result of this standardization, a single device can query the on-board computer(s) for these parameters in any vehicle. OBD-II standardization was prompted to simplify diagnosis of increasingly complicated emissions equipment, and though only emission-related codes and data are required to be transmitted through it according to U.S. legislation, most manufacturers have made the OBD-II Data Link Connector the main connector in the vehicle through which all systems are diagnosed and reprogrammed. OBD-II Diagnostic Trouble Codes are 4-digit, preceded by a letter: P for engine and transmission (powertrain), B for body, C for chassis, and U for network. Manufacturers may also add custom data parameters to their specific OBD-II implementation, including real-time data requests as well as trouble codes.|$|E

2500|$|Recharging a large {{battery pack}} {{presents}} a high {{load on the}} electrical grid, but this can be scheduled for periods of reduced load or reduced electricity costs. In order to schedule the recharging, either the charging station or the vehicle can communicate with the smart grid. Some plug-in vehicles allow the vehicle operator to control recharging through a web interface or smartphone app. Furthermore, in a Vehicle-to-grid scenario the <b>vehicle</b> <b>battery</b> can supply energy to the grid at periods of peak demand. This requires additional communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle electronics. SAE International is developing a range of standards for energy transfer {{to and from the}} grid including SAE J2847/1 [...] "Communication between Plug-in Vehicles and the Utility Grid". ISO and IEC are also developing a similar series of standards known as ISO/IEC 15118: [...] "Road vehicles -- Vehicle to grid communication interface".|$|E
2500|$|Plug-in hybrid or {{electric}} cars [...] {{could be used}} [...] for their energy storage capabilities. [...] Vehicle-to-grid technology can be employed, turning each vehicle with its 20 to 50kWh battery pack into a distributed load-balancing device or emergency power source. This represents 2 to 5 days per vehicle of average household requirements of 10kWh per day, assuming annual consumption of 3650kWh. This quantity of energy is equivalent to between [...] of range in such vehicles consuming 0.5 to 0.16kWh per mile. These figures can be achieved even in home-made electric vehicle conversions. Some electric utilities plan to use old plug-in vehicle batteries (sometimes resulting in a giant battery) to store electricity However, a large disadvantage of using vehicle to grid energy storage {{is the fact that}} each storage cycle stresses the battery with one complete charge-discharge cycle. Conventional (cobalt-based) lithium ion batteries break down with the number of cycles – newer li-ion batteries do not break down significantly with each cycle, and so have much longer lives. One approach is to reuse unreliable vehicle batteries in dedicated grid storage [...] as they are expected to be good in this role for ten years [...] [...] If such storage is done on a large scale it becomes much easier to guarantee replacement of a <b>vehicle</b> <b>battery</b> degraded in mobile use, as the old battery has value and immediate use.|$|E
