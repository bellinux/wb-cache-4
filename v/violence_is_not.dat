5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on themselves in a library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> graphically rendered.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} the news of a fight {{circulating}} at a diner. This scene repeats itself at a pool hall, where gang members arrive via foot, forklift, and out of sewers, while the video's titular song begins to play. The camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed, revealing he's the one singing contemplating the senseless violence. The singer notices rival gangs and leaves. Michael Jackson dons a red leather J. Parks brand jacket, and dances his way towards the fight through the diner and pool hall. A knife fight is taking place between the two gang leaders in a warehouse. They dance battle for an interlude of music until MJ arrives; the singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine. The video ends with the gang members joining him in the dance, agreeing that <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the solution to their problems.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} this {{violence}} against Muslims are varied. The roots {{are thought to}} lie in India's history– resentment toward the Islamic domination of India during the Middle Ages, policies established by the country's British colonizers, and the violent partition of India into a Muslim-majority Pakistan and a secular India with a Muslim minority. Many scholars believe that incidents of anti-Muslim violence are politically motivated {{and a part of}} the electoral strategy of mainstream political parties who are associated with Hindu nationalism like the Bharatiya Janata Party. Other scholars believe that the <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> widespread but that it is restricted to certain urban areas because of local socio-political conditions.|$|E
25|$|In India, {{domestic}} violence toward women is considered as {{any type of}} abuse that {{can be considered a}} threat; it can also be physical, psychological, or sexual abuse to any current or former partner. Domestic <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> handled as a crime or complaint, it is seen more as a private or family matter. In determining the category of a complaint, it is based on caste, class, religious bias and race which also determines whether action is to be taken or not. Many studies have reported about the prevalence of the violence and have taken a criminal-justice approach, but most woman refuse to report it. These women are guaranteed constitutional justice, dignity and equality but continue to refuse based on their sociocultural contexts. As the women refuse to speak of the violence and find help, they are also not receiving the proper treatment.|$|E

25|$|The city’s and municipality’s {{recent history}} has {{centered}} on violence related to drugs and the environment. Drug-related violence of {{the past several decades}} has taken its toll as tourism is down, fewer come to shop in the city and many residents stay indoors for fear of a stray bullet. The violence and threats of violence have left streets empty after 7 pm. Pickups and SUVs with darkened windows are a common sight. These vehicles are associated with the many shootings and even grenade attacks that have taken place in and around the city in recent years. The <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> limited to the city of Petatlán; it also occurs in its small rural communities such as La Morena, El Camalote and Las Humedades.

The <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the type that can psychologically damage a child and the softer scenes of the film managed to offset the darker part of it".

500|$|Alongside its {{critical}} acclaim, {{the series}} has garnered controversy both in Japan and overseas. Amongst the material cited are its demon negotiation mechanic, depictions of suicide and cannibalism, religious criticism, its use and mixture of Christian and occult imagery, political references, depictions of homosexuality, and its sometimes-strange demon designs. Specific examples {{have been cited}} by western journalists. The original release of Persona caused concern due to the title's religious implications. 1UP.com's 2007 game awards, which ran in the March 2008 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Persona 3 was given the [...] "Most controversial game that created no controversy" [...] award: the writers said [...] "Rockstar's Hot Coffee sex scandal and Bullys boy-on-boy kissing's got nothing on this PS2 role-player's suicide-initiated battles or subplot involving student-teacher dating." [...] GamesRadar included the series on its list of [...] "Controversies Waiting to Happen", saying {{that the lack of}} public outcry was due to its niche status when compared to other series with similar content. Writing for 1UP.com in a later article, Kalata traced this use of controversial content back to the Digital Devil Story novels, which depicted violence and rape committed by demons, and said that [...] "Such <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> particularly rare in the land of Japanese animation, but it became even more disturbing in [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The graphic {{depiction}} {{of violence in}} The Last of Us generated substantial commentary from critics. Engadget writer Ben Gilbert found the game's persistent focus on combat was [...] "a necessary evil to lead the game's fragile protagonist duo to safety", {{as opposed to being}} used as a method to achieve objectives. Kotakus Kirk Hamilton wrote that the violence was [...] "heavy, consequential and necessary", as opposed to gratuitous. USGamer's Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence, intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat. He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified, making the story more powerful. Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that, despite the [...] "incredibly brutal" [...] combat, the violence never felt gratuitous. Eurogamers Welsh echoed similar remarks, stating that the <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> [...] "desensitized or mindless". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer observed that the game's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices. Joystiq's Mitchell wrote that the violence is [...] "designed to be uncomfortable", stating that it contributes to Joel's character. Prior to the release of the game, Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that the acceptability of the violence would depend on its context within the game.|$|E
500|$|Thunderball was {{generally}} well {{received by the}} critics; Francis Iles, writing in The Guardian wrote that it [...] "is a good, tough, straightforward thriller on perfectly conventional lines." [...] Referring to the negative publicity that surrounded Dr. No—in particular the article by Paul Johnson in the New Statesman entitled, [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism"—Iles was left [...] "wondering {{what all the fuss}} is about", noting that [...] "there is no more sadism nor sex than is expected of the author of this kind of thriller". Peter Duval Smith, writing in Financial Times, also took the opportunity to defend Fleming's work against negative criticism, also specifically naming Paul Johnson and his review: [...] "one should not make a cult of Fleming's novels: a day-dream is a day-dream; but nor should one make the mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing." [...] Duval Smith thought that Thunderball was [...] "an exciting story is skilfully told", with [...] "a romantic sub-plot... and the denouement involves great events" [...] He also considered it [...] "the best written since Diamonds Are Forever, four books back. It has pace and humour and style. The <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> so unrelenting as usual: an improvement, I think." [...] He also expressed concern for the central character, saying [...] "I was glad to see him [...] in such good form. Earlier he seemed to be softening up. He was having bad hangovers on half-a-bottle of whisky a day, which I don't call a lot, unless he wasn't eating properly." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2002, {{hundreds}} of hooligans attaching themselves to Millwall {{were involved in}} disorder around the ground, after the team lost a play-off game to Birmingham City. It was described by the BBC {{as one of the}} worst cases of civil disorder seen in Britain in recent times. A police spokeswoman said that 47 police officers and 24 police horses were injured, and the Metropolitan Police considered suing the club after the events. The then chairman Theo Paphitis responded that Millwall could not be blamed for the actions of a mindless minority who attach themselves to the club. [...] "The problem of mob <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> solely a Millwall problem, it is not a football problem, it is a problem which plagues the whole of our society", he said. Paphitis later introduced a membership scheme whereby only fans who would be prepared to join and carry membership cards would be allowed into The Den. Scotland Yard withdrew its threat to sue, stating: [...] "In light of the efforts made and a donation to a charity helping injured police officers, the Metropolitan Police Service has decided not to pursue legal action against Millwall F.C. in relation to the disorder". Some legal experts said it would have been difficult to hold a football club responsible for something that occurred away from its ground and involved people who did not attend the match. The scheme introduced by Paphitis now only applies to perceived high-risk away games. Many fans blame the scheme for diminishing Millwall's away support, such as at Leeds United where fans are issued with vouchers which are then exchanged for tickets at a designated point of West Yorkshire Police's choosing {{on the day of the}} game. Also, early kick-off times arranged by the police often result in only a few hundred fans making the trip.|$|E
500|$|On June 27, 2011, the Supreme Court {{issued a}} 7–2 opinion {{striking}} down the California law as unconstitutional {{on the basis}} of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The majority opinion was authored by Justice Antonin Scalia and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Kennedy, Sotomayor, and Kagan. [...] It first held that [...] "video games qualify for First Amendment protection": Justice Scalia then affirmed that, while states may pass laws to block obscene material from minors as previously decided in the 1968 Ginsberg v. New York case, [...] "speech about <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> obscene," [...] and California's statute was unlawful. The decision pointed to fairy tales like those of the Brothers Grimm, which are regularly given to children to read, [...] "contain no shortage of gore" [...] that are also present in video games. The decision further compared video games to classical works like The Divine Comedy, stating that [...] "Even if we can see in them nothing of any possible value to society, they are as much entitled to the protection of free speech as the best of literature." [...] Scalia's decision also stated that the current self-moderated industry standards like the ESRB are operated effectively to regulate the sale of more mature games to minors, and that [...] "filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents' control can hardly be a compelling state interest" [...] requiring a law to enforce. [...] The Court's decision also determined that from the evidence, there was no [...] "compelling" [...] link between violent video games and its effects on children. The decision cited one medical report that asserted that cartoons like Looney Tunes generate the same effects in children as in games like Sonic the Hedgehog or imagery of guns.|$|E
500|$|Ācārya Amṛtacandra has {{described}} {{as to how}} the consequences of violence (karmas attracted) differ from person to persons for similar and different types of acts. A small violence may bring serious consequences to one person, while to another person grievous violence may bring about lesser consequences. For instance, a person hunting and killing only one small animal suffers severe consequences while a person who is building a temple or hospital suffers milder karmic consequences even though its construction kills many animals. Even when violence is jointly committed by two persons, the same act may result in severe consequence for one person and mild consequence for another person. This may happen in the case where the leader and planner of violence binds severe karmas, while a follower binds much lesser karmas. One who actually does not commit violence may be responsible for hiṃsā while one who actually commits <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> responsible for hiṃsā. For instance, a burglar who fails in his robbery is still a felon but a diligent surgeon who is trying to save a patient is not responsible for violence even if a patient dies during the surgery. Persons who have not committed violence may become responsible for violence committed by others. This may happen when a violence which is carried out by someone is approved and instigated by someone else. [...] often gives result of himsa to one and himsa may sometimes give result of ahimsa to another. For instance, one person saves another from oppression by use of violence and hence enjoys consequences of ahimsa although resorting to violence, while another does not act to save someone wishing that the other person is not saved and thus suffers the consequences of violence although he may have not actually done anything.|$|E

2500|$|Margaret Bruder, a film studies {{professor}} at Indiana University {{and the author}} of Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style, proposes that there is a distinction between aestheticized violence and the use of gore and blood in mass market action or war films.

He claims that their rebuttal also claims that [...] "movie violence is fun, spectacle, make-believe; it's dramatic metaphor, or a necessary catharsis akin to that provided by Jacobean theatre; it's generic, pure sensation, pure fantasy. It has its own changing history, its codes, its precise aesthetic uses." ...|$|E
