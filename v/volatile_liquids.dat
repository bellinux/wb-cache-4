25|$|One of {{the most}} {{desirable}} attributes of polyurethanes is their ability to be turned into foam. Making a foam requires {{the formation of a}} gas {{at the same time as}} the urethane polymerization (gellation) is occurring. The gas can be carbon dioxide, either generated by reacting isocyanate with water or added as a gas; it also be produced by boiling <b>volatile</b> <b>liquids.</b> In the latter case heat generated by the polymerization causes the liquids to vaporize. The liquids can be HFC-245fa (1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane) and HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), and hydrocarbons such as n-pentane.|$|E
25|$|From pentane to octane the alkanes {{are highly}} <b>volatile</b> <b>liquids.</b> They {{are used as}} fuels in {{internal}} combustion engines, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes knocking, than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition {{is measured by the}} octane rating of the fuel, where 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) has an arbitrary value of 100, and heptane has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances.|$|E
25|$|The silanes {{comprise}} a homologous series of silicon hydrides {{with the general}} formula SinH2n+2. They are all strong reducing agents. Unbranched and branched trains are known up to n = 8, and the cycles Si5H10 and Si6H12 are also known. The first two, silane and disilane, are colourless gases; the heavier members of the series are <b>volatile</b> <b>liquids.</b> All silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air. They become less thermally stable with room temperature, so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature, although disilane does not decompose very quickly (only 2.5% of a sample decomposes after eight months have passed). They decompose to form polymeric polysilicon hydride and hydrogen gas. As expected from the difference in atomic weight, the silanes are less volatile than the corresponding alkanes and boranes, but more volatile than the corresponding germanes. They are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes, because the larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitates nucleophilic attack at the silicon, the greater polarity of the Si–H bond compared to the C–H bond, {{and the ability of}} silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction's activation energy.|$|E

30|$|The {{yields and}} {{compositions}} of the pyrolysis products were changed due to catalytic upgrading. Catalysts {{can affect the}} production of <b>volatile</b> <b>liquid</b> products via two pathways during the catalytic pyrolysis process. First, the product species can be cracked into gasses or converted into coke or char, which reduces the <b>volatile</b> <b>liquid</b> species. Second, catalysts decompose nonvolatile oligomers into volatile monomers, {{increasing the amount of}} <b>volatile</b> <b>liquid</b> species. The change in the liquid product yield due to catalytic upgrading is determined by a sum of these two opposite effects [11].|$|R
