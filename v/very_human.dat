25|$|The {{religion}} of ancient Greece {{was a form}} of nature worship that grew out of the beliefs of earlier cultures. However, unlike earlier cultures, man was no longer perceived as being threatened by nature, but as its sublime product. The natural elements were personified as gods of completely human form, and <b>very</b> <b>human</b> behaviour.|$|E
25|$|The Kobol gods {{have the}} same names and {{characteristics}} as the Greek Olympian gods and the show makes references to Zeus (as well as Jupiter), Hera, Athena, Poseidon, Ares (as well as Mars), and Apollo. As evidenced by prayers offered by the human characters, the Kobol gods are morally refined and are believed to watch over and intervene benevolently {{in the lives of}} the just. This is similar to the concept of the gods during the Greek classical and Hellenistic periods, not the amoral (and <b>very</b> <b>human)</b> gods of the Greek archaic period. In another parallel to Western polytheism, the names of the Twelve Colonies and their planets are similar to the names of the constellations in the Greco-Roman zodiac. The finale implies that the Greek and Roman pantheons, as well as several ancient belief systems including the zodiac, were imported to Earth by the colonial survivors.|$|E

Billingham further suggests that an extremely advanced and friendly extraterrestrial civilization might {{put an end to}} present-day religious conflicts and lead to greater religious toleration worldwide. On the other hand, Jill Tarter puts forward the view that contact with extraterrestrial intelligence might eliminate religion as we know it and introduce humanity to an all-encompassing faith. Vakoch doubts that humans would be inclined to adopt extraterrestrial religions, telling ABC News [...] "I think religion meets <b>very</b> <b>human</b> needs, and unless extraterrestrials can provide a replacement for it, I don't think religion is going to go away," [...] and adding, [...] "if there are incredibly advanced civilizations with a belief in God, I don't think Richard Dawkins will start believing." ...|$|E

A review in The Washington Times was positive: [...] "With a plot that takes Batman very seriously — and makes him <b>very</b> <b>human</b> — and a dismaying amount of information on the sexual exploitation of children for profit, this novel makes an ineradicable impression". Likewise, another reviewer found it [...] "an engaging and disturbing one-night read that's all the more astonishing because Vachss manages to explore and make his points about a wholly depressing topic without driving your moods into the sewer." [...] Roger Catlin in the Hartford Courant said [...] "Vachss' bold, simple prose is well suited to his story.

500|$|Ron {{became more}} heavily {{involved}} in Parks and Recreation storylines during the second season, and Offerman largely credited Schur {{with the development of}} the character.

[...] He compared Ron to a [...] "19th-century rugged individualist," [...] and said of creating the character, [...] "A lot of the credit has to go to Nick Offerman. In real life, he's an incredibly interesting guy, and at the very least, it's much easier to play an interesting guy when you're an interesting guy." [...] Offerman said his own sense of humor fuels much of the character, along with those of Schur, Greg Daniels, and the writing staff; he added: [...] "I never dreamed that I could prosper with my perverse sense of humor on a network show." [...] Schur said the staff liked writing for Ron because [...] "he's a great mix of a superhero, and also a deeply flawed, and <b>very</b> <b>human</b> and vulnerable person." ...|$|E
500|$|Mulder's {{dream and}} {{decisions}} in [...] "The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" [...] heavily allude to {{the actions of}} Jesus in Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ. Duchovny, {{a fan of the}} book, found parallels between its central story and Mulder's ordeal, and incorporated many of the novel's concepts into the episode. In The Last Temptation of Christ, Jesus is torn between his higher calling as the son of God and his desire towards his own humanity. Duchovny was drawn to the fact that Christ's struggle in the novel was [...] "not only godlike, but also profoundly human" [...] and used this template for Mulder; in the series, Mulder is destined towards greater things—in this case, stopping the oncoming alien invasion—but he also desires to have a personal life. Duchovny noted that [...] "Mulder is a guy who's been given the same problem [...] What I'm doing is using the <b>very</b> <b>human</b> model of Christ". Duchovny cautioned that he was not trying to make Mulder into a Christ-like savior figure but rather [...] "an everyman". Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described the concept as a risk, but Duchovny felt that this exploration of Mulder's character was important to the series.|$|E
500|$|... "Pusher" [...] {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave it an A–, describing it as [...] "smart, well-paced, and exciting, and Modell is memorable {{for being a}} <b>very</b> <b>human</b> monster who manages to be both well-drawn and unsympathetic". Though he praised Modell and the climax, he felt that Holly was a stereotype and [...] "the implication that Modell is {{able to get through}} to her because of her fear walks that weird line between plausible and not entirely necessary". Handlen also felt that it was [...] "an excellent starting point" [...] for someone who wanted to get into the series. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Pusher" [...] a B+, writing, [...] "Much inscrutable warmth between Mulder and Scully parallels some inscrutable detective work. But the climactic mental tug-of-war between Mulder and Pusher makes up for any lapses in logic". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two called Gilligan's script [...] "witty and clever" [...] and noted that it was [...] "a triumph". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised Wisden's performance as Robert Modell, calling his portrayal [...] "spot on". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it a rare four stars out of four. She called it an [...] "intense nail biter" [...] that [...] "ranks with the best of The X-Files".|$|E

500|$|In 1993, David Mirkin hired Scully {{to write}} for The Simpsons, as a {{replacement}} for the departing Conan O'Brien, after reading some of his sample scripts. He began as a writer and producer for the show during its fifth season and wrote the episodes [...] "Lisa's Rival", [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [...] and [...] "Lisa on Ice" [...] which aired in season six. [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] was his first episode; he wrote the script, but the original concept had been conceived by O'Brien. Similarly, he wrote the script for [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds", which was based on an idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. [...] "Lisa on Ice" [...] was inspired by Scully's love of ice hockey and featured many experiences from his childhood, as was [...] "Marge Be Not Proud" [...] (which he wrote for season seven) which was based [...] "one of the most traumatic moments" [...] of his life, when he was caught shoplifting at age 12. He jokingly told Variety that [...] "It's great to be paid for reliving the horrors of your life." [...] He also wrote [...] "Team Homer" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Date with Density". Scully noted: [...] "I wrote a lot of Lisa's shows. I have five daughters, so I like Lisa a lot. I like Homer, too. Homer comes very naturally to me: I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. A lot of my favorite episodes are the ones when Homer and Lisa are in conflict with each other... They're <b>very</b> <b>human,</b> I think that's their appeal." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1970s, {{some critics}} pointed {{out how the}} lines of the poems were memorable and popular while others {{emphasised}} the poem's place in the greater tradition of English poetry. W. K. Wimsatt, in 1970, suggested, [...] "Perhaps we shall be tempted to say only that Gray transcends and outdoes Hammond and Shenstone simply because he writes a more poetic line, richer, fuller, more resonant and memorable in all the ways in which we are accustomed to analyze the poetic quality." [...] In 1971, Charles Cudworth declared that the elegy was [...] "a work which probably contains more famous quotations per linear inch of text than any other in the English language, not even excepting Hamlet." [...] When describing how Gray's Elegy is not a conventional elegy, Eric Smith added in 1977, [...] "Yet, if the poem at so many points fails to follow the conventions, why are we considering it here? the answer is partly that no study of major English elegies could well omit it. But it is also, and more importantly, that in its essentials Gray's Elegy touches this tradition at many points, and consideration of them is of interest to both to appreciation of the poem and to seeing how [...] they become in the later tradition essential points of reference." [...] Also in 1977, Thomas Carper noted, [...] "While Gray was a schoolboy at Eton, his poetry began to show a concern with parental relationships, and with his position among the great and lowly in the world [...] But in the Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard these longstanding and <b>very</b> <b>human</b> concerns have their most affecting expression." [...] In 1978, Howard Weinbrot noted, [...] "With all its long tradition of professional examination the poem remains distant for many readers, as if the criticism could not explain why Johnson thought that [...] "The Church-yard abounds with images that find a mirrour in every mind". He continued by arguing that it is the poem's discussion of morality and death that is the source of its [...] "enduring popularity".|$|E
