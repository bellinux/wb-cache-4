40|$|The Danish National <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Expert</b> {{group for}} Classical and African swine fever {{has been active}} during the last 10 years. The group is {{composed}} of experts in EU-legislation, in Danish pig production, in pig diseases and in virology. The group has participated in a national workshop on CSFV surveillance, in Contingency planning exercises and many efforts is done to keep the group updated on the current international situation for swine fevers. The group has been very stabile and especially the participation in a TAIEX workshop in 2005 in Romania {{was a very good}} basis for fruitful collaboration. The experiences gained from the workshop had been found very valuable during discussion of different epidemiological situations. The obligations of the expert group are both to follow the progress of eradication but definitely also to take care of some of the more time consuming discussions that could otherwise burden the Veterinary Authorities. Questions like “Could we be allowed to vaccinate the pigs in a Zoo if there is an outbreak?” and other veterinary issues that may have a high interest in the press; but which do not matter that much in the gross picture of the disease eradication could be handed over to the expert group.   Slide presentation and discussions The presentation gave examples of activities carried out by the Classical swine fever and African swine fever expert group during the last 10 years and how the expert group was kept alive. It was highlighted that a “good chemistry” between the members of the expert group was considered to be important for the success in “peacetime” and in a “war-time. The importance of the annual meetings of National Reference Laboratories organized by the EU Community Reference Laboratory for classical swine fever, Hannover was emphasized, as the meetings did not only cover diagnostic laboratory methods, but also valuable information on disease transmission and current epidemiological situations. The issue of independence was discussed. It was agreed that an expert should work as an independent person. He/she is deemed to work in a personal capacity and, in performing the work, does not represent any organization. The use of a declaration or statement of no conflict of interest was used in many evaluation projects and could also be applied for work in expert groups. A potential conflict of interest could occur, if an expert: - Was employed by a private company involved in production and sales of vaccine or reagents used in disease diagnostics - Was employed by the livestock sector and involved in the determination of animal movement restrictions - Is in any other situation that could cast doubt on his or her ability to evaluate disease control measures impartially. The meeting was also informed about an article describing the activities of the Danish National <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Expert</b> group for Classical and African swine fever published in the journal of the Danish Veterinary Medical Association...|$|E

For each spermatozoid head, a deviation from the model distribution is computed. This produces a conditional probability distribution of that deviation for each set. Using a set of test images, we determine the fraction of normal heads in each image and compare it with the result of expert classification. This yields an absolute error below 0. 25 in the 89 % of the samples. ...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{artificial}} insemination {{as a primary}} reproduction technique obviously makes it necessary to identify the animals on heat. The use of synchronization makes artificial insemination easier in as much that insemination is carried out at fixed times. However it cannot be used on all the animals throughout the year. In the buffalo farm in Italy the identification of females on heat is not usually part of the official duties of the herdsmen. Since artificial insemination is not routinely used, readings taken are used only {{to add to the}} anamnesis of the individual animal and to give extra data to the <b>veterinary</b> <b>expert</b> or, in some cases, to ascertain the paternity of a calf. It is difficult to persuade the staff to perform a task that is different from the duties normally required. Moreover it is difficult to recognise the animals by simply looking at them. Their coats are a uniform colour. The identification tags applied to the buffalo are often impossible to read on account of encrusted mud. It has already been noted that female buffalo do not ostensibly manifest reciprocal covering postures. One means of identifying animals on heat is to use a vasectomized bull. This has a dual function. Firstly to identify the animals on heat and secondly to improve the reproductive efficiency of the herd thanks to the “bull effect” (51) on female buffaloes which has already been described. In the last few years our Research Unit has been investigating the possibility of adopting pedometers for use on farms. The need to develop new technologies to identify animals on heat stems from the dairy cattle industry where the problem of synchronizing artificial insemination and the oestrous cycle is all the more pressing and where the success in the identification of fertile periods is reported to be still around 50...|$|E
40|$|Breed-related {{disease and}} harmful breed {{specifications}} {{are a big}} problem in the global dog breeding sector, also in the Netherlands. It is clear that rigorous change in breeding is {{necessary in order to}} improve the long term well-being of purebred dogs. Only after identification and quantification of a breed’s health problems, further measures as modern DNA diagnostics and epidemiological techniques can be deployed to collectively and systematically develop new effective breeding policies. A primary need to effectively improve breed health, is that breeders have insight in the incidence of disease and of harmful breed characteristics in their breed population. The ‘Expertise Centre Genetics of Companion Animals’ (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals of Utrecht University), that centers all scientific knowledge and research on veterinary genetics, population genetics and molecular genetics, aims to create this detailed insight in the status of breed-related health problems in the Netherlands. In the here reported research project, the progressive process is described of creating, thoroughly organizing and analyzing a disease registration database of dogs in the Netherlands. Qualitative analysis using existing literature, current <b>veterinary</b> <b>expert</b> opinions and the patient database of the University Clinic for Companion Animal Health of Utrecht University, gives insight in the health status of breeds. However, these data should be combined with quantitative data to draw reliable conclusions regarding the health of an entire breed population. Therefore, disease registrations from primary care veterinary practices were collected. These were automatically sent to and monitored in a standardized, cumulative and world-leading database showing diseases incidence in all breed populations. The aims of this Master thesis were (1) to set up a new standard for reporting qualitative analyses of diseases and harmful breed characteristics in Dutch purebred dog populations, and (2) to analyze recorded first line practice diagnostic data in the central database and develop an structured method to analyze these large scale data which could be used for future quick scan analysis of many populations. The database was thoroughly organized as such, that it generates a fast overview of the most problematic health issues for every breed. However, to indicate an overrepresentation of a breed within a disease, these data should be further analyzed. This can be done by comparing the incidence of a specific diagnosis, sub-diagnosis or involved organs system in breeds to this incidence in mixed-bred dogs. Another possibility is to use a method called data mining. This scientific analysis searches for statistical relations and/or patterns within a voluminous dataset. This method is time-consuming and complex, but prevents data exclusion and should therefore generate reliable results. As soon as data are accessible, these methods will indicate all overrepresentations in any breed, generating an evidence-based overview of the health status of breeds in the Netherlands. This project has resulted in a new format for standardized reporting of qualitative data of companion animal breed populations. Furthermore, a matrix for quantitative analysis of large scale first line diagnostic data was developed which may be employed for future quick scan data analysis. On the long term, this may contribute to new, evidence-based, breed-specific and durable breeding policies that improve and maintain the health of pedigree animals in the Netherlands...|$|E

30|$|In {{pastoral}} communities, {{animals that}} get sick are often treated by themselves due to unavailability of livestock disease professional and para-professionals {{that can take}} charge in disease diagnosis, treatment and other disease management. Other factors include high treatment cost linked to calls of veterinary doctors and buying of drugs, keeping large number of animals just for prestige, nomadic lifestyle and insufficient knowledge on best ways to control diseases. Apart from livestock experts being few, nomadic lifestyle contributes by far for the limited access to veterinary services that would provide service on time. Pastoralists have limited knowledge about dosage and routes for drug administration. Free market economy for veterinary pharmaceutical in Tanzania contributes greatly to self-treatment of animals by and mishandling of drugs. Easy access to drugs and self-treatment procedures have great impact on control of livestock diseases especially during outbreaks as pastoralists will report after so many trials, while the disease is progressing to spread. The use of trained Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) as an important alternative animal to animal health delivery channel in the country’s marginal areas where there are few professional veterinary practitioners will help to reduce the problems (Allport et al. 2005; Swai and Masaaza 2012). In the rural settings health delivery systems are hampered by many factors including remoteness, poor infrastructure, inadequate transport, lack of qualified veterinary staffs and insufficient funds to support surveillance operations and buy reagents and drugs (Swai and Schoonman 2012). Therefore, the use of CAHWs {{could be a good}} link to the veterinary professionals and the livestock disease control units for providing information to the livestock keepers and to the <b>veterinary</b> <b>experts.</b>|$|R
