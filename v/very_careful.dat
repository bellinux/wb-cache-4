5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress was <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> to base {{the changes to}} the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard to be <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> on coastal paths.|$|E

5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E

Later, it was alleged that Tyrone Miller forced entry into the residence by pointing a shotgun at Pietrzak.|$|E

25|$|Infection is {{especially}} dangerous in bones, {{due to the}} recrudescent nature of bone infections. Bone tissue is predominantly extracellular matrix, rather than living cells, and the few blood vessels needed to support this low metabolism are only able to bring {{a limited number of}} immune cells to an injury to fight infection. For this reason, open fractures and osteotomies call for <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> antiseptic procedures and prophylactic use of antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|As the {{mediator}} {{of the three}} groups under the NASAKOM system, Sukarno displayed greater sympathies to the communists. The PKI had been <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> to support all of Sukarno's policies. Meanwhile, Sukarno saw the PKI as the best-organised and ideologically solid party in Indonesia, and a useful conduit to gain more military and financial aid from Communist Bloc countries. Sukarno also sympathised with the communists' revolutionary ideals, which were similar to his own.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong {{was largely}} {{accepted}} into white society, both {{on stage and}} off, a privilege reserved for very few African-American public figures, and usually those of either exceptional talent or fair skin tone. As his fame grew, so did his access to the finer things in life usually denied to African-Americans, even famous ones. It was a power and privilege that he enjoyed, although he was <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> not to flaunt it with fellow performers of color, and privately, he shared what access that he could with friends and fellow musicians.|$|E
25|$|Rav Kook wrote rulings {{presenting}} {{his strong}} opposition to people ascending the Temple Mount, {{due to the}} Jewish Laws of impurity. He felt that Jews should wait until {{the coming of the}} Messiah, when it will be encouraged to enter the Temple Mount. However, he was <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> to express the fact that the Wailing Wall and the Temple Mount were holy sites which belong to the Jews. Rav Kook also opposed the secular spirit of the Hatikvah anthem, and penned another anthem with a more religious theme entitled haEmunah.|$|E
25|$|Hiring {{discrimination}} {{is similar to}} wage discrimination in its pattern. It typically consists of employers choosing to hire a white candidate over a minority candidate, or a male candidate over a female candidate, to fill a position. A study of employment patterns in the US indicated {{that the number of}} hiring discrimination cases has increased fivefold in the past 20 years. However, their percentage as a whole fraction of the workforce hirings has decreased almost as drastically. With the stiff laws against discrimination in hiring, companies are <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> in who they hire and do not hire.|$|E
