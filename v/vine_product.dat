In the practical part of the thesis there is performed the procedure of the production (conservation) of grape vine must and production of jelly from must from cultivars "Veltlínské zelené" and "Dornfelder". These 2 samples of jellies were then together with other 6 samples of similar products (5 of them <b>vine</b> <b>products</b> from other vineries, 1 product from different fruit - cherries) organoleptically evaluated and analytically measured in the laboratory.

By Cypriot legislation passed on March 2, 1990, it is only produced in a collection of 14 neighbouring villages: Agios Georgios, Agios Konstantinos, Agios Mamas, Agios Pavlos, Apsiou, Gerasa, Doros, Zoopigi, Kalo Chorio, Kapilio, Laneia, Louvaras, Monagri and Silikou. The designated area has assumed the name of the Commandaria Region and is located on the south facing slopes of the Troödos Mountains at an altitude of 500-900m within the Limassol District. Only grapes from vineyards that have been planted for at least 4 years are allowed. Vine training must follow the goblet method and watering is prohibited. The grape harvest may only commence after the <b>vine</b> <b>products</b> commission of Cyprus has given the green light, based on the average sugar content of the grapes. Xinisteri grapes must demonstrate a sugar content of 212 g/L whilst Mavro can only qualify with a reading of 258 g/L and above. The sugar concentration is then raised by laying the grapes in the sun, usually for 7-10 days, to a strict window of 390 to 450g/L.|$|R

40|$|Psalmocharias alhageos is an {{important}} pest of vine {{in most parts of}} Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, southern areas of Russia, Turkey and Iraq. This cicada is spread in most provinces in Iran such as Esfahan, Hamedan, Qazvin, Markazi, Lorestan, Qom, Kerman, Tehran and Kordestan. In addition to vine, this insect damages some other fruit trees, such as apple, sour cherry, quince, peach, pomegranate and pear trees and some non-fruit trees, namely white poplar, ash, elm, eglantine, silk and black poplar trees. The nymphs of cicada damage the trees by feeding on root, adult insects on young bud and by oviposition under branch barks. Nourishing root by nymph leads to the weakness of the tree and hinder its growth. The high density oviposition of adult insects inside young barks causes withering of branches. The resulted damage on <b>vine</b> <b>products</b> is 40 % {{which is one of the}} most important factors in product reduction in vineyard. This research was conducted in Takestan in Qazvin. It was conducted for the first time to study the behaviors of the mates of this vine cicada in order to manage it. Two systems were used to record the sound of male cicada called analog voice-recorder and digital voice recorder. To analyze the recorded sound of the male cicada we used of spectrum analyzer, digital storage oscilloscope and protens 7 computer softwares. We could call the attention of natural enemies an disturb the male insect`s attracting sound by producing natural and artificial sound in the range of 1 - 6 kHz in two different ripeness status of the fruits and could prevent mating and oviposition of female cicadas...|$|R

40|$|The {{market is}} a dynamic market in which the European Union plays a leading role as the main {{producer}} and exporter of <b>vine</b> <b>products.</b> In this area, four countries with strong agricultural and viticultural tradition dominate the market: France, Italy, Spain and Germany. But among the new eastern EU members, countries as Romania, with a favorable geography and climate and also a viticultural tradition, some may also play a more prominent role. Romania {{is part of the}} top 12 wine-producing countries, however Romania penalty to export large-scale production of wine. In contrast, France is the main producer and exporter of wine country. This situation is primarily due to the strategic choice of a very strong geographic labelisation of wine production and the emphasis on quality and even the excellence of its products, in particular thanks to a promotion policy. Two major non-exclusive solutions seem to emerge for Romania. On the one hand, it can copy to a certain extent the French solution by leveraging labelisation its wines. The French wine {{market is a}}lso the reference of the European Union in particular as regards the creation of the label: Appellation of Origin (PDO). The example of champagne is, in this context, remarkable. This product alone largely not only the volume and value of exports of wines, but also the volume and value of exports of all agricultural products. It can also try to increase its exports to emerging countries outside the European Union. Non-European areas are both a promise of growing opportunities in a context of economic crisis or post-crises and a threat to the European wine sector: in particular we think about America, Asia and Oceania. Indeed, the main third countries also wine producers are trying to increase their market share. This explains the new measures taken by the European authorities aimed at deep modernizing European wine sector...|$|R

40|$|Grapes {{and wine}} {{products}} were and are symbolizing both the agriculture and economy of Moldova. Until the 90 s of last century the main consumer of our drinks was the Russian Federative Republic. On its markets we {{sold more than}} four fifths of wines from grapes and more than 90 percent of sparkling wine. After {{the approval of the}} Declaration of Independence (August 27, 1991), our country has made considerable efforts to reform the national economy, to transition from centrally managed economy to a market economy that - and allows the manufacturer to direct activities according to demand and primarily domestic market. The request of grapes and grape products on the domestic market rules according to our traditions and previous practice and must be covered entirely by the local production. The national market for <b>vine</b> <b>products</b> is characterized by excessive fluctuations generated by the dynamics of production of grapes and processed products thereof, price volatility, increased competition, etc. Grapes and grape products obtained in Moldova exceed the domestic market demand and our country is doomed to commercial relations with other countries and/or groups of countries. The emergence of new socio-economic system open to the world triggered the joint efforts of the international community's own produced undoubtedly important changes not only in shape, but also background in trade flows and wine grapes. The European Union has been and remains an important actor of major interest to us. The signing and ratification in 2014 of the Association Agreement between Moldova and the European Union will definitely contribute to increase the sales in the Common Market of the European Union, but our country is required to know the trade policies of the EU and should adjust its national trade policy to the EU requirements. In the paper the authors reflect on the grapes and grape products market, studying the import and export of such products, seek practical operation of the CIS market and Common Market. According to this study the authors come up with some proposals that would change the situation on the national market for the better and would accelerate the integration of the national market in the European Union Common Market...|$|R

Unfortunately, General Atmospheric Circulation Models are lacking to accurately reproduce useful local climate pattern. The use of Regional Atmosphere Circulation Models offers a great opportunity towards climate impact studies. In this paper, we assess the ability of the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) regional climate model to reproduce climate variability in the Burgundy region during the key development periods of the grape vine. This simulation was performed for the 2003 calendar year which is an “unusual” climate year. Indeed, the warmer weather pattern observed in spring and summer may foreshow for this latitude the effect of climate changes. Our goal is to use this model to assess at regional scale the growing degree days at the date of maturity in 2003 and thus be able to simulate and predict the possible viticultural climatic zoning for the Burgundy region in the future...|$|R
