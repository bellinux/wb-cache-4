40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theory for the <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in sedimentation that unifies all previous experimental results and numerical simulations. The central {{idea is that}} <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in experiments decrease below those of an independently-distributed uniform density sediment between side walls because {{of the development of}} a vertical stratification in the cell, owing to the broadening of the sediment front. We show through numerical simulations, scaling arguments, theoretical calculations, and experimental observations that a very small stratification changes the characteristics of the density and <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> If the initial <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are large enough (the cell is thick enough) the fluctuations decay continuously in time, throughout the experiment. For intermediate values of the initial <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> (cell thicknesses) the fluctuations decrease below that of an independently-distributed uniform sediment, and appear to stay at roughly constant levels throughout the experiment. For small enough initial fluctuations (cell thicknesses) the fluctuations quantitatively agree with those predicted by independent Poisson distribution estimates.

The <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in sedimentation are therefore not universal as often suggested, but instead depend on both the cell shape and developing stratificatio...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model for <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of dilute sedimenting spheres at low Reynolds number. The central idea is that a {{vertical}} stratification causes the fluctuations to decrease below those of an independent uniform distribution of particles, such a stratification naturally occurring from the broadening of the sedimentation front.

40|$|The {{effect of}} fluid <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> on the {{dynamics}} of the particles in a turbulent gas–solid suspension is analysed in the low-Reynolds-number and high Stokes number limits, where the particle relaxation time is long compared with the correlation time for the fluid <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations,</b> and the drag force on the particles due to the fluid can be expressed by the modified Stokes law. The direct numerical simulation procedure is used for solving the Navier–Stokes equations for the fluid, the particles are modelled as hard spheres which undergo elastic collisions and a one-way coupling algorithm is used where the force exerted by the fluid on the particles is incorporated, but not the reverse force exerted by the particles on the fluid. The particle mean and root-mean-square (RMS) fluctuating velocities, as well as the probability distribution function for the particle <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> and the distribution of acceleration of the particles in the central region of the Couette (where the velocity profile is linear and the RMS velocities are nearly constant), are examined. It is found that the distribution of particle velocities is very different from a Gaussian, especially in the spanwise and wall-normal directions. However, the distribution of the acceleration fluctuation on the particles is found to be close to a Gaussian, though the distribution is highly anisotropic and there is a correlation between the fluctuations in the flow and gradient directions. The non-Gaussian nature of the particle <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> is found to be due to inter-particle collisions induced by the large particle <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in the flow direction. It is also found that the acceleration distribution on the particles is in very good agreement with the distribution that is calculated from the <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in the fluid, using the Stokes drag law, indicating that there is very little correlation between the fluid <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> and the particle <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in the presence of one-way coupling.

40|$|An {{internal}} feedback mechanism, capable of sustaining combustion instabilities, is investigated inside a small laboratory combustor {{in which the}} flame is stabilized behind a rearward facing step. Pressure and optical measurements are employed to define the acoustic field and heat release rate within the combustor, while shadowgraph records are used to visualize the reacting, kinematic flow field. The acoustic flow field creates an unsteady flow inside the combustor, which produces an unsteady heat addition. When this fluctuating heat release is in the appropriate phase relationship with the pressure oscillation, energy is supplied to the acoustic field, and the strong acoustic oscillations are sustained. As {{a result of the}} strong acoustic oscillations present during combustion instability, the flow surges into the combustor periodically, and large vortices are formed at the acoustic frequency which produce the large <b>velocity</b> <b>fluctuation</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} flameholder.
