40|$|There is {{considerable}} debate regarding {{the relationship between}} obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and hypertension. Many studies attempting to assess the association, have produced conflicting results, which {{may be due to}} <b>variable</b> <b>allowance</b> for confounding variables such as upper body obesity, alcohol and smoking. We performed a case control study of 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring in patients with OSA, compared to closely matched controls from the general population, to assess whether OSA is an independent contributor to diurnal hypertension. 45 sleep clinic patients with moderate to severe OSA and excessive daytime sleepiness were matched to 45 controls without evidence of OSA on a sleep study. Matched variables included age, body mass index (BMI), alcohol and cigarette consumption, treated hypertension and history of ischaemic heart disease. Upper body obesity was measured using waist:hip and waist:height ratios. 24 -hour ABP recordings were performed in all subjects, and before treatment in the patients with OSA. Compared to controls, OSA patients had significantly increased mean (SD) diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during both the daytime (87. 4 (10. 2) versus 82. 8 (9. 1) mmHg, p< 0. 05) and night-time (78. 6 (9. 3) versus 71. 4 (8. 0), p< 0. 001), and higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) at night (119. 4 (20. 7) versus 110. 2 (13. 9), p< 0. 05). There was less nocturnal reduction in SBP ("dipping") in patients with OSA (day to night fall SBP, 13. 5 v 21. 0 mmHg, p< 0. 005). The relatively increased nocturnal SBP in patients with OSA persisted briefly into the morning. Compared to closely matched control subjects, patients with OSA have increased DBP during both day and night, and increased SBP at night. The magnitude, of these differences is such that by extrapolation it should carry increased relative risk of cardiovascular morbidity. Further studies are required to establish whether cardiovascular morbidity is in fact raised and whether treatment of OSA reduces blood pressure and its complications...|$|E

A regression model {{is used by}} the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to predict median rents so as to find <b>variable</b> housing <b>allowance</b> (VHA) as a supplement to Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ). These allowances are made for service members in the continental United States. It is this model that is reviewed in this theses. Median rental data taken from the annual VHA survey are used to test this model. From this analysis, the model indicates lack of fit, invalid assumptions and perhaps not even a 'resonable' approach. A more sensible approach is used to propose two other regression models. These models are a Weighted Regression Model which, like the current model, predicts medians; and an Analysis of Covariance model which predicts or analyzes the mean rent.

30|$|Prediction 3 {{hinges on}} the idea that the greater the uncertainty, the more {{governors}} must worry that their targeted increase will trigger a penalty and warning. With perfect information the governor can set the maximum allowance rates at the target rate plus the cost of take-over. Thus, the more information a governor has about the SSA targeted rate, the less uncertainty around the maximum increased allowance rate a governor may impose without incurring the penalty. This will thus increase deviations when the returns are higher (because the expected costs are lower) but also reduce the effects of changes in the probability of detection because the space over which that detection may occur is smaller. While in our model we don’t take into account that disability applicants might have an incentive to apply for benefits in the second period, we are going to test empirically for the existence of such responses. We are also going to test alternative relationships between political and electoral <b>variables</b> and <b>allowance</b> rates which allows us to explore the extent to which particular characteristics which affect the returns to increasing allowances and the costs if detected.|$|R

40|$|Privatization of Military Family Housing {{will place}} a greater {{reliance}} on private sector rental housing. Before the DoD embarks on any policy changes that place {{a greater emphasis}} on private sector housing, the DoD must be certain that rental property landlords do not raise rental prices based on changes in a service member's housing allowances. This thesis explores the relationship between changes in military housing allowances and changes in private sector rental prices. A multiple regression model was used to determine this correlation. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Fair Market Rent data was used to measure the changes in private sector rent prices in 25 cities. Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ), <b>Variable</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> (VHA) rates, and a ratio that measured the presence of military members in a given area were used as the independent variables. Using the three independent variables described above, the result did confirm the popular impression that rent prices do rise with increases in housing allowances.

These models are suitable to the Chinese situation {{due to the}} existence of procurement prices, quotas, and other interventions that have distorted prices. Results show that there is high but declining {{productivity growth}} rates in the mid 1990 ’s with productivity growth decreasing in the late 1990 ’s but with a reversal of the trend around 1998 when growth rates start accelerating. A stochastic frontier translog production function is estimated to obtain an alternative measure of total factor productivity growth. Results are compared across these two models. Although average growth in technical change is similar in the two models, the regional rates are dissimilar. A model that includes three variables hypothesized to explain the difference in performance across regions is also estimated. The three variables included in the model are irrigation ratio, illiterate ratio and agriculture expenditure level. These <b>variables</b> make <b>allowance</b> for the difference of land and labor quality and the effect of public inputs.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) is based on information held by HM Revenue and Customs tax offices on individuals who could be liable to UK income tax. It is carried out annually by HMRC and covers income assessable to tax for each tax year. Not {{all of them are}} taxpayers because the operation of personal reliefs and allowances may remove them from liability. Where income exceeds the threshold for operation of Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE), the survey provides the most comprehensive and accurate official source of data on personal incomes. The SPI is compiled to provide a quantified evidence base from which to cost proposed changes to tax rates, personal allowances and other tax reliefs for Treasury Ministers. It is used to inform policy decisions within HMRC and the Treasury, as well as for tax modelling and forecasting purposes. In addition, it is used to provide summary information for the National Accounts that are prepared by the Office for National Statistics. Finally, it is used to provide information to Members of Parliament, other Government Departments, companies, organisation and individuals. The UK Data Archive currently holds the Public Use Tape (PUT) data for 1985 - 86 and 1995 - 96 onwards (data for 2008 - 09 is currently unavailable). For further details of sampling and coverage criteria, see documentation. Further information about the SPI, including income tax and personal incomes statistics, is available on the gov. uk Statistics at HMRC webpages.

But the political elements eventually changed the focus to disputes between the management and unions with political background. In 1951, the Hong Kong government proposed {{that most of the}} workers' <b>variable</b> living <b>allowance</b> paid by their employers should be included as part of the basic wage. The Hong Kong Tramways then launched a new Condition of Services along with the new wage plan, stating that other than allowances, dismissal and retirement compensations would also be considered as part of the basic wage. Most of the workers were opposed to the new Condition of Services. The Hong Kong Tramway Workers' Union (HKTWU) even asked for mediation from the Labor Department with Hong Kong Tramways. The HKTWU, a member of the left-wing Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions. After they announced their intention to mediate with Hong Kong Tramways through the Labour department, left-wing organisations and unions actively showed support to them. Considering the political background of HKTWU, the Hong Kong Tramways refused to attend mediation with HKTWU. Instead, they held a meeting with workers representatives, given that workers could not claim to be representatives of the HKTWU. These meetings went on for several months, and Hong Kong Tramways at last agreed to change mandatory participation in the new Condition of Services to voluntary-based participation. The Tramway workers gained success in the negotiation with Hong Kong Tramways, but HKTWU then requested recognition from Hong Kong Tramways, which turned the dispute into political means. The Hong Kong Tramways recognised another non-political Tramway workers' union, but refused to recognise the HKTWU, which led to discontents among HKTWU members and other left-wing organisations and unions. The conflict became more intense after three tramway workers were dismissed on 20 April 1952. The HKTWU met with Hong Kong Tramways, asking to restore the three workers' position. Lots of workers gathered outside the Russell Street tram depot, waiting for the result of the meeting. The meeting continued for two days. Two of the three workers were eventually reinstated.|$|R

Xaraés) were evaluated from February 2006 to March 2008. Structural characteristics, forage allowance and nutritional value of Xaraés palissadgrass were also evaluated. The structural <b>variables</b> of pasture, <b>allowances</b> and nutritive value of forage, besides the DWG were only affected (p< 0. 05) by season, with highest results for spring and summer. Throughout the experimental period (730 days), no sign of mineral deficiency was detected in heifers that ingested the selective supplement. The DWG and AFM were not influenced by the mineral mixture offered (0. 52 and 0. 33 kg/day during the spring/summer and in fall/winter for DWG, respectively, and 813 days of AFM). The IMM was higher for commercial mineral mixture than for selective (61. 6 and 51. 0 g/day respectively). The BCS was slightly higher for selective (3. 17) than for the commercial (3. 02) mineral mixture.

The impact of variations in feed allowance prior to as well as throughout pregnancy has received less attention. Ewes were offered 0. 6 (R), 1. 2 (C) or 1. 8 (AL) maintenance requirements from 89 days before conception until day 133 of pregnancy. Ewes were euthanised on days 50, 92 and 133 of pregnancy. Ewe live weight and body condition score, maternal and fetal metabolic and hormonal profiles, fetal body dimensions and organ weights, and the number, weight and morphology of placentomes were measured. Maternal live weight and condition score were lower in R compared to AL ewes at all stages of pregnancy (P< 0. 05). Plasma glucose and albumin concentrations of R ewes were significantly reduced (P< 0. 05) at mid and late gestation, respectively. Placental components were generally unresponsive to long term variations in maternal feed allowance. However, placental weight was significantly (P< 0. 05) correlated with fetal weight at days 50 (r= 0. 59) and 133 (r= 0. 69) of gestation. By late gestation growth-retarded singleton fetuses from R ewes were 19 % lighter (P< 0. 05), with reduced abdominal (9 %) and thoracic (10 %) girths (P< 0. 05) but of similar crown-rump length compared with fetuses from AL ewes.

40|$|Permanent grasslands are {{exploited}} by grazing animals or as meadows depending on different constraints. Grazing {{is the most}} common use in large parts of Europe, especially in the northwest of Europe. However, certain areas are less suitable for grazing. In the Alps e. g. meadows are the most relevant grassland utilization option because of the steepness of the terrain and a short favourable season, so animals use stored forage during the long winter period. In the Cantabrian fringe, although climate and topography allows for a long grazing season, this is practiced in few farms due to the small size and dispersion of parcels, making it very difficult to organise a reasonable grazing scheme. In several countries in the North West of Europe zero-grazing is practised due to different reasons like large herds or use of Automated Milking Systems (AMS). Permanent grasslands are highly variable. They differ markedly in their botanical composition and productivity, ranging from agricultural-improved grasslands with few very productive plant species, to natural and semi-natural grasslands (Peeters et al., 2014), found in a high variety of ecological conditions and thus with a high number of potentially dominant plant species, mostly of low productivity. Most ruminant livestock farmers have some agricultural-improved grassland, but depending on the livestock system, this will be the majority of their farmland (e. g. dairy farms) or the minority (e. g. goats for meat in mountain areas). For every grassland based livestock farm, irrespective of the types of grassland used, the ideal target is that its own forage allowance matches animal needs. These two <b>variables</b> –forage <b>allowance</b> and feed requirements- are mainly dependent on the stable components of the farm (animals: type, number and annual and seasonal productivity (milk and/or meat); and grasslands: type, area, botanical composition, annual and seasonal productivity, nutritive quality), but also on the weather. Normally, the stable components of the farm are adapted to the climate, soils and other use restrictions of the area. It is the changeable inter-annual weather conditions that lead to variability in {{the quantity and quality of}} available forage, and so weather conditions are the main factor affecting the forage allowance, and so the profitability of the system in the short-medium term. The farmers have to adjust their management (fertilisation, timing of grazing / cutting, etc.) to these changeable weather conditions. Farmers feel the need to control this short-term variability generated by changing weather conditions. Staying in control is a big issue for the farmers and they feel unsure about their livestock and grassland management if external factors like weather affect the functioning of their system. When they are not in control, it is difficult for them to see the economic profits of certain improvements, such as grazing instead of cutting in dairy or beef cattle systems (Peyraud et al, 2010) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a {{comprehensive}} data set {{to develop a}} hedonic model of office rent that estimates values of contractual terms such as tenant improvement allowances, leasing commissions, and options. The model includes variables to control for building characteristics and market conditions, as well as basic lease terms. Although other studies have used a similar approach, the prior {{work in this area}} was limited by the lack of data regarding contractual terms. The results show that there is a consistent, upward-sloping, convex term structure of rent. Furthermore, there is an insignificant "size premium" but the "proportion discount" is significant. In general, other variables, such as location variables and qualitative variables behave as expected, {{with the exception of the}} expense type dummy <b>variables.</b> Tenant improvement <b>allowances</b> and leasing commissions paid by the landlord do not have a predictable impact on rent at low levels. But high levels of allowances and commissions result in significant rent premiums. These results indicate that lower levels of allowances and commissions may be expected by the market. At higher levels, however, these contractual terms are clearly priced into rent levels. (cont.) Renewal options appear to have positive impacts in some years and negative impacts in other years. Renewal options may represent amenities that are granted to tenants as inducements in weaker leasing markets but are priced in stronger markets. Termination options and rights of first offer/refusal appear to have negative impacts on rent that are somewhat consistent in all years. This is counterintuitive because these options are thought to benefit the tenant. One explanation is that these options are in fact beneficial to the landlord. Further study is necessary to understand the value of these options. Overall, more information about options terms would be beneficial. Information such as the renewal rent, the termination fee, and the size of the offer/refusal space would help us to understand the economic arrangement between the parties and to predict the corresponding impact on rent. by Kevin T.

40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivos avaliar e explicar o desenvolvimento de novilhas de corte dos 12 aos 24 meses de idade em uma pastagem natural manejada sob níveis fixos ou variáveis de oferta de forragem (OF), através das relações entre quantidade de forragem disponível, estrutura do pasto e lotação animal. Os tratamentos foram OF 4; 8; 12 e 16 % do peso vivo (PV) dos animais durante o ano inteiro e 8 - 12; 12 - 8 e 16 - 12 %, com o primeiro valor correspondendo à OF durante a primavera e o segundo à OF no verão-outono-inverno. O período de avaliações foi de outubro de 2004 a novembro de 2005. Foram utilizadas novilhas cruza Angus e Hereford com Nelore com peso inicial de 263 kg, em um delineamento de blocos ao acaso com duas repetições de área por tratamento. Os dados foram analisados pelos procedimentos Glm, Reg, Corr e Stepwise, do pacote estatístico SAS/STAT ao nível de 10 % de significância. A massa de forragem (MF) e a altura do pasto (ALT) aumentaram de forma linear com o aumento da OF e apresentaram alta correlação entre si (r= 0, 90). O ganho de peso médio diário (GMD), o peso (PV 18) e o escore de trato reprodutivo (ETR 18) aos 18 meses, assim como o peso (PV 24) e o escore de trato reprodutivo aos 24 meses (ETR 24) responderam de forma quadrática aos níveis de OF testados, aumentando até OF 12 %. Perda de peso foi registrada com OF 4 % no outono-inverno, ALT {{inferior}} a 5, 0 cm. A alteração da OF não afetou o ETR 18. As OF 12 e 12 - 8 % apresentaram ETR 24 acima de 4, 0 (atividade cíclica regular). O aumento da lotação em pastagem natural, apesar de aumentar a área do estrato efetivamente pastejado (AEP), reduz a área efetivamente pastejada por animal (AEPA), além de resultar em valores mais baixos de massa de MF e ALT, tendendo a restrições na ingestão de MS. A MF, ALT, estações alimentares com MF ou ALT ótimas (EMF e EALT) apresentaram alta correlação entre si e com outras variáveis de estrutura do pasto, relação forragem/animal e desenvolvimento animal. Conforme os modelos de regressão linear múltipla, o escore de trato reprodutivo das novilhas aos 18 meses (ETR 18) foi influenciado pelo ganho de peso dos 12 aos 18 meses (GMD 1) e o ETR 24 pelo peso aos 18 meses (PV 18). O GMD 1 foi explicado pela EMF (R 2 = 0, 52) e o GMD 2 pela EMF e pela AEPA (R 2 = 0, 63). This trial {{aimed to}} evaluate and explain beef heifers development from 12 until 24 months of age in natural pasture managed under set or <b>variables</b> forage <b>allowance</b> levels (FA), through relations among the amount of forage available, sward structure and stocking rate. The treatments were daily FA 4; 8; 12 and 16 % of animals live weight (LW) along the year and 8 - 12; 12 - 8 and 16 - 12 %, with the first value corresponding to FA during spring and the second to the FA applied on summer-autumn-winter. The trial was realized from 10 / 24 / 05 to 11 / 10 / 05. Angus, Hereford and Nelore cross heifers with 263 kg live weight were used in a randomized block design with two replicates (plots) per treatment. Data were analyzed by the statistical procedures Glm, Reg, Corr and Stepwise from SAS/STAT software at 0. 1 significant level. Forage mass (FM) and sward height (HEI) increased linearly with the FA and showed high correlation among each other (r= 0. 90). The average daily gain (GMD), the live weight (LW 18) and the reproductive tract score (RTS) at the 18 th month, {{as well as the}} live weight (LW 24) and the reproductive tract score (RTS 24) at the 24 th month, fitted to a quadratic model in relation to FA levels, increasing until 12 % FA. Weight loss was registered at 4 % FA in autumn-winter period, when HEI was lower than 5. 0 cm. Variables FA did not affect RTS 18. The 12 and 12 - 8 % FA showed RTS 24 greater than 4. 0 (normal cyclic activity). The increasing stock in natural pasture, despite the increase in the area effectively grazed (GEA), decreased the animal grazed effectively area (AGEA), resulting in lower values of FM and HEI, leading to DM intake restrictions. The variables FM, HEI and percentage of feeding stations with optimal forage mass or sward height (FMS and HEIS) showed high correlation among each other as well as with other sward structure, forage/stocking relations and animal development variables. According to the multiple linear regression models, ETR 18 was influenced by weight gain from 12 until 18 th month and ETR 24 by live weight at 18 months. The GMD 1 was explained by FMS (R 2 = 0. 52) and the GMD 2 by FMS and by AGEA (R 2 = 0. 63) ...|$|R

O delineamento utilizado foi o de blocos ao acaso com duas repetições, com três ofertas de forragem fixas (8, 12 e 16 %) e três ofertas de forragem variáveis ao longo do ano (8 - 12 %, 12 - 8 % e 16 - 12 %), com o primeiro valor correspondendo à primavera. Na oferta fixa de forragem de 8 %, observou-se maior percentual de área efetivamente pastejada, porém os valores médios de altura e massa de forragem foram inferiores aos das demais ofertas. As maiores ofertas de forragem, 16 e 16 - 12 %, apresentaram altura média do pasto superior, 9, 0 cm e massa de forragem de 2. 000 kg/ha de matéria seca, porém, com área efetivamente pastejada inferior às observadas nas ofertas de 8 e 8 - 12 %. Mesmo estratégias de manejo tão distintas, aproximadamente 60 a 70 % dos sítios alimentares ocorreram em faixas consideradas limitantes ao potencial de ingestão de forragem por bovinos, com exceção dos tratamentos 16 % e 16 - 12 %, nos quais se observou menor frequência de sítios alimentares na faixa inferior a 6, 0 cm de altura. Os sítios alimentares, em geral, se concentraram em faixas com altura < 6 cm e massas de forragem < 1000 e 1000 - 1500 kg/ha de matéria seca em todas as ofertas de forragem avaliadas, porém, nas ofertas de 16 - 12 % e 8 - 12 %, ocorreu uma melhor distribuição dos sítios alimentares nas demais faixas de massa de forragem e altura do pasto. The {{objective of}} this trial {{was to investigate the}} spatio-temporal dynamics of feeding sites stratified by strips of herbage mass and sward height, and the percentage of effectively grazed area, herbage growth rate and dry matter yield of a natural pasture from Pampa Biome managed with different herbage allowance management strategies. A randomized block design with two replications was used with three fixed herbage allowance (8, 12 and 16 %) and three herbage <b>allowance</b> <b>variables</b> throughout the year (8 - 12 %, 12 - 8 %, and 16 - 12 %), with first value corresponding to the spring season. The 8 % fixed herbage allowance presented greater effectively grazed area, but the average height and herbage mass were lower than in other allowances. The highest herbage allowance, 16 % and 16 - 12 %, presented 9. 0 cm average sward height and herbage mass of 2, 000 kg/ha dry matter, and a smaller effectively grazed area than the 8 % and 8 - 12 % herbage allowances. In spite of the different management strategies used, between 60 and 70 % of feeding sites occurred in strips considered to constrain animal intake, except in the 16 % and 16 - 12 % treatments, in which a smaller frequency of feeding sites in strips lower than 6. 0 cm was registered. In general, the feeding sites were concentrated on strips < 6 cm SH, and herbage masses < 1000 and 1000 - 1500 kg/ha dry matter, in all allowances. However, at 16 - 12 % and 8 - 12 % herbage allowances, the feeding sites were better distributed among the strips for herbage mass and sward height...|$|R
