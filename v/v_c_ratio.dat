Significant decreases in ventilatory capacity were recorded on Friday, Monday, and the following Thursday, with, on the average, complete `overnight' recovery, as indicated by similar morning values. Slightly, but not significantly, greater differences were observed in seven subjects with mild byssinotic symptoms and in five subjects with an observed productive cough on request. No effect of sex, shift, or history of cough and sputum was demonstrable. By contrast with the jute workers, no influence of smoking habit was apparent. The larger decreases in ventilatory capacity were observed in those with the higher F. E. V. 1 · 0 :F. <b>V.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>ratios,</b> whereas the reverse trend was noted in the jute workers. The occurrence of significant large decreases in those employed in the industry for less than a month, in conjunction with other evidence, suggests that a factor of `self-selection' may be operative among cotton employees in this country and {{may be related to the}} apparently low prevalence of clinically important byssinosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Reduced gas {{transfer}} {{in patients with}} pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is traditionally attributed to remodeling and progressive loss of pulmonary arterial vasculature that results in decreased capillary blood volume available for gas exchange. Methods We tested this hypothesis by determination of lung diffusing capacity (DL) and its components, the alveolar capillary membrane diffusing capacity (D m) and lung capillary blood volume (<b>V</b> <b>c)</b> in 28 individuals with PAH in comparison to 41 healthy individuals, and in 19 PAH patients over time. Using single breath simultaneous measure of diffusion of carbon monoxide (DL CO) and nitric oxide (DL NO), DL and D m were respectively determined, and <b>V</b> <b>c</b> calculated. D m and <b>V</b> <b>c</b> were evaluated over time in relation to standard clinical indicators of disease severity, including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 6 -minute walk distance (6 MWD) and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) by echocardiography. Results Both DL CO and DL NO were reduced in PAH as compared to controls and the lower DL in PAH was due to loss of both D m and <b>V</b> <b>c</b> (all p[*] CO of PAH patients did not change over time, DL NO decreased by 24 ml/min/mmHg/year (p[*]=[*] 0. 01). Consequently, D m decreased and <b>V</b> <b>c</b> tended to increase over time, which led to deterioration of the D m /V <b>c</b> <b>ratio,</b> a measure of alveolar-capillary membrane functional efficiency without changes in clinical markers. Conclusions The findings indicate that lower than normal {{gas transfer}} in PAH is due to loss of both D m and <b>V</b> <b>c,</b> but that deterioration of D m /V c over time is related to worsening membrane diffusion. </p...|$|R
30|$|Doping an impure element with {{a larger}} atomic volume into {{crystalline}} structure of buck crystals is normally blocked because the rigid crystalline structure could not tolerate a larger distortion. However, this difficulty may be weakened for nanocrystalline structures. Diamonds, {{as well as many}} semiconductors, have a difficulty in effective doping. Theoretical calculations carried out by DFT indicate that vanadium (V) is a dopant element for the n-type diamond semiconductor, and their several donor state levels are distributed between the conduction band and middle bandgap position in the V-doped band structure of diamond. Experimental investigation of doping vanadium into nanocrystalline diamond films (NDFs) was first attempted by hot filament chemical vapor deposition technique.

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted through searching in PubMed, Embase, the Chinese Biomedical Database, and the Wei Pu (Chinese) Database by the end of April 2016. Eleven publications with 21 studies were included in this meta-analysis, covering a total of 4333 patients with pneumoconiosis and 3478 controls. Study quality was assessed, and heterogeneity and publication bias were measured. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 12. 0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) software. Results: The data showed significant associations between TGF-β 1 − 509 C>T polymorphism and the risk of pneumoconiosis development (T <b>vs.</b> <b>C,</b> odds <b>ratio</b> [OR] = 1. 35, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 00 – 1. 81, P = 0. 046); between TGF-β 1 + 915 G>C polymorphism and the pneumoconiosis risk (<b>C</b> <b>vs.</b> G, OR = 1. 69, 95 % CI: 1. 19 – 2. 40, P = 0. 004; CG vs. GG, OR = 1. 79, 95 % CI: 1. 23 – 2. 60, P = 0. 002; CC+CG vs. GG, OR = 1. 80, 95 % CI: 1. 24 – 2. 61, P = 0. 002).

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether recent {{changes to the}} mathematics courses offered in {{the final year of}} secondary school (Year 12) in the state of Victoria, Australia have affected the learning outcomes of students in terms of then: skill levels in algebra, calculus and problem solving; and in terms of their preparation for a tertiary mathematics unit. The impact of these changes on the transition from secondary to tertiary mathematics is also considered. A comparison is made between students who attempted a first year mathematics unit at the University of Melbourne (U. of M.) having completed the new <b>V.</b> <b>C.</b> E. (Victorian Certificate of Education) mathematics courses and mathematics courses from the previous H. S. C. (Higher School Certificate) system. The comparison involves the use of tests administered upon entrance to a tertiary mathematics unit at the U. of M., and questionnaires. In 1991, <b>V.</b> <b>C.</b> E, students and H. S. C. students attempted the same mathematics test at the U. of M. and their results were compared. In 1992, the tests were attempted by <b>V.</b> <b>C.</b> E. students only. To compare new <b>V.</b> <b>C.</b> E. students and H. S. C. students, questions on the 1991 test were matched with similar questions on the 1992 tests and a panel of experts determined what the H. S. C. students who attempted the 1991 test would have been expected to average on these matched questions on the 1992 tests had they attempted them. These expected average scores were then compared with the actual scores of the new <b>V.</b> <b>C.</b> E. students. The scores of the groups were scaled when necessary. Questionnaires were administered to 1991 U. of M, mathematics students who were part of the <b>V.</b> <b>C.</b> E. pilot group in 1990, secondary mathematics educators, tertiary mathematics educators, and 1991 <b>V.</b> <b>C.</b> E. (1992 U. of M.) students. The mathematical misconceptions exhibited by new <b>V.</b> <b>C.</b> E. students are discussed and their frequencies stated. The research indicates that the new <b>V.</b> <b>C.</b> E. mathematics courses have provided the <b>V.</b> <b>C.</b> E. mathematics students in this study with significantly lower skill levels and a significantly poorer preparation for a tertiary mathematics unit than those which were previously provided by the H.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Glycated albumin (GA) {{relative}} to A 1 C {{is a useful}} marker of short-term glycemic control. We investigated whether endogenous insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes has different effects on GA and A 1 C levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A 1 C, GA, and GA-to-A 1 <b>C</b> <b>ratio</b> were compared in 202 type 2 diabetic patients by type of treatment. Effect of �-cell function determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-%�) on GA-to-A 1 <b>C</b> <b>ratio</b> was examined. In addition, GA-to-A 1 <b>C</b> <b>ratio</b> was compared between type 2 diabetic patients and 16 patients with type 1 diabetes. RESULTS — In type 2 diabetic patients, GA-to-A 1 <b>C</b> <b>ratio</b> was significantly higher in those treated with insulin than in those treated with diet or oral hypoglycemic agents. HOMA-%� showed a significant inverse correlation with GA-to-A 1 <b>C</b> <b>ratio.</b> This ratio was higher in type 1 diabetic patients than in type 2 diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS — In diabetic patients with decreased insulin secretion, serum GA levels are higher {{relative to}} A 1 C. Diabetes Care 33 : 270 – 272, 201...|$|R
