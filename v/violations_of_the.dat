5|$|In April 2006, Rangel {{and nine}} other representatives joined John Conyers' action against George W. Bush and others, alleging <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Constitution {{in the passing}} of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Conyers v. Bush was {{dismissed}} later that year for lack of standing.|$|E
5|$|Attorneys {{criticized the}} show as {{unrealistic}} due to numerous <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct by the fictional attorneys on the show. The show was also criticized for its depiction of young associates performing tedious legal research with hard copy books in a law library; a firm the size and caliber of Sterling, Huddle, Oppenheim, & Craft would have a subscription to online databases like Westlaw or LexisNexis.|$|E

5|$|Complicating {{the account}} of this period {{is the issue of}} the Peace of Callias, which {{allegedly}} ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians. The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace), and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of the}} campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander {{met at the}} Congress of Erfurt to {{preserve}} the Russo-French alliance. The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807. By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was {{under pressure from the}} Russian nobility to break off the alliance. A major strain on {{the relationship between the two}} nations became the regular <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, {{the company}} {{agreed to a}} $2.8 million {{settlement}} with the U.S. government over <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act {{that had taken place}} between 2003 and 2005. Payments of $536,000 had been made to the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization in order to obtain purchase orders and had been inaccurately reported as sales commissions in Comverse's accounting.|$|E
50|$|A {{complaint}} was {{filed with the}} Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. <b>The</b> complaint alleged <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The EEOC subsequently determined that no <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ADEA had occurred.|$|R
50|$|The EEOC {{ultimately}} {{ruled that}} the discharge itself did not constitute a <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ADEA, but <b>the</b> subsequent cancellation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insurance was retaliatory in nature and was a <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act. (a), (d).|$|R
50|$|The {{recommended}} {{charges were}} falsification of public documents, prolonging of performance <b>of</b> duties, <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passport law, obstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apprehension and prosecution of criminal offenders, perjury, and <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Central Bank Act.|$|R
5|$|Sultan Iskandar and {{his family}} members were not prosecuted for their past <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law on grounds that the royal {{immunity}} was still applicable when the incidences occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted {{to take steps to}} rehabilitate his public image, which was more or less tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have toned down somewhat on his hardline image and appeared to be somewhat more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain their loyalty to him.|$|E
5|$|The main {{national}} courts are the Constitutional Court, which oversees <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, and the Supreme Court, {{which is the}} highest court of appeal. In addition, there are also County, Municipal, Misdemeanor, Commercial, and Administrative courts. Cases falling within judicial jurisdiction are {{in the first instance}} decided by a single professional judge, while appeals are deliberated in mixed tribunals of professional judges. Lay magistrates also participate in trials. State's Attorney Office is the judicial body constituted of public prosecutors that is empowered to instigate prosecution of perpetrators of offences.|$|E
5|$|The {{refusal of}} the United States {{government}} to take promised military action {{in the face of}} North Vietnamese <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cease-fire is also examined as a key to the defeat. Adherents to this claim believed that South Vietnam could have been saved by another U.S. bombing campaign. The conflict between the executive and legislative branches of the American government, already severe before the onset of the Operation Linebacker II in 1972, was only more exasperating during 1975, when a new campaign would probably only have provoked even more Congressional outrage.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendants}} {{were subject to}} fines of up to $100,000 per <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spyware Act and $2,000 per <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Consumer Protection Act if found liable. They were also subject to paying restitution to affected consumers.|$|R
50|$|Irregular {{migration}} to Spain is <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> foreign nationals entering Spain, without government permission and in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> given nationality law, or staying beyond <b>the</b> termination date <b>of</b> a visa, also in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law.|$|R

5|$|The report, {{released}} on 15 September 2009, concluded {{that both sides}} had committed <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws of war. It stated that Israel had used disproportionate force, targeted Palestinian civilians, used them as human shields and destroyed civilian infrastructure. Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups {{were found to have}} deliberately targeted Israeli civilians and sought to spread terror in southern Israel by mounting indiscriminate rocket attacks. The report's conclusions were endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council.|$|E
5|$|While {{there were}} many <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ceasefire, the {{incidents}} were relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion on their side in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two sides were also careful to leave {{the door open for}} a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as the best chance to unseat Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|With the reconfirmation of the Charters in 1300, an {{additional}} document was granted, the Articuli super Cartas (The Articles upon the Charters). It {{was composed of}} 17 articles and sought in part {{to deal with the}} problem of enforcing the Charters. Magna Carta and the Forest Charter were to be issued to the sheriff of each county, and should be read four times a year at the meetings of the county courts. Each county should have a committee of three men who could hear complaints about <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Charters.|$|E
25|$|This was a {{clear and}} {{increasingly}} blatant <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basic right to life. The impunity for those who committed these acts, or ordered their commission, was a <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right to justice and to a fair trial.|$|R

25|$|A {{law passed}} in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Origination Clause would thus {{be no more}} immune from {{judicial}} scrutiny because it was passed by both Houses and signed by the President than would be a law passed in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment.|$|R
5|$|After seeing Ned Flanders reject {{an offer}} from a crooked cable man to get an illegal cable hook-up for $50, Homer chases after the cable man and takes the offer. Homer likes the new {{channels}} and {{spends a lot of}} time watching the television along with his family. Lisa, however, feels suspicious about the cable hook-up. Following a Sunday school lesson regarding the existence and nature of Hell, Lisa becomes terrified of <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ten Commandments, the adherence to which she is assured will keep one's soul safe from Hell. She fears that because Homer violated the Eighth Commandment, he will go to Hell when he dies.|$|E
5|$|After <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1933 Reichskonkordat {{between the}} Church and Nazi Germany, Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 {{encyclical}} Mit brennender Sorge which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the Church and their ideology of neopaganism and racial superiority. The Church condemned the 1939 invasion of Poland that started World War II and other subsequent wartime Nazi invasions. Thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned and murdered throughout the countries {{occupied by the}} Nazis, including Saints Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein. While Pope Pius XII has been credited with helping to save {{hundreds of thousands of}} Jews in the Holocaust, the Church has also been accused of encouraging centuries of antisemitism and not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the warring}} parties were {{responsible}} for widespread <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws of war, as civilians {{were caught in the}} ensuing crossfire. Insurgents reportedly deployed militants and established strongholds in heavily populated neighborhoods, launched mortar rounds from residential areas, and targeted public and private individuals for assassination and violence. TFG forces alleged to have failed to efficaciously warn civilians in combat zones, impeded relief efforts, plundered property, in some instances engaged in murder and violence, and mistreated detainees during mass arrests. According to HRW, the implicated TFG forces included military, police and intelligence personnel, as well as the private guards of senior TFG officials. Victims were often unable to identify TFG personnel, and confused militiamen aligned with TFG officials with TFG police officers and other state security personnel.|$|E

5|$|Article 3 of {{the bill}} amended the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses with Article 6.21, which prescribes {{penalties}} for <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> propaganda ban: Russian citizens found guilty can receive fines of up to 5,000 rubles, and public officials can receive fines of up to 50,000 rubles. Organizations or businesses can be fined up to 1 million rubles and be forced to cease operations for up to 90 days. Foreigners may be arrested and detained for up to 15 days then deported, or fined up to 5,000 rubles and deported. The fines for individuals are much higher if the offense was committed using mass media or internet.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} of his partial term in 1942, Chandler faced a challenge from former ally John Y. Brown, Sr. in the Democratic primary. As {{a result of}} his votes on the anti-lynching bill and the poll tax repeal, the Louisville chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People worked against his re-election effort. During the campaign, Brown accused Chandler of abusing his power, including having a swimming pool installed at his home in violation of the federal rationing provisions implemented during World War II. Chandler invited the Truman Committee to investigate the installation of the pool; the committee found no <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal rationing provisions. Chandler went on to defeat Brown and was easily re-elected in the general election over Republican Richard J. Colbert.|$|E
5|$|One cageside judge scored it a 10–8 {{round as}} Silva was {{credited}} with zero strikes. Sonnen connected with 76 strikes from the top position in the opening round, and held a 22-to-15 edge in significant strikes against Silva. However, Sonnen was unable to inflict substantial damage to the champion, and as the fight resumed Silva was repeatedly admonished by the ref for holding Chael's shorts. Being unable to score a takedown due to Silva's constant <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ref's commands, Sonnen failed to connect with a high-risk spinning backfist strike, leaving Sonnen in a scooting position for Silva to land a knee to the chest, then with punches to stop Sonnen with a TKO at 1:55 of the second round.|$|E
