40|$|Intra-host {{sequence}} {{data from}} RNA viruses have revealed {{the ubiquity of}} <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> in natural viral populations, sometimes at surprisingly high frequency. Although <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> have long been known to laboratory virologists, their relevance in clinical and epidemiological settings has not been established. The discovery of long-term transmission of a defective lineage of dengue virus type 1 (DENV- 1) in Myanmar, first seen in 2001, raised important questions about the emergence of transmissible <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> and their role in viral epidemiology. By combining phylogenetic analyses and dynamical modeling, we investigate how evolutionary and ecological processes at the intra-host and inter-host scales shaped the emergence and spread of the defective DENV- 1 lineage. We show that this lineage of <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> emerged between June 1998 and February 2001, and that the <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> was transmitted primarily through co-transmission with the functional virus to uninfected individuals. We provide evidence that, surprisingly, this co-transmission route has a higher transmission potential than transmission of functional dengue viruses alone. Consequently, we predict that the defective lineage should increase overall incidence of dengue infection, which {{could account for the}} historically high dengue incidence reported in Myanmar in 2001 – 2002. Our results show the unappreciated potential for <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> to impact the epidemiology of human pathogens, possibly by modifying the virulence-transmissibility trade-off, or to emerge as circulating infections in their own right. They also demonstrate that interactions between viral variants, such a...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the derivation {{of a novel}} T-cell-defective virus vector employing the human herpesvirus 7 (HHV- 7). The new vector, designated Tamplicon- 7, replicates in CD 4 + T cells. The system is composed of a helper <b>virus</b> and <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> genomes derived by the replication of the input Tamplicon vector. There are two cis-acting functions required for the replication and packaging of the <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> genomes {{in the presence of}} the helper virus: the viral DNA replication origin and the composite cleavage and packaging signal, which directs the cleavage and packaging of <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> genomes. Viral DNA replication is compatible with the rolling circle mechanism, producing large head-to-tail concatemers of the Tamplicon vector. Thus, {{in the presence of the}} helper virus, the replicated vectors are packaged and secreted into the medium. Furthermore, we have shown that the vector can be employed to express a foreign gene, encoding the green fluorescent protein, in the T cells infected with the HHV- 7 helper virus. We predict that the Tamplicon- 7 vector might be potentially useful for gene therapy of diseases affecting the human CD 4 + T cells, including autoimmune diseases, T-cell lymphomas, and AIDS...|$|R

40|$|There {{was strong}} {{interference}} between various virulent and avirulent strains of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) {{and their respective}} <b>defective</b> interfering (DI) <b>viruses</b> but in other combinations interference was variable: it could be equally strong, weak or could not be demonstrated. On passage, this spectrum of interfering activity changed, some combinations showing greater interference than before and others less. Heterotypic interference between DI SFV, DI Sindbis virus and standard viruses was clearly demonstrated although this was strongest between DI SFV preparations and Sindbis standard virus than in the reciprocal combinations. Variation in interference between DI SFVs and different SFV strains was similar in magnitude to that between DI SFVs and Sindbis virus, suggesting that a similar DI RNA sequence is recognized by both <b>viruses.</b> <b>Defective</b> interfering (DI) <b>viruses</b> are generated by serial undiluted passage of most, if not all, animal viruses (Huang & Baltimore, 1977) and have a genome which is a deleted form of the infectious (standard) virus genome.

Enhanced S-phase replication of the E 4 orf 6 -mutant viruses requires the E 4 orf 3 gene. This report {{demonstrates that the}} E 4 orf 3 gene is also required for enhanced S-phase replication of the E 1 B- 55 K-mutant <b>virus.</b> Adenoviruses (Ads) <b>defective</b> in the coding regions of the early region 1 B 55 -kDa (E 1 B- 55 K) protein or early region 4 open reading frame 6 (E 4 orf 6) are restricted for growth by the cell cycle.

Furthermore, the yields of mutant viruses from S-phase-infected cells were significantly greater than the yields from G 1 -infected cells. By contrast, every cell infected with the wild-type virus produced progeny to an equivalent level irrespective of the stage of the cell cycle at the time of infection (5, 6).

40|$|We have {{constructed}} recombinant adenoviruses (Ad), with functional or defective E 1 a genes, which harbor {{either the}} hepatitis B (HB) virus s gene encoding the HB surface antigen, {{as well as}} the pre-S 2 epitopes, or the bacterial gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) under control of the Ad major late promoter (MLP).

The yields of HBs and CAT proteins obtained with these different recombinant viruses demonstrate no real advantage to using nondefective vectors, whatever the cell type infected.

Analysis of the DI genomes revealed internal deletions of 4, 764 nucleotides encompassing the complete structural protein-coding region of the virus and two flanking nonstructural genes.

40|$|Murine {{acquired}} immune deficiency syndrome (MAIDS) shares several common characteristics {{with human}} AIDS, including immunodeficiency, hypergammaglobulinemia, susceptibility to infection, both B and T cell dysfunctions, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and aberrant cytokine production. The etiologic agent of MAIDS {{has been identified}} as a defective retrovirus which contains major deletions in its pol and env regions but has largely maintained its gag region. The only gene product of this virus is a 60 kDa gag fusion protein, Pr 60 gag, which is necessary and sufficient to induce MAIDS in susceptible mouse strains. The target cells of the MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> have been identified as belonging to the B cell lineage. Infection of these target cells with the MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> leads to their proliferation, which is required for the full development of the disease. We undertook several approaches in order to more clearly understand the role of the MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> target B cell population in the development of this disease. Studies using SCID, CD 4 knockout, and nude mutant mice revealed that a relatively mature B cell population is the target of the MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus,</b> and that these cells can be infected in the absence of CD 4 + T cells. Our knowledge {{of the nature of the}} MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> target B cells was furthered by the derivation of two independent MAIDS defective virus-infected B cell lines which have characteristics of both mature and immature B cells. These B cell lines were used to demonstrate an in vivo association between Pr 60 gag and c-Abl. Additional exploration of the Pr 60 gag-c-Abl interaction revealed that Pr 60 gag could induce a CD 8 + T cell-dependant rejection of v-Abl-transformed pre-B cell lines, and increase the tumor latency of mice inoculated with Pr 60 gag-expressing B 16 F 1 melanoma cells. Taken together, these results enhance our knowledge of the identity and role of the MAIDS <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> target cells in the pathogenesis of this disease and propose a possible mechanism by which Pr 60 gag activates the disease process. As well as inducing MAIDS, Pr 60 gag may also have potential positive use in cancer therapy...|$|R

Cells infected by this mutant accumulated {{higher levels of}} viral covalently closed, circular DNA (cccDNA) than those infected by wild-type virus. The accumulation of high levels of cccDNA was due to {{a failure of the}} mutant-infected cells to suppress de novo cccDNA synthesis compared with suppression by cells infected by the wild type. The envelope-defective virus failed to establish a persistent infection in vitro, possibly because of a virus-mediated cell death. Therefore, one or both viral envelope proteins are required for regulation of cccDNA synthesis and for maintenance of persistent infection in vitro...|$|E

Using in vitro-transcribed Sendai <b>virus</b> <b>defective</b> interfering RNA as a model ligand, we show that RIG-I oligomerizes on 50 -ppp dsRNA in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent and dsRNA length-dependent manner, which correlates with the strength of type-I interferon (IFN-I) activation.

40|$|CD 4 down-modulation is {{essential}} for the production of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectious particles. Disease progression correlates with enhanced viral induced CD 4 down-modulation, and a subset of long-term nonprogressors carry <b>viruses</b> <b>defective</b> in this function. Despite multiple pieces of evidence highlighting the importance of this function in viral pathogenesis in vivo, to date, HIV-induced CD 4 down-modulation has not been used as a target for intervention. We describe here HIV-based vectors that deliver truncated CD 4 molecules resistant to down-modulation by the viral products Nef and Vpu. Infection of cells previously transduced with these vectors proceeded normally, and viral particles were released in normal amounts. However, the infectivity of the released virions was reduced 1, 000 -fold. Lentiviral vectors expressing truncated CD 4 molecules were efficient at blocking HIV- 1 infectivity and replication in several cell lines and in CD 4 -positive primary lymphocytes. The findings presented here provide proof-of-principle that approaches targeting the virus-induced CD 4 down-modulation may constitute the basis for novel anti-HIV therapies...|$|R
40|$|Adenovirus type 2 mRNAs were {{injected}} via glass capillaries into Vero cells, {{a line of}} African {{green monkey}} kidney cells permissive for adenovirus growth. Polypeptides synthesized after injection were labeled with 35 S-labeled amino acids, precipitated with antiviral sera, and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both early and late viral mRNAs give rise to authentic polypeptides. The in vivo translation of mRNAs can be measured as late as 24 hr after injection. The ability to analyze the protein products of microinjected mRNAs directly should greatly extend the applications of the procedure. Vero cells injected with early mRNA from adenovirus type 2 support the growth of adenovirus-associated <b>virus,</b> a <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> that is dependent on adenovirus helper functions.

40|$|Influenza <b>virus</b> <b>defective</b> interfering (DI) RNAs, which {{originate}} from polymerase genes by simple internal deletion, can be transcribed in vitro. These DI RNA transcripts contain covalently linked polyadenylic acid, and their synthesis {{is dependent on}} ApG or capped RNAs as primers. Furthermore, like the standard viral RNA transcripts, they are complementary in nature and are slightly smaller in size compared with the corresponding DI RNAs. Hybridization of the specific DI RNA transcripts with the corresponding DI RNA segments {{and analysis of the}} duplex RNA by gel electrophoresis indicate that they are not incomplete polymerase gene transcripts, but rather the transcripts of the DI RNAs. Since influenza virus DI RNAs contain both the 5 ' and the 3 ' termini and transcribe polyadenylic acid-containing complementary RNAs in vitro the mechanism of interference may differ from that of the 5 ' DI RNAs of Sendai and vesicular stomatitis viruses...|$|E
40|$|Lymphocytic choriomeninigitis (LCM) <b>virus</b> <b>defective</b> interfering (DI) {{particles}} form foci {{of protected}} cells in a monolayer under an agarose-containing overlay medium. Foci originate from one cell dually infected {{with at least}} 1 interference focus-forming unit and infectious virus. As a result, an interfering factor is produced and released which interacts with neighboring cells, thereby protecting them against cytopathic lysis by challenge virus. The property of individual LCM virus DI particles to induce countable foci has been made the basis of quantitative assay that is comparable in every respect to the plaque assay of infectious virus and is much more sensitive and probably more accurate than other procedures used to measure LCM virus DI particles. LCM virus was passaged, undiluted, 10 times in cell cultures. When yields were analyzed as to concentrations of PFU and interference focus-forming units, both entities were found to fluctuate with the pattern expected from theoretical considerations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{protein kinase}} {{regulated}} by RNA (PKR) enhances both activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and the induction of interferon beta (IFN-β) by measles <b>virus</b> <b>defective</b> in C-protein expression (Cko). Here we used complementation of human cell lines stably deficient in PKR (PKRkd) {{to probe the}} basis of these PKR-mediated responses. We found that PKRkd HeLa and amnion U cell lines were defective for virus-mediated activation of IFN induction signaling components compared to PKR-sufficient control cells. Complementation of PKRkd cells with wildtype PKR, but not with PKR mutants defective in either catalytic activity or dsRNA-binding activity, restored JNK, p 38 and ATF- 2 phosphorylation and enhanced IFN-β induction following infection. By contrast to mammalian PKR, the Z-DNA binding domain-containing fish homologue of PKR, PKZ, lacked the capacity to enhance Cko virus-mediated IFN-β induction. Furthermore, inhibition of virus growth was observed with Cko-infected PKRkd cells complemented with PKR but not with PKZ...|$|E
40|$|In 1970 Abelson and Rabstein (1) {{isolated}} {{a variant}} of Moloney leukemia virus from a nonthymic lymphoma of a BALB/c mouse. Subsequent studies indicated that this virus, now termed Abelson murine leukemia virus (MuLV-A), 1 induces a malignant disease of primitive bone marrow-derived lymphocytes (2 - 5). Under certain conditions, MuLV-A also induces tumors of highly differentiated B cells, i. e. plasmacytomas (6). Thus, {{it is apparent that}} MuLV-A differs from other murine leukemia viruses in its target cell specificity. Virologic studies indicate that MuLV-A is a complex of <b>defective</b> <b>virus</b> and nondefective Moloney leukemia <b>virus.</b> The <b>defective</b> <b>virus,</b> which can be assayed in vitro by focus formation on certain etablished cell lines, is responsible for the induction of nonthymic lymphoma (7). Recent evidence indicates that MuLV-A can exert its oncogenic effect on lymphoid cells in tissue culture (5, 8 - 10). The studies reported here examined the age and virus dose dependence of MuLV-A lymphomagenesis, and the pattern of susceptibility of various mouse strains to MuLV-A. Results from studies of BALB/c × C 57 BL/ 6 recombinant inbred strains indicate that susceptibility to MuLV-A lymphomagenesis is controlled by two loci, designated Av-I and Av- 2, at which sensitivity alleles are dominant. Furthermore, the genes involved in this disease are not identical to genes controlling other pathologic forms of murine leukemia...|$|R
40|$|HIV- 1 latently {{infected}} {{cells in}} vivo {{can be found}} in extremely low frequencies. Therefore, in vitro cell culture models have been used extensively for the study of HIV- 1 latency. Often, these in vitro systems utilize <b>defective</b> <b>viruses.</b> <b>Defective</b> <b>viruses</b> allow for synchronized infections and circumvent the use of antiretrovirals. In addition, replication-defective viruses cause minimal cytopathicity because they fail to spread and usually do not encode env or accessory genes. On the other hand, replication-competent viruses encode all or most viral genes and better recapitulate the nuances of the viral replication cycle. The study of latency with replication-competent viruses requires the use of antiretroviral drugs in culture, and this mirrors the use of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in vivo. We describe a model that utilizes cultured central memory CD 4 + T cells and replication-competent HIV- 1. This method generates latently infected cells that can be reactivated using latency reversing agents in the presence of antiretroviral drugs. We also describe a method for the removal of productively infected cells prior to viral reactivation, which takes advantage of the downregulation of CD 4 by HIV- 1, and the use of a GFP-encoding virus for increased throughput...|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) has the {{capacity}} to establish a life-long latent infection in sensory neurones and also to periodically reactivate from these cells. Since mutant <b>viruses</b> <b>defective</b> for immediate-early (IE) expression retain {{the capacity}} for latency establishment it is widely assumed that latency is the consequence of a block in IE gene expression. However, {{it is not clear whether}} viral gene expression can precede latency establishment following wild-type virus infection. In order to address this question we have utilized a reporter mouse model system to facilitate a historical analysis of viral promoter activation in vivo. This system utilizes recombinant viruses expressing Cre recombinase under the control of different viral promoters and the Cre reporter mouse strain ROSA 26 R. In this model, viral promoter-driven Cre recombinase mediates a permanent genetic change, resulting in reporter gene activation and permanent marking of latently infected cells. The analyses of HSV- 1 recombinants containing human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early, ICP 0, gC or latency-associated transcript promoters linked to Cre recombinase in this system have revealed the existence of a population of neurones that have experienced IE promoter activation prior to the establishment of latency...|$|R

While these structures in the sub-genomic RNA {{were found to be}} essential for its replication, their nucleotide sequences were not, so long as any new sequences maintained wild type RNA secondary structure. These observations suggested that these sub-genomic fragments of RNA from dengue viruses were replicated {{in the same manner as}} the full length genomes of their wild type, “helper”, viruses and that they probably represent the smallest fragments of DENV RNA that can be replicated during a natural infection. While D. I. particles containing sub-genomic RNA are completely parasitic, the relationship between wild type and D. I. DENV may be symbiotic, with the D.

40|$|Direct {{sequencing}} of nine Sendai <b>virus</b> <b>defective</b> interfering RNA species revealed {{two kinds of}} 3 '-terminal sequences. Six RNA species had 3 ' termini identical to the virus genome (negative strand), confirming that internal deletions are a frequent cause of Sendai virus defectiveness.

Schubert, Cell 26 : 145 - 154, 1981), indicating that they are of the copy-back type. Extensive homology between {{these two types of}} 3 ' sequences evidently accounts for the ability of the copy-back sequence to function as an initiation signal for viral RNA replication.

40|$|Vaccinia <b>viruses</b> <b>defective</b> in the {{essential}} gene coding for the enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) do not undergo DNA replication {{and do not}} express late genes in wild-type cells. A UDG-deficient vaccinia virus vector carrying the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus prM/E gene, termed vD 4 -prME, was constructed, and its potential as a vaccine vector was evaluated. High-level expression of the prM/E antigens could be demonstrated in infected complementing cells, and moderate levels were found under noncomplementing conditions. The vD 4 -prME vector was used to vaccinate mice; animals receiving single vaccination doses as low as 104 PFU were fully protected against challenge with high doses of virulent TBE virus. Single vaccination doses of 103 PFU were sufficient to induce significant neutralizing antibody titers. With the corresponding replicating virus, doses at least 10 -fold higher were needed to achieve protection. The data indicate that late gene expression of the vaccine vector is not required for successful vaccination; early vaccinia virus gene expression induces a potent protective immune response. The new vaccinia virus-based defective vectors are therefore promising live vaccines for prophylaxis and cancer immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory viruses {{represent}} a major clinical burden. Few vaccines and antivirals are available, and the rapid appearance of resistant viruses {{is a cause}} for concern. We have developed a novel approach which exploits <b>defective</b> <b>viruses</b> (<b>defective</b> interfering (DI) or protecting viruses). These are naturally occurring deletion mutants which are replication-deficient and multiply only when coinfection with a genetically compatible infectious virus provides missing function(s) in trans. Interference/protection is believed to result primarily from genome competition and is therefore usually confined to the virus from which the DI genome originated. Using intranasally administered protecting influenza A virus we have successfully protected mice from lethal in vivo infection with influenza A viruses from several different subtypes [1]. Here we report, contrary to expectation, that protecting influenza A virus also protects in vivo against a genetically unrelated respiratory virus, pneumonia virus of mice, a pneumovirus from the family Paramyxoviridae. A single dose that contains 1 μg of protecting virus protected against lethal infection. This protection is achieved by stimulating type I interferon and possibly other elements of innate immunity. Protecting virus thus {{has the potential to}} protect against all interferon-sensitive respiratory viruses and all influenza A viruses...|$|R
