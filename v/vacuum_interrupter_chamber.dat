40|$|A {{resistive}} superconducting {{fault-current limiter}} (SFCL) {{has been developed}} using round magnesium diboride (MgB 2) wire. The SFCL coil was wound using an interleaved coil arrangement to minimize the total coil inductance. The SFCL coil demonstrated reliable and repeatable current-limiting properties during testing. However, the wire temperature of the SFCL coil increases quickly during quench tests, and several minutes are required for temperature recovery after the fault is cleared. The SFCL coil therefore was fully integrated with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> to quickly remove the SFCL coil from the circuit once a fault occurred. This allowed the SFCL coil to recover quickly while a bypass resistor acted as the current limiting resistance. A fast-acting actuator and its control circuit were designed and built to provide automatic control for {{the operation of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> The SFCL with the prototype <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> was successfully tested. The energy dissipated in the SFCL coil was significantly reduced by integrating the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> The fault tests with different potential fault currents also proved that the operation of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> is independent of the fault current level. This prototype demonstrated the potential of a cost-effective and compact integrated SFCL and <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> for power system applications...|$|R

50|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> bellows {{allows the}} moving contact to be {{operated}} from outside the interrupter enclosure, and must maintain a long-term high vacuum over the expected mechanical operating life of the <b>interrupter.</b> The <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> bellows is made of stainless steel with a thickness of 0.1 to 0.2 mm. The fatigue life of the bellows is affected by heat conducted from the arc.|$|R
50|$|The contact's {{structure}} {{has a great}} influence on the breaking capacity of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b>|$|R
40|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> is a {{switching}} device used in vacuum circuit breakers, which are widely employed in medium voltage circuits for interrupting the short-circuit fault currents. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> is the <b>chamber</b> {{in which the}} arc extinction and hence the current interruption takes place. On the occurrence of a fault, the breaker mechanism separates the contacts of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> As the contacts separate, an arc is established between the contacts. The arc evolves in the contact space and extinguishes {{at or near the}} current zero, thus interrupting the current. The processes of arc ignition, evolution and extinction are very complex. These processes are fundamental to the design and the performance of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> and hence the circuit breaker. The evolution of the arc predominantly depends on the short-circuit current, the design and metallurgy of the contacts. The evolution of the vacuum arc has been the focal point of considerable research activity. Significant effort has been concentrated to understand the various modes of the arc, the transition between the modes, the arc movement and the dependency on the contact design and finally the effect of the arc evolution on the current interruption performance of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> The voltage across the contacts during the arcing, termed as the arc voltage, has been a focal point of several research projects. Research has shown that the arc voltage depends strongly on the mode and the evolution process of the arc. The dependency is observed with respect to the magnitude {{and the nature of the}} arc voltage. This dependency has been established through the comparison of the arc voltage trace and the actual arc photographs. The arc voltage is thus an important parameter in understanding the arcing process in the interrupter. Arc voltage could also be utilised to compare the arcing behaviour in vacuum interrupters with different contact geometries and metallurgies. Having understood how the arc voltage depends on the arc modes and how it can be used to analyse the arcing performance of the interrupter, this work aims to establish experimentally the dependency of the arc voltage on fundamental parameters of the short-circuit current and the contact design. The variation of the arc voltage is studied with respect to the magnitude of the short-circuit current. It is seen that the magnitude of the arc voltage is higher, for a higher short-circuit current. This dependency is also reflected in the nature of the arc voltage waveform. The effect of cumulative short- circuit operations has been understood through the study of arc voltage variation with respect to the accumulated arcing time. It has been found that the arc voltage consistently decreases as the accumulated arcing time increases. The effect of the contact diameter on the arc evolution has been studied by comparing the arc voltage variations for contacts of different diameters for the same short-circuit current. It is observed that the variation of arc voltage with respect to the contact diameter depends on the type of contact. In the case of radial magnetic field contacts, it has been observed that the arc voltage is lower for a contact with lower diameter. Whereas in the case of axial magnetic field contacts there is an inverse relation between the contact diameter and the arc voltage. Finally, the effect of the type and distribution of the magnetic field on the arc voltage variation as well as the contact erosion has been studied. In general, the observations show that the arc voltage magnitude for the radial magnetic field geometry is higher than the axial magnetic field geometry. Also, there is a significant difference in the appearance of the arc voltage waveforms for the arcs under the two types of magnetic fields. Finite element simulations and short-circuit evaluations have shown that the axial magnetic field contact system with 90 deg coil orientations yield a more uniform distribution of the flux density and hence lower erosion of the contacts. These results show a clear dependence of the arc voltage on the various above mentioned parameters. Thus the arc voltage could be utilised as a diagnostic parameter during the evaluation of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> In the present scenario, significant research is being done to increase the breaking capacity of the interrupters. This calls for optimization of design of the existing contacts and the design of novel contact geometries. The arc voltage would be used as an important diagnostic tool in this process. Also, the utilization of <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> in high voltage and extra high voltage circuits is being explored. This application requires increase in the contact gap or series connection of gaps. The arc behaviour in longer gaps and gaps connected in series would be an important research area. Again the arc voltage could be used to study the arc evolution in these specialised conditions. The experiments in this research work have been performed on commercial vacuum interrupters. For a dedicated research on vacuum arcs and <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> contacts, development of a vacuum arc research facility has also been attempted as a part of this research work...|$|R

Vacuum interrupters {{can be used for}} circuit breakers and load switches. Circuit breaker vacuum interrupters are mainly used in the power sector in the substation and power grid facilities, while load switching <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> is mainly used for power grid of the end user.|$|R
40|$|The {{microscopic}} field enhancement factor β {{and the field}} emission area α of variously prestressed <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> contacts were investigated using the Fowler Nordheim equation.

50|$|Components of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> must be {{thoroughly}} cleaned before assembly since any contaminants could emit gas into the vacuum envelope.

Also, the arc voltage depends on the parameters like the magnitude of short-circuit current, the arcing time, the point of opening of the contacts, the geometry and area of the contacts and the type of magnetic field. This paper investigates the dependency of the arc voltage on some of these parameters. The paper also discusses the usefulness of the arc voltage in diagnosing the performance of the contacts...|$|R
50|$|Programma Electric AB was a Swedish {{electrical}} test and measurement equipment manufacturer founded in 1976. It provided products including: circuit breaker analysers, battery load testers, primary injection testers, <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> testers, microhmmeters and protective relay test instruments. The production plant facility {{was located in}} Täby, Sweden.|$|R
50|$|An {{external}} {{operating mechanism}} drives {{the motion of}} the moving contact, which opens and closes the connected circuit. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> will include a guide sleeve to control {{the motion of the}} moving contact, and to protect the sealing bellows from any twisting, which would drastically shorten its life.|$|R
50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, a <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> is a {{switching device}} that uses electrical contacts in a vacuum. It {{is the core}} component of medium-voltage switches. The separation of electrical contacts results in a vacuum arc, which is quickly extinguished. Vacuum interrupters are used in utility power transmission systems and in power distribution systems for railway and industrial plants.|$|R
50|$|In circuit breakers, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> contact {{materials}} are mostly copper-chromium alloy, copper and chromium each 50%. These {{may be made}} by welding a copper-chrome alloy sheet on {{the upper and lower}} contacts surface over a contact seat made of oxygen-free copper. Other {{materials are}} used in other interrupter designs, such as silver, tungsten and tungsten compounds, and others.|$|R
50|$|The {{contacts}} {{carry the}} circuit current when closed, and form the terminals of the arc when opening the circuit. Contacts {{are made of}} different materials depending on {{the application of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> and selection of the design for long contact life, rapid recovery of voltage withstand rating, and control of over-voltage due to current chopping.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} of the interrupter is made {{of glass}} or ceramic. To ensure that the <b>interrupter</b> <b>vacuum</b> is maintained {{over the life of}} the device, there must be hermetic seals between metal and ceramic components. The enclosure material must be impermeable to gas and must not give off trapped gas over its lifetime. The function of the stainless steel bellows not only isolates the vacuum state inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> from the external atmosphere, but also moves the movable contact with the conductor within a specified range to complete the closing and breaking of the vacuum switch operating.|$|R
50|$|The {{reduction}} in the number of <b>interrupting</b> <b>chambers</b> per pole has led to a considerable simplification of circuit breakers as well as the number of parts and seals required. As a direct consequence, the reliability of circuit breakers improved, as verified later on by International Council on Large Electric Systems (CIGRE) surveys.|$|R
50|$|Glass-ceramic-to-metal seals offer {{superior}} properties {{over their}} glass equivalents including more refractory behaviour, {{in addition to}} their ability to seal successfully to many different metals and alloys. They have been used in electrical feed-through seals for such applications as <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> envelopes and pyrotechnic actuators, in addition to many applications where a higher temperature capability than is possible with glass-to-metal seals is required, including solid oxide fuel cells.|$|R
50|$|The first {{industrial}} application of SF6 for current interruption dates to 1953. High-voltage 15 kV to 161 kV load switches were developed with a breaking capacity of 600 A. The first high-voltage SF6 circuit breaker built in 1956 by Westinghouse, could interrupt 5 kA under 115 kV, {{but it had}} six <b>interrupting</b> <b>chambers</b> in series per pole.|$|R
50|$|New {{types of}} SF6 {{breaking}} chambers, which implement innovative interrupting principles, {{have been developed}} over the past 30 years, {{with the objective of}} reducing the operating energy of the circuit breaker. One aim of this evolution was to further increase the reliability by reducing the dynamic forces in the pole. Developments since 1980 have seen the use of the self-blast technique of interruption for SF6 <b>interrupting</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This technique, {{known as}} [...] "self-blast" [...] {{has now been}} used {{extensively}} since 1980 {{for the development of}} many types of <b>interrupting</b> <b>chambers.</b> The increased understanding of arc interruption obtained by digital simulations and validation through breaking tests, contribute to a higher reliability of these self-blast circuit breakers. In addition the reduction in operating energy, allowed by the self-blast technique, leads to longer service life.|$|R
50|$|Some {{designs of}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> have simple butt contacts, but {{generally}} the contacts are shaped {{to improve their}} ability to break very heavy currents. Slots, ridges, or grooves are formed in the contacts. Arc current flowing through the shaped contacts generate magnetic forces on the arc column which cause the arc contact spot to move rapidly {{over the surface of}} the contact. This reduces contact wear due to erosion by the arc, which melts the contact metal at the point of contact.|$|R
5000|$|Now {{the main}} {{manufacturers}} of <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> are General Electric (GE), Westinghouse Electric (WH), Jucro Electric, Cooper Electric and Jenning ELectric.GEC company (later incorporated into France Alsthom, AREVA)Seimens company, AEG (later incorporated into France Alsthom, AREVA) and Calor-Emag (later incorporated into ABB), the technology source come from United States and United Kingdom.Toshiba company, MEIDENSHA CORPORATION, Fuji company, Hitachi and Mitsubishi etc., their products are longitudinal magnetic field structure, but {{each has its}} own characteristics, but which Toshiba is the most representative.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} requirements {{apply to}} contact materials:1. High breaking ability. Requirements excellent conductivity of the material, small thermal conductivity, bigger heat capacity, low hot electron emission capability.2. Requirements High breakdown voltage. 3. High resistance to electrical erosion. 4. Resistance to welding.5. Low cutoff current value.6. Low gas content. The low gas content {{is a requirement}} for all materials used inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> Especially copper, must require low air content of the special process to deal with oxygen-free copper. While the solder is used silver-copper alloy.|$|R
50|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> {{will have}} {{internal}} shields around the contacts {{and at the}} ends of the interrupter. The shields stop any contact material vaporized during the arc from condensing {{on the inside of the}} vacuum envelope. This would reduce the insulation strength of the envelope and ultimately would result in a flash-over of the interrupter when open. The shield material also helps control the shape of the electric field distribution inside the interrupter, which contributes to a higher open-circuit withstand voltage rating. Additionally, the shield system helps absorb some of the energy produced in the arc, increasing the interrupting rating of the device.|$|R
50|$|Many {{manufacturing}} variations exist, but {{in general}} a <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> will have a fixed contact, a moving contact, a flexible bellows to allow movement of the moving contact, and arc shields, enclosed in a hermetic glass, ceramic or metal housing that is evacuated to a high vacuum. The moving contact is connected by a flexible braid to the external circuit, and is moved by an actuating mechanism when the device is required to open or close. Since air pressure tends to close the contacts, the operating mechanism must hold the contacts open against the inherent closing force of air pressure on the bellows.|$|R
40|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> utilises {{magnetic}} field for effective arc extinction. Based {{on the type}} of field, the vacuum interrupters are classified as radial or axial magnetic type of vacuum interrupters. This paper focuses on the axial {{magnetic field}} type of vacuum interrupters. The magnitude and distribution of the axial magnetic field {{is a function of the}} design of the contact system. It also depends on the orientations of the movable and fixed contact systems with respect to each other. This paper investigates the dependence of arcing and erosion performance of the contact on the magnitude and distribution of this axially oriented magnetic field. The experimental observations are well supported by electromagnetic simulations...|$|R

50|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> uses a {{high vacuum}} to {{extinguish}} the arc between {{a pair of}} contacts. As the contacts move apart, the current flows through a small area. There is {{a sharp increase in}} resistance between the contacts and the temperature at the contact surface increases rapidly until the occurrence of electrode metal evaporation. At the same time, the electric field is very high across the small contact gap. The breakdown of the gap produces a vacuum arc. As the alternating current passes through a zero, and the gap between the fixed and moving contact widens, the conductive plasma produced by the arc moves away from the gap and becomes non-conductive. The current is interrupted, unless the impressed voltage is large enough to break down the wider gap of the open contacts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. DC Vacuum Circuit Breakers based {{arc control}} {{has been a}} major topic in the last few decades.

Vacuum gap behavior under pre-arcing and inrush current conditions (pre-arc energy, duration and interruption of inrush current) will be highlighted. Field electron emission measurement has been used to monitor field electron emission current that flows in vacuum gaps after current interruption. Statistics will be presented in relation to the late breakdown events, field electron emission current measurement, vacuum interrupters design and contact material. It was observed that only the mechanism of electron field emission alone could not explain the breakdown in vacuum at the origin of late breakdown phenomena.

40|$|The {{formation}} of the surface-near microstructure after a current interruption of CuCr contact materials in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> {{is characterized by a}} fast heating and subsequently rapid solidification process. In the present article, we reveal and analyse the {{formation of}} two distinct microstructural regions that result from the heat, which is generated and dissipated during interruption. In the topmost region, local and global texture, as well as the resulting microstructure, indicate that both Cu and Cr were melted during rapid heating and solidification whereas in the region underneath, only Cu was melted and elongated Cu-grains solidified with the -direction perpendicularly aligned to the surface. By analysing the lattice parameter of the Cu solid solution, a supersaturation of the solid solution with about 2. 25 at % Cr was found independent if Cu was melted solely or together with the Cr. The according reduction of electrical conductivity in the topmost region subsequent to current interruption and the resulting heat distribution are discussed based on these experimental results...|$|R
