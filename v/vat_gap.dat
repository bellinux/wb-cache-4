40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{describes the}} methods of calculation of the <b>VAT</b> <b>gap.</b> <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> {{is the difference between}} the theoretical VAT liability in the whole economy and the accrued VAT receipts. It is expressed in relative terms to the theoretical VAT liability and it approximates the amount of the VAT evasion. The <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> in the Czech Republic in the years 2002 to 2010 ranges in average from 16 to 17 %. It is steadily increasing from 11 % to 26 % during the last 5 years of the relevant period. Furthermore, the thesis also analyses the determinants of the <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> in the EU member states in the years 2000 to 2006. The share of VAT on total tax revenues and the Tax quota were identified as main tax factors that reduce the <b>VAT</b> <b>gap.</b> On the other hand, the complexity of the VAT system, expressed by the number of VAT rates, the difference between them and the number of preliminary questions to the European Court of Justice, increases the <b>VAT</b> <b>gap.</b> Further significant factor influencing the <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> in the negative direction is the Corruption perception Index...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to compare an amount of tax loopholes to the state budget deficit in the Czech Republic for the period from 2009 to 2014. Partial aims of my thesis are: to {{describe}} how the cash registers work, to compare the function of receipts lottery in selected countries, and to explain what it is the tax gap and why I used it for calculations in the analytic part. In order to achieve individual goals is used the descriptive method. The next part has a legislative technical character. To fulfil the main object the method of applied research is used, based on which determined by ratio {{between the amount of}} <b>VAT</b> <b>gaps</b> and he state budget deficit from 2009 to 2014. For the year 2014 I used an estimate of the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic on the state budget deficit. The tax gap for the period from 2012 [...] 2014 will be determined by an expert estimate. The result of the analysis part is {{that in the case of}} an ideal tax collection would be the state budget from the year 2010 and 2011 slightly in deficit, in 2012 balanced and in 2013 even surplus. In the case of prediction for the year 2014 it would be a slightly deficit budget...|$|R
40|$|In 2011, in the {{aftermath}} of the economic crisis, Poland increased its value added tax rates. Despite an already large <b>VAT</b> policy <b>gap,</b> further rate differentiation was used to address distributional concerns and to protect the most vulnerable households. We find that the changes to the VAT rate structure hardly improved the overall progressivity of the VAT and the tax system as a whole. While providing only minimal relief to the poor, taxation of food products at a super reduced rate greatly subsidized the richer households. With a small change to the income tax structure, the government could have secured more progressivity at a lower cost in terms of revenue foregone...|$|R
40|$|This paper quantifies the {{variability}} of tax elasticities in Lithuania using two alternative methods: rolling regressions and pooled mean group estimator. The analysis is motivated by the systematic variation of tax revenues observed over the economic cycle in the recent past. Both methods confirm that tax elasticities moved with the cycle, which {{can be attributed to}} the procyclical tax compliance tendencies and structural composition effects across tax bases. Comparison of <b>VAT</b> revenue <b>gaps</b> across Baltic countries during the recent recovery suggests that tax revenues rebounded fastest in Estonia, followed by Lithuania and Latvia. Overall, the results of the study emphasize the importance of accounting for cyclical variation in tax elasticities when making short-term tax revenue projections.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} an {{estimation}} of tax evasion of value added tax in the Czech Republic during 2006 – 2012. For the estimation I {{have used the}} concept of tax gap {{which is based on}} a comparison of the theoretical tax liability in the economy with the actual tax receipts. According to my results the <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> in the Czech Republic gradually increased during the observed period and it is more than CZK 100 billion in the last three years. The most significant growth of <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> occurred between the years 2007 and 2008 and between 2011 and 2012 when the reduced VAT rate was increased by 4 percentage points. The second part of the paper focuses on impact of my estimates on tax policy of the Czech Republic. I discuss two different possibilities how the additional revenue gained from <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> reduction could be used – either to decrease the government deficit and therefore to meet the Maastricht criteria or to decrease tax burden on labour which influences particularly low income workers...|$|E

40|$|As {{most of the}} {{developing}} countries do, Ethiopia was highly dependent on external financial resources to finance its development activities. For many decades, the tax contribution to GDP was very less and this needs an improvement. On the other hand, the Ethiopian Government has a strong belief and commitment to eradicate poverty and assure sustainable development; and {{it is impossible to}} achieve such a goal without generating sufficient revenue that can cover at least the budget of the government. To narrow the <b>gap,</b> <b>VAT</b> was introduced before seven years and is showing dramatic changes in generating government revenue. Hence, this research tries to fill the gap that existed in VAT administration and revenue generation in the branch office. The research had an objective of investigating how VAT was administered and performed in the last five year (in terms of efficiency and effectiveness) at the Mekelle Branch of the Revenue and Customs Authority. In order to attain the stated objective, after the taxpayers are stratified, 120 taxpayers were randomly selected using systematic random sampling and 20 tax officers were purposely selected and then all were required to fill the questionnaire that was prepared for that purpose. In addition, secondary data was used and analyzed, mainly to show the trend of the last five years. Ate federal level, a total amount of 13. 78 billion birr was collected from the Inland Revenue in the form of VAT at Federal level in five years time. In the Mekelle Branch of the Revenue and Customs Authority, a total amount of 879. 4 million birr is collected {{in the last five years}} (1997 E. C. – 2001 E. C.) and out of this, 782. 36 million (88. 96 %) is collected from VAT. In the process of VAT administration and revenue generation, different problems were observed, the main ones being attitudinal problem of the tax payers and implementation capacity of the government employees. As a result, the data show that there are many business men and companies that should be registered for VAT but are not. As a result, the branch office is losing millions of birr per year. The opportunities and challenges of the VAT administration of the branch office is well-studied and as a result recommendations are made on the issues. Changing the attitude of the taxpayers and building the implementation capacity of the employees of the branch office are some of the important recommendations made by the study. It is also suggested that further research on the area is needed and it is important and timely to make collaborations with the nearby universities such as the Mekelle University and Axum University...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{describes}} the methods of estimating the level of tax evasion and summarises the existing quantitative appraisals of this phenomena. In {{the first part of}} the text, the term "tax evasion " is defined. In the second part of the paper, direct and indirect methods of estimating the tax gap are explained with the references to studies and reports where these methods are used. These methods include in particular tax audits and the so called "top-down " methods using the discrepancy between the data from two sources. Furthermore, the article reviews the existing papers and studies quantifying the tax gap in various countries and years. The data on <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> in 24 European countries in the years 1993 to 2006 are summarised in a table. The estimates of <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> produced in two studies are compared and the differences between them analysed.

40|$|One of {{the most}} serious {{problems}} of fiscal character is the issue of the tax gap. The tax gap is defined as the amount of tax liability faced by taxpayers that is not paid on time. The tax gap comes from three main areas of non-compliance with the tax law – firstly, from underreporting of income, secondly, from underpayment of taxes, and thirdly, from non-filing of returns. The tax evasions in the area of value added tax create one of the largest groups of tax gaps. This article describes the current situation in the field of tax gap in selected countries of the European Union. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the dependence of the <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> on three variables: the Corruption Perception Index CPI, GDP growth rate and the basic VAT rate. The method of regression analysis was used, which was performed on data in the years 2000 – 2011. Although it could be assumed that tax burden will affect the <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> the most, the highest dependence was shown in the case of Corruption Perception Index. tax gap; value added tax; Corruption Perception Index; GDP growth; VTTL model; regression analysi...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} and discusses {{the findings of}} the "Study to quantify and analyse the <b>VAT</b> <b>Gap</b> in the EU- 27 Member States", conducted by CASE and CPB. The main aim {{of the study was to}} help better understand the recent trends in the field of VAT fraud and analyse determinants of VAT Gaps using a number of econometric techniques. The authors discuss the structure of the VAT systems in the EU, the broad trends in the EU economy over the period 2000 - 2011, and review the behaviour of VAT revenues, as well as the changes in VAT rates and exemptions that have occurred as a response to economic events or policy decisions. They pay particular attention to the events following the onset of the economic crisis in 2008. Moreover, they discuss the definition of VAT Gaps that has been used in this study, as well as other alternatives existing in the literature. They review possible shortcomings associated with different concepts. Subsequently, they present the results of the estimations for EU- 26 countries for the period 2000 - 2011. The estimates are first discussed for the EU- 26 as a whole, and then for each country individually. Finally, an econometric analysis of the determinants of VAT Gaps for the period under consideration is provided...|$|E

The diploma thesis deals with value added tax and the relevant factors that affect the amount of VAT collection in the Czech Republic. In the diploma thesis is then made a comparison of the success of collection of value added tax in the Czech Republic and the European Union. Based on established indicators of tax quota, collection of VAT in relation to total tax revenues and Vat Revenue Ratio, are then calculated actual values to determine the effectiveness of the development in the Czech Republic.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is the {{creation}} of a map of the division of the tax gap is to create an informative presentation and an overview of the phenomenon of tax policy. This analysis of the tax gap creates spaces for every interested party and to judge what brings consequences tax gap and what changes need to be made in the tax system a little bit to narrow this gap. One should note that any tax system throughout the world constantly facing the challenges of the tax gap as this is a negative phenomenon inherent in tax administration. A collaboration between policymakers and citizens would be the best solution and the most effective for reducing the tax gap. Creating a special mission in tax administration will serve as a model of good governance. Anyone who wants to contribute to maintaining the same level of tax gap or even worse attempt to increase his will help increase the tax burden on the taxpayers expenses honest. In this paper will be analyzed countries of the Balkan region. Discussion on the tax gap helps to focus attention on the events and lives of fiscal management that is a match with the culture face to face fiscal evasion and tax avoidance. This discussion should provide a light on the dilemma of tax administration, where efforts to promote voluntary compliance in the calculation and payment of taxes need to oppose strong measures to disarm those that do not apply the same principles of voluntary compliance. Tax gap can be assessed through two main models. The first model deals with microeconomic indicators approach or different model down – up. The second model which will apply and in this study has to do with the alignment of various macroeconomic indicators from top – down. Adapting the second model we can measure and evaluate the <b>VAT</b> <b>gap</b> and excise tax gap. But this approach has it...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of VAT, EU and Members States’ policy-makers and administrations have been confronted with fraud and avoidance (abuse), often on a (very) large scale. Despite all the efforts made {{in order to improve}} the fight against this phenomenon, VAT fraud numbers remain worrying. According to the latest <b>VAT</b> <b>Gap</b> study, published by the Commission in 2014, EUR 177 billion in VAT revenues were lost due to noncompliance or non-collection of VAT in 2012. VAT fraud not only negatively affects the financial interests of the Member States, but it also constitutes a serious issue for business, because VAT malpractices distort the normal conditions of fair competition in which compliant businesses operate. The transformation of business models through information and communication technologies paves the way for new forms of VAT fraud, particularly in an EU cross-border context. This is in part due to the inadequacy of the design of the present VAT system. As the Commission pointed out, the common system is not entirely ‘well-fitted for today’s society’ and ‘inconsistent {{with the idea of a}} Single Market’. Adopted more than forty years ago, it also suffers from the institutional rigidity of the unanimity rule and barely takes into account recent developments, in particular the digitalization of the economy. Digital commerce follows its own specific pattern, and one could wonder how traditional tax rules ‘would interact with the new technologies that enabled global electronic commerce’. Action 1 of the OECD BEPS Report is related to the tax challenges of the digital economy and recognizes that the present tax rules, also in the area of income taxation, are not adapted to the new business environment. Even if this situation does not necessarily imply that specific VAT regimes have to be set up for digital transactions it certainly forces all concerned to rethink the manner in which VAT rules are applied and in which the fight against VAT fraud is conducted...|$|E
