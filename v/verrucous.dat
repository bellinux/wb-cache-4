Most patients will avoid discussing pain for many reasons, so this will require logical thinking or communication skills to assess. In advanced lymphedema, there may be the presence of skin changes such as discoloration, <b>verrucous</b> (wart-like) hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and Ulcer (dermatology).|$|E

2500|$|HPV+OPC {{is usually}} {{diagnosed}} {{at a more}} advanced stage than HPV-OPC, with 75â€“90% having involvement of regional lymph nodes. Genetic signatures of HPV+ and HPV- OPC are different. HPV+OPC is associated with expression level of the E6/E7 mRNAs and of p16. [...] Nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma strongly predicts HPV-association. HPV16 E6/E7-positive cases are histopathologically characterized by their <b>verrucous</b> or papillary (nipple like) structure and koilocytosis of the adjacent mucosa. Approximately 15% of HNSCCs are caused by HPV16 infection and the subsequent constitutive expression of E6 and E7, and some HPV-initiated tumors may lose their original characteristics during tumor progression. High-risk HPV types {{may be associated with}} oral carcinoma, by cell-cycle control dysregulation, contributing to oral carcinogenesis and the overexpression of mdm2, p27 and cathepsin B.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are four}} genetic {{disorders}} acknowledged {{by the industry}} that may affect horses of Friesian breeding: dwarfism, hydrocephalus, a tendency for aortic rupture, and mega-esophagus. [...] There are genetic tests {{for the first two}} conditions. [...] The Friesian is also among several breeds that may develop PSSM. [...] Approximately 0.25% of Friesians are affected by dwarfism, which results in horses with a normal-sized head, a broader chest than normal, an abnormally long back and very short limbs. It is a recessive condition. [...] Additionally, the breed has a higher-than-usual rate of digestive system disorders, and a greater tendency to have insect bite hypersensitivity. Like some other draught breeds, they are prone to a skin condition called <b>Verrucous</b> pastern dermatopathy and may be generally prone to having a compromised immune system. [...] Friesian mares have a very high 54% rate of retained placenta after foaling. Some normal-sized Friesians also have a propensity toward tendon and ligament laxity {{which may or may not}} be associated with dwarfism. [...] The relatively small gene pool and inbreeding are thought to be factors behind most of these disorders.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Verrucous</b> {{vascular}} malformation (also {{known as}} [...] "Angiokeratoma circumscriptum naeviforme") is a malformation of dermal and subcutaneous capillaries and veins, a congenital vascular malformation, which, over time, a <b>verrucous</b> component appears.|$|E

Some <b>verrucous</b> leukoplakias may have an exophytic growth pattern, and some may slowly invade surrounding mucosa, when the term proliferative <b>verrucous</b> leukoplakia may be used.

Generally, multiple papules present simultaneously, and coalesce to form a serpiginous plaque.

50|$|Proliferative <b>verrucous</b> leukoplakia (PVL) is a {{recognized}} high risk subtype of non-homogenous leukoplakia.
