40|$|With the {{advancement}} of neuroradiology, clinical localization followed by radiology, had made neurology more interesting. <b>Vertical</b> <b>gage</b> palsy as presentation cerebrovascular disease is not so common. Vertical gaze palsy usually localizes the lesion to dorsal mid brain. A 56 years male patient presented with sudden onset vertigo, diplopia, transient loss of consciousness and sways toward right side while walking. Clinical examination showed vertical gaze palsy with skew deviation along with swaying towards rt. during walk. MRI brain showed â€“ infarct involving dorsal midbrain at superior colliculus level and medial thalamus KEY WORDS Mid brain, skew deviation, thalamus, vertical gaze pals...|$|E
40|$|A Rockwell built 0. 030 -scale 45 - 0 {{modified}} Space Shuttle Orbiter Configuration 14 ?A/B {{model and}} a Boeing built 0. 030 -scale 747 carrier model were tested to provide six component force and moment data for each vehicle in {{proximity to the}} other at a matrix of relative positions, attitudes and test conditions (angles of attack and sideslip were varied). Orbiter model support system tare effects were determined for corrections to obtain support-free aerodynamics. In addition to the balance force data, pressures were measured. Pressure orifices were located {{at the base of}} the Orbiter, on either side of the vertical blade strut, and at the mid-root chord on either side of the <b>vertical</b> tail. Strain <b>gages</b> were installed on the Boeing 747 vertical tail to indicate buffet onset. Photographs of aerodynamic configurations tested are shown...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a full scale accelerated test performed on the IFSTTAR pavement fatigue carrousel, to study the effect of various multiple axle combinations on bituminous pavements. The tested combinations correspond to the permissible maximum loads in France for the following axle systems: tridem axle (255 kN), tandem axle with dual wheels (210 kN), tandem axle with single wheels (170 kN) and single axle with dual wheels (130 kN). Recently, however, the French road carriers' federation was authorized to change the vehicle load from 400 kN to 440 kN. The consequences of this increase are also discussed. The test was performed on two thick bituminous pavement sections consisting of a 16 -cm granular subbase and a 26 -cm thick bituminous layer. Both pavements were instrumented with strain <b>gages,</b> <b>vertical</b> displacement and temperature sensors. The objective {{of this research is}} to compare the strain signals and the maximum strain levels obtained for different axle combinations and temperature conditions and then, to compare the re-sults with classical pavement design calculations to assess the relative aggressiveness of the different axle systems. The fatigue life of the two pavements, however, was not studied because, owing to their thickness, too many load cycles would were necessary to complete a full fatigue test...|$|R
