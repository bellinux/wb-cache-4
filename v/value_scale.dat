50|$|Clawson and Vinson (1978) further {{elaborated}} on {{this idea}} by explaining how values {{are one of}} the most powerful explanations of, and influences on, consumer behavior. <b>Values</b> <b>scales</b> are helpful in understanding several aspects of consumption areas and consumer behavior, including leisure, media, and gift giving. People who endorse certain values more highly than others engage in certain activities, prefer certain programs or magazines, or give gifts differently from others. <b>Values</b> <b>scales</b> and the study of values could also be of interest to companies who are looking to build or strengthen their customer relationship management.|$|R
50|$|<b>Values</b> <b>scales</b> {{were first}} {{developed}} {{by an international}} group of psychologists whose goal {{was to create a}} unique self-report instrument that measured intrinsic and extrinsic values for use in the lab and in the clinic. The psychologists called their project the Work Importance Study (WIS). The original <b>values</b> <b>scale</b> measured the following values, listed in alphabetical order: ability utilization, achievement, advancement, aesthetics, altruism, authority, autonomy, creativity, cultural identity, economic rewards, economic security, life style, personal development, physical activity, physical prowess, prestige, risk, social interaction, social relations, variety, and working conditions. Some of the listed values were intended to be inter-related, but conceptually differentiable.|$|R

50|$|<b>Values</b> <b>scales</b> are {{psychological}} inventories used {{to determine}} the values that people endorse in their lives. They facilitate the understanding of both work and general values that individuals uphold. In addition, they assess the importance of each value in people’s lives and how the individual strives toward fulfillment through work and other life roles, such as parenting. Most scales have been normalized and can therefore be used cross-culturally for vocational, marketing, and counseling purposes, yielding unbiased results. <b>Values</b> <b>scales</b> are used by psychologists, political scientists, economists, and others interested in defining values, determining what people value, and evaluating the ultimate function or purpose of values.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to identify evidence that work values can predict organizational values preference, based on conceptual similarity proposed by the Theory of Values. A total of 254 Brazilian undergraduate students responded to the Organizational <b>Values</b> <b>Scale</b> and the revised Work <b>Values</b> <b>Scale.</b> Hierarchical regressions were run controlling for demographics. The results indicated significant explanation of variance for all organizational values. The most significant predictors were compatible with the hypotheses based on Schwartz's Theory of Values, revealing that work and organizational values are logically connected through an axiological structure. In conclusion, work values and preferred organizational values have adequate nominal commensurability for conducting Individual-Organization fit studies and implications for organizational socialization and vocational and career counseling...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} examined {{the extent to}} which relations between social values and personality are due to shared genetic or environmental factors. Using the Rokeach (1973) Value Survey and a scoring key from Schwartz and Bilsky (1990), seven value scores (enjoyment, achievement, self-direction, maturity, prosocial, security, and restrictive conformity) were derived in a sample of twins. As expected, all of the <b>value</b> <b>scales</b> were found to have a significant genetic component, with values ranging from 36 % for enjoyment to 63 % for prosocial, and there were numerous significant phenotypic correlations found between the <b>value</b> <b>scales</b> and personality scores. Most important, bivariate genetic analyses revealed that some of these phenotypic correlations could be attributed to common genetic or environmental factors...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a scale to measure materialism among {{children}} while relying on insights from research conducted among adults. Although research among adults suggests that materialism is a second-order construct with three underlying factors (i. e., material centrality, material happiness, and material success), existing materialism scales for children include only one or two of these factors. Hence, we adapted the items of the well-established Material <b>Values</b> <b>Scale</b> (MVS) of Richins and Dawson (1992) to make them appropriate for use among children. We then administered the Material <b>Values</b> <b>Scale</b> for children (MVS-c) to 1001 8 - to 11 -year-olds. Structural equation modeling confirmed the presumed second-order structure of the MVS-c. Based on these findings, we created 6 - and 3 -item versions in addition to the full-length, 18 -item MVS-c.
