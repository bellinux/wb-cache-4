40|$|Abstract — In multi-hop {{wireless}} networks, {{the number}} of supportable VoIP calls can be surprisingly small due to the increased spatial interference. To mitigate the interference, <b>voice</b> <b>frame</b> aggregation can be used. In this paper, we depart from the traditional approaches that perform aggregation at the voice source, and propose a technique called the Self-Controlled Frame Aggregation (SCFA) that runs at wireless routers. The core idea of SCFA is to let the congestion itself control the degree of aggregation. Unlike existing frame aggregation approaches, SCFA does not incur fixed delay cost, since it is used only when and by exactly {{as much as it}} is needed. In this paper, we take the example of 802. 11 -based multi-hop network to show the impact of SCFA, since many emerging multi-hop networks are built on the 802. 11 technology. The result shows that SCFA on 802. 11 -based multi-hop network can boost {{the number of}} calls approximately twofold, or extends the hop distance threefold for a given number of calls to carry. • SCFA automatically determines the optimal degree of <b>voice</b> <b>frame</b> aggregation. • SCFA does not incur additional delay in the process of <b>voice</b> <b>frame</b> aggregation. • SCFA transforms VoIP over the multi-hop wireless network into a delay-bounded system from a capacitybounded system. This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we explain the explain the problem using a simple example. We discuss our solution to the problem, the SCFA, in Section III. The performance of SCFA is compared with that in the unmodified system and existing <b>voice</b> <b>frame</b> aggregation approaches. The existing approaches are briefly discussed in Section V, and the paper is concluded in Section VI. I...|$|E

30|$|Though LACK {{provides}} a novel covert channel with high capacity and security over the VoIP network, it {{is limited by}} several factors. An important constraint of the LACK is that though it fits the voice applications where the frame sizes are small, the extension of its application to general types of multimedia services is limited. With the entire <b>voice</b> <b>frame</b> replaced by the secret message, it may not degrade the voice quality too much {{as long as the}} entire frame size is small. The quality requirement of the voice network also constrains the number of packets that can be used as covert channel. Meanwhile, the covert channel capacity is bound by the call duration distribution performance as well. Those constraints prevent the further increase of the covert channel. In this paper, discrete spring transform (DST) which is originally proposed as a multimedia steganography attack method is adopted to the LACK method so that both the covert channel capacity and the quality of service (QoS) of the voice network can be significantly improved. The proposed DST-LACK method {{provides a}} larger capacity covert channel while maintaining its undetectability.|$|E

Nonetheless, very few testbed or field trial measurement accounts have been reported in the peer-reviewed literature.

The actual codec payload per packet is very small compared to the total length of headers appended to each <b>voice</b> <b>frame.</b> RObust Header Compression (ROHC) can significantly decrease header size by capitalizing on static or rarely changing header fields. Aggregating multiple voice frames into one packet is another attractive and effective way to increase application goodput and overall bandwidth utilization. We study the effect of ROHC and application layer aggregation on VoIP performance in a fixed WiMAX testbed consisting of one base station and two subscriber stations. We find that ROHC increases the number of simultaneous bidirec-tional emulated VoIP flows by 6 % when compared to plain VoIP. When aggregation and ROHC are employed in uni-son, they allow for 86 % more flows than standard VoIP to be sustained in our testbed. ...|$|E

The algorithm is executed by software over an embedded system that includes a MicroBlaze microprocessor connected to a vector floating-point unit (VFPU). The VFPU is designed to speed up the resolution of any vector floating-point operation involved in the verification algorithm, whereas the microprocessor manages the control of the process and executes the rest of operations. With a clock frequency of 40 MHz, the system is capable of executing the complete algorithm in real time, processing a <b>voice</b> <b>frame</b> in 9. 1 ms. The same verification process was carried out for two different systems: 1) an ARM Cortex A 8 microprocessor; and 2) configuring MicroBlaze with the scalar floating-point unit provided by Xilinx. The experimental results show that when comparing our proposed system against both systems, the number of clock cycles is reduced by a factor of 11. 2 × and 15. 4 ×, respectively. The main advantage of the VFPU is its flexibility, which allows quick adaptation of the software to the potential changes produced in both the system and the user requirements.
