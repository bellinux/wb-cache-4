Young on Falcon Crest appealed to him. [...] After playing the role for a year, he appeared in a comedy-science fiction show called They Came From Outer Space from 1990-1991, and another TV series, Foreign Affairs, in 1992-93.|$|E
5000|$|The girl {{meets the}} Chinese man when {{crossing}} the river on the ferry {{to return to}} the city after a school holiday. He is the son of a businessman whose fortune was made in real estate, and has recently returned from Paris after dropping out of school. He has the look but lacks the self-assurance of the playboy he fancies himself to be, and he is mesmerized the first time he sees her standing by the rail on a crowded ferry crossing the Mekong River. After some awkward conversation, he offers her a ride to Saigon in his chauffeur-driven limousine and she accepts, although the two barely speak during the drive. In <b>voice-over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the film she originally gives her age as 15, but tells the man she is 17. He, as well, appears to exaggerate when he states he is 32, considering the usual age of the recent graduate at the time. The following day, he waits for her outside her boarding school, and the two go to the room he rents for entertaining mistresses in the seedy Chinese quarter, where they have sex.|$|E
50|$|The series prize {{tended to}} be a {{classical}} artefact (for example a Greek vase), and {{was presented to the}} winning contestant by the regular voice-over artist, Laura Calland (who married Stewart in 1997).

It was also named the Best Sitcom of the TV Season by BuddyTV reviewer John Kubicek. He also stated [...] "A killer cast and the funniest and smartest writing TV has seen in a long time helped make this freshman comedy not only the funniest show on TV, but also the best." [...] A poll by the Los Angeles Times said Modern Family is to win Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series and beat three year in a row winner 30 Rock.

40|$|Music {{and voices}} in Pickpocket (1951), by Robert Bresson – The French {{director}} Robert Bresson {{was known for}} his creative use of sound elements and the scanty insertion of music in his films. In films produced during the intermediary phase of his career, such as A man escaped (1956), Pickpocket (1959) and Au hasard Balthazar (1966), preexisting classical music pieces, which contain formal aspects that are analogous to their distribution in the respective films, were used as non-diegetic music. Moreover, in Pickpocket, the preexisting music by Lully also relates to the voice-in and <b>voice-over.</b> <b>The</b> voice-in <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the dialogues usually triggers musical excerpts, which are inserted in situations of movement and whose function resembles that of divertissements in baroque opera. We also consider the relations between voice-in and voice-over and the lag between the latter and the action and the image of the main character’s diary as it is being written...|$|R
