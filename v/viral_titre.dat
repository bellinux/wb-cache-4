50|$|Viral load, {{also known}} as viral burden, <b>viral</b> <b>titre</b> or viral titer, is a {{numerical}} expression of the quantity of virus in a given volume. It is often expressed as viral particles, or infectious particles per mL {{depending on the type}} of assay. A higher viral burden, titre, or viral load often correlates with the severity of an active viral infection. The quantity of virus / mL can be calculated by estimating the live amount of virus in an involved body fluid. For example, it can be given in RNA copies per millilitre of blood plasma. Tracking viral load is used to monitor therapy during chronic viral infections, and in immunocompromised patients such as those recovering from bone marrow or solid organ transplantation. Currently, routine testing is available for HIV-1, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus.|$|E

Hepatopancreatic parvovirus (HPV) {{is one of the}} viral pathogens that infect banana shrimp (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis). HPV is thought to slow down growth and cause mortality in the juvenile stages of banana shrimp. Genetic improvement through selection of shrimp resistant to viral diseases is one approach to address this issue. This is the first detailed report on an aquaculture species that investigates whether <b>viral</b> <b>titre</b> varies among families and is heritable, and thus whether <b>viral</b> <b>titre</b> per se is a possible candidate trait for selection to produce resistant stock. ResultsHPV titre was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of DNA extracted from 1137 offspring (from 48 full-sib families). Estimated heritability of HPV titre, based on the linear animal mixed model, was moderate (h 2  =  0. 41). Genetic correlations of HPV with body traits (weight, length and width of body, head and tail) ranged from − 0. 13 to − 0. 38. HPV titre was negatively correlated with raw and cooked body colour (− 0. 33 and − 0. 43, respectively). ConclusionsThis is the first study based on a large dataset that provides evidence that <b>viral</b> <b>titre</b> may have a genetic component in penaeid shrimp or even in any aquaculture species. The moderate heritability estimated for this trait suggests that resistance to HPV may be achieved by selecting for low HPV titre. With moderate and negative correlations, selection for resistance to HPV should gradually improve body traits and colour of banana shrimp...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{long term}} {{effectiveness}} of combination therapy at reducing viral loads in seminal fluid and blood plasma obtained from HIV- 1 infected {{men who had}} undergone previous antiretroviral therapy was assessed. METHODS: Samples of semen and blood were obtained from a cohort of 12 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor experienced men before and during 25 - 68 weeks of combination therapy, which included the protease inhibitor indinavir. HIV- 1 RNA titres present in the cell free blood and seminal plasma samples were determined using the nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) /Nuclisens assay system. RESULTS: Viral RNA was detected in 9 / 12 and 7 / 12 baseline blood plasma and seminal plasma samples, with median <b>viral</b> <b>titres</b> of 10 (4. 81) and 10 (4. 56) per ml, respectively.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Influenza {{infections are}} of major {{importance}} {{as they have}} a significant impact on the health of individuals and impart substantial socio-economic ramifications on society. Prevention and treatment of influenza infections are complicated by frequent genetic mutations of the influenza virus. Patients with underlying chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are more susceptible to influenza infection, and infection with influenza exacerbates these diseases. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms underpinning increased susceptibility to influenza in these patients is vital. Here, we established an experimental mouse model of COPD and utilised an existing ovalbumin-induced allergic airways disease (AAD) model to investigate the effects of influenza infection in COPD and asthma, respectively. Influenza infection in experimental COPD resulted in increased <b>viral</b> <b>titre,</b> exaggerated airway inflammation and further impaired lung function. These effects were accompanied by decreased neutrophil influx into the airways, reduced antiviral interferon responses, and the suppression of a range of cytokines and chemokines, including interferon (IFN) -γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α, IFN-γ-induced protein (IP) - 10, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 1 α, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC, or IL- 8 in humans) and interleukin (IL) - 10, as well as increased IL- 6. This increased susceptibility was mediated by an increase in phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) protein expression. The inhibition of PI 3 K effectively reduced <b>viral</b> <b>titre,</b> enhanced antiviral IFNs and improved lung function. Influenza infection in recombinant IL- 13 -treated or ovalbumin (Ova) -induced AAD models led to increased <b>viral</b> <b>titre,</b> impaired antiviral responses and increased airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). It also resulted in exaggerated airway inflammation, more severe histopathology, increased mucus secreting cell numbers and increased IL- 13. Importantly, we also showed that inhibition of IL- 13 by administration of anti-IL- 13 (αIL- 13) monoclonal antibody during influenza infection reduced <b>viral</b> <b>titre,</b> AHR, eosinophil infiltration and MSCs, which were associated with improved antiviral IFN responses. In summary, these data highlight the important roles of PI 3 K and IL- 13 in the increased susceptibility to influenza infection in experimental models of COPD and asthma, respectively. Such findings offer evidence for new and promising avenues for influenza disease management in these chronic lung diseases. In fact, both PI 3 K inhibitors and anti-IL- 13 antibodies have already entered clinical trials and may be utilised as novel therapeutic approaches for influenza infections in the future...|$|E
40|$|Human noroviruses (HuNoV) are {{the leading}} cause of acute nonbacterial {{gastroenteritis}} in humans and can be transmitted either by person-to-person contact or by consumption of contaminated food. Knowledge of an efficient disinfection for both hands and food contact surfaces is helpful for the food sector and provides precious information for public health. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of seven disinfectants belonging to different groups of biocides (alcohol, halogen, oxidizing agents, quaternary ammonium compounds, aldehyde and biguanide) on infectious <b>viral</b> <b>titre</b> and on genomic copy number. Due to the absence of a cell culture system for HuNoV, two HuNoV surrogates such as murine norovirus (MNV) and feline calicivirus (FCV), were used and the tests were performed in suspension, on gloves and on stainless steel discs. When, as criteria of efficacy, a log reduction > 3 of the infectious <b>viral</b> <b>titre</b> on both surrogates and in the three tests is used, the most efficacious disinfectants in this study appear to be biocidal products B, C and D, representing the halogens, the oxidizing agents group and a mix of QAC, alcohol and aldehyde, respectively. In addition, these three disinfectants also elicited a significant effect on genomic copy number for both surrogate viruses and in all three tests.

40|$|Invariant NKT (iNKT) {{cells have}} an indubitable role in {{antiviral}} immunity, although the {{mechanisms by which}} these cells exert their functions are not fully elucidated. With the emerging importance of high-pathogenicity influenza A virus infections in humans, we questioned whether iNKT cells contribute to immune defence against influenza A virus and whether activation of these cells influences outcome. We show that activation of iNKT cells with alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GC) during influenza virus infection transiently enhanced early innate immune response without affecting T cell immunity, and reduced early <b>viral</b> <b>titres</b> in lungs of C 57 BL/ 6 mice. This {{is accompanied by a}} better disease course with improved weight loss profile. Temporal changes in iNKT cells in the liver, blood and lungs suggest activation and migration of iNKT cells from the liver to the lungs in mice that were administered alpha-GC. Improvement in <b>viral</b> <b>titres</b> appears dependent on activation of iNKT cells via the intraperitoneal route since intranasal administration of alpha-GC did not have the same effect.

Following {{the conclusion of}} the 30 day pathogenicity trial, histological examination and real-time PCR was performed on gill and hepatopancreatic tissues of all crayfish. Crayfish challenged with PmergDNV showed signs of disease less than one week with mortalities recorded one day after commencement. Histopathological lesions characteristic of PmergDNV were absent from all crayfish, however, histological examination revealed opportunistic infections involving bacteria, fungi, Coxiella cheraxi (rickettsia) and reovirus in crayfish that had been challenged with PmergDNV. Reovirus lesions were also present in a low percentage of control crayfish. The highest percentage mortality (46. 6 %) was recorded in the orally challenged treatment + overcrowding and the lowest (3. 3 %) in the control treatment. Overcrowding had a significant influence on percentage mortality recorded between treatments (F = 9. 412, df = 1, 29, p < 0. 01) as did route of infection (F = 6. 797, df = 2, 29, p < 0. 01).

Prophylactic IFN-A 6 and IFN-B DNA treatment for 14 days prior to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection was more efficacious in significantly reducing <b>viral</b> <b>titres,</b> than 2 days prior to or 2 days post-virus infection. Similarly, IFN-A 6 DNA treatment commencing 14 days prior to virus infection was superior in suppressing both acute and chronic myocarditis. Furthermore, reduction of autoantibody titres was more pronounced when IFN was administered 14 days prior to viral infection. Combinational IFN gene therapy was assessed for synergy between IFN subtypes. Combination treatment with either IFN-A 6 /A 9 or IFN-A 6 /B greatly reduced spleen <b>viral</b> <b>titres</b> while IFN-A 6 /B and IFN-A 9 /B reduced virus replication in the liver. Only IFN-A 6 /A 9 and IFN-A 9 /B reduced acute viral myocarditis, whereas IFNA 6 /B treatment was most efficacious for autoimmune chronic myocarditis. Finally, treatment with IFN-A 6 DNA 2 weeks post-MCMV infection proved effective at inhibiting the development of chronic autoimmune myocarditis.

Inducing superparasitism allows the virus to colonize uninfected parasitoid lineages but is usually maladaptive for the parasitoid. We tested for the presence of resistance genes to this behavioural manipulation in the parasitoid genotype by sampling 30 lines from five populations with contrasting viral prevalence, after infecting them with a reference viral isolate.

The highest <b>viral</b> <b>titres</b> in sera ranged from 10 (4. 8) to 10 (6. 1) TCID 50 /ml for PRRSV (Lena) whereas they ranged from 10 (3. 1) to 10 (4. 8) TCID 50 /ml for PRRSV (Belgium A). The replication of PRRSV (Lena) was further studied in depth. <b>Viral</b> <b>titres</b> ranged from 10 (2. 5) TCID 50 / 100 mg to 10 (5. 6) TCID 50 / 100 mg in nasal secretions between 3 and 14 dpi and from 10 (2. 8) TCID 50 / 100 mg to 10 (4. 6) TCID 50 / 100 mg in tonsillar scrapings between 3 and 21 dpi. High <b>viral</b> <b>titres</b> were detected in lungs (10 (2. 3) - 10 (7. 7) TCID 50 /g tissue), tonsils (10 (2. 0) - 10 (6. 2) TCID 50 /g tissue) and inguinal lymph nodes (10 (2. 2) - 10 (6. 6) TCID 50 /g tissue) until 35, 28 and 35 dpi, respectively. To examine the antigenic heterogeneity between the East European subtype 3 isolate Lena, the European subtype 1 strain Lelystad and the North American strain US 5, sets of monospecific polyclonal antisera were tested in immunoperoxidase monolayer assays (IPMAs) with homologous and heterologous viral antigens. Heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres (p = 0. 01 - 0. 03) for antisera against PRRSV (Lena) at all sampling time points. For antisera against PRRSV (Lelystad) and PRRSV (US 5), heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres at 14 and 21 dpi (p = 0. 01 - 0. 03) and at 10 and 14 dpi (p = 0. 04), respectively. Conclusions: Lena is a highly pathogenic East European subtype 3 PRRSV, which differs from European subtype 1 Lelystad and North American US 5 strains at both the genetic and antigenic level...|$|R

The effect of gabexate mesilate in influenza pneumonia in mice was investigated {{by examining the}} changes in pulmonary inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Pathological changes in the lungs of treated mice were extremely mild, compared with changes in infected, untreated mice. Intrapulmonary levels of interleukin- 6 and macrophage inflam-matory protein- 2 decreased in treated mice compared with untreated mice, despite similar <b>viral</b> <b>titres</b> in the lungs. Survival terms for treated and untreated groups were similar. These data indicate that gabexate mesilate has beneficial effects on influenza pneumonia, which {{may be due to}} the modulation of inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses...|$|R

Although chlorine-based products are widely used, they can also be damaging to equipment or apparatus that needs continuous use such as aircraft use for transportation of infected people. Two aircraft cleaning solutions were assessed alongside two common laboratory disinfectants in a contact kill assay with EBOV on two aircraft relevant materials representative of a porous and non-porous surface. A decimal log reduction of <b>viral</b> <b>titre</b> of 4 is required for a disinfectant to be deemed effective and two of the disinfectants fulfilled this criteria under the conditions tested.

40|$|Influenza A virus {{infection}} {{is an ongoing}} clinical problem and thus, there is an urgent {{need to understand the}} mechanisms that regulate the lung inflammation in order to unravel novel generic pharmacological strategies. Evidence indicates that the Nox 2 -containing NADPH oxidase enzyme promotes influenza A virus-induced lung oxidative stress, inflammation and dysfunction via ROS generation. In addition, lung epithelial and endothelial cells express the Nox 1 isoform of NADPH oxidase, placing this enzyme at key sites to regulate influenza A virus-induced lung inflammation. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether Nox 1 oxidase regulates the inflammatory response and the oxidative stress to influenza infection in vivo in mice. Male WT and Nox 1 -deficient (Nox 1 (-/y)) mice were infected with the moderately pathogenic HkX- 31 (H 3 N 2, 1 × 10 (4) PFU) influenza A virus for analysis of bodyweight, airways inflammation, oxidative stress, <b>viral</b> <b>titre,</b> lung histopathology, and cytokine/chemokine expression at 3 and 7 days post infection. HkX- 31 virus infection of Nox 1 (-/y) mice resulted in significantly greater: loss of bodyweight (Day 3); BALF neutrophilia, peri-bronchial, peri-vascular and alveolar inflammation; Nox 2 -dependent inflammatory cell ROS production and peri-bronchial, epithelial and endothelial oxidative stress. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including CCL 2, CCL 3, CXCL 2, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, GM-CSF and TNF-α was higher in Nox 1 (-/y) lungs compared to WT mice at Day 3, however, the expression of CCL 2, CCL 3, CXCL 2, IFN-γ and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 were lower in lungs of Nox 1 (-/y) mice vs. WT mice at Day 7. Lung <b>viral</b> <b>titre,</b> and airways infiltration of active CD 8 (+) and CD 4 (+) T lymphocytes, and of Tregs were similar between WT and Nox 1 (-/y) mice. In conclusion, Nox 1 oxidase suppresses influenza A virus induced lung inflammation and oxidative stress in mice particularly at the early phases of the infection. Nox 1 and Nox 2 oxidases appear to have opposing roles in the regulation of inflammation caused by influenza A viruses. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} fifty years, annual {{honeybee}} (Apis mellifera) colony losses have been steadily increasing worldwide. These losses {{have occurred in}} parallel with the global spread of the honeybee parasite Varroa destructor. Indeed, Varroa mite infestations {{are considered to be}} a key explanatory factor for the widespread increase in annual honeybee colony mortality. The host-parasite relationship between honeybees and Varroa is complicated by the mite’s close association with a range of honeybee viral pathogens. The 10 -year history of the expanding front of Varroa infestation in New Zealand offered a rare opportunity to assess the dynamic quantitative and qualitative changes in honeybee viral landscapes in response to the arrival, spread and level of Varroa infestation. We studied the impact of de novo infestation of bee colonies by Varroa on the prevalence and titres of seven well-characterised honeybee viruses in both bees and mites, using a large-scale molecular ecology approach. We also examined the effect of the number of years since Varroa arrival on honeybee and mite <b>viral</b> <b>titres.</b> The dynamic shifts in the <b>viral</b> <b>titres</b> of black queen cell virus and Kashmir bee virus mirrored the patterns of change in Varroa infestation rates along the Varroa expansion front. The deformed wing virus (DWV) titres in bees continued to increase with Varroa infestation history, despite dropping infestation rates, which could be linked to increasing DWV titres in the mites. This suggests that the DWV titres in mites, perhaps boosted by virus replication, may be a major factor in maintaining the DWV epidemic after initial establishment. Both positive and negative associations were identified fo...|$|R
40|$|RSV is {{the most}} common cause of infant bronchiolitis, leading to {{morbidity}} and mortality in both infants and the elderly. The relationship between RSV and asthma development further highlights the need to fully understand the immune responses involved in order to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics to aid prevention and treatment of RSV infection respectively. Helminths have long been studied both as a major pathogen of humans, infecting approximately 3 billion people worldwide, and also their ability to modulate the host immune response to allow survival and chronic infection to ensue. Specifically, helminth infections are thought to modulate the host immune response through regulatory mechanisms which are not fully understood. This not only confers protection and survival of the parasites themselves, but also modulates the immune response to unrelated antigens and pathogens. In this thesis, the potential role of a strictly enteric helminth infection, with Heligmosomoides polygyrus, in the modulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was investigated and the associated immune mechanisms were investigated. Firstly, the effects of prior H. polygyrus infection on RSV infection and immune responses in the lung were analysed. H. polygyrus significantly reduced the number of natural killer cells, CD 8 + T cells, B cells and conventional dendritic cells in the lung following RSV infection. Co-infection also reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 6 and TNF-α in the lungs. All of these reductions were associated with significantly lower <b>viral</b> <b>titres</b> on day 4 of RSV infection. Interestingly, this attenuation of immune responses and <b>viral</b> <b>titres,</b> correlated with reduced severity of clinical disease, as assessed by weight loss and lung function. H. polygyrus excretory secretory product (HES) was not found to be the immune-modulatory factor in this system, as HES failed to suppress <b>viral</b> <b>titres</b> and reduce immune cell responses to RSV infection. However, irradiated larvae with stunted maturation to adult worms, revealed that larval stages were sufficient to suppress <b>viral</b> <b>titres.</b> Next, the role of type 2 signalling for H. polygyrus effects on RSV infection were examined, using IL- 4 Rα-/- mice. H. polygyrus infection maintained the ability to attenuate RSV infection and subsequent immune responses in IL- 4 Rα-/- mice. Furthermore, the presence of the adaptive immune response was not required for H. polygyrus-induced attenuation of RSV infection, as demonstrated in recombinase-activating gene (RAG-/-) deficient mice. H. polygyrus induces innate type 2 immune responses indicating the release of the innate alarmin, IL- 33, in the lung and consequently an accumulation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC 2). Their contribution to H. polygyrus effects remain to be fully elucidated. Finally, the role of antiviral responses was explored in H. polygyrus and RSV co-infection. H. polygyrus infection alone induced expression of antiviral genes, IFN-β, OAS 1 A, Viperin and the antimicrobial peptide CRAMP, in both the duodenum and the lung. Expression of these genes was still higher in the lung 1 hour after RSV in H. polygyrus co-infected mice compared to controls without co-infection. The importance of type I IFN signalling pathway was demonstrated using mice deficient in the type I IFN receptor in H. polygyrus co-infection, which failed to suppress RSV titres and subsequent lung immune cell infiltration. These data highlight the ability of the strictly enteric helminth H. polygyrus to attenuate RSV infection and subsequent immune responses in the lung through the potentiation of type I IFN signalling and consequent upregulation of antiviral immune responses in the lung...|$|R
