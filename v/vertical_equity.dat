50|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>equity</b> {{states that}} the {{government}} should implement higher taxes on those who have higher abilities to pay than those who have a lower ability to pay. However, problems immediately arise with <b>vertical</b> <b>equity</b> because not only do policy makers have to define what having a higher ability means, but they also have to determine what an appropriate increase in taxation is for those with a greater ability to pay. Practically, <b>vertical</b> <b>equity</b> provides no solution to these problems. Furthermore, because of the complexity of current tax policies, those who have greater incomes and greater ability to pay are able to avoid paying taxes in ways that those in the lower brackets cannot. However, the concept of <b>vertical</b> <b>equity</b> is necessary in considering how best to create and implement a fair tax code. Because it is widely agreed upon that those of higher incomes should pay more in taxes, this helps alleviate the tax burden on those whose ability to pay is lower. It is then up to policy makers to determine what this looks like and how much more higher-income earners should be required to pay.|$|E

Surprisingly, there is very little difference among the three proposed individual income tax regimes in terms of <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>equity.</b> However, when the initial effective tax rate positions and economic incomes of each pair of taxpayers are compared to the new effective tax rate positions under the two proposals, we find that the Obama proposal makes the tax system more progressive than 2009 law. This change is much more pronounced than under the McCain proposal.

50|$|When {{discussing}} what a {{fair and}} optimal tax level would be, the principle of equity, both horizontal and vertical, is important. Equity is determined by first assessing an individual’s ability-to-pay. The idea of the ability-to-pay principle considers {{whether or not it}} is fair to tax someone higher just because that person has the ability and resources to pay. If it is decided that they should be required to pay more, the question of how much more arises. These questions can be analyzed through horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>equity</b> which are subsets of the ability-to-pay principle. Horizontal equity suggests it is fair if people who have equal ability-to-pay actually do pay the same amount in taxes. <b>Vertical</b> <b>equity</b> is the idea that people who have a higher ability-to-pay should actually pay more than those who have a lower ability-to-pay, as long as the increase in tax level is considered to be reasonable.|$|E

50|$|Mankiw {{provides}} {{a summary of}} eight lessons that represent the current thought in optimal taxation literature. They include, first the idea considering horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>equity,</b> that social planners should base optimal tax schedules on income rates for labor, which marks the equality and efficiency trade-off. Second, the more income an individual makes, their marginal tax schedule could actually decrease because they are discouraged from working at their optimal production level. The solution is to, after individuals reach a certain income level, ensure that the marginal tax remains steady. Third, reaching an optimal tax level could mean flat taxes. Fourth, the increase in wage inequality is directly proportionate {{to the extent of}} income redistribution as revenue is distributed to low-income earners. Fifth, taxes should not only depend on income amounts, but also on personal characteristics such as a person’s wage earning capabilities. Sixth, goods produced should only be taxed as a final good and should be taxed uniformly, which leads to their seventh point that capital should also not be taxed because it is considered an input of production. Finally, policy makers should consider individuals’ income histories, which require reliance on different types of taxation to derive optimal taxation. Mankiw identifies that the tax policy has largely followed the theories laid out in tax literature because social planners believe that the flatter the tax, the better, there are declining top marginal rates in OECD countries, and taxes on commodities are now uniform and usually only final goods are taxed.|$|E

40|$|After a {{long process}} of {{judicial}} action, states have revised the education funding distribution systems to meet the legal requirement of providing both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> funding <b>equity</b> between districts (interdistrict) in the state. A {{major part of the}} judicially required reforms was a shift to weighted student funding or funding which provides differential amounts of education funding dependent on the estimated needs of students based on their individual characteristics. However, little research has been done to examine the equity of the funding distribution systems between schools within districts (intradistrict). Intradistrict funding inequities are likely to persist in districts today for numerous reasons. Primary among these is the ubiquitous use of step and lane salary schedules in US public schools and the historical use of full-time equivalency systems to assign faculty positions to schools. Under full-time equivalency systems, school districts assigned teaching positions to schools {{based on the number of}} students enrolled and then estimated the amount of funding per school based on the average cost for employing a teacher. The full-time equivalency system ignored both differences in the salaries of the teachers assigned to the schools and the characteristics of the students enrolled in the schools. Often under this method, schools with the least needy students ended up with the highest paid teachers as experienced and more expensive teachers tend to opt out of these schools. This was especially true in New York City (Lankford, Loeb, and Wychoff, 2002). Thus categorical funds provided by the state to fund additional services for students with exceptional needs ended up being spent on student without special needs while schools with high number of exceptional needs students actually had lower than average per pupil expenditures. While concerns over these types of unintended funding transfers have a great influence on intradistrict funding equity and have existed for many years, only recently has school-level spending data become available. With this improved spending data, this analysis will evaluate the level of funding inequities which exists within rural districts in Arkansas and also within a large urban district specifically New York City. Further, these differences have a great influence on intradistrict funding equity...|$|R

Over the past few years, a variety of {{proposals}} have been advanced for {{the replacement of the}} current income tax system and most proposals involve a compression of the multi-rate structure into a single rate and a shift to some form of consumption tax base. Flat taxes are advocated on the belief that they will provide a strong stimulus to investment, employment and output. Their supporters are convinced that the economic benefits are sufficiently large to make everyone better off, therefore {{there is no need to}} be concerned about the distributional effects of flat taxes. However, the claims about potentially large efficiency gains from flat taxes are not supported by research. Evaluating the effects of a consumption-base flat tax of the type proposed by Hall and Rabushka is one of the main purposes of the paper. Using a microdata set for Canada, which allows identifying taxpayers by both income level and family type, we show that flat taxes not only increase income inequality but also have important horizontal equity implications. We argue that a full debate on income tax reform requires a detailed evaluation of both polar alternatives to the current hybrid income tax: a move to a consumption base and a move to a comprehensive income tax. Toward that end, we have performed a simulation which estimates the distributional effects of a comprehensive income base with across the board rate reductions in order to maintain revenue-neutrality.

But he also observes that over this period our federation has become the most decentralized federation in the world. Looking forward, he sees major challenges facing the fiscal arrangements. The equalization system and the political will to maintain it are in peril at the same time as disparities are likely to increase. The federal government has effectively lost control of the spending power, which has historically been one of the most powerful instruments at the hands of the federal government for managing the federation. This has left the federal government with no effective mechanism for managing the economic union. The income tax system is becoming disharmonized as provinces are engaged in competitive reductions in income tax progressivity. Attempts to arrive at cooperative solutions by federal-provincial negotiation have not been successful. Boadway believes that the decentralized Canadian federation could evolve into one in which the provinces behave “cooperatively” with respect to the national objectives of equity and efficiency. However, he sees little evidence that this is happening, and argues that an overall vision is needed. Unfortunately, Canada does not have an institution like the former Economic Council that is currently capable of developing such a vision.

40|$|Taxation equity may be {{classified}} into horizontal equity, where {{people who are}} in the same economic position should be taxed the same, and <b>vertical</b> <b>equity,</b> where those who differ economically should be treated differently. In the New Zealand income tax, the <b>vertical</b> <b>equity</b> norm has primarily been achieved by progressive tax rates, and by family-friendly adjustments. Given that the income tax intentionally discriminates between taxpayers on the basis of taxpayer-specific characteristics such as income level and domestic situation, the question arises as to how the New Zealand income tax in its successive manifestations has been justified as fair; that is, what <b>vertical</b> <b>equity</b> in the New Zealand income tax looked like and how it was justified. This thesis considers the practice of the New Zealand income tax since its introduction in 1891 until 1984. By illuminating an employee’s lived experience of the income tax, it illustrates what taxation fairness actually looked like in practice, and contrasts this with the rhetoric of those responsible for the tax. It concludes that the reality of external events, rather than the rhetoric of taxation fairness, appears to have been the main driver of taxation practice. By focusing attention on the experience of the taxpayer, rather than merely on aggregated taxation data, legislative provisions or political discussion, the thesis permits the political rhetoric or fairness to be assessed against the fiscal impact on personal taxpayers. The thesis commences by reviewing certain influences on New Zealand income tax thought: from religion, antiquity, and more particularly from certain key British philosophers. It finds that despite their importance, these do not provide a clear direction for taxation policy. The thesis then shifts from philosophical discussions of what constitutes a fair tax to look at what the income tax actually looked like in the case of a wage or salary earner. It adopts an inductive approach by calculating the effect of the income tax legislation on employees at three income levels and in three domestic situations. The resulting nine cases demonstrate how taxpayers were distinguished for the purposes of <b>vertical</b> <b>equity.</b> Returning to the sources, this thesis then reviews contemporary Parliamentary Debates and Reports for evidence of how Parliament justified the practice of <b>vertical</b> <b>equity</b> in the income tax. Despite frequent appeals to fairness or equity, no clear basis was found. Rather, significant changes to the income tax, and thus to the practice of <b>vertical</b> <b>equity,</b> largely reflected pragmatic responses to political or economic events.

40|$|The {{equitable}} {{provision of}} public transportation services {{is a major concern}} for transit planners and service providers around the world. However, very few tools are available to planners seeking to incorporate equity concerns into their transit network designs. This research proposes innovative models for directly incorporating equity into the stop sequencing and stop grouping components of the Transit Network Design Problem (TNDP) and develops a solution method, a genetic algorithm, for solving these models. First, a single route model is developed to test the effects of designing routes according to different definitions of equity. This research explores nine possible inequity minimizing objective function formulations, drawing from horizontal, <b>vertical,</b> and intermodal <b>equity</b> perspectives. The single route model is largely based on the classic traveling salesman problem (TSP); every stop must be visited once and only once on a single circulating route. The primary difference between the two is the single route model replaces the TSP’s cost minimizing objective function with an inequity minimizing function. The Sioux Falls and Willimantic networks were used to test the single route model and to develop a genetic algorithm capable of solving this complex problem. These experiments narrowed the list of possible equity objective functions from nine to six. Extensive testing was conducted on the genetic algorithm, both on the algorithmic structure and on the input parameters, to validate its quality and efficiency. After testing the single route model and developing a solution method, the model was expanded into a multiple route model which addresses both the stop sequencing and stop grouping components of the TNDP. This model also considers route transfers, walking paths to and from transit stops, stops serving the same demand zones, multiple paths between demand zones, and idle time. This model was applied to a subset of the University of Connecticut’s, USA, shuttle bus system and solved using an expanded and updated version of the genetic algorithm applied to the single route model...|$|R
40|$|Income {{variability}} {{explains a}} significant {{fraction of the}} increase in annual income inequality. Chapter 1 considers the impact of variability on tax unit inequality. Using income tax return panel data, I estimate that between a tenth and a quarter {{of the increase in}} top one percent income shares between the early 1980 s and 2000 s was caused by variability. Increased income variability over this period resulted from mean-reverting fluctuations in the bottom quintile and top one percent. Variability {{in the top of the}} distribution seems partly driven by permanent income shifting in response to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Chapter 2 examines the individual earnings distribution. Using Social Security Administration earnings panel data, I estimate that variability explains half of the increase in annual inequality in the bottom half of the distribution between 1973 and 1985. When workers with years of zero earnings are included, increasing earnings variability explains almost all of this group's increase in inequality. The increase in earnings variability appears to be explained by an increased fraction of working age men with years of zero earnings. Annual individual earnings inequality in the bottom half of the distribution not only increased with variability in the 1970 s and 1980 s, but also fell with variability in the 1950 s and early 1960 s. This suggests that the U-shaped trend in income inequality observed over these four decades was partly caused by first a fall and then a rise in earnings variability. Between 1985 and 2000, falling variability caused most of the decline in annual earnings inequality within the bottom half of the distribution. Within the top of the distribution, earnings inequality increased over this period because of changes in permanent earnings and not increasing variability. Income variability means that in a progressive tax system annual and lifetime federal tax rates can diverge. Chapter 3 shows that on an annual basis, those at the bottom of the distribution pay little or no federal income taxes, while on a lifetime basis they pay average tax rates about five percentage points higher. Income variability also means there is a trade-off between <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>equity...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tax {{avoidance}} and evasion are {{pervasive in}} all countries, and tax structures are undoubtedly skewed by this reality. Standard models of taxation and their conclusions must reflect these realities. This paper first presents theoretical models that integrate avoidance and evasion into the overall decision problem faced by individuals. Early models {{of this area}} focused on tax evasion, modeled as a gamble against the enforcement capability of the state. More recently, the literature has examined more general models of the technology of avoidance, with the additional risk bearing caused by tax evasion either being a special case of this technology or {{one aspect of the}} cost of changing behavior to reduce tax liability. If the cost of evasion and avoidance depends on other aspects of behavior, the choice of consumption basket and avoidance become intertwined. The paper then relates the behavior predicted by the model to what is known empirically about the extent of evasion and avoidance, and how it responds to tax enforcement policy. The paper then turns to normative analysis, and discusses how avoidance and evasion affect the analysis of <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>equity</b> as well as efficiency costs; a taxonomy of efficiency costs is presented. Acknowledging the variety of behavioral responses to taxation changes the answers to traditional subjects of inquiry, such as incidence, optimal progressivity, and the optimal mix between income and consumption taxes. It also raises {{a whole new set of}} policy questions, such as the appropriate level of resources to devote to administration and enforcement, and how those resources should be deployed. Because there are a variety of policy instruments that can affect the magnitude and nature of avoidance and evasion response, the elasticity of behavioral response is itself a policy instrument, to be chosen optimally. The paper reviews that is known about these issues, and introduces a general theory of optimal tax systems, in which tax rates and bases are chosen simultaneously with the administrative and enforcement regimes. We argue that the concept of the marginal efficiency cost of funds is a useful way to summarize the normative issues that arise, and expand the concept to include administrative costs, avoidance, and evasion. ...|$|R
