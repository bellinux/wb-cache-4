40|$|Developments {{of fiber}} linked optical {{interferometer}} are reported. This interferometer {{is a part}} of MIRA-I. 2 interferometer (Mitaka InfraRed and optical Array). MIRA-I. 2 is an optical interferometer with a 30 meters long baseline. It consists of two 30 cm siderostats, tip-tilt mirrors, <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipes</b> delay lines and detectors. We plan to use two 60 meters long polarization-maintaining fibers for arms of the interferometer, instead of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipes.</b> The developments include dispersion and polarization compensation of fiber and fiber injection module. In laboratory experiments, dispersion compensation succeeded. The fringe visibility was 0. 93 for wide-band, where the central wavelength of light was 700 nm, and bandwidth was 200 nm, while 0. 95 with a He-Ne laser. We used BK 7 glass wedge for dispersion compensation. About fiber injection module, basic optical design has completed. The results of our fiber interferometer could contribute to OHANA (Optical Hawaiian Array for Nanoradian Astronomy) project.

The train had run from Ellesmere Port as an unbraked freight train and stopped at Helsby, where it needed to reverse. The guard had forgotten to connect the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipes</b> when the locomotive coupled up to {{the opposite end of}} the train, so that extra brake power was not available on the falling gradient into Chester.

25|$|The leather valve {{along the}} top of the pipe tended to dry out and air could then leak in, but this was mitigated {{slightly}} by the passing trains spraying water on the leather. The harsh environment of the line, which runs adjacent to the sea for much of its length and is often soaked with salt spray, presented difficulties in maintaining the leather flaps provided to seal the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipes,</b> which had to be kept supple by being greased with tallow; even so, air leaked in, reducing the pressure difference.|$|R

50|$|The brake {{cylinder}} {{is contained in}} a larger housing—this gives a reserve of vacuum as the piston operates.

50|$|The British Rail Class 109 is a {{class of}} 2-car diesel {{multiple}} units built in 1957 by D Wickham & Co. Five two-car units were built featuring an unusual body design. The design, first used in 1936 for South American railways, aimed to minimise weight. It had no underframe, but the whole body was formed into a welded stress-bearing box girder made of 1/8 in solid drawn steel tube. Aluminium was used for panels, luggage racks, window frames, <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipes</b> and fuel and vacuum tanks. The corrugated steel floor was filled with sprayed asbestos and covered with asbestos-filled flame-proofed hardboard and rubber sheet.|$|R

They are used to compute the power that the multi-bunch LHC beams can dissipate in such a structure if one of its resonant frequencies is equal to a harmonic of the beam intensity. This power can be several kilowatts for a specific rigid geometry. It is demonstrated that the actual power dissipation in a resonance is reduced to only a few watts for beam pipes that are not thermally constrained.

50|$|A few {{remedies}} {{have been}} proposed to deal with this, such as putting ridges in the accelerator tube, adding antechambers to the tube, coating the tube to reduce the yield of electrons from the surface, or creating an electric field to pull in stray electrons. At the PEP-II accelerator at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipe</b> which contains the positron ring has a wire coiled around its entire length. Running a current through this wire creates a solenoidal magnetic field which tends to contain the electrons liberated from the beam pipe walls.|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} {{use for the}} injector {{technology is}} in vacuum ejectors in continuous train braking systems, which were made compulsory in the UK by the Regulation of Railways Act 1889. A vacuum ejector uses steam pressure to draw {{air out of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipe</b> and reservoirs of continuous train brake. Steam locomotives, with a ready source of steam, found ejector technology ideal with its rugged simplicity and lack of moving parts. A steam locomotive usually has two ejectors: a large ejector for releasing the brakes when stationary and a small ejector for maintaining the vacuum against leaks. The small ejector is sometimes replaced by a reciprocating pump driven from the crosshead because this is more economical of steam.|$|E
3000|$|The {{laser beam}} is {{introduced}} into the vacuum chamber through an optical window {{after it has been}} collimated in the input path with optical benches at 5 -m separation. To avoid aberrations in the expansion optics, the beam diameter is gradually expanded to ~ 100 times from the output of the optical fiber. The beam diameter of the interferometer needs to be large enough to prevent degrading due to a mismatch in interference beams during the 3 -km round-trip. Furthermore, it needs to allow confinement in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipes</b> because the beam diameter (d) at wavelength (λ) and distance (z) from the beam waist position is approximately inversely proportional to the beam waist size (diameter \(d_{ 0 }\)), given as \(d = d_{ 0 } \sqrt { 1 + \left([...] { 4 \lambda z} \right)^{ 2 } /\left([...] {\pi^{ 2 } d_{ 0 }^{ 4 } } \right)} \sim 4 \lambda z/\left([...] {\pi d_{ 0 } } \right)\) for a Gaussian beam, where \(z \gg d_{ 0 }^{ 2 } /\lambda\) (Kogelnik and Li 1966). To minimize the diameter for the 3 -km round-trip beam, the beam waist should be \(d_{ 0 } = \sqrt { 4 \lambda L/\pi }\) and located at the end reflector. Then, the beam diameter of the front reflector is minimized to \(\sqrt 2 d_{ 0 }\). Accordingly, the retroreflectors and beam splitter have a large aperture, more than ~ 3 d, to prevent chipping of the beam. Because the diameters of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipes</b> need to be much more than 6 d =  270  mm to confine the round-trip beams, we used 400  mm for the actual system. The optical parameters used for this design are listed in Table  2.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{mentions}} {{first the}} requirement of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) for storage rings with colliding beams, and then describes how, in the mid- 1950 's, the fast development of UHV technology made {{the construction of the}} Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) possible with their 2 km of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipes</b> at 10 /sup - 11 / Torr. The performance features are discussed with special emphasis on the problem of stimulated gas desorption from chamber walls. The placing of contracts for sputter-ion pumps and the need for developing sector valves at CERN is mentioned to illustrate that there was some feedback from these constructions to the general development of UHV. Finally, some problems and solutions are listed which are common to other fields where UHV is used: namely in thermonuclear fusion, space research, and manufacturing of integrated circuits...|$|R
40|$|The {{electron}} cloud in <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipes</b> of accelerators of positively charged particle beams causes a beam energy loss {{which could be}} estimated from the synchronous phase. Measurements done with beams of 75 ns, 50 ns, and 25 ns bunch spacing in the LHC for some fills in 2010 and 2011 show that the average energy loss depends on the total beam intensity in the ring. Later measurements during the scrubbing run with 50 ns beams show {{the reduction of the}} {{electron cloud}} due to scrubbing. Finally, measurements of the individual bunch phase give us information about the electron cloud build-up inside the batch and from batch to batch.

50|$|Most turbopumps have a Holweck pump (or {{molecular}} drag pump) {{as their}} last stage {{to increase the}} maximum backing pressure (exhaust pressure) to about 1-10 mbar. Theoretically, a centrifugal pump, a side channel pump, or a regenerative pump {{could be used to}} back to atmospheric pressure directly, but currently there is no commercially available turbopump that exhausts directly to atmosphere. In most cases, the exhaust is connected to a mechanical backing pump (usually called roughing pump) that produces a pressure low enough for the turbomolecular pump to work efficiently. Typically, this backing pressure is below 0.1 mbar and commonly about 0.01 mbar. The backing pressure is rarely below 10−3 mbar (mean free path ≈ 70 mm) because the flow resistance of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipe</b> between the turbopump and the roughing pump becomes significant.|$|E

Chowder then fights off many monsters and encounters the second boss, a large <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipe.</b> After defeating them all, he moves another crate to a high up platform and finds a key to the nearby door behind some furnaces. He enters an underground bathroom where a TV passes from behind while he goes forward. Making his way through the labyrinth, Chowder fights two more living TVs and encounters the third boss, again the giant pipe, but has to defeat it three times before he can make his way to the actual basement.|$|E
50|$|The next {{innovation}} in automatic milking was the milk pipeline, {{introduced in the}} late 20th century. This uses a permanent milk-return pipe and a second <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipe</b> that encircles the barn or milking parlor above the rows of cows, with quick-seal entry ports above each cow. By {{eliminating the need for}} the milk container, the milking device shrank in size and weight {{to the point where it}} could hang under the cow, held up only by the sucking force of the milker nipples on the cow's udder. The milk is pulled up into the milk-return pipe by the vacuum system, and then flows by gravity to the milkhouse vacuum-breaker that puts the milk in the storage tank. The pipeline system greatly reduced the physical labor of milking since the farmer no longer needed to carry around huge heavy buckets of milk from each cow.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} {{required the}} use of leather flaps to seal the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipes.</b> The natural oils were drawn out of the leather by the vacuum, making the leather vulnerable to water, rotting it and breaking the fibres when it froze {{during the winter of}} 1847. It had to be kept supple with tallow, which is attractive to rats. The flaps were eaten, and vacuum operation lasted less than a year, from 1847 (experimental service began in September; operations from February 1848) to 10 September 1848. Deterioration of the valve due to the reaction of tannin and iron oxide has been cited as the last straw that sank the project, as the continuous valve began to tear from its rivets over most of its length, and the estimated replacement cost of £25,000 was considered prohibitive.|$|R
