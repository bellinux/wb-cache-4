It is named after Jean-Marie Duhamel who first applied the principle to the inhomogeneous heat equation that models, for instance, the distribution of heat in a thin plate which is heated from beneath.

40|$|<b>Vibrating</b> <b>plates</b> {{can be used}} in Active Noise Control (ANC) {{applications}} {{as active}} barriers or as secondary sources replacing classical loudspeakers. The system with <b>vibrating</b> <b>plates,</b> especially when nonlinear MFC actuators are used, is nonlinear. The nonlinearity in the system reduces performance of classical feedforward ANC with linear control filters systems, because they cannot cope with harmonics generated by the nonlinearity. The performance of the ANC system can be improved by using nonlinear control filters, such as Artificial Neural Networks or Volterra filters. However, when multiple actuators are mounted on a single plate, which is a common practice to provide effective control of more vibration modes, each actuator should be driven by a dedicated nonlinear control filter. This significantly increases computational complexity of the control algorithm, because adaptation of nonlinear control filters is much more computationally demanding than adaptation of linear FIR filters. This paper presents an ANC system with multiple actuators, which are driven with a single nonlinear filter. To avoid destructive interference of vibrations generated by different actuators the control signal is filtered by appropriate separate linear filters. The control system is experimentally verified and obtained results are reported...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Considerable {{attention}} {{has been devoted to}} actively and passively controlling the sound radiation from <b>vibrating</b> <b>plates</b> into closed cavities. With the advent of smart materials, extensive effort has been exerted to control the vibration and sound radiation from flexible plates using smart sensors/actuators. The Active Constrained Layer Damping (ACLD) treatment has been used successfully for controlling the vibration of various flexible structures. The treatment provides an effective means for augmenting the simplicity and reli-ability of passive damping with the low weight and high efficiency of active controls to attain high damping characteristics over broad frequency bands. This study investigates a numerically simulated example con-sisting of an ACLD treated plate/acoustic cavity system excited by a point harmonic force. In this study, an ACLD treated plate/acoustic cavity coupled finite element model is utilized to calculate the structural inten-sity and sound pressure radiated by the <b>vibrating</b> <b>plates.</b> In the passive control, the optimum placement of ACLD patches is determined by the structural intensity of ACLD treated plates and compared to the results obtained by using the strain energy approach. The influence on the structural intensity of the plate due to the damping treatment is investigated...|$|R
40|$|A unimorph {{flexural}} transducer {{design is}} proposed and tested {{with regard to}} mode shapes and frequencies. The transducers consist of a passive metal cap structure, and a thin piezoelectric disc, rigidly bonded to the inside. Extensive finite element (FE) modelling, and experimental 2 D, time-resolved displacement measurements were done to characterise the transducers flexural properties, and to compare them to the analytical solutions of thin <b>vibrating</b> <b>plates.</b> Emphasis was put on characterising the passive layer of the unimorph structure, before bonding the piezoelectric element, {{to understand how the}} active element affects the behaviour of the flexing plate. A high power Nd:YAG laser was used to actuate the metal plate (non-contact), and the frequency content of the resulting displacement signal was analysed to identify the flexural modes. The non-axisymmetric modes, which are conventionally disregarded because of their unfavourable acoustic properties, were also taken into account. There was excellent agreement between the experimental results and the FE simulation data. There was good agreement with the analytical edge clamped plate model, but with some notable deviations, which have not previously been identified or commented upon. Specifically, the second axisymmetric mode is split into three separate modes, which is not explained by the traditional theory of <b>vibrating</b> <b>plates.</b> ...|$|R

Furthermore, we found that the charge transfer depends on various factors, such as the initial charge, chemical and electrical properties, travel length of particles, and the external electric field. We also found that the equilibrium charge of particles depends on the chemical property and external electric field. The equilibrium charge and the rate of tribocharging were evaluated analytically from the relationship between the initial and transferred charges without changing the travel distance of particles. This method enables the rapid and reliable analysis of the particle tribocharging process...|$|E
40|$|Adaptive Active Control algorithms, such as {{the well}} known Filtered-X LMS and Filtered-U LMS algorithms, often do not yield optimal {{performance}} in practise, due to finite length impulse response of the controller (Filtered-X) or convergence to a local minimum (Filtered-U).

40|$|A {{method of}} suppressing sound {{radiation}} {{to the far}} field of a near-field acoustic communication system using an evanescent sound field is proposed. The amplitude of the evanescent sound field generated from an infinite <b>vibrating</b> <b>plate</b> attenuates exponentially with increasing {{a distance from the}} surface of the <b>vibrating</b> <b>plate.</b> However, a discontinuity of the sound field exists at the edge of the finite <b>vibrating</b> <b>plate</b> in practice, which broadens the wavenumber spectrum. A sound wave radiates over the evanescent sound field because of broadening of the wavenumber spectrum. Therefore, we calculated the optimum distribution of the particle velocity on the <b>vibrating</b> <b>plate</b> to reduce the broadening of the wavenumber spectrum. We focused on a window function that is utilized in the field of signal analysis for reducing the broadening of the frequency spectrum. The optimization calculation is necessary for the design of window function suitable for suppressing sound radiation and securing a spatial area for data communication. In addition, a wide frequency bandwidth is required to increase the data transmission speed. Therefore, we investigated a suitable method for calculating the sound pressure level at the far field to confirm the variation of the distribution of sound pressure level determined on the basis of the window shape and frequency. The distribution of the sound pressure level at a finite distance was in good agreement with that obtained at an infinite far field under the condition generating the evanescent sound field. Consequently, the window function was optimized by the method used to calculate the distribution of the sound pressure level at an infinite far field using the wavenumber spectrum on the <b>vibrating</b> <b>plate.</b> According to the result of comparing the distributions of the sound pressure level in the cases with and without the window function, it was confirmed that the area whose sound pressure level was reduced from the maximum level to − 50 dB was extended. Additionally, we designed a sound insulator so as to realize a similar distribution of the particle velocity to that obtained using the optimized window function. Sound radiation was suppressed using a sound insulator put above the vibrating surface in the simulation using the three-dimensional finite element method. On the basis of this finding, it was suggested that near-field acoustic communication which suppressed sound radiation can be realized by applying the optimized window function to the particle velocity field...|$|E

The system is assembled from concatenated SAW vibration sensors based on a SAW delay line manufactured on a surface of a piezoelectric plate. Vibrations of the plate are transformed into electric signals that allow identification of the sensor and localization of a threat. The theoretical study of sensor vibrations leads us to the simple isotropic model with one degree of freedom. This model allowed an explicit description of the sensor plate movement and identification of the vibrating sensor. Analysis of frequency response of the ST-cut quartz sensor plate and a damping speed of its impulse response has been conducted. The analysis above was the basis to determine the ranges of parameters for <b>vibrating</b> <b>plates</b> to be useful in electronic warning systems. Generally, operation of electronic warning systems with SAW vibration sensors is based on the analysis of signal phase changes at the working frequency of delay line after being transmitted via two circuits of concatenated four-terminal networks.

The amplitude of vibration can also be correlated to the amount of friction reduction between the plate and the finger.
