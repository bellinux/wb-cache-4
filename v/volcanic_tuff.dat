5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E
5|$|With {{material}} from previous articles, Weisman uses {{the fate of}} the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff,</b> and are likely to survive for centuries to come.|$|E

5|$|The Maya {{built their}} cities with Neolithic technology; they built their {{structures}} from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style. Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available. The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety {{in the quality}} of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed sandstone. In Comalcalco, where suitable stone was not available locally, fired bricks were employed. Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco. Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing pulleys.|$|E

25|$|The Greeks used <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> {{from the}} island of Thera as their {{pozzolan}} and the Romans used crushed volcanic ash (activated aluminium silicates) with lime.

In the absence of pozzolanic ash, the Romans used powdered brick or pottery as a substitute and they may have used crushed tiles for this purpose before discovering natural sources near Rome. The huge dome of the Pantheon in Rome and the massive Baths of Caracalla are examples of ancient structures made from these concretes, many of which are still standing. The vast system of Roman aqueducts also made extensive use of hydraulic cement.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the medieval}} period, Aksumite {{architecture}} and influences and its monolithic tradition persisted, with its influence strongest {{in the early}} medieval (Late Aksumite) and Zagwe periods (when the churches of Lalibela were carved). Throughout the medieval period, and especially during the 10th to 12th centuries, churches were hewn out of rock throughout Ethiopia, especially during the northernmost region of Tigray, which was {{the heart of the}} Aksumite Empire. However, rock-hewn churches have been found as far south as Adadi Maryam (15th century), about 100km south of Addis Abeba. The most famous example of Ethiopian rock-hewn architecture are the 11 monolithic churches of Lalibela, carved out of the red <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> found around the town. Though later medieval hagiographies attribute all 11 structures to the eponymous king Lalibela (the town was called Roha and Adefa before his reign), new evidence indicates that they may have been built separately over a period of a few centuries, with {{only a few of the}} more recent churches having been built under his reign. Archaeologist and Ethiopisant David Phillipson postulates, for instance, that Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el was actually built in the very early medieval period, some time between 600 and 800 AD, originally as a fortress but was later turned into a church.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The main aim of {{this paper}} is to {{preserve}} the historical masonry buildings by determining the characteristics of original stone which is essential in the conservation and restoration activities. The determination of the characteristics of original material is necessary for both conservation and restoration of buildings. The characterization of original stone is very important to choose the appropriate treatment methods and protective chemicals. Because, conservation methods can be different in each type of stone. And also, characterization data of the original stone is necessary to choose appropriate the quarried stone. To make a contribution to preservation of the cultural heritage studies, the experimental methods were evaluated for characterization of original stones used in the structure. In this paper, Ahi Celebi Mosque which was built in 16 th century by Architect Sinan in Istanbul was chosen as a case study. In this building, usage of white colored limestone (Kufeki) and green colored <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuffs</b> (Od Stone) were observed.

500|$|Stelae {{were usually}} crafted from quarried limestone, {{although}} in the Southern Maya area other types of stone were preferred. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> was used at Copán to craft their stelae in three dimensions. Both limestone and tuff were easily worked when first quarried and hardened with exposure to the elements. At Quiriguá a hard red sandstone was used that was unable to reproduce the three-dimensionality of Copán but was of sufficient strength that the kings of the city were able to raise the tallest free-standing stone monuments in the Americas. The Maya lacked beasts of burden and did not employ the wheel; therefore the freshly quarried blocks of stone had to be transported on rollers along the Maya causeways. Evidence {{of this has been}} found on the causeways themselves, where rollers have been recovered. The blocks were sculpted to their final form while still soft and they then hardened naturally with time. Stone was usually quarried locally but was occasionally transported over great distances. Calakmul in Mexico was one of two powerful cities that shaped the political landscape of the Classic Period, the other being Tikal. It imported black slate for one stela from the Maya Mountains, more than [...] away.
