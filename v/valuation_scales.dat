40|$|In this {{strictly}} positional {{paper we}} propose a general approach to bipolar knowledge representation, where the meaning of concepts can be modelled by examining their decomposition into opposite and neutral categories. In particular, it is the semantic relationship between the opposite categories which suggests the emergence of a paired structure and its associated type of neutrality, being there three general types of neutral categories, namely indeterminacy, ambivalence and conflict. Hence, the key issue consists in identifying the semantic opposition characterizing the meaning of concepts {{and at the same time}} the type of neutrality rising in between opposites. Based on this first level of bipolar knowledge representation, paired structures in fact offer the means to characterize a specific bipolar valuation scale depending on the meaning of the concept that has to be verified. In this sense, a paired structure is a standard basic structure that allows learning and building different <b>valuation</b> <b>scales,</b> leading to linear or even more complex <b>valuation</b> <b>scales...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Although the expectancies {{component}} of the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol Questionnaire has previously {{been shown to be}} factorially valid, the factor structure of its valuations component has not previously been examined. The aims of this paper were: (i) to replicate the factor structure of the expectancies items; (ii) to explore the factor structure of the valuations items; and (iii) to investigate the utility of using the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol Questionnaire to predict drinking behavior. The questionnaire was administered to 1004 university students along with measures of quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption. Fromme, Stroot, and Kaplan’s (1993) factor structure of the expectancies scales was replicated. The factor structures of the negative <b>valuations</b> <b>scales</b> were characterized by 2 rather than 3 factors. Negative expectancies improved upon the prediction of drinking quantity and frequency over-and-above positive expectancies, and valuations further improved prediction over-and-above expectancies. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

40|$|Introduction: World Health Organization (WHO) Articles of Association defines {{health as}} the state of {{complete}} physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease. According to this definition, the concept of health is enlarged and consists of public and personal needs, motives and psychological nature of a person, education, culture, tradition, religion, etc. All these needs {{do not have the}} same rank on life <b>valuation</b> <b>scale.</b> Objective: The objective of our study was ranking 6 most important values of life out of 12 suggested. Method: Questionnaire about Life <b>Valuation</b> <b>Scale</b> was used as method in our study. This questionnaire was created by the Serbian Medical Association and Department of General Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade. It analyzed 10 % of all citizens in 18 places in Serbia, aged from 25 to 64 years, including Belgrade commune Vozdovac. Survey was performed in health institutions and in citizens’ residencies in 1995 / 96 by doctors, nurses and field nurses. Results: A total of 14, 801 citizens was questioned in Serbia (42. 57 % of men, 57. 25 % of women), and 852 citizens in Vozdovac commune (34. 62 % of men, 65. 38 % of women). People differently value things in their lives. On the basis of life values scoring, the most important thing in people’s life was health. In Serbia, public rank of health was 4. 79 %, and 4. 4 % in Vozdovac commune. Relations in family were on the second place, and engagement in politics was on the last place. Conclusion: The results of our study in the whole Serbia and in Vozdovac commune do not differ significantly from each other, and all of them demonstrated that people attached the greatest importance to health on the scale of proposed values. Relationships in family were on the second place, and political activity was on the last place. High ranking of health and relationships in family generally shows that general practitioners in Serbia take important part in primary health care and promotion of health care management. They have responsibility to preserve and enhance health of a person, family and society as a whole...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Delays in the {{admission}} to {{care of young}} adults with emerging mental disorders represent one of the current major concern in psychiatry. This delay, often experienced in clinical practice, has several determinants. One of these is "unexpressed help-seeking" that is influenced by cultural and historical backgrounds and by {{the characteristics of the}} disorder itself, but most of all by the way community mental health services are developed. The aims are to identify: level of stress and mental unease and main determinants of unexpressed help-seeking within a community sample of young adults in a national contest of generalist community mental health model. Methods: the sample is made up of 3, 446 university students. An explorative questionnaire together with SVS (Stress related <b>Valuation</b> <b>Scale)</b> for the assessment of subjective stress and GHQ- 12 for the evaluation of mental health status were given. A descriptive analysis was carried out followed by correlations between unexpressed help-seeking variable and other variables.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of a {{contingent}} valuation study for finding a conservative estimate of the value-of-statistical-life in an urban road safety context in Sweden. We estimate the value of both a private-good device and a public-good safety program. The reduction of risk is communicated with a “community analogy” representation of the “Vision Zero” target of the national traffic-safety policy. According to this target, the road-traffic system should be designed so as to prevent accidents when they happen to lead to fatalities or severe injuries. We use the “certainty approach” for ex-post correction of results to remove or mitigate hypothetical bias of responses. As expected we find insensitivity of responses in the full sample {{to the size of the}} risk reduction being valued. By our approach we can compute a conservative estimate, based on answers from fully confident respondents, of the value of the largest possible safety enhancement (i. e. fulfilment of the “Vision Zero”). This lower bound estimate indicates a higher average willingness-to-pay for public safety-improving measures than currently assumed in benefit-cost assessments. We also find that the willingness to pay is considerably lower within a public-good than a private-good framework and a weak indication of sensitivity to scale among the most confident respondents.

The two spaces, urban and wilderness, are placed in opposition {{to one another in}} a sliding <b>valuation</b> <b>scale</b> that is based on the degradation experienced in these urban areas, due to industrialized capitalist means of production, by the inhabitants. These effects are the source of both literary and visual art protests that originate in the 19 th century in both generations of the Hudson River School painters, American pastoral writing, philosophy, and photographs. These romanticized views of natural space and out interactions with natural spaces create a deeply sentimental and mythic connection to America 2 ̆ 7 s wilderness. This spurs the creation of the National and State Parks and Forests systems that preserve and embalm the idealistic settings for industrialized man to commune with wilderness. These spaces, however, are inherently flawed in their construction and execution. This fact began my investigation into what American society presents as natural, or in some cases, more natural, in the Parks and public lands systems and natural history museums. I argue that the three works presented in my thesis are linked to the greater American pastoral art tradition, but engage wild spaces as a means to create a critical discourse into the authenticity of the ideals established by previous authors and artists.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the studies was to {{determine}} the effects of media containing composts from sewage sludge and potato pulp on the flowering and decorative value of 'Butterfly Yellow with Blotch' parviflorous pansy. In the experiment 14 potting media, including 12 media made of 4 composts, were tested. The percentage of compost mixed with sphagnum peat was 25 %, 50 % and 75 %. The components of particular composts were as follows: I - municipal sewage sludge 70 % and straw 30 %; II - municipal sewage sludge 70 % and sawdust 30 %; III - municipal sewage sludge 35 %, potato pulp 35 % and straw 30 %; IV - municipal sewage sludge 35 %, potato pulp 35 % and sawdust 30 %. Two control potting media were used: 1 - sphagnum peat with Osmocote Exact Lo-Start at the dose 5 g×dm - 3 and 2 - sphagnum peat with Azofoska at the dose 2. 5 g×dm - 3. There was no top-dressing during cultivation. The pansies for whose cultivation a slow-release fertiliser was used turned out to have most flowers, but the plants cultivated in compost with peat at the ratio 1 : 1 had equally abundant flowering. At the generative stage, the pansies in control media were the most decorative and those growing in 25 % of compost I, 75 % of compost II and 50 % of compost III and IV. On the basis of plant <b>valuation</b> <b>scale,</b> quality assessment and the abundance of flowering it was found that the media containing 50 % of composts were optimal for pansy cultivation...|$|R

However, the underlying economic model of human psychology fails to explain why certain types of stated behaviour are observed. Thus, good scope exists for interdisciplinary {{research in the area of}} economics and psychology with regard to environmental valuation. A critical review is presented here of some recent research by social psychologists in the US attempting to explain stated behaviour in contingent <b>valuation.</b> Attitudinal <b>scales</b> have been used to analyse the role of ecocentric, biocentric and altruistic motives for giving. However, the research is shown to draw some potentially misleading conclusions and be unrepresentative of contingent valuation. Two recent economic studies using contingent valuation are then reported and shown to have identified non-economic motives for WTP. The complexity of value formation and expression is found to go far beyond that generally accepted by economic models. Greater consideration of the role played by attitudes and ethical considerations then becomes relevant to the interpretation of results being used in standard cost-benefit analysis and environmental policy. attitudes, behaviour, contribution model, contingent valuation, environmental ethics, rights, social psychology...|$|R

(2010) from solid-angle polynomials to all translation-invariant simple valuations. For general polytopes, this yields a new characterization of the volume as the unique combinatorially positive <b>valuation</b> up to <b>scaling.</b> For lattice polytopes our results extend work of Betke [...] Kneser (1985) and give a discrete Hadwiger theorem: There is essentially a unique combinatorially-positive basis for the space of lattice-invariant valuations.

40|$|Logical {{inconsistencies}} in survey respondents' valuations of hypothetical health states - {{represented by the}} EQ- 5 D, for example - present a conundrum {{as to whether or}} not their responses ought to be included for estimating social 'tariffs'. A 'logical inconsistency' occurs when a state that 'in logical terms' is unambiguously less severe than another is assigned a lower value. Excluding such responses is defensible on data quality grounds but puts at risk the representativeness of the estimated tariff, given it is meant to represent the preferences of 'society'. This paper explores the rationale for and effect of excluding, to varying degrees, responses distinguished by the number of pairwise inconsistencies they contain, and reports equations for two tariffs that arise from contrasting approaches. The data are from a random sample of adult New Zealanders whose visual analogue <b>scale</b> <b>valuations</b> for a selection of EQ- 5 D states were collected in 1999 via a postal survey to which 1360 people responded (a 50 % response rate). We conclude that there is no simple, generalisable 'rule' to guide exclusions and therefore researchers ought to explore the sensitivity of their estimated tariffs (and ultimately QALY estimates) to alternative treatments of logically inconsistent responses.

The reasons for the reluctance to introduce the form factor are mainly due to the considerations regarding the effects of Reynolds and Froude numbers on the value of k. Various geosim model tests carried out by different institutions highlight the influence both of Reynolds and of Froude numbers on the form factor, but the associated physics is far from being completely understood. In order to obtain further information on the scale effect on the form factor, we have carried out experimental tests in two different towing tanks with geosim models of three parent hulls of Series 60, having block coefficient CB = 0. 60, 0. 70 and 0. 80.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{reconcile}} landscape conservation with changing demands on {{land use and}} natural resources, {{it is essential that}} the ecological, socio-cultural and economic values of the landscape be fully taken into account in planning and decision-making. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for integrated assessment of ecological services and socio-economic benefits of natural and semi-natural ecosystems and landscapes. The framework can be applied at different scale levels to different ecosystems or landscape-units and basically consists of three steps: (1) Function-analysis: translates ecological complexity into a limited number of ecosystem (or landscape) functions, which, in turn, provide a range of goods and services; (2) Function valuation: includes ecological, socio-cultural and economic valuation methods; and (3) Conflict analysis: to facilitate the application of function-analysis and <b>valuation</b> at different <b>scale</b> levels, it is important to integrate analytical valuation methods with stakeholder participation techniques. The framework presented in this paper facilitates the structured assessment of the (total) value of the goods and services provided by a specific area (landscape) and to analyze the costs and benefits involved in trade-offs between various land use options. The last section of this paper gives some conclusions and recommendations for application-possibilities of function-analysis and valuation to achieve more sustainable landscape use and maintenance of our "natural capital"...|$|R

K. -Spanish poverty comparisons to variations in the dependence of equivalence scales on household size and composition, using evidence from national household budget surveys. We sum up these comparisons using subjective confidence levels. Taking into account the dissimilarities {{in the distribution of}} incomes and needs across countries, we find, inter alia, that although the poor are typically more numerous in Spain than in Britain, the actual headcount differ-ences may vary by up to 10 percent of the population when needs allowances are altered, even when kept the same across the two countries. Comparisons of poverty composition across the two countries are also very sensitive to the choice of equivalence scale parameters. Generally, however, the pro-portion of single adults among the poor is much less important in Spain than in Britain, the reverse being true for households with three or more adults. Distributional assessments require comparisons of individual welfare levels, which are typically unobserved. The traditional way to infer these individual wel-fare levels from available household micro-data is through the use of equivalence scales, which convert family incomes into equivalent incomes that are comparable across individuals.

40|$|The {{numerical}} certainty scale (NCS) and polychotomous choice (PC) {{methods are}} two widely used techniques for measuring preference uncertainty in contingent valuation (CV) studies. The NCS follows a numerical {{scale and the}} PC {{is based on a}} verbal scale. This paper presents results of two experiments that use these preference uncertainty measurement techniques. The first experiment was designed to compare and contrast the uncertainty scores obtained from the NCS and the PC method. The second experiment was conducted to test a preference uncertainty measurement scale which combines verbal expressions with numerical and graphical interpretations: a composite certainty scale (CCS). The construct validity of the certainty scores obtained from these three techniques was tested by estimating three separate ordered probit regression models. The results of the study can be summarized in three key findings. First, the PC method generates a higher proportion of ‘Yes’ responses than the conventional dichotomous choice elicitation format. Second, the CCS method generates a significantly higher proportion of certain responses than the NCS and the PC methods. Finally, the NCS method performs poorly in terms of construct validity. We conclude that, overall, the verbal measures perform better than the numerical measure. Furthermore, the CCS method is promising in measuring preference uncertainty in CV studies. However, further empirical applications are required to develop a better understanding of its strengths and the weaknesses.

The present cross-sectional study examined the role of spiritual well-being in buffering the impact of functional difficulty on the anxiety and depressive symptoms of 319 functionally vulnerable community-dwelling elders, aged 70 or older, participating in a 6 -month randomized controlled trial designed to enhance function. As demonstrated in recent research on spirituality and health, we expected that spiritual well-being would moderate the association between functional difficulty and anxiety {{as well as the}} relationship between functional difficulty {{and depression}}. Functional difficulty was significantly associated with anxiety (r =. 27, p =. 000) and depression (r =. 33, p =. 000) such that anxiety and depression increased as did functional difficulty. Spiritual well-being was assessed using an 8 -item subscale of Lawton et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (2001) <b>Valuation</b> of Life <b>scale</b> (e. g., 2 ̆ 2 Life has meaning for me. 2 ̆ 2). After controlling for demographic and health conditions, results of separate regression analyses indicated that spiritual well-being had a moderating effect on the association between functional difficulty and depression (R 2 =. 42, p [interaction] =. 041), i. e., elders with greater functional difficulty and greater spiritual well-being experienced less depression. Contrary to expectations, spiritual well-being did not buffer the effect of functional difficulty on anxiety. Spiritual well-being has a differential effect on mental health. It appears to afford protection against the depressive consequences of functional impairment in frail elders but not anxiety. (NIA funded #AG 13687) ...|$|R
40|$|Land use {{includes}} those {{human activities}} that exhibit a spatial dimension and {{that change the}} bio-geophysical conditions of land. Land use policy making at European level aims at fostering sustainability pathways of natural resource use and rural development through the decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation while supporting social cohesion in rural areas. Targeted policy making requires tools for the ex ante assessment of impacts of policy driven land use changes on sustainable development opportunities in European regions. These tools have to cover all relevant land use sectors and impact issues including their interrelations. They have to be spatially explicit, allow scenario analysis of possible future developments, be based on reproducible analyses, and be transparent and easy to use. The European Commission funded Integrated Project SENSOR is dedicated to develop such ex-ante Sustainability Impact Assessment Tools (SIAT) for land use in European regions. SIAT is designed as a meta modelling toolkit, in which global economic trend and policy scenarios are translated into land use changes at 1 km 2 grid resolution for the area of Europe.

30|$|Our {{approach}} to assessing resilience implications is semi-quantitative; an ordinal <b>scale</b> <b>valuation</b> on resilience principles. Examples of quantitative approaches are available as well. For instance, Cutter et al. (2010) explore disaster resilience {{with a large}} set of indicators, and Mens (2015) models flood and drought robustness (resistance plus resilience). Thissen et al. (2015) compare ordinal analysis, robustness modelling, and exploratory modelling for a freshwater system. They conclude that robustness modelling requires considerable computation and quantitative input {{and understanding of the}} system. Exploratory modelling also requires significant computation, but less probabilistic specification of input. A qualitative or semi-quantitative resilience approach requires little quantitative input, can easily include stakeholder perspectives and tailoring to local situations, but can’t assess the efficiency of options and is less spatially explicit. Thissen et al. conclude that ordinal/qualitative approaches are useful for large-scale applications with multiple impacts, sectors, and stakeholder processes. Quantitative approaches are suitable for more narrowly constrained situations, such as the vulnerability of a specific sector to a specific impact. Indicator-based studies could provide a middle way, trading the speed of our approach for better quantitative and (potentially) spatially explicit evaluation. They do depend on the availability of suitable indicators and data to evaluate them. It would also be easier to develop a baseline of resilience than to evaluate the impacts of newly proposed policy options. Quantitative approaches are resource-intensive. A screening using our approach could provide an indication regarding what options or functions require a quantitative follow-up. Other tools also could be considered to further evaluate options, such as Multi-Criteria Analysis, cost-benefit analysis, or deliberative tools. Their suitability depends on the case-specifics, including framing of the adaptation problem, uncertainties and decision-strategy (Wardekker et al. 2009; De Boer et al. 2010). In our study, MCA usefully indicated that co-benefits was an important additional criterion for societal support.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} role of the catastrophic {{imaginary}} in shaping environmental praxis in the UK. Confronted by the threat of a looming climate change catastrophe, environmentalism in the global North is caught in a state of impasse. Despite numerous organising attempts no mass climate change movement has emerged to confront the threat. This absence of a political movement is compounded by the failure of legislative campaigns and the inadequacy of government responses. Environmental praxis appears caught between ineffective practices and a catastrophic imaginary. It is this state of impasse, one as yet to be critically analysed, that this thesis sets out to explore. The thesis argues that the impasse in environmental praxis emerges from the intersection of the catastrophic imaginary and the limits of activism as a mode of liberal politics that I term liberal utopianism. Exploring a number of specific environmental organisations through a nomadic methodology framed by the practices of multi-sited ethnography, this thesis contends that the failure of liberal utopianism to adequately engage with climate change is in part due to the form climate change takes as a sociotechnical problem and not only an outcome of political practice itself. Exploration of responses to this state of impasse suggests {{that it is possible to}} break from the impasse by transforming the material grounds of the imaginary and envisioning catastrophe as a process of slow violence, and thus amenable to situated political action. This thesis explores the potential recent moves towards a politics of collapse, one I call radical fatalism, hold for environmental praxis. The thesis concludes by suggesting the need for a turn away from the politics of the event and the over-determining <b>valuation</b> of global <b>scales</b> within environmental praxis...|$|R
