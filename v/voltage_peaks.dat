5000|$|Rotary gaps {{operated}} in two modes, synchronous and [...] A synchronous gap {{was driven by}} a synchronous AC motor so that it ran at a fixed speed, and the gap fired in direct relation to the waveform of the A.C. supply that recharged the tank capacitor. The operator changed {{the point in the}} waveform where the gaps were closest by adjusting the rotor position on the motor shaft relative to the stator's studs. By properly adjusting the synchronous gap, it was possible to have the gap fire only at the <b>voltage</b> <b>peaks</b> of the input current. This technique made the tank circuit fire only at successive <b>voltage</b> <b>peaks,</b> thereby delivering maximum energy from the fully charged tank capacitor each time the gap fired. The break rate was thus fixed at twice the incoming power frequency (typically, 100 or 120 breaks/second, corresponding to 50 Hz or 60 Hz supply). When properly engineered and adjusted, synchronous spark gap systems delivered the largest amount of power to the antenna. However, electrode wear progressively changed the gap's firing point, so synchronous gaps were somewhat temperamental and difficult to maintain.|$|E

50|$|For example, at a {{frequency}} ν=20 MHz (free space wavelength of 15 m) in a transmission line whose velocity factor is 2/3, the guided wavelength (distance between <b>voltage</b> <b>peaks</b> of the forward wave alone) would be λ = 10 m.

On the other hand, the magnitude of the voltage due to a standing wave produced by its addition to a reflected wave, would have a wavelength between peaks of only λ/2 = 5 m. Depending on the location of the load and phase of reflection, there might be a peak in the magnitude of Vnet at x = 1.3 m. Then there would be another peak found where |Vnet|=Vmax at x = 6.3 m, whereas it would find minima of the standing wave |Vnet| = Vmin at x = 3.8 m, 8.8 m, etc.|$|E
50|$|If the SMPS has an AC input, {{then the}} first stage is to convert the input to DC. This is called rectification. A SMPS with a DC input does not require this stage. In some power {{supplies}} (mostly computer ATX power supplies), the rectifier circuit can be configured as a voltage doubler {{by the addition of}} a switch operated either manually or automatically. This feature permits operation from power sources that are normally at 115 V or at 230 V. The rectifier produces an unregulated DC voltage which is then sent to a large filter capacitor. The current drawn from the mains supply by this rectifier circuit occurs in short pulses around the AC <b>voltage</b> <b>peaks.</b> These pulses have significant high frequency energy which reduces the power factor. To correct for this, many newer SMPS will use a special PFC circuit to make the input current follow the sinusoidal shape of the AC input voltage, correcting the power factor. Power supplies that use active PFC usually are auto-ranging, supporting input voltages from ~100 VAC - 250 VAC, with no input voltage selector switch.|$|E

Finite element numerical simulations showed that the tangential component of the magnetic field exhibits sharp peaks above cracks, due to the stray magnetic field produced by them.

30|$|Figure 4 b {{shows the}} plasma {{evolution}} of energetic Al/Ni superlattice captured by ultra-high-speed camera. The process of Joule heating, evaporation, and plasma generating and expanding is evident. According to Fig.  4, a blurring light is observed, and the {{voltage and current}} rises slowly, indicating a Joule heating process (≤[*] 168 [*]ns). At 218 [*]ns, the voltage is suddenly increased while the emitting light is distinct, and {{the area of the}} light is nearly the area of the bowtie bridge. This corresponds to the evaporation process of the energetic Al/Ni superlattice. When the voltage reaches its maximum at 258 [*]ns, the explosion associated with plasma generation takes place following with intense light. After exploding, the plasma expansion towards ambient is apt to cause shock wave. Product particles which existed in the combustion of Al/Ni RMFs are not observed in this study, implicating that the explosion of energetic Al/Ni superlattice is uniform under high-pulse current [38]. Therefore, the time of the <b>voltage</b> <b>peak</b> can be regarded as the delay time (Tb) (between the onset of the current pulse and the <b>voltage</b> <b>peak</b> signal). The energy absorbed of the sample during this delay time is deemed as the critical explosion energy (Ec).
