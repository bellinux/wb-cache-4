40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2016. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: James Van de Ven. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 209 pages. <b>Valve</b> <b>timing</b> {{is critical to}} the performance of hydraulic piston motors and pumps. With non-optimal <b>valve</b> <b>timing,</b> the pressure differential across the valve during a valve opening or closing can be significant, causing transitional throttling loss and reducing the energy efficiency. The goal of this thesis is to provide a fundamental understanding of the role of <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> and propose a viable active valve solution for better efficiency of hydraulic pumps and motors. Previously, researchers have proposed a variety of <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> models based on analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and optimization. However, many critical questions, such as the relationship between the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> and throttling energy loss, the meaning of the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> optimality, and the influence of the fluid compressibility with entrained gas, have not been fully answered. Prior work on <b>valves</b> with active <b>timing</b> have focused on reducing the valve transition time, leakage, and dead volume. The cylindrical rotary valve architecture {{has been found to be}} a promising solution, provided that the leakage issue is solved. In this research, a new two-phase analytical <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> solution, a complete active motor-valve numerical model, a prototype cylindrical rotary valve, and a novel fluid compressibility experiment have been developed. Results have shown that the analytical <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> solution is capable of capturing the trade-offs between throttling energy loss and output piston work. A full model of a motor was used to optimize <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> for a specific operating condition. The numerical model was validated experimentally, where a prototype active rotary valve was integrated into a commercial pump. A rectified bulk modulus model was derived from a novel mass transfer experiment to determine the compressibility of oil with entrained gas based on an optical bubble size measurement. The contributions of the thesis are: (1) the validated analytical and numerical models that allow finding the optimal <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> as a function of the operating conditions, (2) a new active valve architecture that enables variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> motor/pump, and (3) a rectified fluid compressibility model based on a lumped interfacial mass transport equation that predicts the effective fluid bulk modulus dynamically...|$|R

Electro-Hydraulic valve actuators are used to eliminate the camshaft of an existing Internal Combustion(IC) engine and to control the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> of intake and exhaust valves, valve duration independently. This paper presents a research activity like hydraulic valve actuator design, dynamic simulations, analysis and adaptive <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> control of Camless Engine Valve Actuator. Electro-Hydraulic valve actuator’s main function is to provide fully variable open/close <b>valve</b> <b>timing.</b> The Camless Engine Valve Actuator (CEVA) system has been modeled {{by means of a}} powerful hydraulic simulation tool, AMESim, which is useful for the dynamic simulations and analysis of hydraulic systems. The designed model has been validated through comparison with mathematical model and experimental results obtained in a prototype test bench. This research is focused on Adaptive <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> control of Camless Engine Valve Actuator (CEVA) system. A proposed <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> control in this paper is used to robustly control opening timing, duration, closing timing regardless of fluid temperature variations without high-cost sensors.

50|$|The valves {{within an}} {{internal}} combustion engine are used to control {{the flow of the}} intake and exhaust gases {{into and out of the}} combustion chamber. The timing, duration and lift of these valve events has a significant impact on engine performance. Without variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> or variable <b>valve</b> lift, the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> must be the same for all engine speeds and conditions, therefore compromises are necessary. An engine equipped with a variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> actuation system is freed from this constraint, allowing performance to be improved over the engine operating range.|$|R
50|$|The main factor {{preventing}} {{this technology}} from wide use in production automobiles {{is the ability}} to produce a cost effective means of controlling the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> under the conditions internal to an engine. An engine operating at 3000 revolutions per minute will rotate the camshaft 25 times per second, so the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> events have to occur at precise times to offer performance benefits. Electromagnetic and pneumatic camless valve actuators offer the greatest control of precise <b>valve</b> <b>timing,</b> but, in 2016, are not cost effective for production vehicles.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Compression {{pressure}} of individual cylinder and <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> have big influence on combustion pressure, indicated {{mean effective pressure}} (IMEP), emission, vibration, combustion noise and many other combustion parameters. Therefore, uniformity of compression pressure and <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> became one of most important engine design and production standard. Conventional method to evaluate compression pressure uniformity is to measure each cylinder pressure by mechanical pressure gage during cranking. This conventional method causes inaccuracy of cylinder pressure measurement because of different cranking speed results from battery status and also causes high manhour and cost. To check <b>valve</b> <b>timing,</b> related FEAD parts should be disassembled and timing mark should be checked manually.

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the development of}} a fully continuous, hydraulics-based variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system. This hydraulics based variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system is capable of controlling an engine valves lift height and infinitely varying the engine valves lift profile. Along with full valve controllability during normal operation, the variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system is capable of providing the same operation as a classic cam shaft under engine power loss conditions. This is possible due to the rotating hydraulic spool valves coupled to the engines crank shaft, which are used to actuate the engine poppet valves. The main focus of this thesis is to investigate, alter and implement a new iteration of the hydraulic variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system on a standalone test bench to validate the systems operating principles. The test bench utilizes servo motors to act as an engines crank shaft which runs the rotating hydraulic spool valves and hydraulic pump. This serves as an intermediate step to full engine implementation of the variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system. The research begins by analyzing the current mechanical spool valve and hydraulic cylinder design for any potential problems that may occur either during assembly or full operation. The basic system equations are presented to give a glimpse into the working principles of the rotary valves. The mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic subsystems are discussed in terms of what was considered during the design and implementation process.
