The reasons underlying this risk are complex. To identify opportunities to reduce adverse sequelae, the cardiovascular perfusion community was invited to amend existing perfusion-related fields as well as add new ones to the current version of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS-CHSD). The International Consortium for Evidence-Based Perfusion (ICEBP) was invited by the STS-CHSD Task Force to identify and resolve ambiguities related to definitions among the 3 current perfusion-related fields as well as to propose new <b>variables</b> (<b>and</b> <b>definitions)</b> for inclusion in the 2010 update of the STS-CHSD. The ICEBP used teleconferences, wiki-based communication software, and e-mail to discuss current definitions and create new fields with definitions. The ICEBP created modified definitions to existing fields related to cardiovascular perfusion and also developed and defined new fields that focus on (1) techniques of circulatory arrest and cerebral perfusion, (2) strategies of myocardial protection, and (3) techniques to minimize hemodilution and allogeneic blood transfusions. Three fields in the STS-CHSD related to perfusion were redefined, and 23 new <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> were selected for inclusion. Identifying and defining fields specific to the practice of perfusion are requisite for assessing and subsequently improving the care provided to patients undergoing congenital heart surgery.

40|$|Objective. This article gleans {{important}} lessons for environmental justice (EJ) policy from the empirical literature and demonstrates them using EJ analyses of Superfund sites. It constructively critiques the EJ literature and suggests some future directions for designing policy and framing the discourse. Methods. The research methods of many quantitative EJ studies are reviewed. To demonstrate sensitivity to researchers' choices, logit models {{are estimated to}} explain the nationwide distribution of Superfund sites (and deletions from the NPL) using various spatial scales, control <b>variables,</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> of proximity. Results. Most empirical EJ studies examine cross-sectional distributions for aggregated demographic measures, dwelling on the implied counterfactual or causal mechanism briefly, if ever. The EJ analysis for Superfund sites exhibits much sensitivity to modeling choices and to whether environmental conditions or policy impacts are modeled. Conclusions. The findings highlight the limitations of conventional EJ research designs. Several implications {{for the design of}} EJ policy are drawn, emphasizing the importance of clarity about counterfactuals and which sorts of impacts are relevant.

30|$|The BCM {{can be used}} to {{identify}} locations and climatic conditions that generate excess water by quantifying the amount of water available either as runoff generated throughout a basin or as in-place recharge (Flint and Flint 2007). Because of the grid-based, simplified nature of the model, with no internal streamflow routing, long time series for very large areas can be simulated easily. However, if local unimpaired streamflow data are available, estimated recharge and runoff from each grid cell {{can be used to}} calculate basin discharge that can be extrapolated through time for varying climates. In addition, the application of the model across landscapes allows for grid-based comparisons between different areas. Because of the modular and mechanistic approach used by the BCM, it is flexible with respect to incorporating new input data or updating of algorithms should better calculations be derived. All input files necessary to operate the BCM, and the output files resulting from the simulations, are shown in Thorne et al. (2012; Appendix A).

The concept of community structure arises from the analysis of social networks and has successfully been applied to complex networks in other fields such as biology, physics and computing.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{learn from}} {{a sample of}} general {{practitioners}} and their patients how they define early at-risk alcohol intake and what they perceive the physician's role in helping patients with early at-risk alcohol intake to be. DESIGN: Survey questionnaire. SETTING: Family practices in Kamloops, BC, and the Department of Family Practice at Vancouver General Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one family physicians and 860 of their patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> of alcohol intake, opinions on appropriate interventions for physicians. RESULTS: Patients' median estimate for the limit of early, at-risk drinking for a 75 -kg man was two drinks per day an 11 drinks per week; doctors' estimate was 1. 5 drinks per day and nine drinks per week. For a 55 -kg woman, patients set risk to begin at 1. 5 drinks per day and nine drinks per week; doctors set it at 1. 2 per day and eight per week. However, patients thought there should be 4. 3 alcohol-free days each week and doctors thought 3. 5, both answers inconsistent with the daily and weekly limits set. Most (85 %) patients and 97 % of doctors think doctors should ask about drinking behaviour; yet only 42 % of these patients recalled ever being asked how much they drank. CONCLUSIONS: Both physicians and patients have stringent definitions of early at-risk drinking and believe physicians should intervene.

40|$|SummaryA {{universal}} classification {{of the negative}} outcomes of carpal tunnel release surgery does not, as yet, exist. In {{order to avoid the}} use of arbitrary factors we have applied the Accordion Severity Grading System, which uses rigorously defined qualitative terms to classify complications. It also provides a uniform manner for grading the severity of complications, enabling outcome comparisons between centres. We analysed the negative outcomes of 500 device-assisted carpal tunnel releases performed over a 2 -year period in the author's department. In order to establish a standardised list of complications we used the terms employed within the guidelines of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Most of these terms were subsequently defined using the data <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> taken from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program or the Medical Subject Headings of the National Library of Medicine. We also adopted the quantitative severity weighting, as proposed by the Accordion system, {{in order to determine the}} postoperative morbidity index for our assisted carpal tunnel releases. The most common complications were pain and reversible damage to peripheral nerves. Other common negative events, other than complications, included hand weakness, which we classified as a sequela of the procedure, and incomplete retinaculum release, which we classified as failure to cure. The overall postoperative morbidity index for complications was 0. 014. Although the Accordion system was developed for more complex procedures, it may also be adopted for carpal tunnel release surgery where it provides an objective and universal method for the classification of complications...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{severity}} of bipolar disorder {{can be assessed}} using the daily prospective National Institute of Mental Health's Life Chart Method (LCM-p). Also for scientific research the LCM-p, has been used frequently. However, processing and analyzing the LCM-p for research purposes, are challenging because of the multitude of complex measures that {{can be derived from}} the data. In the current paper we review the different LCM-p course variables (mood episodes, average severity, proportion of time ill and mood switches) and their definitions. Strengths and limitations and the impact of the use of different LCM-p course measures and definitions on the research results are described. Method: A systematic review of original papers on the LCM was conducted using 9 electronic databases for literature between January 1996 and December 2014. Papers using other prospective charting procedures were not evaluated in the current study. Results: The initial literature search led to 1352 papers of which 21 were eventually selected. A relatively wide variety of definitions of LCM-p course variables was used across the studies. Especially for the calculation of number of episodes and mood switch no univocal definition seems to exist. Across studies several different durations and severity criteria are applied to calculate these variables. We describe which <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> are most suitable for detecting specific bipolar disease course characteristics and patterns. Conclusion: In the absence of a golden standard for the calculation of LCM-p course variables, researchers should report the exact method they applied to their LCM-p data, and clearly motivate why this is their method of first choice considering their research aim.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} a set of lesson plans with tasks for {{teaching}} pupils how to program in Python using the turtle module. The first part discusses the problem of programming in primary schools: we note that programming presents only a small and optional fraction of the elective class about computing. Next we present programming language Python along with characteristics that make it suitable for teaching. We describe its installation and the development environment IDLE. Presentation of the turtle module, implemented in Python, which comes from the Logo programming language that was designed for learning to program, was emphasized. When being moved and turned, turtle draws a line. This drawing helps the pupils visualize what certain commands do. The {{second part of the}} thesis focuses on the explanation of basic programming concepts, such as conditional statements, loops and functions, which we introduce through tasks that need to be solved by using the turtle. The text in this part is written in a style that is closer to pupils, therefore we occasionally stray away from the standard terminology, e. g. by referring to functions as "statements". The first tasks deal with moving and turning the turtle. Then we introduce repeating a block of statements - a loop -, through tasks for drawing shapes in which a certain part is repeated multiple times. We continue with <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> of functions. For preparing suitable tasks about conditional statements and the while loop, we introduce functions for communication with user and computation of random numbers. Each set of the tasks is followed by help or tips, which help the pupils solve these tasks, as well as the solution. ...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop risk models for {{congenital}} heart surgery short-term and midterm outcomes from a nationwide integrated database drawn from hospitals in Japan. MethodsThe Japan Congenital Cardiovascular Surgery Database collects clinical information from institutions throughout Japan specializing in congenital heart surgery. <b>Variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> used in the Japan Congenital Cardiovascular Surgery Database are almost identical to those of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons–European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery database for congenital heart surgery. We used logistic regression to develop risk models, which were then validated through spilt-sample validation. In addition to procedural complexity categories by Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS- 1) score, we incorporated patient characteristics to predict surgical outcome. ResultsAmong 8923 congenital heart operations performed at 69 sites with cardiac surgical programs, 30 -day mortalities by RACHS- 1 category were as follows: I, 0. 1 % (n =  1319); II, 0. 5 % (n =  3211); III, 2. 2 % (n =  3285); IV, 4. 3 % (n =  818); and V and VI, 8. 6 % (n =  290). From the test data set (n =  7223), we developed 3 risk models (30 -day mortality, 90 -day mortality, and 90 -day and in-hospital mortality) with 11 variables, including age category, RACHS- 1 category, preoperative risk factors, number of surgical procedures, unplanned reoperations, status of surgery, surgery type, asplenia, and prematurity (< 35 weeks). For the performance metrics of the risk models, C statistic values of 30 -day, 90 -day, and 90 -day and in-hospital mortalities for the test data set were 0. 85, 0. 85, and 0. 84, respectively. When only the RACHS- 1 score was used for discrimination, the C statistic values of 30 -day, 90 -day, and 90 -day and in-hospital mortalities for the validation data set were 0. 73, 0. 73, and 0. 77, respectively. ConclusionsThe proposed risk scores and categories have high discrimination power for predicting mortality, demonstrating improvement relative to existing consensus-based methods. Risk models incorporating these measures may be useful for comparing mortality outcomes cross institutions or countries with mixed cases...|$|E
