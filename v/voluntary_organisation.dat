40|$|Abstract Matchmaking on an {{organisational}} level – about co-operation between municipal introduction-units and <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> Essay in Political Science D, by Rebecka Johansson, spring 2006 The aim of {{this study}} is to examine co-operation between municipal introduction-units, which work to integrate newly arrived immigrants and refuges, and <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> in Sweden. The essay is a comparative case study which examines three local authorities and the main questions are; - Do <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> constitute a functioning co-operation partner to the municipal introduction-units? Are there conditions for future co-operation? The answer to the questions is that there are no, or rarely any, co-operation between <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> and municipal introduction-units. It is difficult to judge whether there are conditions for future co-operation. The theory used is interorganisational theory and it’s thesis on resource-dependency. According to the theory organisations need to have some kind of dependency towards the other organisations to be interested in co-operation. This study shows that the local authorities are more eager to co-operate than the <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations.</b> Both types of organisations can see benefits with co-operation, but the <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> also see costs. The main problem for the <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> is lack of resources, both economic and personnel. Many organisations have too few volunteers. Both the local authorities and the <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> see the role of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> as being a complement to the local authorities. The local authorities are only willing to compensate the <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> economically for smaller costs in an eventual co-operation. In other fields such as healthcare the role of <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> has developed from being a voice to delivering services on payment from the public sector. The integration field has not reached this point, and many <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> are critical towards such a development as they fear losing their autonomy in a too close co-operation with the local authority. The local authorities want to co-operate, but they still want to be in charge of the introduction program...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the debate on}} the future of voluntary social service following the establishment of the post-war welfare state, commonly regarded as a painful period of adjustment for <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations,</b> and argues that this debate sheds light on the later resurgence of the voluntary sector. It assesses the policy instruments available to governments in managing the voluntary sector in the 1940 s, and the influence of this regulatory framework on the institutional forms available to <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations.</b> It explores the legal and ethical distinction between endowed charities and <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> which Labour inherited from the Liberal political tradition, and how this interacted with the conceptual framework articulated by leading proponents of voluntary social service. The nature of <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> meant that traditional theories of voluntarism were often at odds with the routine maintenance of extended organisational structures, especially with the methods required to finance <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations.</b> A consensus on proposals to resolve this conflict emerged in the late 1940 s and this reflected structural changes within the voluntary sector which had given rise to a class of professional managers whose views increasingly converged with those of Labour policy makers. The proposals included the creation of autonomous funding bodies to be financed partly from the assets of defunct charitable endowments, providing financial stability for <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations,</b> satisfying the requirements of accountability without compromising the independenceo f <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations.</b> The new funding bodies were not created, but a new framework of corporate governance for <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> was implemented in the 1960 Charities Act, which brought <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> within the regulatory regime governing charitable trusts. The assimilation of voluntarism to charity ensured that the Idealism that inspired <b>voluntary</b> social service <b>organisations</b> was tied to compliance with institutional and legal forms which impaired their capacity to express social criticism...|$|R

25|$|The {{design of}} the bridge was not {{appreciated}} {{by many of the}} residents of Loxwood, because of its steel barriers, and following a period of consultation and fund-raising, planning permission was obtained to replace them with lower, brick-faced parapets, to match the adjacent lock and footbridge. The lock and footbridge achieved second place in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Community Benefit Awards in 2010. The Trust's success was particularly welcome, as it was the only entry in the category by a <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisation,</b> rather than a professional one. The scheme, which cost £1.9 million, was also the winner in the Community category of the 2011 Waterways Renaissance Awards. The Awards are made annually by the Waterways Trust.|$|E

It provides a corrective to the dominant individual-level approach by offering an organisational-level analysis of social capital. The evidence suggests that inter-organisational social capital is not distributed equitably within cities. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> that regularly engage with a city administration can build networks of trust and information flows that outstrip those available to other <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations.</b> Although it is easier to build social capital within a sector, such as the voluntary sector, building it in tight networks with <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> would appear to be an achievable goal for a city administration – but such networks do not guarantee an enhanced overall confidence in the local political system...|$|R

40|$|A {{major problem}} for <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> service {{providers}} under contract has been their independence in regard to both the relatively narrow issue of the terms and conditions of service provision, and the broader issue about the part <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> might play in policy shaping and democratic renewal.

I argue that better terms and conditions have been secured for <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> providing services, and that large and umbrella organisations now have more impact on the implementation of central government policy. However, the more equal partnership required for a policy-shaping role in the sense of agenda-setting is likely to remain elusive, while at the local level there are tensions between the idea of <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> as agents of ‘civil renewal’ and as service providers...|$|R
40|$|The {{accountability}} {{mechanisms of}} government contracts are considered less than effective {{by both the}} government officials that monitor them and the <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> that deliver on them. This paper reports on doctoral research that explored what accountability relationships <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> perceive themselves {{to be involved in}} and which relationships they prioritise. The implications of these perceptions of accountability for current mechanisms of contracting are considered. Current mechanisms are modelled on agency theory, which assumes that <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> have different goals to government agencies. Accountability mechanisms aim to control voluntary organisations’ activities to ensure they deliver what government requires. The research findings suggest that the assumed misalignment of goals does not exist, and that both government official and <b>voluntary</b> <b>organisations</b> aim to provide high-quality services and outcomes for clients. This provides an opportunity for exploring a new approach to accountability for contracts...|$|R
