5|$|Louis XIV of France {{sought to}} knock Emperor Leopold {{out of the}} war by seizing <b>Vienna,</b> the Habsburg capital, and gain a {{favourable}} peace settlement. The dangers to <b>Vienna</b> were considerable: the Elector of Bavaria and Marshal Marsin's forces in Bavaria threatened from the west, and Marshal Vendôme's large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger with a potential offensive through the Brenner Pass. <b>Vienna</b> was also under pressure from Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt from its eastern approaches. Realising the danger, the Duke of Marlborough resolved to alleviate the peril to <b>Vienna</b> by marching his forces south from Bedburg and help maintain Emperor Leopold within the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Nowotny {{was given}} a state funeral in <b>Vienna.</b> The guard of honor was {{composed}} of his friend Karl Schnörrer, Oberst Gordon Gollob, Major Rudolf Schoenert, Hauptmann Heinz Strüning, Major Josef Fözö and Major Georg Christl. The eulogy was delivered by General der Jagdflieger Adolf Galland and Generaloberst Otto Deßloch. Nowotny was buried at the Zentralfriedhof in <b>Vienna</b> in a grave of honor sponsored {{by the city of}} <b>Vienna,</b> which was still part of Nazi Germany. Following an initiative by the Austrian Green Party and debates in the <b>Vienna</b> Landtag, a resolution supported by Social Democrats and Greens was passed to remove the status of honor in 2003.|$|E

5|$|In 1882, {{scientist}} and diplomat Prince Aleksey Borisovich Lobanov-Rostovsky was appointed as the Empire's representative in <b>Vienna.</b> In 1891 he bought several houses on Reisnerstraße from Adolphe I, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, the former Duke of Nassau, which still houses the embassy and consular section in <b>Vienna,</b> {{and he also}} began construction of the Nicholas Orthodox Cathedral.|$|E

The settlers at Fort <b>Vienna</b> frequently clashed with the Shawnee who used the area as a hunting ground. The Rowans would remain at Fort <b>Vienna</b> for six years.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} how {{directly}} Offenbach influenced Johann Strauss. He had encouraged Strauss to turn to operetta when they met in <b>Vienna</b> in 1864, {{but it was not until}} seven years later that Strauss did so. However, Offenbach's operettas were well established in <b>Vienna,</b> and Strauss worked on the lines established by his French colleague; in 1870s <b>Vienna,</b> an operetta composer who did not do so was quickly called to order by the press. In Gammond's view, the Viennese composer most influenced by Offenbach was Franz von Suppé, who studied Offenbach's works carefully and wrote many successful operettas using them as a model.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{methods of}} {{producing}} lager were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the Spaten Brewery in Bavaria, and Anton Dreher, who began brewing a lager (now known as <b>Vienna</b> lager), probably of amber-red colour, in <b>Vienna</b> in 1840–1841. With improved modern yeast strains, most lager breweries use only {{short periods of}} cold storage, typically 1–3 weeks.|$|E

50|$|Many of <b>Vienna's</b> famous parks include monuments, {{such as the}} Stadtpark {{with its}} statue of Johann Strauss II, and the gardens of the baroque palace, where the State Treaty was signed. <b>Vienna's</b> {{principal}} park is the Prater which {{is home to the}} Riesenrad, a Ferris wheel, and Kugelmugel, a micronation the shape of a sphere. The imperial Schönbrunn's grounds contain an 18th-century park which includes the world's oldest zoo, founded in 1752.The Donauinsel, part of <b>Vienna's</b> flood defences, is a 21.1 km long artificial island between the Danube and Neue Donau dedicated to leisure activities.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vienna's</b> Jewish {{community}} had around 185,000 {{members at the}} time of Austria’s Anschluss with the Third Reich in 1938. In that same year, the Nazis closed the IKG down. It was reopened in May 1938 as the “Vienna Jewish Community” with the task of acting as a buffer organisation between the Nazis and <b>Vienna’s</b> Jewish population. This body was also forced to organise the emigration and later the deportation of <b>Vienna’s</b> Jews for the Central Office for Jewish Emigration. The title Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien has been in use again since 1945.|$|R

5|$|The Hotel Metropole was {{transformed}} into Gestapo headquarters in <b>Vienna</b> in April 1938. With a staff of 900 (80 percent of whom were recruited from the Austrian police), {{it was the largest}} Gestapo office outside Berlin. An estimated 50,000 people were interrogated or tortured there. The Gestapo in <b>Vienna</b> was headed by Franz Josef Huber, who also served as chief of the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in <b>Vienna.</b> Although its de facto leaders were Adolf Eichmann and later Alois Brunner, Huber was nevertheless responsible for the mass deportation of Austrian Jews.|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{processed}} products, chopped hams (0. 15 % and 0. 30 % phosphate on final yield) and <b>viennas</b> (27 and 32 % fat extension) were manufactured from ostrich fan fillets (M. iliofibularis) {{to determine the}} suitability of ostrich meat for processing purposes. Cooking losses differed significantly (P 0. 10) between {{the two types of}} ostrich <b>viennas.</b> Colour evaluation (L*,a*,b*) of the fresh ostrich meat and processed ostrich products (chopped hams and <b>viennas)</b> indicated significant differences between the different types of <b>viennas.</b> Chemical composition (moisture, ash, protein and fat content) of the ostrich meat, processed ostrich products and similar types of commercially available products suggested that processed ostrich products can be formulated to compete successfully with similar types of products derived from other meat species. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5|$|The logical {{positivism}} movement {{originated in the}} <b>Vienna</b> Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The <b>Vienna</b> Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the <b>Vienna</b> Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning, which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.|$|E
5|$|The outcome has two versions. In {{the first}} version, Nikola Jurišić {{rejected}} the offer to surrender on favourable terms, and the Ottomans retreated. In the second version, {{the city was}} offered terms for a nominal surrender. The only Ottomans who {{would be allowed to}} enter the castle would be a token force who would raise the Ottoman flag. In either case, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and returned homeward instead of continuing towards <b>Vienna</b> as previously planned. He had been delayed nearly four weeks, and during this time a powerful army had been collected in <b>Vienna,</b> which Suleiman had not the intention to face. According to historian Paolo Giovio, Charles arrived with an imperial army at <b>Vienna</b> on 23 September, too late for fighting the Ottomans since Suleiman already withdrew. By their defense of Kőszeg, Nikola Jurišić and his men had saved <b>Vienna</b> from a siege.|$|E
