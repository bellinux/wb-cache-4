5|$|Valve added Steam Guard {{functionality}} to the Steam {{client in}} March 2011 {{to protect against}} the hijacking of accounts via phishing schemes, one of the largest support issues Valve had at the time. Steam Guard was advertised {{to take advantage of the}} identity protection provided by Intel's second-generation Core processors and compatible motherboard hardware, which allows users to lock their account to a specific computer. Once locked, activity by that account on other computers must first be approved by the user on the locked computer. Support APIs for Steam Guard are available to third-party developers through Steamworks. Steam Guard also offers two-factor, risk-based authentication that uses a one-time verification code sent to a <b>verified</b> <b>email</b> address associated with the Steam account; this was later expanded to include two-factor authentication through the Steam mobile application, known as Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator. If Steam Guard is enabled, the verification code is sent each time the account is used from an unknown machine.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{educational}} and career trajectories of the alumnae of an outreach activity for girls. The outreach activity was originally developed using an integrated marketing approach to attract girls into engineering programs. 1 The program, a two day, overnight experience for rising 9 th, 10 th and 11 th grade girls, focuses on showcasing engineering as an exciting, creative activity, including activities developed from that perspective. Started in 2005 and held annually since then, a total of over 500 girls have participated, with approximately 85 % of them coming from Boise State University’s immediate metropolitan area. Facilitated by the College of Engineering, and largely staffed by volunteering women engineers from the region, the outreach event takes place in Boise, Idaho - small metropolitan city in the United States. When it originated, e-Girls was the only science and engineering outreach or camp activity focused on girls and young women in this area. The college-going rate in Idaho is very low, so there is interest in any programming that increases that rate – especially for girls in engineering. The specific topic {{of this paper is}} an investigation into what has transpired in the girls’ lives relative to their educational and career plans since participating in the program. We are interested capturing and analyzing narratives about their pathways so that we may better understand and enhance the impact of this and similar programs. These narratives will enable us to tell the story about how one program can influence such plans. Our participants are drawn from a population of 418 alumni of the program who are currently at least 18 years of age and for whom we have a <b>verified</b> <b>email</b> address. Surveys were sent to 175 past participants focusing on what other STEM related extracurricular programs they participated in, their post-secondary activities (education and career), and what impacted those choices. Additional data was gathered from two focus groups of alumnae drawn from current students at Boise State University (n = 5). The qualitative methods used contribute to an evaluative analysis of paths taken and not taken by the program’s alumni. Implications for program design and follow up activities are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Data are {{essential}} to every decision support system and as more systems become capable of automated decision making, data quality is critical. Data are of good quality if conformant to some standard (verified) and of some semantic meaning (valid). While verification is predominant, validation is not often used because of its complexity. By presenting why a full Verification & Validation (V&V) process is suitable for data quality improvement and by applying this concept to email address quality assurance, it will be demonstrated that email deliverability of Customer Relationship Management or Email Marketing systems can be significantly improved. Standard email address verification techniques based on regular expression are extended by complex verification techniques that <b>verify</b> all <b>email</b> address parts in multiple steps. Validation techniques are extended by a Support Vector Machine classification of bounce failures, and an n-gram based classification of email address local-part.

However, even the confirmation emails contribute to the attack. A better defense would prevent Web sites from being exploited without abandoning subscription forms. After a subscription form is filled out, the Web site would dynamically create a mailto link to itself. A legitimate user would then {{send a message to}} validate the request without receiving any email from the Web site. While the sender's email could be spoofed, the sender's SMTP IP address cannot.

The result is a higher quality collection of public keys, and each key has been vetted by email with the keys apparent owner.

The receiver can, at negligible computational cost, verify that the stamp is valid.

40|$|While microblogging {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} information sharing and communication platform, it has also become a convenient venue for spammers to overwhelm other users with unwanted content. Currently, spammer detection in microblogging focuses on using social networking information, but little on content analysis due to the distinct nature of microblogging messages. First, label information is hard to obtain. Second, the texts in microblogging are short and noisy. As we know, spammer detection has been extensively studied for years in various media, e. g., emails, SMS and the web. Motivated by abundant resources available in the other media, we investigate whether we {{can take advantage of}} the existing resources for spammer detection in microblogging. While people accept that texts in microblogging are different from those in other media, there is no quantitative analysis to show how different they are. In this paper, we first perform a comprehensive linguistic study to compare spam across different media. Inspired by the findings, we present an optimization formulation that enables the design of spammer detection in microblogging using knowledge from external media.

40|$|Introduction: Currently in Australia, midwifery {{education}} programs {{have their own}} clinical assessment tools to evaluate students’ clinical performance. Assessment processes are required to ascertain that graduates meet the requisite professional competency standards. A common validated assessment tool can contribute to national consistency in midwifery graduate standards. Aim: This project aimed to enhance assessment through developing and validating a standard tool to assess midwifery student performance in workplace-based settings. Methods: An iterative process with 24 midwives across four universities was used to develop and refine the tool and behavioural cues. Four workshops where held with the refinement process from each iteration <b>verified</b> through <b>email.</b> The refinement process ensured that the language in the tool was relevant and meaningful to clinicians working with students, {{as well as for}} academics. Midwives who assess students in clinical practice scored student performance with the new AMSAT tool alongside existing tools. Feedback {{in the form of a}} brief survey explored whether the assessor found the AMSAT tool user-friendly. A total of 159 assessments were undertaken across the five universities. Results: Principal factor analysis extracted one factor, the competency of midwifery students, which accounted for the 73. 9 % of variance. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value was 0. 904 and the Bartlett’s test of sphericity was statistically significant (p < 0. 000) which indicate the appropriateness of the selected analysing method. The Scree plot, Monte Carlo simulation and exploratory factor analysis using Mplus program all demonstrated one factor. The AMSAT instrument (with 24 items) revealed to be reliable with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0. 987. The calculated Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for each of 4 domains also demonstrated a high internal consistency. The mean of AMSAT scores for second year students was higher than the first years, but did not reach significant signifi- cance, (p < 0. 106). The mean of AMSAT scores of third year students was significantly higher from both first and second years (p < 000 and p < 008), respectively. Conclusion and implications: By fulfilling requirements of reliability, validity, educational effect, acceptability and feasibility this tool will serve as a robust instrument to demonstrate student achievement, to meet professional competency and educational quality frameworks...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MIng (Computer and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. In 2011 South Africa's main {{electricity}} supplier, Eskom, {{experienced a}} peak electricity demand of 89 % {{of their total}} installed generation capacity. The high utilisation rate {{makes it difficult to}} perform essential maintenance on the system. Eskom implements Demand-Side Management (DSM) projects in various industries, {{in order to reduce the}} demand and to ensure sustainable electricity supply. The mining sector consumes 14. 5 % of the total amount of electricity generated by Eskom. Mine compressed air systems can consume as much as 40 % of a mine's total electricity requirements. This makes mine compressed air systems an ideal target for DSM. Electricity load seems to be reduced, but many DSM savings are not sustained throughout the project lifetime. An existing project feedback method of a specific Energy Services Company (ESCo) includes the manual collection of data from the mines and manual generation of reports. These reports show energy savings of the DSM projects to help the ESCo and their clients to improve and sustain the performance of the projects. A great amount of man-hours is used which results in large time delays in the feedback-loop. In order to address this, the need for a new automatic feedback reporting system was identified. This study mainly focusses on the development and implementation of a new method to monitor DSM savings on mine compressed air systems. It includes the reliable collection of data from mines, processing and storing of the data in a central database and generating savings reports. This is done automatically on a daily basis. In order to complete the feedback-loop, the reports are <b>verified</b> and <b>emailed</b> to clients and ESCo personnel on a daily basis. The new reporting system is implemented at a number of mines. Four of these project implementations are used as case studies to measure and interpret the effectiveness and value of this system. It saves a significant amount of man-hours and proves to be of great value in the sustainability of DSM project savings. Both Eskom and mining companies benefit from the efficient monitoring of mine compressed air savings. Master...|$|R
40|$|Phishing {{is a kind}} {{of modern}} swindles that targets {{electronic}} communications users and aims to persuade them to perform actions for a another’s benefit. Miscreants performing this activity are named phishers and employ their power of persuasion to tailor socially engineered messages able to deceive their gullible victims. A popular example of phishing activities is the stealing of web services account login information or credit card information using fake websites or spoofed emails. However, several means are used to perform phishing attacks and several goals are sought, which harden the fight against phishing. Despite the forces engaged {{to get rid of this}} threat, phishing remains a concerning problem since the financial damage it causes is increasing overtime. Moreover, the perceived fatality about being a victim of phishing erodes the trust among users and threaten the use of electronic means as way of communicating. Existing solutions to cope with phishing attacks are not adapted to their short lifetime and the variety of means used to perform them, making them inefficient. Crowd <b>verified</b> blacklists, <b>emails</b> content analysis techniques or web page content analysis techniques did not succeed to reverse the increasing trend presented by phishing consequences. None of these solutions present the essential requirements that must meet a phishing protection technique to be efficient and which are speed, coverage, reliability and usability. Stating that phishing attacks rely mostly on social engineering and that most phishing vectors leverage directing links represented by domain names and URLs, we introduce new solutions to cope with phishing. These solutions rely on the lexical and semantic analysis of the composition of domain names and URLs. Both of these resource pointers are created and obfuscated by phishers to trap their victims. Hence, we demonstrate in this document that phishing do- main names and URLs present similarities in their lexical and semantic composition that are different form legitimate domain names and URLs composition. We use this characteristic to build models representing the composition of phishing URLs and domain names using machine learning techniques and natural language processing models. The built models are used for several applications such as the identification of phishing domain names and phishing URLs, the rating of phishing URLs and the prediction of domain names used in phishing attacks. All the introduced techniques are assessed on ground truth data and show their efficiency by meeting speed, coverage and reliability requirements. This document shows that the use of lexical and semantic analysis can be applied to domain names and URLs and that this application is relevant to detect phishing attacks...|$|R
