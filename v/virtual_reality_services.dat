40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a unified approach to virtual reality platform and treat this domain {{as a whole}} whereas the cognitive, psychological and physical aspects of helping people are all encompassed within a single solution, called Cyber Care Clinique (CCC). The underlying idea {{is to create a}} single hospital unit with <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> <b>services</b> to which different departments can subscribe their patients to and therefore maximize the utilization of the system. In this model, the flexibility and ease of reconfigurability of the VR solution as well as the virtual environments themselves play a critical role. Therefore we created a unique platform to serve the needs of multiple health-care units and allow for the treatment {{of a large number of}} patients. The paper describes in detail the technical aspects of our solution as well as clinical application areas we successfully implemented and evaluated during the past years.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} Quality of Service (QoS) signaling for complex multimedia services {{in the next generation}} network (NGN), from establishing necessary QoS support at session setup, to further QoS modifications in response to dynamic changes during the session. The model aims to maximize user perceived quality, while taking into account constraints imposed by the user, network, and service itself. While the model is independent of the particular service and network scenario, we take a Networked <b>Virtual</b> <b>Reality</b> (NVR) <b>service</b> as a fairly good representative of intricate media-rich services in the NGN. We further propose a mapping onto the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), as the most prominent NGN-driven part of the current Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) architecture; and identify its possible functional enhancements for supporting services such as NVR. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network {{represents}} an intermediary step between GSM and 3 G mobile systems, providing {{a solution for}} IP communication between mobile systems and Internet hosts. With packet switching capabilities and {{a significant increase in}} data rates comes the potential of accessing advanced Internet services using a mobile terminal.

This paper examines the capability of currently available GPRS network resources in supporting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of NVR services. Measurements of selected QoS parameters have been performed using three different NVR applications, while setting different QoS parameters defined in the Home Location Register (HLR). Results are analyzed to determine the feasibility of deploying NVR services over GPRS networks...|$|R

By user mobility we here mean a user who communicates over a wireless interface and that the system supports handover as the user roams to new cells. Another trend in today's communication systems is the demand for real-time services to be provided over the Internet. In addition to the services like electronic mail (pop), file transfer (ftp) and information retrieval (www), users are likely {{to make use of}} <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> (VR) <b>services</b> and applications including real-time audio and video streams.

40|$|Abstract. The {{synchronization}} {{of continuous}} media {{is a key}} issue {{in the development of}} distributed systems, such as videoconference and <b>virtual</b> <b>reality.</b> These <b>services</b> must be carried out in a synchronized manner with different media types, like continuous and discrete media. Due to the unreliable and asynchronous nature of networks, some problems can disrupt the synchronization. Such problems can include lost messages and delay jitter. In this paper, we aim to solve the synchronization problem of real-time continuous media in unreliable networks. The detection and recovery of lost messages is achieved by the technique of forward error detection in a distributed form, which implies avoiding retransmission. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to propose a forward error recovery technique for the synchronization of continuous media with causality control. The mechanism is based on our temporal model that determines logical dependencies between intervals (continuous media) to represent the basic temporal relations defined by Allen. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} an adaptive <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> (VR) <b>service.</b> The service adaptation, as described by the model, is performed by matching the parameters of – and possibly transcoding – the VR service {{in order to achieve}} the “best possible quality”, given the limitations of the terminal and access network, and taking into account individual user preferences. The matching process is based on two sets of parameters, called “profiles”: the VR service profile, which describes the VR service, and the client capabilities and preferences profile, which describes the client. Both profiles use Extensible Markup Language for notation, and are thus in line with the existing W 3 C standards. The model is independent of the particular VR service and network scenario, and it is suitable for heterogeneous environments such as the Internet and 3 G wireless networks. A case study involving two prototype VR services demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>reality</b> offers new {{possibilities}} and new challenges {{for teaching and}} learning. For students in elementary mathematics, {{it has been suggested}} that <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> offers new ways of representing numeracy concepts in the form of <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> manipulatives. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate the effectiveness of using desktop <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> as a cognitive tool to enhance the conceptual understanding of numeracy concepts by elementary school children, specifically addition and subtraction. This research investigated the technical and educational aspects of <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> manipulatives for children beginning to learn numeracy by implementing a prototype mathematical virtual learning environment (MAVLE) application and exploring its educational effectiveness. This research provides three main contributions. First, the proposed design framework for the <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> model for cognitive learning. This framework provides an initial structure that can be further refined or revised to generate a robust design model for <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> learning environments. Second, the prototyping and implementation of a practical <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> manipulatives application ‘MAVLE’ for facilitating the teaching and learning processes of numeracy concepts (integer addition and subtraction) was proposed. Third, the evaluation of conceptual understanding of students’ achievements and the relationships among the navigational behaviours for the desktop <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> were examined, and their impacts on students’ learning experiences were noted. The successful development of the <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> manipulatives provides further confirmation for the high potential of <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> technology for instructional use. In short, the outcomes of this work express the feasibility and appropriateness of how <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> manipulatives are used in classrooms to support students’ conceptual understanding of numeracy concepts. <b>Virtual</b> <b>reality</b> manipulatives may be the most appropriate mathematics tools for the next generation.
