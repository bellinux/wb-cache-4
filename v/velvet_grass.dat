Velvet bent has recently had a resurgence in the UK due to the high demands on greens from inclement weather and speed expectations. This species also has a lighter color than the two previous species.|$|R

60|$|The {{old and the}} new kiss {{each other}} {{constantly}} in England, and I perceived that this vividly modern possessor of the most perfect Tudor house existing was, with the intense actuality of his interests and ambitions, as English as the most feudal presence in the kingdom. When we {{came out of the house}} and walked towards the group we had left under a spreading oak (or it might have been an elm; the two are much of the same habit in England) on the long, wide lawn, one might have fancied one's self in any most picturesque period of the past, if it had not been for the informality of the men's dress. Women are always of the past in the beauty of their attire, and those whom the low sun, striking across the <b>velvet</b> of the <b>grass,</b> now lighted up in their pretty gowns of our day, could easily have stepped out of an old picture, or continued in it as they sat in their wicker chairs around the afternoon tea-table.|$|R
60|$|The {{gardens of}} the Great House of Allington {{and those of}} the Small House open on to each other. A proper {{boundary}} of thick laurel hedge, and wide ditch, and of iron spikes guarding the ditch, there is between them; but over the wide ditch there is a foot-bridge, and at the bridge there is a gate which has no key; and for all purposes of enjoyment the gardens of each house are open to the other. And the gardens of the Small House are very pretty. The Small House itself is so near the road that there is nothing between the dining-room windows and the iron rail but a narrow edge rather than border, and a little path made with round fixed cobble stones, not above two feet broad, into which no one but the gardener ever makes his way. The distance from the road to the house is not above five or six feet, and the entrance from the gate is shut in by a covered way. But the garden behind the house, on to which the windows from the drawing-room open, is to all the senses as private as though there were no village of Allington, and no road up to the church within a hundred yards of the lawn. The steeple of the church, indeed, {{can be seen from the}} lawn, peering, as it were, between the yew-trees which stand in the corner of the churchyard adjoining to Mrs Dale's wall. But none of the Dale family have any objection to the sight of that steeple. The glory of the Small House at Allington certainly consists in its lawn, which is as smooth, as level, and as much like <b>velvet</b> as <b>grass</b> has ever yet been made to look. Lily Dale, taking pride in her own lawn, has declared often that it is no good attempting to play croquet up at the Great House. The grass, she says, grows in tufts, and nothing that Hopkins, the gardener, can or will do has any effect upon the tufts. But there are no tufts at the Small House. As the squire himself has never been very enthusiastic about croquet, the croquet implements have been moved permanently down to the Small House, and croquet there has become quite an institution.|$|R
60|$|They {{were sitting}} {{about the little}} table on the lawn when an {{opportunity}} was made for her, and the scene long remained impressed on Nettie’s memory. The old house showed cool and gray between its wrappings of creepers that were flecked with saffron now, while {{here and there a}} tendril gleamed warm crimson against the stone. Its long shadow lay black upon the <b>velvet</b> <b>grass,</b> and there were ruddy gleams from the woodlands from which the yellow light was fading beyond the moss‐crusted wall. Still, the river shone dazzlingly where it came rippling out of the gloom of a copse, and a long row of windows blinked in the building beside its bank.|$|E
60|$|THE cool shadows were {{creeping}} {{across the}} <b>velvet</b> <b>grass</b> next afternoon when Nettie Harding lay languidly content in a canvas {{chair on the}} Low Wood lawn. Behind her rose a long, low, red‐roofed dwelling, whose gray walls showed only here and there through their green mantle of creeper, but in front, beyond the moss‐covered terrace wall, wheatfield, coppice, and meadow flooded with golden sunlight melted through gradations of color into the blue distance. It was very hot, and the musical tinkle of a mower that rose from the valley emphasized the drowsy stillness. Opposite her, {{on the other side}} of the little table whereon stood dainty china and brass kettle, sat her hostess’s daughter, Hester Earle, and she smiled a little as she glanced at Nettie.|$|E
6000|$|One little {{incident}} occurred upon the road. As we were passing by a quaint old mansion, which stood {{back from the}} road, surrounded by a deep court, Mr. S. said to me, [...] "There is a friend here {{who would like to}} see thee, if thou hast no objections," [...] and went on to inform me that she was an aged woman, who had taken a deep interest in the abolition of slavery since the time of its first inception under Clarkson and Wilberforce, though now lying very low on a sick bed. Of course we all expressed our willingness to stop, and the carriage was soon driving up the gravelled walk towards the house. We were ushered into a comfortable sitting room, which looked out on beautiful grounds, where the <b>velvet</b> <b>grass,</b> tall, dark trees, and a certain quaint air of antiquity in disposition and arrangement, gave me a singular kind of pleasure; the more so, that it came to me like a dream; that the house and the people were unknown to me, and the whole affair entirely unexpected.|$|E
60|$|These {{gardens of}} New College are indescribably beautiful,--not gardens in an American sense, but lawns {{of the richest}} green and softest <b>velvet</b> <b>grass,</b> shadowed over by ancient trees, that have lived a quiet life here for centuries, and have been nursed and tended with such care, and so {{sheltered}} from rude winds, that certainly {{they must have been}} the happiest of all trees. Such a sweet, quiet, sacred, stately seclusion-- so age-long as this has been, and, I hope, will continue to be--cannot exist anywhere else. One side of the garden wall is formed by the ancient wall of the city, which Cromwell's artillery battered, and which still retains its pristine height and strength. At intervals, there are round towers that formed the bastions; that is to say, on the exterior they are round towers, but within, in the garden of the College, they are semicircular recesses, with iron garden-seats arranged round them. The loop-holes through which the archers and musketeers used to shoot still pierce through deep recesses in the wall, which is here about six feet thick. I wish I could put into one sentence the whole impression of this garden, but it could not be done in many pages.|$|E
60|$|He was {{apparently}} asleep in five minutes, but Appleby lay motionless {{in his chair}} with every sense alert. The laughter and hum of voices had died away, and only an occasional hoarse shouting rose from the town. His {{eyes were fixed on}} the patio, and his hands, which were hard and brown, clenched on the rifle; but his thoughts were far away in a garden where the red beech leaves strewed the <b>velvet</b> <b>grass</b> in peaceful England, and it was not Nettie Harding’s blue eyes, but Violet Wayne’s calm gray ones that seemed to look into his. Harper’s words by the camp fire were bearing fruit, and he was ready to admit now that it was a woman who had sent him there. There was also satisfaction in the thought that he was serving her, which was the most he could look for, since his part was to give and not expect, but he felt that she would approve of what he was doing then. So the time slipped by; while Nettie Harding, still sitting behind the lattice, now and then raised her head and looked at him. His attitude betokened his watchfulness, and with a little sigh of relief she sank back into her chair again. That ragged figure with the grim, brown face seemed an adequate barrier between her and whatever could threaten her.|$|E
60|$|He did not {{remember}} falling asleep, but by and by the sombre wall of coniferous forest that shut the hollow in seemed to dwindle to the likeness of a trim yew hedge, and the river now slid by smooth and placidly. There was also <b>velvet</b> <b>grass</b> beneath his feet in place of wheel-rutted gravel and brown fir needles. Still, the scene he gazed upon was known to him, though it seemed incomplete until a girl with brown eyes in a long white dress and big white hat appeared at his side. She fitted the surroundings wonderfully, for her almost stately serenity harmonized with the quietness and order of the still English valley, but yet he was puzzled, for there was sunlight on the water, and {{he felt that the}} moon should be shining round and full above her shoulder. Then when he would have spoken the picture faded, and he became suddenly conscious that his pipe had fallen from his hand, and that he was dressed in soil-stained jean which seemed quite out of keeping with the English lawn. That was his first impression, but while he wondered vaguely how he came to have a pipe made out of a corn-cob, which cost him about thirty cents, at all, a rattle of displaced gravel and pounding of hoofs became audible, and he recognized that something unusual was going on.|$|E

40|$|Since {{being built}} in 1990, the {{rhizotron}} facility in Wageningen, the Wageningen Rhizolab, {{has been used for}} experiments on crops (e. g. Alfalfa, Brussels sprouts, common <b>velvet</b> <b>grass,</b> field bean, fodder radish, leeks, lupins, maize, potato, beetroot, ryegrass, spinach, spring wheat, winter rye and winter wheat). In the experiments, horizontal glass minirhizotron tubes combined with auger sampling were used to assess rooting characteristics. For this paper we took the root data from these experiments and looked for a general relationship between thermal time/time after planting and rooting depth, the velocity of the root front and root proliferation. For certain depths (fixed by the depth at which the horizontal minirhizotrons were installed) a simple linear regression was established between the average root number per cm 2 minirhizotron surface area and thermal time after planting. The compartments selected for each crop were those in which there had been a control treatment and/or in which conditions for rooting were considered to be optimal. We performed regression analyses per compartment and per depth, but only for the period after planting in which a linear increase of root numbers vs. thermal time was observed. After averaging the results, the regression procedure yielded two parameters of rooting for each crop: (a) the actual or thermal time at which the first root appeared at a certain depth and (b) the root proliferation rate after the first root had appeared. In this way, inherent crop differences in rooting behaviour (rooting depth and root proliferation) became apparent. For each crop, the velocity of the root front after planting could be established (calculated in cm(°C day) - 1). This parameter differed greatly between crops. Some crops (such as leeks and common <b>velvet</b> <b>grass)</b> explored the soil profile slowly: the root front moved at a velocity of only 0. 07 cm(°C day) - 1. Among the crops whose roots grew down much faster (0. 18 - 0. 26 cm (°C day) - 1) were cereals and fodder radish. For a day with an average temperature of 15 °C these rates would have corresponded with the root front travelling approximately 1 - 4 cm per day. In the crops studied the root front velocity did not correlate with the root proliferation rat...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Improper {{management}} of rangelands can cause land degradation {{and reduce the}} economic efficiency of livestock activity. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate soil properties and quantify plant biomass production in four natural rangeland management systems in the Santa Catarina Plateau (Planalto Catarinense) of Brazil. The treatments, which included mowed natural rangeland (NR), burned natural rangeland (BR), natural rangeland improved through the introduction of plant species after harrowing (IH), and natural rangeland improved through the introduction of plant species after chisel plowing (IC), were evaluated in a Nitossolo Bruno (Nitisol). In the improved treatments, soil acidity was corrected, phosphate fertilizer was applied, and intercropped annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), <b>velvet</b> <b>grass</b> (Holcus lanatus), and white clover (Trifolium repens) were sown. Management systems with harrowed or chisel plowed soil showed improved soil physical properties; however, the effect decreased over time and values approached those of burned and mowed natural rangelands. Natural rangeland systems in the establishment phase had little influence on soil organic C. The mowed natural rangeland and improved natural rangeland exhibited greater production of grazing material, while burning the field decreased production and increased the proportion of weeds. Improvement of the natural rangelands increased leguminous biomass for pasture...|$|E
40|$|Keynote speechOrganizer: Hong Kong Institute of SurveyorsAs an {{exceptionally}} compact city, Hong Kong attempts {{to adopt the}} sustainable development mode. Urban greening offers a feasible way to attain environmental sustainability. With seven million population concentrated largely in 200 km 2 of land, the urban public open space provision at merely 3 m 2 /person is usually low. High-rise buildings with barren flat rooftops and facades are seldom employed to introduce nature into the vertical dimension. Numerous hardly serve any useful purpose. Besides providing outdoor amenity and recreational spaces, green roofs can bring significant cooling and amelioration ofth e urban heat island effect especially for the tropical city. The scientific aspects of establishment and the environmental benefits need to be ascertained {{in the context of}} the humid-tropical regime. An extensive green roof was retrofitted on a four-storey building at the University of Hong Kong in 2006, denoting the first research green roof in the city. It covers 240 m 2 of four plots planted respectively with turfgrass (Zoysia tenuifolia, Korean <b>Velvet</b> <b>Grass),</b> groundcover vine (Arachis pintoi, Perennial Peanut) and shrub (Duranta repens, Golden Dewdrops), plus a barren control plot.

Significant reduction in surface and below green roof temperatures and energy conservation were recorded, with about 15 °C drop at summer midday for turfgrass and groundcover, and more so for shrub. Top floor indoor temperature was reduced by about 2 °C under the vegetated plots.

40|$|General Description: Perennial herb with a stout taproot {{and short}} woodstock, stems 16 to 40 inches tall, glabrous to hirsute with short appressed simple hairs; racemes spikelike but {{elongate}} and open, many-flowered, the pedicels usually about 1 / 8 inch long; calyx 1 / 8 to 1 / 4 inch long, usually purplish-tinged, subglabrous to fairly thickly pubescent with tiny stellae; petals 1 / 4 to 5 / 8 inch long, pinkish-lavender. Identification Tips: S. hendersonii and S. hirtipes both occur {{within the range}} of S. nelsoniana. The calyx of S. nelsoniana is shorter and much less pubescent, the petals are shorter and the stem is much less hirsute than those of S. hirtipes (see general description for dimensions of calyx and petals of S. nelsoniana). S. hendersonii occurs only on tideflats; S. nelsoniana and S. hirtipes do not. Phenology: Flowering can occur as early as mid-May and extend into September, depending on weather and site conditions. Fruits have been observed as early as mid-June and as late as mid-October. Range: Regional endemic; southern Benton County, Oregon, north to Lewis County, Washington, and from central Linn County, Oregon, west to just west of the crest of the Coast Range. In WA it occurs in the Olympic Peninsula and Southwest Washington physiographic province. Habitat: The range of the species is all within the Western Hemlock Zone of Franklin and Dyrness 1973. It occurs along streams and in meadows and other relatively open areas, such as roadsides. It is generally found in areas where prairie or grassland remnants persist, such as along fencerows, drainage swales, and at the edges of plowed fields adjacent to wooded areas. Standing water is present at some sites. Associated species of the known populations include mainly weedy species such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), common <b>velvet</b> <b>grass</b> (Holcus lanatus), common rush (Juncus effusus), oxeye daisy (Chrysanthemum leucanthemum), sweet vernal gras...|$|E
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. Prior to their eradication in 1987, feral pigs (Sus scrofa) were a common source of ground disturbance in the mountain parkland ecosystem of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, especially in grasslands. In 1985 - 1986, 27, 2 x 5 m plots were established in 9 open, grassy sites recently damaged by pigs. No pig digging occurred after the plots were initially established. The purpose of monitoring vegetation changes was to evaluate the efficacy of pig control in promoting community recovery and to detect any changes that might need further management intervention. Percent cover of plants was determined by point-intercept methods, and woody plants were counted in height classes in 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989, and 1992. The 27 plots were stratified into 5 plant communities based on a Braun-Blanquet analysis of surrounding vegetation, and successional changes were graphed. Deschampsia nubigena, a native bunchgrass, consistently increased in cover in most communities where it was originally a dominant or codominant species in surrounding vegetation. It did not increase in cover where it was initially a minor component. These trends suggest that Deschampsia will continue to increase in importance. <b>Velvet</b> <b>grass</b> (Holcus lanatus), the main competitor with Deschampsia in mid and upper elevation sites, recovered rapidly at first but generally declined from its maximum cover after 2 - 4 years. However, Holcus cover may be stable at upper elevation sites where it was dominant prior to disturbance. In lower and mid elevation sites, Holcus species may continue to decline in importance, while other alien grass species, e. g., sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum ordoratum) and beardgrass (Schizachyrium condensatum), show signs of becoming more abundant. There was some recruitment of native shrubs in the disturbed areas, especially at lower elevations. Koa (Acacia koa), a root-sprouting, clonal tree in the study area, invaded many sites. The continued expansion of koa colonies may, at least locally, be more ecologically important than competition between Deschampsia and alien grasses.
