40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{economic}} analysis of accident law {{is used to}} examine the liability for nuclear accidents. It is argued that the classic system of individual liability of a nuclear power plant operator with a financial cap on compensation a d individual insurance by national pools is not effective. The current system leads to a too low compensation for victims and lacks an adequate internalization f the nuclear isk. Hence, it is argued that the economic analysis of law can provide useful insights for the revision of the Paris and <b>Vienna</b> <b>Conventions</b> on the liability for nuclear accidents. It is also argued that higher amounts of compensation can be generated only if the idea is accepted that all plants share the costs of an accident wherever it occurs. This could be realized through a mutual pooling system. Such a system could also be fitted into the revision of the Paris and <b>Vienna</b> <b>Conventions.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} aims to {{show that}} the dominance of formalism in treaty law is much more nuanced and qualified than the general perception sketched out in the preceding paragraph suggests. It will be argued that from its making to its termination, a treaty see-saws between formalism and flexibility, and that the body of rules designed by international lawyers to regulate the life of treaties mirrors this constant oscillation: the law of treaties, as codified in the two <b>Vienna</b> <b>Conventions,</b> displays both formal rationality and flexibility. This chapter aims to shed some light on the various, and disparate, features of this fundamental tension. It is more specifically submitted here that the oscillation between formal rationality and flexibility comes to a head at three different levels: at the moment of the creation of the treaty, at the moment of its validation and identification as a treaty properly so-called and, finally, at the moment of its application, that is when the provisions of a treaty are confronted with the facts and accordingly need to be interpreted. At each of these stages, the tension between formal structures and flexibility is solved according to a different equilibrium. The different balances struck are themselves unstable and {{in a constant state of}} flux, for they are treaty-dependent and have not been definitively concretized by the rules of the <b>Vienna</b> <b>Conventions.</b> It is true that the constant oscillation between formalism and flexibility also infuses the rules on suspension and termination. However, as suspension and termination form the subject of a separate contribution, the ‘un-making’ of treaties will be addressed only briefly...|$|R

40|$|Can peace {{agreements}} concluded {{between a}} State and a non-State entity produce legal {{effects in the}} international sphere, as mentioned in Article 3 of the <b>Vienna</b> <b>Conventions</b> on the Law of Treaties?

40|$|The <b>Vienna</b> Sales <b>Convention</b> (1980) follows {{in large}} measure the American Uniform Commercial Code: Article 2 on Sales.

This paper answers this {{question}} in the negative, and argues instead that the United States' economic leverage with other countries is the key factor influencing developments pertaining to private law on a global level. We explain why it may be useful to harmonize rules of private law on a global level and which rules should be chosen for a uniform law. We show that the choice between two legal arrangements may lead to a coordination problem. Next we argue that the coordination problem is solved in favor of the jurisdiction whose economy is less dependent upon the economies of other jurisdictions than the other way around. We use our model to discuss the harmonization of sales law on a global level in the twentieth century. Unification Harmonization Private law Economic interdependencies Game theory...|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, the Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978 ( [...] et seq.) {{follows the}} {{principles}} {{introduced by the}} <b>Vienna</b> <b>Conventions.</b> The United States tends to be generous when granting diplomatic immunity to visiting diplomats, because {{a large number of}} U.S. diplomats work in host countries less protective of individual rights. If the United States were to punish a visiting diplomat without sufficient grounds, U.S. representatives in other countries could receive harsher treatment. If a person with immunity is alleged to have committed a crime or faces a civil lawsuit, the State Department asks the home country to waive immunity of the alleged offender so that the complaint can be moved to the courts. If immunity is not waived, prosecution cannot be undertaken. However, the State Department still has the right to expel the diplomat. In many such cases, the diplomat's visas are canceled, and he and his family may be barred from returning to the United States. Crimes committed by members of a diplomat's family can also result in dismissal.|$|R
