Two years later, England U20 drew 2–2 with Netherlands U20, with former Burnley midfielder Richard Chaplow captaining the England side. On 25 May 2007, Turf Moor hosted a friendly international between England B and Albania. Although {{the game was}} not officially recognised as a full international, a number of England first-team players played in the game. In October 2007, a Barco <b>video</b> <b>wall</b> was installed in the Cricket Field End, {{which at the time}} accommodated visiting supporters. At the start of the 2009–10 season, a new PA system was installed and the big screen was moved to allow home fans to sit in the Cricket Field Stand for the club's inaugural season in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Various {{technological}} and aesthetic {{changes have been}} made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount {{on one side and the}} clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection <b>video</b> <b>wall,</b> which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.|$|E
5|$|Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow {{throughout}} October and November {{with such}} pranks as throwing water and confetti {{on him and}} dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire across the aisle during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the <b>video</b> <b>wall</b> {{that was part of}} the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks talking and laughing at the same time.|$|E

500|$|During {{construction}} {{the underground}} parking garage remained open. An additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs, while accommodating {{two levels of}} underground parking underneath.

This design allows {{for the removal of}} individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display. The filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning.

2500|$|The first live {{performance}} of the song was made at the premiere of the artist's Politia Live Clubbing concert series in Thessaloniki on 14 May. For the {{live performance}} of the song it is played with smoke and bright green and pink lights in the background as Rouvas sings {{standing in front of}} a microphone stand while playing his black Gibson Les Paul. Rouvas was also short-listed as a performer at the MAD Video Music Awards 2010, where he led the nominations for a solo artist with six, and performed a similar routine as the third act of the night. For the performance, all of the lights in the stadium were dimmed to bring lights from the cellular phones of audience members into prominence, while an animation of the new [...] "Sakis" [...] logo, also exhibited on the single cover, ran on the black <b>video</b> <b>wall</b> as Rouvas appeared on stage wearing tight black pants, unlaced boots, and a torn black T-shirt designed by Dimitris Kaïdantzis, while playing an excerpt of an unrelated guitar riff as he walked to his platform on the side of the stage. The music subsequently began with Rouvas singing in front of a stand and playing guitar simultaneously, while below him a grid exuded gold lighting and smoke and behind him an outtake of the then-unreleased music video, featuring a close-up of Rouvas singing in front of a black background, as well as additional imagery, was played on the <b>video</b> <b>wall.</b> In the final chorus, the platform raised Rouvas several feet in the air above the audience, while confetti was distributed all over the stadium. The performance was reviewed favourably, with MAD TV deeming it [...] "explosive," [...] while it was [...] "unique" [...] to the awards' standard, where upbeat, choreographed performances are usually favoured by artists. While most negative criticism of the performance centred on the selection of the song itself being wrong for the event, especially as Rouvas is known for his elebarate stage shows and choreography, the innovative camera work and stage presentation was widely acclaimed, with Madata calling it an [...] "impressive extreme." [...] The song will also be part of Rouvas' set list on his forthcoming tour following Politeia.|$|E
