This condition leads to mediastinitis. Mediastinitis is a serious condition which increases morbidity, mortality and hospital costs. The correct time for surgical treatment is contraversial in cases who have sternal dehiscence and discharge due to superficial infection. In this study, patients received sternal stabilization as soon as a diagnosis was made and monitored for the development of mediastinitis. Methods: Among the 1440 patients who had undergone elective CABG, a total of 85 patients who developed sternal dehiscence and superficial wound discharge were included in this study. These patients were re-operated on as soon as diagnosed and early sternal stabilization was provided. Results: The ratio of overall dehiscence was 5. 9 %.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{renormalization}} prescription for the quark-meson model in an extended mean-field approximation, where vacuum quark fluctuations are included. At a given cutoff scale the model parameters are fixed by fitting <b>vacuum</b> <b>quantities,</b> typically including the sigma-meson mass m_σ and the pion decay constant f_π. In most publications {{the latter is}} identified with the expectation value of the sigma field, while for m_σ the curvature mass is taken.

In the present article we investigate {{the influence of the}} parameter-fixing scheme on the phase structure of the model at finite temperature and chemical potential. Despite large differences between the model parameters in the two schemes, we find that in homogeneous matter the effect on the phase diagram is relatively small. For inhomogeneous phases, on the other hand, the choice of the proper renormalization prescription is crucial. In particular, we show that if renormalization effects on the pion decay constant are not considered, the model does not even present a well-defined renormalized limit when the cutoff is sent to infinity.

While VAC {{is a common}} packing method and 100 % CO 2 MAP is used in some countries, there is little information about how these different techniques affect the growth of spoilage bacteria and sensory attributes of lamb. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess changes in microbiological and organoleptic properties, and determine differences in microbial communities by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) and 454 pyrosequencing, in bone-in (BI) and bone-out (BO) MAP- and VAC-packed lamb shoulders stored at - 0. 3 °C over 12 wk. VAC and MAP lamb shoulders were acceptable in sensory test scores over 12 wk of storage at - 0. 3 °C, despite total viable count (TVC) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) levels increasing to 8 log 10 CFU/cm(2) for VAC lamb and 4 - 6 log 10 CFU/cm(2) for MAP lamb. Similar to the sensory results, there were no significant differences in microbial communities between BI and BO product. However, types of bacteria were different between VAC and MAP packaging.

This work bridges the gap in the cluster beam literature between small, few atom clusters and the production of large MoS_ 2 fullerenes and monolayers. It has been found that MoS_ 2 clusters display a characteristic layered structure down to the smallest studied cluster, 50 units of MoS_ 2. Growth of clusters is indicative of anisotropic growth from the reactive edge sites, proceeds by subsequent addition of van der Waals bound layers and finally coalescence of smaller units in the case of large clusters.

Methods: Twelve patients with DSWI out of 840 median sternotomy procedures for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement, valve repair, adult congenital heart disease and mediastinal tumors which needed median sternotomy were collected; Radical debridement of the wounds was performed; sterile foam with drain was placed in the wound which was covered with sterile OPSITE dressing; the drain being connected to a suction unit maintaining − 100  mmHg pressure except wounds in which the cardiac surface directly touches the device we used minimum low negative pressure of − 50  mmHg because of the fear of hemorrhage and impairment of cardiac function. Follow up for 3 – 6 months after vacuum therapy was done to detect any morbidity or recurrence. Results: Patients with DSWI in our study were managed with this therapy. They were twelve patients. 7 were males and 5 females. Mean age was 66  years. Excellent wound healing occurred in eleven patients (91. 7 %), with no mortality while one patient (8. 3 %) had relapse (multiple sinuses appeared). This patient had multiple risk factors. The organisms isolated from his wound were Staphylococcus epidermis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. This patient required omental flap to fill the defect after radical debridement of the wound combined with a VAC therapy system and intravenous antifungal therapy, these led to this patient's favorable outcome.

40|$|We {{consider}} how well current theories can predict neutrino mass and mixing parameters, and construct a statistical discriminator which {{allows us to}} compare different models to each other. As an example we consider see-saw models based on family symmetry, and single right-handed neutrino dominance, and compare them {{to each other and}} to the case of neutrino anarchy with random entries in the neutrino Yukawa and Majorana mass matrices. The predictions depend crucially on the range of the undetermined coefficients over which we scan, and we speculate on how future theories might lead to more precise predictions for the coefficients and hence for neutrino observables. Our results indicate how accurately neutrino masses and mixing angles need to be measured by future experiments in order to discriminate between current models. 1 Neutrino oscillation physics is one of the most rapidly developing areas of particle physics [1]. Current atmospheric neutrino data are consistent with νµ ↔ ντ oscillations [2] with sin 2 2 θ 23 > 0. 88 and 1. 5 × 10 − 3 eV 2 < |∆m 2 32 5 × 10 − 3 eV 2 (90 % CL) [3], where ∆m 2 ij = m 2 i − m 2 j in units of eV 2.

40|$|The {{potential}} of vacuum pyrolysis to convert {{sugar cane bagasse}} into char materials for wastewater treatment and soil amendment {{is the focus of}} this research paper. Vacuum pyrolysis produces both bio-oil and char in similar <b>quantities.</b> <b>Vacuum</b> pyrolysis has the potential to produce high quality chars for wastewater treatment and soil amendment directly during the conversion process, with no further upgrading required. In the present study, chars with the required porous structure was obtained directly from the vacuum pyrolysis process, making it very efficient as adsorbent both in terms of methylene blue (MB) adsorption with a N 2 -BET surface area of 418 m 2 g - 1. Further steam activation of the chars benefited the development of meso- and macroporosity, although this upgrading step was not essential to achieve the required performance of char as an MB adsorbent. The development of large pores during the vacuum pyrolysis favored physisorption of MB, rather than chemisorption. The chemical nature of the vacuum pyrolysis char resulted in a slightly acidic surface (pH 6. 56). The biochar from vacuum pyrolysis can be considered as a highly beneficial soil amendment, as it would enhance soil nutrient and water holding capacity, due to its high cation exchange capacity (122 cmol c kg - 1) and high surface area.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyFood Science InstituteMelvin C. HuntSeveral {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate factors affecting myoglobin redox forms stability and detection of myoglobin redox forms using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. In experiment 1, we investigated the relationship between metmyoglobin (MMb) reduction and oxidation of malate to α-ketoglutarate with regeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) via malate dehydrogenase (MDH). Our specific objectives for this experiment were: (1) to examine the interaction of malate and MDH to reduce MMb in vitro, (2) to {{determine the influence of}} pH, temperature, NAD[superscript]+, and malate concentration on MDH enzyme activity and MMb reduction, and (3) {{to determine the effects of}} malate on NADH generation, metmyoglobin reducing activity, and color stability using beef muscles (Longissimus lumborum, Psoas major, and Semitendinosus) extracts. We observed that, nonenzymatic reduction of horse MMb in vitro in a malate-MDH-NADH system increased with increasing NAD[superscript]+ and L-malate concentrations. Our findings further confirmed that reduction of MMb in beef extract was NAD[superscript]+ and malate concentration dependent (p M > P in the ST, and M > L > P in the PM and LL muscles. MMB was reduced most effectively with combination of metabolites where M+L > M+P > L+P. Enhancement of meat with these metabolites can effectively extend color life of postrigor meat apparently by providing more reducing conditions for myoglobin, thus increasing myoglobin redox form stability. Experiment 4 was conducted to determine how near-infrared (NIR) tissue oximeter measurements of post-rigor beef skeletal muscle relate with the more established methods of quantifying myoglobin redox states. Surface color differences were created by packaging steaks in <b>vacuum</b> (<b>VAC),</b> 80 % O[subscript] 2 and 20 % CO[subscript] 2 modified atmosphere packaging (HiOx MAP), polyvinyl chloride film overwrap (PVC), and HiOx MAP converted to PVC (HiOx-PVC) after 2 days. Changes in surface color and sub-surface pigments during display (0, 2, 4, 10, and 15 days at 2 °C) were characterized by using a reflectance-spectrophotometer and a near-infrared tissue oximeter, respectively. Fiber orientation, storage, and packaging affected (p < 0. 05) color, total pigment, deoxymyoglobin, and oxymyoglobin content. Tissue oximetry measurements appear to have potential for real-time monitoring of myoglobin redox forms and oxygen status of packaged meat, but fiber orientation needs to be controlled. In experiment 5, we investigated the response of frequency-domain multidistance (FDMD) NIR tissue oximetry for detecting absolute amounts of myoglobin (Mb) redox forms and their relationship to meat color stability. Four packaging formats were used to create different blends of Mb redox forms and meat colors during display. Changes in surface color and subsurface pigment forms during simulated display (0, 2, 4, and 10 d at 2 °C) were evaluated using surface reflecto-spectrophotometry (both L*a*b* and specific wavelengths) and FDMD NIR tissue oximetry. Data for both methods of direct measurement of oxymyoglobin and deoxymyoglobin were strongly related and accounted for 86 to 94 % of the display variation in meat color. Indirect estimates of metmyoglobin ranged from r[superscript] 2 = 59 to 85 %. It appears that NIR tissue oximetry has potential as a noninvasive, rapid method for the assessment of meat color traits and may help improve our understanding of meat color chemistry in post-rigor skeletal muscle...|$|R

BoyleA {{total of}} three studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of different packaging systems and storage times on reduction of Listeria monocytogenes on ready-to-eat meat snacks. Study 1 was conducted {{to determine the effects}} of four packaging systems [heat sealed (HS), heat sealed with oxygen scavenger (HSOS), nitrogen flushed with oxygen scavenger (NFOS), and <b>vacuum</b> (<b>VAC)</b> ] and storage times (24, 48, and 72 h, and 14 and 30 d) on reduction of L. monocytogenes in turkey jerky in the presence or absence of sodium nitrite. Inclusion of sodium nitrite in turkey jerky did not affect (P> 0. 05) L. monocytogenes log reductions regardless of packaging type or storage time. After 14 d of storage in HSOS, NFOS, or VAC, and 48 or 72 h in HS, a reduction of > 1. 0 log CFU/cm² of L. monocytogenes was achieved. Processors could use HS in conjunction with 48 h of ambient storage and be in compliance with the United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service Listeria Rule of post-lethality treatment in achieving at least 1 log reduction of L. monocytogenes. Study 2 was conducted to investigate attachment of L. monocytogenes to uncured and cured turkey jerky packaged in HS, HSOS, NFOS, or VAC using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The SEM examination showed that L. monocytogenes is capable of adhering to uncured or cured turkey jerky surfaces. Elemental maps from EDS analysis revealed that no element was unique or elevated at sites of L. monocytogenes attachment. Elemental composition showed the presence of elemental sulfur and could be an indication of the presence of sulfur-containing amino acids in turkey jerky. Finally, Study 3 evaluated the affects of two packaging types (HSOS and NFOS) and four ambient storage times (24, 48, and 72 h, and 14 d) on reduction of L. monocytogenes on five commercial RTE meats and poultry snacks (beef tenders, beef jerky, beef sausage sticks, pork jerky, and turkey sausage sticks). A mean reduction of > 1. 0 log CFU/cm² of L. monocytogenes was achieved on all products, regardless of packaging or storage time. Correlation analysis provided some indication that reduction of L. monocytogenes increased with fat content. However, the strength of linear correlation was not sufficient to account for the differences in log reduction in L. monocytogenes. In study 1, a holding time of 24, 48, or 72 h for HSOS or NFOS packaging of was not effective for reducing L. monocytogenes by at least 1 log on turkey jerky. In contrast, packaging beef tenders, beef jerky, beef sausage sticks, pork jerky, and turkey sausage sticks in HSOS or NFOS for at least 24 h ambient storage was sufficient to achieve at least 1 log reduction in L. monocytogenes population. Specific components such as sulfur-containing amino acids in turkey jerky might be contributing to < 1 log reduction of L. monocytogenes population on turkey jerky after 24, 48, or 72 h of ambient storage. Overall, nitrite was not an effective ingredient to control L. monocytogenes in turkey jerky. However, packaging such as HS, HSOS, NFOS or VAC and at least 24 h holding time were effective hurdles for controlling L. monocytogenes at post-lethality...|$|R
