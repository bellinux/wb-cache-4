This choice was due both to the strong presence in the region of small and medium sized enterprises, and to the well known lack of social capital among local firms.

The rats of both sexes (n= 20), with an average weight of 200 g were randomly assigned into treatment (n= 10) and control (n= 10) groups. The rats in the treatment group received 600 mg/ 70 kg body weight of efavirenz dissolved in distilled water daily for 30 days through the orogastric tube. The control group received equal volume of distilled water daily for 30 days through the same route. The rats were fed with growerÕs mash obtained from Edo Feeds and Flour Mill Limited, Ewu, Edo state, Nigeria and given water liberally. ˚The rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation method on the thirty-first day of the experiment. The inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body were carefully dissected out and quickly fixed in 10 % formal saline for histological study. The histological findings indicated that the treated sections of the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body showed that the chromatophilics substances were less intensely stained as compared to the control. The parenchyme was vacuolated and with evidence of hypertrophy and more spaces between the axonal mesh around the sparsely distributed neurons as compared to the control group.

The structure is not merely a <b>relay</b> <b>centre</b> but is involved in processing nociceptive information before transmitting the information to various parts of the cortex. The thalamic nuclei are involved in the sensory discriminative and affective motivational components of pain. Generally each group of nucleus has prominent functions in one component for example ventrobasal complex in sensory discriminative component and intralaminar nuclei in affective-motivational component. The thalamus is also part of a network that projects to the spinal cord dorsal horn and modulates ascending nociceptive information. In the animal models of neuropathic pain, changes in the biochemistry, gene expression, thalamic blood flow and response properties of thalamic neurons have been shown.

40|$|Limits of {{the system}} of maize {{collection}} developed by traders in West Cameroon plateau. In the Western high plateau region of Cameroon, maize is a cash crop but the farmers do not understand the marketing system giving way to middlemen traders to benefit from the disorganisation of the maize trade to exploit the relationship between the farme rs and the market. This paper seeks to know whether maize trade through middlemen can help peasant farmers to adequately fight against poverty. Findings show that in spite of adequate maize production the trade through middlemen presents limitations. The middlemen attend only the periodic markets and those one located in accessible places. They buy maize in small quantities at very low prices and stock in small <b>relay</b> <b>centres</b> for short periods of time.

Despite this, a {{large majority}} of them believe that they personally are at very low, or no risk for infection (loveLife, 2001). Furthermore, the onset of sexual activity has become progressively earlier, with many teenagers becoming sexually active at around 13 - 14 years old (Stadler & Hlongwa, 2002). 50 % of young people are sexually active by the age of 16 (Eaton, Flisher, & Aaro, 2002). However, only 30 % of sexually experienced youth report using a condom every time they have sexual intercourse. Sexually experienced teenagers report that they are most likely to get condoms from clinics, but only 32 % have been to a clinic in the past year for sexual health advice or care (loveLife, 2001). In the light of the alarming statistics mentioned above, youth represent an important target group for interventions, particularly those which address and effect changes in attitudes and behavior relating to sexuality.
