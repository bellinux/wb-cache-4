5|$|The U-1-class design {{had several}} {{features}} typical of Lake's designs, including a diving chamber under {{the bow and}} two <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> propellers. Lake's design also called for two retractable wheels that, in theory, could allow travel over the seabed. The design also placed the diving tanks above the waterline of the single, cylindrical hull, which necessitated a heavy ballast keel for vertical stability. The propulsion system for the U-1 class consisted of two gasoline engines for surface running and two electric motors for running while submerged. For underwater steering and maneuverability, the design featured four pairs of diving planes.|$|E

25|$|The Merlin was {{designed}} by F.G. Miles of Philips and Powis, {{as a result of}} collaboration with G. Birkett of Birkett Air Service Ltd, and Tata Sons Ltd of India. It was based on the three-seat and four-seat versions of the M.3 Falcon, but with wider fuselage and consequent increased wing span. It was a low-wing monoplane, with fixed main undercarriage in trouser fairings plus a fixed tailwheel. Construction was mainly of wood, with spruce frames and three-ply birch covering, and the wings had hydraulically operated split flaps. It was powered by a 200hp de Havilland Gipsy Six piston engine. It was first designated M.4 Merlin, but all four examples were completed as M.4A Merlin, with fixed pitch propeller instead of the intended <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> unit.|$|E

25|$|The Il-18B was {{powered by}} four Ivchenko AI-20A Series 1 turboprops, each {{providing}} a takeoff power of 2,985kW (4,000 shp) and sustained power of 2,090kW (2,800 shp) at cruise altitude. Early Il-18A production had initially been fitted with Kuznetsov NK-4 engines, {{but they were}} soon exchanged for AI-20s. Later Il-18B production featured AI-20A Series 2 engines, with the same power ratings, but with technical improvements, thus older machines were updated with the Series 2 powerplants. The AI-20s drove four-bladed <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> reversible props with a diameter of 4.5 meters (14 feet 9 inches), featuring prominent propeller spinners, and hydraulic actuation for prop pitch. The engines were mounted above the wing and featured integrated fire extinguishers. The engines were started with electric motors, the power for the motors being provided by a ground cart.|$|E
25|$|There {{had already}} been a very {{substantial}} investment in the Herald project, such that the management held a meeting to discuss continuation. Handley Page decided to press ahead with the Herald project, {{in an effort to}} recover the investment; announcing a new uprated version powered by the Rolls-Royce Dart. The revised aircraft, now designated the HPR.7 Dart Herald, was powered by 1,910shp Dart 527 engines driving 12ft 6in (3.81m) <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> four-blade Dowty Rotol propellers, and the fuselage was lengthened by 20in (51cm), while other improvements included increased fuel capacity. The first prototype was converted to Dart Herald standard, making its maiden flight on 11 March 1958, with the first production aircraft flying on 30 October 1959. The initial Series 100 version of the Dart Herald was certified in April 1958. The basic price in 1960 was around £185,000.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Recently, an {{increasing}} number of multi-MW (1 MW and up) wind generating set are being developed with a <b>variable</b> speed-variable <b>pitch</b> (VS-VP) control strategy to improve the fast response speed and get optimal energy. But the power generated by wind turbine changes rapidly because of the continuous fluctuation of wind speed and direction, and wind energy conversion systems are of strong nonlinear characteristics because of many uncertain factors. By analyzing the mathematical model of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG), this paper presents a kind of control strategy of optimal power tracking. Fuzzy adaptive PID controller (FAPIDC) is adopted, and simulation results show that the controller can compensate the nonlinearity and have excellent robustness.

25|$|On March 17, 1937, Earhart and {{her crew}} flew {{the first leg}} from Oakland, California to Honolulu, Hawaii. In {{addition}} to Earhart and Noonan, Harry Manning and Mantz (who was acting as Earhart's technical advisor) were on board. Due to lubrication and galling problems with the propeller hubs' <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> mechanisms, the aircraft needed servicing in Hawaii. Ultimately, the Electra {{ended up at the}} United States Navy's Luke Field on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor. The flight resumed three days later from Luke Field with Earhart, Noonan and Manning on board. During the takeoff run, Earhart ground-looped, circumstances of which remain controversial. Some witnesses at Luke Field including the Associated Press journalist on the scene said they saw a tire blow. Earhart thought either the Electra's right tire had blown and/or the right landing gear had collapsed. Some sources, including Mantz, cited pilot error.|$|E
25|$|The rising {{popularity}} of disco came {{in tandem with}} developments {{in the role of}} the DJ. DJing developed from the use of multiple record turntables and DJ mixers to create a continuous, seamless mix of songs, with one song transitioning to another with no break in the music to interrupt the dancing. The resulting DJ mix differed from previous forms of dance music in the 1960s, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. This in turn affected the arrangement of dance music, since songs in the disco era typically contained beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that could be easily used to transition to a new song. The development of DJing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques, such as beatmatching, a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the Technics SL-1200 MK 2, first sold in 1978, which had a precise <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> control and a direct drive motor. DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings. DJs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.|$|E
25|$|A {{waveform}} generator {{is a fundamental}} module in a sound synthesis system. A {{waveform generator}} usually produces a basic geometrical waveform with a fixed or variable timbre and <b>variable</b> <b>pitch.</b> Common waveform generator configurations usually included two or three simple waveforms and often a single pseudo-random-noise generator (PRNG). Available waveforms often included pulse wave (whose timbre can be varied by modifying the duty cycle), square wave (a symmetrical pulse wave producing only odd overtones), triangle wave (which has a fixed timbre containing only odd harmonics, but is softer than a square wave), and sawtooth wave (which has a bright raspy timbre and contains odd and even harmonics). Two notable examples of systems employing this technology comprise the Nintendo Game Boy portable game console, and the Commodore 64 personal computer. The Game Boy uses two pulse channels (switchable between 12.5%, 25%, 50% and 75% wave duty cycle), a channel for 4-bit PCM playback, and a pseudo-random-noise generator. The Commodore 64, however, used the MOS Technology SID chip which offered 3 channels, each switchable between pulse, saw-tooth, triangle, and noise. Unlike the Game Boy, the pulse channels on the Commodore 64 allowed full control over wave duty cycles. The SID was a very technically advanced chip, offering many other features including ring modulation and adjustable resonance filters.|$|E
40|$|Lower surface blowing (LSB) is {{investigated}} as {{an alternative}} to the <b>variable</b> blade <b>pitch</b> requirement for the X-wing Circulation Control (CC) rotor concept. Addition trailing edge blowing slots on the lower surfaces of CC airfoils provide a bidirectional lift capability that effectively doubles the control range. The operational requirements of this rotor system are detailed and compared to the projected performance attributes of LSB airfoils. Analysis shows that, aerodynamically, LSB supplies a fixed pitch rotor system with the equivalent lift efficiency and rotor control of present CC rotor designs that employ <b>variable</b> blade <b>pitch.</b> Aerodynamic demands of bidirectional lift production are predicted to be within the capabilities of current CC airfoil design methodology. Emphasis in this analysis is given to the high speed rotary wing flight regime unique to stoppable rotor aircraft.

40|$|Zinc oxide nanorod films {{produced}} by glancing angle deposition were fabricated within the parameter space {{defined by the}} process <b>variables</b> <b>pitch</b> (nanorod growth per substrate rotation), deposition rate, and throw distance to investigate the effect these parameters have on morphology and crystallinity. Statistical {{analysis was used to}} identify important relationships. Final film morphology depends on both pitch and deposition rate, where two growth regimes distinguished by deposition rate are observed and interpreted as arising from competition between geometric shadowing and crystalline growth kinetics. Optimal growth conditions for nanostructured films of isolated zinc oxide nanorods occurred for pitch values of approximately 1 nm to 10 nm. Pole-figure measurements confirm that the films consist of oriented single-crystal nanorods. Films deposited at all pitch values between 0. 001 nm to 6. 5 3 ̆bcm are crystalline and textured, and greater texturing is achieved for conditions of decreased surface diffusion. 9 2011 Elsevier B.

500|$|The first He 111B {{made its}} maiden flight {{in the autumn}} of 1936. The first {{production}} batch rolled off the production lines that summer, at Rostock. Seven B-0 pre-production aircraft were built, bearing the Werknummern (Works numbers) 1431 to 1437. The B-0s were powered by DB 600C engines fitted with <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> airscrews. The screws increased output by 149kW (200hp). The B-0 had a MG 15 machine gun installed in the nose. The B-0 could also carry 1,500kg (3,310lb) in their vertical cells. The B-1 had some minor improvements, including the installation of a revolving gun-mount in the nose and a flexible Ikaria turret under the fuselage. After improvements, the RLM ordered 300 He 111B-1s; the first were delivered in January 1937. In the B-2 variant, engines were upgraded to the supercharged 634kW (850hp) DB 600C, or in some cases, the 690kW (925hp) 600G. The B-2 began to roll off the production lines at Oranienburg in 1937. The He 111B-3 was a modified trainer. Some 255 B-1s were ordered. However, the production orders were impossible to fulfill and only 28 B-1s were built. Owing to the production of the new He 111E, only a handful of He 111B-3s were produced. Due to insufficient capacity, Dornier, Arado and Junkers built the He 111B series at their plants in Wismar, Brandenburg and Dessau, respectively. The B series compared favourably with the capacity of the A series.

At the same time, the so-called PI-sufficiency condition is fulfilled. Moreover, a good fit to the acquisition requirements of the various medical applications of cone-beam CT is achieved. In contrast to other helical cone-beam acquisition and reconstruction methods, the-PI-method introduced in this publication allows for <b>variable</b> <b>pitches</b> of the acquisition helix.
