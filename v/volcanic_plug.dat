25|$|Other {{theories}} {{have suggested that}} Devils Tower is a <b>volcanic</b> <b>plug</b> or {{that it is the}} neck of an extinct volcano. Presumably, if Devils Tower was a <b>volcanic</b> <b>plug,</b> any volcanics created by it– volcanic ash, lava flows, volcanic debris– would have been eroded away long ago. Some pyroclastic material of the same age as Devils Tower has been identified elsewhere in Wyoming.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the local}} museum, Dumbarton Rock is a <b>volcanic</b> <b>plug</b> of basalt created 334 million years ago, with the softer {{exterior}} of the volcano having weathered away.|$|E

25|$|The rock is a <b>{{volcanic}}</b> <b>plug,</b> {{a remnant}} of the strong volcanic activity that affected the region some one million years ago. However, a Captain Hansen of the Norwegian steamship Talisman reported that on 13 May 1902, he observed what he took to be a volcanic eruption from {{a hole in the}} rock. This was {{at the time of the}} devastating volcanic eruption of Mount Pelée that destroyed Saint Pierre. Hansen did not investigate further.|$|E
25|$|Situated in a {{position}} dominating the town of Orvieto which sits perched on a <b>volcanic</b> <b>plug,</b> the cathedral’s façade is a classic piece of religious construction, containing elements of design from the 14th to the 20th century, with a large rose window, golden mosaics and three huge bronze doors, while inside resides two frescoed chapels decorated {{by some of the}} best Italian painters of the period with images of Judgment Day. The cathedral has five bells, dating back to Renaissance, tuned in E flat.|$|E
25|$|It is {{traditionally}} recorded {{that one of}} the great fighting chiefs of the Ngati Kahupungapunga, Tokoroa by name, was slain by Ngati Raukawa during the siege of Pōhaturoa, a <b>volcanic</b> <b>plug</b> adjacent to Atiamuri, 27km south of Tokoroa on the main Taupo highway. It is possible that some early surveyor applied the name Tokoroa as a tribute to the old chief's memory. The name Tokoroa first appeared on the early maps of the 1860s, although this was for an area 50km north east of today's Tokoroa.|$|E

25|$|Geologically, Ailsa Craig is {{the remains}} of a <b>volcanic</b> <b>plug</b> from an extinct volcano. It stands out because all younger {{sedimentary}} rocks covering Southwest Scotland have long since been eroded away. But the island survived erosion because it is composed of much harder igneous rocks from the Palaeogene period. The plug, which is composed of granite, is all that remains from the massive volcanic activity caused by the formation of the Atlantic Ocean. Dykes of similar age can be found in Scotland through other older rocks such as the extensive Cleveland and Eskdalemuir dykes. Though only a few metres across, these volcanic dykes can be traced all the way from northern England back to an ancient supervolcano on the Isle of Mull.|$|E
25|$|The {{congestion}} {{was obviously}} serious, {{with no apparent}} solution on the route through Waverley. The line lay in a valley between very high ground on an east-west alignment, and any railway by-passing Waverley {{would have to be}} aligned south of the <b>volcanic</b> <b>plug</b> that forms Salisbury Crags and Arthur's Seat. In 1865 the NBR proposed a line from Haymarket to connect with the former Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway near its terminus {{on the south side of}} the city. The Dalkeith line, now in NBR control, connected near Niddrie (often spelt Niddry at the time) with the NBR main line to Berwick and the Dalkeith route to the mineral fields. The Caledonian Railway too saw this as an opportunity to secure an advantage over its rival, and in the same year it too proposed a similar route from its own lines near Gorgie to Niddrie, intending to claim running powers over the NBR lines to get access to the Lothian coal fields. However neither of these schemes was progressed.|$|E
500|$|Geologically, most of {{the islands}} are the {{remnants}} of igneous intrusions. The Isle of May's rock is [...] "fine grained basalt of a dark-grey colour with tinges of green and greenstone". Fidra is also largely basalt and The Bass is a phonolite <b>volcanic</b> <b>plug.</b> Craigleith is a laccolith made up of essexite which is popular for making curling stones and Cramond island {{is made up of}} dolerite. Inchmickery and Inchgarvie are of igneous origin and the latter is partly made up of picrite. Studies of the landscape beneath the waters of the firth have revealed that the visible surface of Inchgarvie is only the top of a larger crag and tail structure similar in structure to Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile created by glacial action. The tidal islet of Eyebroughy is about [...] to the west of Fidra. Its component rock is trachyte and Lower Carboniferous in origin.|$|E

50|$|The Waitakere volcano has mainly been eroded, but {{conglomerate}} {{from the}} volcano formed the Waitakere Ranges. The Waitakere Ranges also contain many dikes, <b>volcanic</b> <b>plugs,</b> etc., that formed {{part of this}} volcano.|$|R
500|$|The Mount Cayley massif, [...] in elevation, is {{the largest}} and most {{persistent}} volcano in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. It is a highly eroded stratovolcano composed of dacite and rhyodacite lava that was deposited during three phases of volcanic activity. The first eruptive phase started about four million years ago with the eruption of dacite lava flows and pyroclastic rock. This resulted {{in the creation of the}} Mount Cayley proper. Subsequent volcanism during this volcanic phase constructed a significant lava dome. This acts like a <b>volcanic</b> <b>plug</b> and composes the lava spines that currently form pinnacles on Cayley's rugged summit. After the Mount Cayley proper was constructed, lava flows, tephra and welded dacite rubble was erupted. This second phase of activity [...] million years ago resulted in the creation of the Vulcan's Thumb, a craggy volcanic ridge on the southern flank of the Mount Cayley proper. Lengthy dissection from an extended period of erosion demolished much of the original stratovolcano. Volcanic activity after this prolonged period of erosion produced thick dacite lava flows from parasitic vents 300,000years ago that extended into the Turbid and Shovelnose Creek valleys near the Squamish River. This subsequently created two minor parasitic lava domes 200,000years ago. These three volcanic events in contrast to several others around Cayley in that they do not show signs of interaction with glacial ice.|$|E
2500|$|Ailsa Craig ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{an island}} of [...] in the outer Firth of Clyde, [...] west of {{mainland}} Scotland, upon which blue hone granite was quarried to make curling stones. The now uninhabited island is formed from the <b>volcanic</b> <b>plug</b> of an extinct volcano.|$|E

The Pitons are a World Heritage Site 2909 ha {{in size and}} located {{near the town of}} Soufrière.|$|R
50|$|The peaks {{were created}} over 20,000,000 years ago during the Miocene Epoch of the Neogene Period, as <b>volcanic</b> <b>plugs</b> of magma which welled up and {{solidified}} inside softer rock {{which has since}} eroded away.|$|R
