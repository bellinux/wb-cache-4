25|$|Automotive critic Jeremy Clarkson, {{known for}} his disdain for hybrid vehicles, criticized the Insight for its {{continuously}} <b>variable</b> <b>transmission,</b> engine noise, and build quality. He recognized that the price was low, but concluded that a Volkswagen Golf was a better deal.|$|E
25|$|The {{generator}} component, {{which is}} approximately 34% {{of the wind}} turbine cost, includes the electrical generator, the control electronics, and most likely a gearbox (e.g. planetary gearbox), adjustable-speed drive or continuously <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> component for converting the low speed incoming rotation to high speed rotation suitable for generating electricity.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the RC was {{available}} {{with a choice}} of three engines; the RC 300h with the 2.5-liter 2AR-FSE inline-four engine mated to a continuously <b>variable</b> <b>transmission,</b> the RC 350 with the 3.5-liter 2GR-FSE V6, and the RC F with 5.0-liter 2UR-GSE V8. The RC 200t, featuring a 2.0-liter 8AR-FTS I4 turbocharged petrol engine, was added to the range in late 2015. All-wheel drive is offered for the RC 300h and RC 350.|$|E
25|$|A Getrag F23 5-speed manual or an Aisin AF23 5-speed {{automatic}} transmission were available. The compact 5-speed automatic had several unique characteristics. The transmission lacked an overdrive, allowing for five forward gears to be packaged {{in the size}} of a typical four-speed manual gearbox, both providing close gear ratios for better acceleration and fuel efficiency while eliminating the heat and parasitic loss generated by the additional planetary gearset. The unit was also “fill-for-life”, meaning that it was not intended to be serviced {{for the life of the}} vehicle. The 2003 and 2004 Ion Coupes were available with the VTi continuously <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> or a Getrag F23 5-speed manual.|$|E
25|$|In North America, the Spark {{was first}} {{delivered}} to GM dealerships in Mexico for the 2012 model year, {{but did not}} replace the Chevrolet Matiz (formerly Pontiac G2 Matiz) which is still sold (as of 2014). The United States version of the 2013 Chevrolet Spark went into production on April 16, 2012, and arrived in dealerships in August 2012. For 2014 in North America, the automatic transmission is a Jatco M4M-CVT7 Continuously <b>Variable</b> <b>Transmission</b> (CVT) and the final drive ratio lowered to 3.75. The CVT gives better fuel mileage overall than the previous 4 speed automatic, and changing the final drive ratio from its previous 4.145 reduces engine noise and increases fuel economy on the highway while increasing noise and reducing fuel mileage in the city. Industry sources have commented on the ongoing reliability issues with the Jatco CVT transmissions.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical and {{hydraulic}} {{adjustable speed}} drives are usually called <b>transmissions</b> or continuously <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{when they are}} used in vehicles, farm equipment and some other types of equipment.|$|R
50|$|Continuously <b>Variable</b> <b>Transmissions</b> (CVT), {{which are}} {{available}} in some smaller cars, offer similar performance - albeit completely mechanical; while the Turboglide operates hydraulically and may be geared to multiply torque at any speed.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 Valtra {{introduced}} the stepless Direct transmission, {{which it had}} developed and manufactured itself. Unlike other continuously <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions,</b> Direct transmissions have ground-speed PTO option, are equally efficient when driven forwards and in reverse, and have separate oils for the hydraulics and transmission. Direct transmissions are very similar in design to Valtra’s five-step Versu powershift transmissions.|$|R
25|$|The Insight’s Continuously <b>Variable</b> <b>Transmission</b> (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward gear ratios are infinitely variable between 3.172–0.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted {{behind the steering wheel}} allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated gear ratios for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT’s gear ratios are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed gear ratios. The CVT’s variable gear ratios allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the Honda CR-Z {{received}} a minor refresh. It {{received a}} {{change to the}} front and rear bumper, as well as a slightly revised interior. It also gained the EX-L trim from the refresh with a small increase in price. The base price LX trim starts at $20,295 with a manual transmission, and $20,945 with a continuously <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> or CVT. The EX trim increased to $22,140 with a manual transmission, and $22,790 with a CVT. The new EX-L trim starts at $24,440 with a manual transmission, and $25,090 with a CVT. The refresh has changed a few colors as well. The North Shore Blue Pearl color changed to the Aegean Blue Metallic color, the Crystal Black Pearl color has changed to the Jet Black color, and Premium White Pearl has changed to Ivory Pearl. On the EX trim, the secondary interior red color has changed to orange. The CR-Z also gained a few new wheel designs for the refresh. Honda had previously confirmed that a second generation of the CR-Z was under development, possibly for the 2018 model year.|$|E

The long-wheelbase LS 600h L is equipped with Lexus Hybrid Drive, featuring a 5.0-liter 2UR-FSE V8 engine mated to a high-output electric motor with nickel-metal hydride battery packs. This system uses a continuously <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> and generates an output of [...] Fuel economy is slightly higher overall than the lower-powered non-hybrid LS, and the hybrids achieve a U.S. Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) rating. Features specific to the LS hybrids include the first production low beam LED headlights, a leather-trimmed dash, and blue-tinted hybrid badging. In April 2007, Lexus announced that the base price for the LS 600h L would be over US$104,000, surpassing the V12-equipped Toyota Century as the most expensive Japanese luxury car ever produced. A standard-wheelbase version destined for Asia and Europe, the LS 600h (UVF45), was launched in Japan in May 2007. The first 100 LS 600h L sedans sold in the U.S. were offered as [...] "Launch Edition" [...] models via the Neiman Marcus catalog for InCircle members.|$|E

40|$|Battery {{electric}} vehicles (BEVs) represent a possible sustainable solution for personal urban transportation. Presently, the most limiting characteristic of BEVs is their short range, {{mainly because of}} battery technology limitations. A proper design {{and control of the}} drivetrain, aimed at reducing the power losses and thus increasing BEV range, can contribute to make the electrification of urban transportation a convenient choice. This paper presents a simulation-based comparison of the energy efficiency performance of six drivetrain architectures for BEVs. Although many different drivetrain and transmission architectures have been proposed for BEVs, no literature was found regarding BEVs equipped with infinitely <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions</b> (IVTs). The analyzed drivetrain configurations are: single- (1 G) and two-speed (2 G) gear drives, half toroidal (HT) and full toroidal (FT) continuously <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions</b> (CVTs), and infinitely <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions</b> (IVTs) with two different types of internal power flow (IVT-I and IVT-II). An off-line procedure for determining the most efficient control action for each drivetrain configuration is proposed, which allows selecting the optimal speed ratio for each operating condition. The energy consumption of the BEVs is simulated along the UDC (Urban Driving Cycle) and Japanese 10 - 15 driving cycle, with a backward facing approach. In order to achieve the lowest energy consumption, a trade-off between high transmission efficiency and flexibility in terms of allowed speed ratios is required...|$|R
