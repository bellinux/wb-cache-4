5|$|Plots {{are often}} {{set in motion}} by events, ranging from the fairly typical to the supernatural and extraordinary, which {{frequently}} happen in the town. The boys often act as the <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> when these events cause panic or incongruous behavior among the adult populace, who are customarily depicted as irrational, gullible, and prone to vociferation. The boys are also frequently confused by the contradictory and hypocritical behavior of their parents and other adults, and often perceive them as having distorted views on morality and society.|$|E
5|$|Bruce and Hughes clashed in both {{style and}} ideology. Bruce found Hughes' {{management}} of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them. But {{he served as a}} strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas. His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The Opposition criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness. The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the 1922 elections in December. Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.|$|E
5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees {{as a threat to}} his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E

25|$|Both The Coquette and Charlotte Temple are {{novels that}} treat {{the right of}} women to live as equals as the new {{democratic}} experiment. These novels are of the Sentimental genre, characterized by overindulgence in emotion, an invitation {{to listen to the}} <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> against misleading passions, as well as an optimistic overemphasis on the essential goodness of humanity. Sentimentalism is often thought to be a reaction against the Calvinistic belief in the depravity of human nature.|$|E

25|$|Bruce Lewis (played by John L. Adams) — A {{physiotherapist}} {{who helps}} Johnny regain his strength after his coma. Bruce is an open-minded spiritual junkie {{as a result}} of a religious upbringing by his pastor father. He is Johnny's best friend and frequently his <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason,</b> and may very well be the reason for the divergence in this series when compared to the novel or 1983 movie (Johnny never tried to kill Greg Stillson before the election). An episode in season 2 even featured a vision of an alternate reality where instead of being a physical therapist, Bruce was a reverend who never met Johnny after waking up from his coma. And thus, with the absence of his guidance, this version of Johnny became unstable, deranged, and driven mad by his abilities.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, Kelly met a man named Jake Hanson (played by Grant Show), an emotionally guarded biker who was {{slightly}} older than she. While Jake ultimately resisted their romance, citing Kelly's age, he admitted to admiring her for her heart and kindness. This story line was used to launch the spin-off series Melrose Place. Eventually, Kelly was revealed to have a notable conscience during a summer fling with Dylan McKay, the boyfriend of her friend Brenda, often being the <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> during their affair. Kelly went through a period of minor depression during her senior year in high school in season 3. The stress of having feelings for Dylan, someone who she could not pursue because of his relationship with Brenda, added to her struggles. Even when Kelly dated Dylan out in the open, following his relationship with Brenda, it caused her to temporarily lose Brenda as a friend.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} power of ―walls ‖ to {{constrain}} thought and silence diverse <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> within planning. Using die Mauer (The Berlin Wall) as a linking metaphor, this paper juxtaposes mid- 1950 s planning in a spatially- and ideologically-divided Berlin (Germany) against Harland Bartholomew‘s mid- 1950 s planning in a racially-divided Louisville, Kentucky (USA). It then juxtaposes the latter against a mid- 1950 s narrative about efforts to desegregate housing in Louisville. This juxtaposition reveals that some people in Louisville used the Cold War divide between East and West to reinforce the long-standing racial divide between blacks and whites. Moreover, it reveals that, by deferring to Cold War-related racial politics {{that could not be}} questioned, Bartholomew‘s technical approach to planning silenced other <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> and thereby reflected and reproduced the race-inflected politics of the Cold War divide. The paper concludes by briefly considering what Bartholomew might have done differently in the context and by exploring what this juxtaposition of stories implies for planning {{in the context of the}} contemporary ―war against terrorists. ...|$|R

Dick Deadeye, based on a character in [...] "Woman's Gratitude" [...] (1869), represents another of Gilbert's favorite (and semi-autobiographical) satiric themes: the misshapen misanthrope whose forbidding [...] "face and form" [...] makes him unpopular although he represents the <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> and common sense. Gilbert also borrows from his 1870 opera, The Gentleman in Black which includes the device of baby-switching.|$|E
