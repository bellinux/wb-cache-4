This method exploits a projective invariant property between concentric circles {{and the corresponding}} projected ellipses to find complete region correspondences centered on interest points. The method matches interest points allowing for a full perspective transformation and exploiting all the available luminance information in the regions. Experiments have been conducted on many different data sets to compare our approach to SIFT local descriptors. The results show the new method offers increased robustness to partial <b>visibility,</b> <b>object</b> rotation in depth, and viewpoint angle change...|$|E

This problem is efficiently solved in this paper through a new 3 D recognition method for free-form objects. The technique uses the Depth Gradient Image Based on Silhouette representation (DGI-BS) and settles the problem of identification-pose under occlusion and noise requirements. DGI-BS synthesizes both surface and contour information of an object avoiding restrictions concerning the layout and <b>visibility.</b> <b>Object</b> recognition is carried out {{by means of a}} simple matching algorithm in the DGI-BS space which yields a point-to-point correspondence between scene and model. The method has been successfully tested in real scenes under occlusion and noise circumstances. The classification based on 3 D representation [2] establishes object centered representations (curved and contour representations, axial representations, surface representations and volumetric representations) and observer centered representations (graph aspects, techniques based on silhouettes, principal components, etc). From another point of view, the techniques are classified regarding to the kind of algorithm they use. Thus, we can find: iterative methods [3]; correspondence search methods through points [4], curves [5, 6] and regions [7] and exhaustive search (pose clustering [8, 9] and geometric hashing methods [10, 11]).

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} if physical {{measures of}} noise predict image quality at {{high and low}} noise levels. Method: Twenty-four images were acquired on a DR system using a Pehamed DIGRAD phantom at three kVp settings (60, 70 and 81) {{across a range of}} mAs values. The image acquisition setup consisted of 14 cm of PMMA slabs with the phantom placed in the middle at 120 cm SID. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Contrast-to- noise ratio (CNR) were calculated for each of the images using ImageJ software and 14 observers performed image scoring. Images were scored according to the observer`s evaluation of objects visualized within the phantom. Results: The R 2 values of the non-linear relationship between objective visibility score and CNR (60 kVp R 2 = 0. 902; 70 Kvp R 2 = 0. 913; 80 kVp R 2 = 0. 757) demonstrate a better fit for all 3 kVp settings than the linear R 2 values. As CNR increases for all kVp settings the Object Visibility also increases. The largest increase for SNR at low exposure values (up to 2 mGy) is observed at 60 kVp, when compared with 70 or 81 kVp. CNR response to exposure is similar. Pearson r was calculated to assess the correlation between Score, OV, SNR and CNR. None of the correlations reached a level of statistical significance (p > 0. 01). Conclusion: For object visibility and SNR, tube potential variations {{may play a role in}} object visibility. Higher energy X-ray beam settings give lower SNR but higher object <b>visibility.</b> <b>Object</b> visibility and CNR at all three tube potentials are similar, resulting in a strong positive relationship between CNR and object visibility score. At low doses the impact of radiographic noise does not have a strong influence on object visibility scores because in noisy images objects could still be identified...|$|E

40|$|Five {{coloured}} totemic sculptural works (up to 4 meters high). Exhibited in {{a variety}} of locations, the steles act as standing stones with no instructional message or commemorative edict, allowing for interpretative flexibility. The Steles engage with the contemporary subject of sculpture, whilst simultaneously testing the limits of the social use of objects. â€˜Stelesâ€™ began with standard metal bars, which were forged, rolled and then rendered in giant form with a PU elastomer coating. The simple forging processes applied pressure to the hot steel, producing an asymmetrical squeezed effect as well as extruded â€˜earsâ€™ at the top, where the original bar corners were. The edges, where the organic and the man-made collide, echo calligraphic standing stones â€“ hence â€˜steleâ€™. Whilst the original steles were produced by carving flat faces across rocks, Wilsonâ€™s forging processes produce a bulge which effects a similar meeting of face and edge. The literal squeeze is reintroduced in Wilsonâ€™s larger pieces with a bevelled zotefoam edge, the overspilling sandwich-filling between two plate steel faces. The elastomer coating is flexible enough for this squeeze to be still in evidence in the final work, an intimate and surprising point of contact for anyone brave enough to touch. There is a precise reversal of the normal hierarchical relation between macquette and final work here â€“ the smaller version in this instance being the â€˜truerâ€™ one. The finished forms are worked up in a factory which usually produces shipping buoys, making for a high <b>visibility</b> <b>object,</b> densely pigmented, saturated with colour. This process also places the work in conversation with New Generation sculptors of the sixties, especially with the painted steel works that appeared to promise to be forever freshly painted, forever new. The twist here is that eventually these stele works will lose their gloss, the pigment will fade and the surface will pit â€“ it will be as if they gradually turn to stone...|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2012. Major: Psychology. Advisors: Gordon E. Legge, Paul R. Schrater. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF), xvi, 138 pages. Visual accessibility is "the effectiveness with which vision {{can be used}} to travel safely through the space and to pursue the intended activities in the space (Legge, Yu, Kallie, Bochsler, & Gage, 2010). " A major issue for visual accessibility involves the <b>visibility</b> of <b>objects</b> under visually challenging conditions, especially those faced by people with impaired vision. This research investigates <b>visibility</b> of <b>objects</b> under conditions of artificially induced blur, and concludes with simple design principles for improving <b>object</b> <b>visibility</b> when vision is compromised by reductions in acuity and contrast sensitivity. Additionally, this research bridges a gap between <b>object</b> <b>visibility</b> studies in physical environments, and studies of visibility using image processing and screen displays of the same objects and scenes. Psychophysical measurements of <b>visibility</b> of <b>objects</b> shown on the desktop display accounted for 58 % of the variability in visibility measurements of the same scenes and objects in the physical environment. The technical aspects of virtual modelingâ€”from stimulus conception to photometrically and geometrically accurate displaying of stimulus imagesâ€”are described. Chapter 1 of this dissertation provides an overview of this research. In Chapter 2, experiments are described in which <b>object</b> <b>visibility</b> was tested in a physical environment. The objects were boxes and cylinders. The subjects were normally sighted young adults who wore blur goggles that simulate the effects of visually impaired acuity and contrast sensitivity loss. Interactions between illumination source (i. e., luminaire location), surface reflectance, and object shape led to the conclusion that curved objects were more visible than flat objects with blurry vision. However we wished to confirm this conclusion for a wider range of viewing conditions. Chapter 3 extended the work of the physically based study to a computer desktop displayed environment. Several models for digitally simulating physical blur goggles were examined. A high dynamic range (HDR) image of the point spread function (PSF) of the physical blur goggles, convolved with HDR images of the stimuli, plus a slight contrast attenuation, provided the best agreement between visibility performance of subjects viewing the objects on a computer display and the performance of the subjects who viewed the corresponding real objects (Chapter 2). A comparison between photographs and renderings showed no difference between the two image types. The main effects and interaction findings of the physical experiment (from Chapter 2) were largely reproduced with our desktop model. The desktop model was used to study novel conditions (i. e., new object locations and orientations), were it was found that under diffuse overhead illumination {{near the center of the}} room, the curved objects were actually less visible than flat objects. In all other cases that were tested, curved objects still provided enhanced <b>visibility</b> over flat <b>objects.</b> Chapter 4 contains a technical report on the methods used to create photometrically accurate HDR images based on physically based 3 D objects, materials, and scenes. It illustrates the 3 D modeling, rendering, photography, and photometry methods for reproducing photometrically and geometrically accurate scenes on a calibrated computer display. In addition to modeling and calibration techniques, Chapter 4 illustrates methods for spatial filtering (i. e. visual blur), and non-spatial image processing, including color balancing and contrast reduction, required for accurate reproduction of the physically based experiment. Example code for all major steps, including spatial and non-spatial filtering, is provided. Collectively, this series of experiments demonstrated a simple heuristic for designing visually accessible spaces: namely that adding curvature to objects can enhance <b>object</b> <b>visibility</b> under reduced acuity and reduced contrast sensitivity situations. This enhancement, however, is lost under diffuse illumination, where other methods for increasing contrast within or around the object would be more reliable. Moreover, this research demonstrates a complete workflow from conception of a physical environment to complete virtual modeling of the physical space, as well as digitization of models for visual impairment. This research provides a foundation for further study of visibility in more complex and realistic environments (including motion, as demonstrated in this dissertation's supplemental video archive), linking virtual desktop models to physical environments...|$|R

In the real world, however, there are many physical obstacles (e. g., buildings) and their presence may affect the <b>visibility</b> between <b>objects.</b> In this paper, we introduce a novel variant of RNN queries, namely, visible reverse {{nearest neighbor}} (VRNN) search, which considers the impact of obstacles on the <b>visibility</b> of <b>objects.</b> Given a data set P, an obstacle set O, and a query point q in a 2 D space, a VRNN query retrieves the points in P that have q as their visible nearest neighbor. We propose an efficient algorithm for VRNN query processing, assuming that P and O are indexed by R-trees. Our techniques do not require any preprocessing and employ half-plane property and visibility check to prune the search space. In addition, we extend our solution to several variations of VRNN queries, including: 1) visible reverse k-nearest neighbor (VRkNN) search, which finds the points in P that have q {{as one of their}} k visible nearest neighbors; 2) Î´-VRkNN search, which handles VRkNN retrieval with the maximum visible distance Î´ constraint; and 3) constrained VRkNN (CVRkNN) search, which tackles the VRkNN query with region constraint.

To capture the full spatial extent of target objects we use a stochastic approximation of their surface area.
