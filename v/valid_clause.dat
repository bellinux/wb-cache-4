40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on {{important}} cultural and social connections of bank holiday and next significant days incorporation into Education to Citizenship on the second grade of primary schools. The work {{is divided into two}} parts - theoretical and practical part. The theoretical one is dealing with the definition and characterization of bank holidays and next significant days in the Czech Republic. In the next part there is described curricular reform of schooling and its documents. In the practical part there is analysed Framework Education Programme for Elementary Education into which are reflected problems of teaching of bank holidays and significant days in primary schools. Afterwards is researching focused on analysis of School Education Programme of Primary School and Kindergarten School for everyone in Osová Bítýška. The author is looking at bank holidays and next significant days incorporation into Education to Citizenship curriculum. In this part there are analysed Education to Citizenship textbooks with <b>valid</b> <b>clause</b> of Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports as well. Subsequently there were created model education units which were used in chosen primary school. The conclusion of diploma thesis is dealing with evaluation of realized classes and appraisal of contribution of created activities to pupils...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to find out the importance of Protected Landscape Area (PLA) Křivoklátsko for environmental education in elementary school. Firstly we carried out the field research thanks to which we discovered the information about total character of area of interest as well as the particular nature trails in PLA Křivoklátsko. Owing to information collecting in field we asked Elementary School Křivoklát for cooperation. The theoretical part deals with role of this topic in curricular documents which are validated in the Czech Republic. We read carefully the Framework Education Programme for Elementary Education, the School Education Programme and the Thematic Plans of Elementary School Křivoklát and chosen textbooks with <b>valid</b> <b>clause</b> by Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. On the basis of all gained information we formed a questionnaire and it was made the pilot research between pupils who are attending the sixth and the ninth class in Elementary School Křivoklát. This research of pupils´ knows ledges concerns nature conservation in the Czech Republic and in the local region, PLA Křivoklátsko. With respect to the results of pilot research and other gained information about the area of interest it was subjectively evaluated the importance of PLA Křivoklátsko for the environmental education in elementary school. Subsequently there were suggested some subject matters for wider using PLA Křivoklátsko in teaching which may be the item of more detailed describing in diploma thesis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nogood {{learning}} is {{a critical component of}} Boolean satisfia-bility (SAT) solvers, and increasingly popular in the context of integer programming and constraint programming. We present a generic method to learn <b>valid</b> <b>clauses</b> from exact or approximate binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and resolution in the context of SAT solving. We show that any clause learned from SAT conflict analysis can also be generated using our method, while, in addition, we can generate stronger clauses that cannot be derived from one application of conflict analysis. Importantly, since SAT instances are often too large for an exact BDD representation, we focus on BDD relaxations of polynomial size and show how they can still be used to generated useful clauses. Our experimental results show that when this method is used as a preprocessing step and the generated clauses are appended to the original instance, the size of the search tree for a SAT solver can be significantly reduced...|$|R

50|$|If the {{contract}} contains a <b>valid</b> arbitration <b>clause,</b> the aggrieved party must submit an arbitration claim {{in accordance with}} the procedures set forth in the clause. Many contracts provide that all disputes arising thereunder will be resolved by arbitration, rather than litigated in courts, partly because arbitration awards are recognized and enforceable internationally under the New York Convention, which has 156 parties. Arbitration judgments may generally be enforced {{in the same manner as}} ordinary court judgments. However, in New York Convention states, arbitral decisions are generally immune unless there is a showing that the arbitrator's decision was irrational or tainted by fraud. Not all disputes regarding contract claims can be resolved in arbitration however, especially regarding validity of registered IP rights, or if they implicate a public interest that goes beyond the narrow interests of the parties to the agreement like claims that a party violated a contract by engaging in illegal anti-competitive conduct or civil rights violations.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop {{techniques}} for applying binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and multivalued decision diagrams (MDDs) to combinatorial optimization and satisfaction problems, in particular multidimensional bin packing {{problems and the}} Boolean satisfiability problem. In the multidimensional bin packing problem, each bin has a multidimensional capacity and each item has an associated multidimensional size. We develop several MDD representations for this problem and explore different MDD construction methods including a new heuristic-driven depth-first compilation scheme. We also derive MDD restrictions and relaxations, using a novel application of a clustering algorithm to identify approximate equivalence classes among MDD nodes. Our experimental results show that these techniques can significantly outperform solvers using current constraint programming and mixed-integer programming methods. The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem {{is the problem of}} determining whether a given propositional formula defined on a set of Boolean variables has a satisfying assignment, that is, an assignment of truth values to the variables that makes the formula true. We present a generic method for deducing <b>valid</b> <b>clauses</b> from a SAT instance using BDDs, with the aim of finding clauses that are bottlenecks for SAT solvers using conflict-directed clause learning. We formally characterize the strength of these generated clauses and show that any clause learned from SAT conflict analysis can also be generated using our method, while our method can additionally generate stronger clauses than those that are derivable using one application of conflict analysis. The method remains valid for approximate BDDs, which is important for SAT instances that are too large for an exact BDD representation. Our experimental results show that the clauses generated from BDDs can signicantly reduce the numbers of decisions and conflicts encountered by a SAT solver. In order to extend these clause generation techniques to larger SAT instances, we propose several methods to decompose a SAT instance into smaller subinstances. These methods are based on the identification of clauses that arise from the application of the widely used Tseitin transformation, the analysis {{of the structure of the}} constraint graph corresponding to the instance, and the modeling of the instance as a resistive electrical network. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that these techniques are promising areas for future research...|$|R
30|$|How {{can these}} {{findings}} be explained? One potential {{explanation is that}} it may be possible in practice to mitigate the problem of ‘non-excludability’ associated with training investment. For instance, using payback clauses firms are able to minimize the risk of turnover, render skills ‘excludable’, and make them de facto a private good – at least for a given period of time. At the downside, there may be some uncertainty as to whether such agreements between the firm and the worker are actually legally valid. For Germany such a problem has been reported by Alewell (1998). Basically, <b>valid</b> payback <b>clauses</b> must not discriminate employees unduly. Legal practice has established a number of criteria for appropriate agreements (Lakies 2012). Yet, some employers may find it risky to close such a contract and decide to abstain from utilizing this instrument. Another drawback of payback clauses could be given by the potential demotivation of workers who might perceive such clauses as a signal of distrust, or as discriminating. Nevertheless, such contracting is applied in quite many firms in Germany (see Mueller 2012)y.|$|R

5000|$|First, {{there is}} the (unlikely) risk that the court first seised finds the {{jurisdiction}} clause invalid, which consequently takes away the possibility for the designated court to decide the case, even if the latter would have declared the <b>clause</b> <b>valid.</b> Although the Court in Gasser first seems to minimise the likelihood of this hypothesis by stating that a jurisdiction clause [...] "must be regarded as an independent concept", it nonetheless points out that verifying the existence of jurisdiction clauses [...] "may necessitate delicate and costly investigations". As a result, although unlikely, {{there is still a}} risk that two courts from different Member States will decide upon the validity of a jurisdiction clause differently.|$|R

40|$|As {{arbitration}} agreements {{become more}} common, bankruptcy courts increasingly encounter arbitration agreements {{to which a}} bankruptcy debtor is a party. Bankruptcy judges must then determine whether to enforce an otherwise <b>valid</b> arbitration <b>clause</b> or to refuse enforcement and decide the underlying dispute themselves. To date, bankruptcy judges facing these issues have tended to see arbitrationa s a competing, quasi-judicialf orum. They typically refuse to enforce arbitration agreements when they find that bankruptcy policy would favor resolution in the bankruptcy proceeding instead of in some other adjudicative forum. Building on previous work, I contend in this article that arbitration is best understood not {{as a type of}} quasi-adjudication, but as a species of contract, with the award equivalent to a contract term agreed upon by the parties ex ante. I argue that arbitration agreements should be enforced by bankruptcy courts unless enforcement would prevent a party from vindicating its statutory bankruptcy rights, and that bankruptcy courts should then decide whether to enforce the award by considering whether the award would contravene the policy of bankruptcy law {{if it had been a}} contract term. In practice, my proposal is for enforcement of arbitration agreements with a more robust degree ofjudicial review of awards than arbitration law typically allows...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} a complex {{description}} of the legal regulation of a non- compete clause in the Czech labour law and also points out to the legal regulation within the labour law in the Slovak Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The non-compete clause in the Czech law system is contained {{not only in the}} labour law but also in the commercial law to which the author refers, as well. However, the main topic of this thesis is the legal regulation of the non-compete clause within the labour law. Nevertheless, in the Czech Republic there was not always the same opinion on whether this contract between an employer and an employee is <b>valid.</b> Non-compete <b>clauses</b> are frequently included in many other European countries, nevertheless, in some countries are not included at all or are prohibited. This fact, i. e. that the non-compete clause is regulated in many foreign legal systems differently than in the Czech labour law, {{is one of the reasons}} why the author chose this topic of the thesis. Moreover, it is an institute of the labour law that is not harmonized by the European Union so we can find plenty of different legal regulations all over the Europe.

In 1980, the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (hereafter the CISG) was specifically drafted to apply to contracts for the international sale of goods. Recently, the European Commission also published a document containing provisions that can apply to contracts for the international sale of goods: the Proposal for a Regulation on a Common European Sales Law. This paper compares the scope of application of these legal regimes, it compares the regulation of standard terms in both regimes and addresses the provisions in the EU Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), which are of relevance for contracts for the international sale of goods which do not contain a <b>valid</b> dispute settlement <b>clause...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{interested}} in an algebraic specification language that (1) allows for sufficient expessiveness, (2) admits a well-defined semantics, and (3) allows for formal proofs. To that end we study clausal specifications over built-in algebras. To keep things simple, we consider built-in algebras only that are given as the initial model of a Horn clause specification. On top of this Horn clause specification new operators are (partially) defined by positive/negative conditional equations. In {{the first part of the}} paper we define three types of semantics for such a hierarchical specification: model-theoretic, operational, and rewrite-based semantics. We show that all these semantics coincide, provided some restrictions are met. We associate a distinguished algebra A spec to a hierachical specification spec. This algebra is initial in the class of all models of spec. In the second part of the paper we study how to prove a theorem (a <b>clause)</b> <b>valid</b> in the distinguished algebra [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is {{to explain the}} meaning of the {{expression}} "non- competition clause" and to analyse its legal regulation in Czech labour law. The reason why I chose this topic is that non-competition clause is a very dynamic subject with a lot of changes in a historical point of view as you can see above. First of all, non-competition clause is an instrument of labour law which protects an employer against the abuse of the company's confidential information, knowledge and other know-how by the employee. According to the Czech legislation, non- competition clause means a voluntary agreement between employer and employee whose purpose is to protect employer's interests by reducing employee's job opportunities which would have a competitive character to the employer after the determination of an employment with the employee. There are several conditions need to be achieved in order to conclude a <b>valid</b> non- competition <b>clause.</b> For example, this contract needs to be agreed in writing. Secondly, the non-competition <b>clause</b> may be <b>valid</b> for only a certain period of time, not exceeding one year. Moreover, an employer is obliged to pay the employee some kind of a financial compensation every month. The amount of this compensation needs to be at least one average monthly salary of the employee. This [...] ...|$|R
40|$|An âagreed damages clauseâ is a {{contractual}} provision {{whereby the}} parties agree on the damages one party must pay if that party breaches a term. A <b>valid</b> agreed damages <b>clause,</b> known as a âliquidated damages clauseâ, is enforceable. An invalid agreed damages clause, known as a âpenalty clauseâ, is not. The âpenalty ruleâ is the legal doctrine that discriminates between {{the two types of}} clauses. This thesis adopts a rights-based, interpretive and formalist methodology to examine the penalty rule as it has evolved, and exists today, in Anglo-Australian commercial law. The investigation proceeds in three parts. First, this thesis restates the law. It derives a principled account of the rule from the leading cases. Second, the thesis justifies the law as restated. It reveals a theory that rationally explains the penalty rule, providing good or legitimate reasons why the rule is as it is. Finally, this thesis refines the restated law in the light of its theoretical justification. It takes interpretive steps to improve the penalty rule, casting the rule in the best possible light. This thesis concludes that a penalty clause is best understood as requiring one party, upon a default, to incur a detriment that is manifestly excessive in light of the clauseâs legitimate function. The refined penalty rule invalidates a penalty clause by rendering it partially unenforceable. Also, this thesis illustrates that the rule encapsulates a principle of preventing consensual civil punishment, and that corrective justice norms justify that principle. As such, the penalty rule ultimately instantiates corrective justice. Further, this thesis demonstrates that a classificatory, correctivist theory scores extremely well on several criteria for evaluating private law theories. Such a rights-based theory is highly transparent, powerfully coherent, and practically beneficial. It also displays a tight fit with the current law. In short, this thesis concludes that, viewed in the best possible light, the penalty rule is certain, elegant and (correctively) just. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{question}} of whether follow-on cartel damages claims fall within the scope of a broadly phrased arbitration clause. Common rules and principles governing the assessment of arbitration clauses have been assumed and reflected against principles of EU law. The jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal is often based on an arbitration clause. In order for an arbitration clause to be binding, it must be valid. The regime of international arbitration has developed common rules and principles for assessing the validity of an arbitration clause. The development is a result of international regulations and model laws promulgated by international bodies and institutions. As all EU Member States are also Contracting States of the New York Convention, the provisions of the convention are reflected in legislation throughout the EU. This study divides these rules into two categories, formal and material. The focus of the study is on the material requirements, which include (i) arbitrability and (ii) scope of reference of the arbitration clause. National courts and arbitral tribunals consider these requirements when deciding on the jurisdiction of the case. Follow-on cartel damages are civil liability claims. The legal basis for follow-on cartel damages claims are found in Article 101 TFEU. The right to claim damages based on a cartel infringement forms a part of the private enforcement of EU competition law, seen to complement the public enforcement conducted by public authorities. EU law principles require an effective implementation of the rights conferred under EU law. The ECJ has stated that the principle of effective implementation may impact both procedural and substantive law. When assessing whether the material requirements of a <b>valid</b> arbitration <b>clause</b> are fulfilled under common rules and principles and national procedural law, national courts may have thus have to consider EU law, and EU competition law in particular. Despite {{the fact that it has}} only been implicitly stated by the ECJ, the arbitrability of competition law is generally acknowledged in the EU. Further, the Damages Directive explicitly states that follow-on cartel damages claims are arbitrable. From this follows that the scope of reference is the question primarily under scrutiny. There are different views on how to interpret the scope of reference. This study has divided the prevailing views into two categories: (i) the Inclusive and (ii) the Exclusive view. The Inclusive view pushes for a strong party autonomy, whereas the Exclusive view puts its emphasis on the foreseeability of follow-on damages claims and a narrow interpretation of the arbitration clause. EU law has not interfered with the common rules and principles for the assessment of the scope of reference. In fact, EU regulations regarding rules of jurisdiction exempt arbitration. Although the EU legislator does not in principle have general competence to regulate the civil proceedings of the Member States, the ECJ was asked to address the issue of whether a broadly phrased arbitration clause cover follow-on cartel damages claims. In its ruling the ECJ referred to a "lack of information" and only considered the scope of reference with respect to jurisdiction clauses governed under the Brussels I Regulation. The ECJ stated that the follow-on damages claims arising from competition law infringements were not within the scope of the jurisdiction clause, as they were not foreseeable. The ruling thus implicitly raised several questions regarding arbitration clauses. This study argues that an interpretation by analogy of the foreseeability requirement cannot be excluded. Further, a by-analogy interpretation may have consequences related to how arbitration clauses are drafted in the future. Additionally, this study argues that the principle of effectiveness of EU law may have an impact on the assessment of arbitration clauses. Finally, this study consists of a de lege ferenda discussion regarding whether the EU should set standards for the assessment of broadly phrased arbitration clauses. The suggestion is based on a recent legislative proposal from the US...|$|R
2500|$|The final [...] "certainty" [...] {{the courts}} require {{is to know}} to some {{reasonable}} degree who the beneficiaries are to be. Again, the courts have become increasingly flexible, and intend to uphold the trust if at all possible. In Re Gulbenkian's Settlements (1970) a wealthy Ottoman oil businessman and co-founder of the Iraq Petroleum Company, Calouste Gulbenkian, had left a will giving his trustees [...] "absolute discretion" [...] to pay money to his son Nubar Gulbenkian, and family, but then also anyone with whom Nubar had [...] "from time to time [...] employed or residing". This provision of the will was challenged (by the other potential beneficiaries, who wanted more themselves) as being too uncertain in regard to who the beneficiaries were meant to be. The House of Lords held that the will was still entirely valid, because even though one {{might not be able}} to draw up a definite list of everybody, the trustees and a court could be sufficiently certain, with evidence of anyone who [...] "did or did not" [...] employ or house Nubar. Similarly, this [...] "is or is not test" [...] was applied in McPhail v Doulton. Mr Betram Baden created a trust for the employees, relatives and dependants of his company, but also giving the trustees [...] "absolute discretion" [...] to determine who this was. The settlement was challenged (by the local council that would receive the remainder) on the ground that the idea of [...] "relatives" [...] and [...] "dependants" [...] was too uncertain. The House of Lords held the trust was clearly valid because a court could exercise the relevant power, and would do so [...] "to give effect to the settlor's or testator's intentions." [...] Unfortunately, when the case was remitted to the lower courts to determine what in fact the settlor's intentions were, in Re Baden's Deed Trusts, the judges in the Court of Appeal could not agree. All agreed the trust was sufficiently certain, but Sachs LJ thought it was only necessary to show that there was a [...] "conceptually certain" [...] class of beneficiaries, however small, and Megaw LJ thought a class of beneficiaries had to have [...] "at least a substantial number of objects", while Stamp LJ believed that the court should restrict the definition of [...] "relative" [...] or [...] "dependant" [...] to something clear, such as [...] "next of kin". The Court of Appeal in Re Tuck's Settlement Trusts was more clear. An art publisher who had Jewish background, Baronet Adolph Tuck, wished to create a trust for people who were [...] "of Jewish blood". Because of mixing of faiths and ancestors over generations, this could have meant a very large number of people, but in the view of Lord Denning MR the trustees could simply decide. Also the will had stated that the Chief Rabbi of London could resolve any doubts, and so it was valid for a second reason. Lord Russell agreed, although on this point Eveleigh LJ dissented, and stated that the trust was only <b>valid</b> with Rabbi <b>clause.</b> Divergent views in some cases continued. In Re Barlow's Will Trusts, Browne-Wilkinson J held that concepts (like [...] "friend") could always be restricted, as a last resort, to prevent a trust failing. By contrast in one highly political case, a High Court judge found that the West Yorkshire County Council's plan to make a discretionary trust to distribute £400,000 [...] "for the benefit of any or all of the inhabitants" [...] of West Yorkshire, with the aim to inform people about the effects of the council's impending abolition by Margaret Thatcher's government, failed because it was (apparently) [...] "unworkable". It remained unclear whether some courts' attachment to strict certainty requirements was consistent with the principles of equitable flexibility.|$|R
