40|$|Abstract Background Suction drains are {{routinely}} used after {{modified radical mastectomy}} and are an important factor contributing to increased hospital stay as the patients are often discharged only after their removal. Amongst various factors that influence the amount of postoperative drainage, the negative suction pressure applied to the drain {{has been reported to}} be of great significance. While a high negative suction pressure is expected to drain the collection and reduce the dead space promptly, it may also prevent the leaking lymphatics from closing and lead to increased drainage from the wound. Against this background a prospective randomized clinical study was conducted to compare the amount and duration of drainage between a half negative <b>suction</b> and full <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drainage in patients following modified radical mastectomy. The associated postoperative morbidity was also compared between the two groups. Methods 85 FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) proven cases of locally advanced breast cancer were randomized. (Using randomly ordered sealed envelops, which were opened immediately before the closure of the wound) in to 50 patients with full <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> (pressure = 700 g/m 2) and 35 cases in to half <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drainage (pressure = 350 g/m 2) groups. The two groups were comparable in respect of age, weight, and technique of operation and extent of axillary dissection. Surgery was performed by the same surgical team comprising of five surgeons (two senior and three resident surgeons) using a standardized technique with electrocautery. External compression dressing was provided over the axilla for first 48 hrs and following that patients were encouraged to do active and passive shoulder exercises. The outcomes measured were postoperative morbidity and the length of hospital stay. Statistical methods used: Descriptive studies were performed with SPSS version 10 and group characteristics were compared using student t-test. Results Half <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drains were removed earlier than the full <b>suction</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drains. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of seroma formation in the two groups and there was a significant reduction in the total hospital stay in patients with half <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drainage <b>systems</b> as compared to the full suction drainage group (p Conclusions Half negative suction drains provide an effective compromise between no suction and full or high suction drainage after modified radical mastectomy by reducing the hospital stay and the post operative morbidity including post operative seromas. </p...|$|R

This study aimed to identify and quantify {{the extent of the}} problems using 25 DCUs, methodically eliminate these problems and develop an efficient approach for reliable, effective, automated disinfection. MethodsDCU <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> residual contamination by environmental and human-derived bacteria was evaluated by microbiological culture following standard aspiration disinfection with a quaternary ammonium disinfectant or alternatively, a novel flooding approach to disinfection. Disinfection of multicomponent suction handpieces, assembled and disassembled, was also studied. A prototype manual and a novel automated <b>Suction</b> Tube Cleaning <b>System</b> (STCS) were developed and tested, as were novel single component suction handpieces. ResultsStandard aspiration disinfection consistently failed to decontaminate DCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> effectively. Semi-confluent bacterial growth (101 – 500 colony forming units (CFU) per culture plate) was recovered from up to 60 % of suction filter housings and from up to 19 % of high and 37 % of low volume suction hoses. Manual and automated flood disinfection of DCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> reduced this dramatically (ranges for filter cage and high and low volume hoses of 0 – 22, 0 – 16 and 0 – 14 CFU/plate, respectively) (P< 0. 0001). Multicomponent suction handpieces could not be adequately disinfected without prior removal and disassembly. Novel single component handpieces, allowed their effective disinfection in situ using the STCS, which virtually eliminated contamination from the entire <b>suction</b> <b>system.</b> ConclusionFlood disinfection of DCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> and single component handpieces radically improves disinfection efficacy and considerably reduces potential cross-infection and cross-contamination risks. Clinical significanceDCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> become heavily contaminated during use. Conventional disinfection does not adequately control this. Furthermore, multicomponent suction handpieces cannot be adequately disinfected without disassembly, which is costly in time, staff and resources.

The thermodynamic analysis gave low isosteric heats of adsorption, which are typical for physical adsorption. The cyclic CO 2 adsorption on MSP(EDA) {{showed that the}} adsorbed CO 2 could be effectively desorbed via thermal treatment at 120 degrees C for 25 min while the adsorbed CO 2 due to physical interaction could be effectively desorbed via <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> at 0. 145 bar for 30 min. If a combination of thermal treatment and <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> was conducted at 120 degrees C and 0. 145 bar, the time for effectively desorbing CO 2 could be shortened to 7. 5 min and thus reduces {{a significant amount of}} energy penalty. The adsorption capacities and the physicochemical properties of MSP(EDA) were preserved after 15 cycles of adsorption and regeneration. These results suggest that the MSP(EDA) can be stably employed in the prolonged cyclic adsorption and that they are thus possibly cost-effective sorbents for CO 2 capture from flue gases.

40|$|An {{important}} {{message in the}} report of A. T. M. Tang and associates [1] concerns the essential role of continuous vacuum in sternotomy wound infections healing process. Dressings by polyurethane foam sealed by transparent adhe-sive drape in fact are changed only once every 48 h, since wound toilette and purulent material removal actually relies on a sophisticate intermittent high <b>suction</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>system.</b> We have adopted a conceptually similar, closed technique for super®cial wound infections. After a favourable experi-ence with a two stage approach [2], consisting in prelimin-ary debridement, followed, a few days later, by a surgical closure {{by means of a}}dvancement ¯aps and multiple high suctions drains, we now carry out primary closure of the infected super®cial tissues. When a super®cial sternal wound infection is diagnosed, surgical debridement is carried out; a suf®cient number of small high suction drains (Riplast; Neukirchen-Saar, Germany) are positioned and the skin is immediately closed by means of a continuous mono-®lament suture. High suction is continued until no more material is drained, usually after 7 ± 8 days. We have treated 15 patients by this method with good results; only in one case a further debridement was necessary with second inten-tion healing. Cosmetic results were very satisfactorily in the remaining 14 patients. Mean hospital stay after infection diagnosis was 9 ^ 2 days. We believe that, when possible, immediate skin closure after debridement over an ef®cient and continuous vacuum system, may be in most cases as effective as the polyurethane foam and adhesive sealant drape medication, offering better cosmetic results...|$|R
