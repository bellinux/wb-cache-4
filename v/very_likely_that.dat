5|$|It is {{not known}} whether Eorpwald was baptised in East Anglia, Northumbria or Kent, but it is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Edwin, now the senior ruler, was present as his sponsor. Higham {{suggests}} {{that because of the}} lack of proper facilities in East Anglia, it is likely that he was baptised by Paulinus at Edwin's centre of authority in Northumbria. The manner of Eorpwald's conversion indicated that he was a subordinate king and that Edwin was his overlord.|$|E
5|$|Some areas were, in fact, {{decorated}} with gold: the shields between the Ignudi and the columns between the Prophets and Sibyls. It seems <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the gilding of the shields {{was part of}} Michelangelo's original scheme, since they are painted to resemble {{a certain type of}} parade shield, a number of which still exist and are decorated in a similar style with gold.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of Gubazes's {{accession}} is unknown, but it {{must not}} have been much earlier than 541, when he is first attested as king of the Lazi. It is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> before his accession he had lived for several years at the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, for he is recorded {{to have been a}} silentiarius, an influential position at the imperial palace; alternatively, but less probably, he may have been given the title as an honorary appointment after his accession.|$|E

5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|The {{well-developed}} compound {{eyes were}} stalked. The striking morphological similarities {{of the eyes}} of Waptia fieldensis to that of extant mysid shrimp make it <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> they were capable of producing true visual images or were at least sensitive to motion. A median eye may have also been present. Nervous tissue, including a putative brain, has been identified.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{a symbol}} of the Punic-Phoenician goddess Tanit, all {{pavement}} motifs are typically Hellenistic Greek in origin, although some pavement mortars used with tesserae designs betray some Italian influence. Although the three major ethnic groups of Delos included Greeks (largely of Athenian origin), Syrians/Phoenicians, and Italians/Romans, it is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> many of these Italians were Italiotes, Greek-speaking natives of Magna Graecia in what is now southern Italy. Delian inhabitants of either Greek, Italian, and Syrian origins owned mosaics in their private households, but Vincent J. Bruno asserts that the designs of their mosaic artworks were indebted entirely to Greek artistic traditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Siletzia began in 1906 with Arnold's description and naming {{of a small}} exposure {{on the north side}} of the Olympic Peninsula near Port Crescent. Though this exposure is small, he recognized as <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> much more of it was buried under younger deposits. With recognition that similar rock exposed at other outcrops is part of the same formation, the name Crescent Formation is now generally applied to all early and middle Eocene basalts on the Olympic Peninsula and Puget Lowland.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{continued to}} intensify, although the NHC anticipated strengthening to cease, because the hurricane {{was expected to}} move into areas of colder sea surface temperatures. During this period, the winds of the system increased and Fausto became a Category 4 hurricane. Becoming a Category4 hurricane, Fausto attained its peak intensity, with winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 936mbar (hPa; 27.64inHg). After attaining peak intensity, the NHC again noted that it was <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Fausto attained its peak intensity, as it was nearing a region of sea surface temperatures less than 78°F (26°C).|$|E
5|$|Apolinario de la Cruz {{was born}} on July 22, 1815 in Barrio Pandác {{in the town of}} Lucban in Tayabas {{province}} (now Quezon Province) back when the Philippines was a colony of the Spanish Empire. His parents—Pablo de la Cruz and Juana Andres—were peasants and devout Catholics. Dela Cruz was literate, but stated that he had no formal education. Despite that, it is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> he received primary religious instruction and attended the local public primary school in Lucban. In 1829, he decided to become a priest and tried to join the Order of Preachers in Manila. During those times, Roman Catholic religious orders barred indios (native people of the Philippines) from joining, thus de la Cruz's application was rejected for the sole reason of his race. He then decided to work as a donado (lay brother) at the San Juan de Dios Hospital where he was admitted to the Cofradía de San Juan de Dios, a brotherhood affiliated with the hospital and was open to indios. During this time, he improved his public speaking and studied the Bible along with other religious writings.|$|E

5|$|The subfamilies of Dromaeosauridae {{frequently}} {{shift in}} content based on new analysis, but typically consist {{of the following}} groups. A number of dromaeosaurids have not been assigned to any particular subfamily, often because they are too poorly preserved to be placed confidently in phylogenetic analysis (see section Phylogeny below), or because they are basal relative to the primary subdivisions of Dromaeosauridae (Mahakala, for example, is the most primitive known dromaeosaurid and falls outside any named sub-group). The most basal subfamily of dromaeosaurids is often {{found to be the}} Unenlagiinae. This enigmatic group is the most poorly supported subfamily of dromaeosaurids and it is possible that some or all of its members belong outside of Dromaeosauridae. The larger, ground-dwelling members like Buitreraptor and Unenlagia show strong flight adaptations, although they were probably too large to 'take off'. One member of this group, Rahonavis, is very small, with well-developed wings that show evidence of quill knobs (the attachment points for flight feathers) and it is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> it could fly. The next most primitive clade of dromaeosaurids is the Microraptoria. This group includes many of the smallest dromaeosaurids, which show adaptations for living in trees. All known dromaeosaurid skin impressions hail from this group and all show an extensive covering of feathers and well-developed wings. Like the unenlagiines, some species may have been capable of active flight. The subfamily Velociraptorinae has traditionally included Velociraptor, Deinonychus, and Saurornitholestes, and while the discovery of Tsaagan lent support to this grouping, the inclusion of Saurornitholestes is still uncertain. The Dromaeosaurinae is usually found to consist of medium to giant-sized species, with generally box-shaped skulls (the other subfamilies generally have narrower snouts).|$|E

50|$|Even so, for {{orthodox}} probabilists {{the second}} and third principles are primary, so the first principle is rejected.
