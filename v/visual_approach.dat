5|$|Just {{under five}} {{seconds after the}} {{undercarriage}} left the ground, the plane's left wing scraped against the asphalt for 110 feet and the stick shaker activated. The crew received six stall warnings, before the jet began banking to the left, then to the right, {{and then to the}} left again, still only several meters above the ground. The aircraft struck two <b>visual</b> <b>approach</b> slope indicator posts, touched down again for approximately 100 feet, before lifting off again and striking an ILS beacon and a water pump house.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1945, a second B-29 (Bockscar), piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, lifted off with Fat Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the {{electrical}} safety plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a <b>visual</b> <b>approach</b> as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works {{in the south and}} the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the Urakami Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200–28,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers. Overall, an estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{encourage}} debate about the use of creative <b>visual</b> <b>approaches</b> in intellectual disability research and discussion about Internet publication of photographs. Image-based research with people with intellectual disability is explored within the contexts of tighter ethical regulation of social research, increased interest in the use of visual methodologies, and rapid escalation in the numbers of digital images posted on the World Wide Web. Concern is raised about the possibility that tighter ethical regulation of social research, combined with the multitude of ethical issues raised by the use of image-based approaches may be discouraging the use of creative <b>visual</b> <b>approaches</b> in intellectual disability research. Inclusion in research through the use of accessible research methods is also an ethical issue, particularly in relation to those people who have hitherto been underrepresented in research. <b>Visual</b> <b>approaches</b> which have the potential to include people with profound and multiple intellectual disabilities are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the severity of impending losses of separation (LOSs) is proposed. It {{is based on the}} FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) separation conformance category for classification of operational errors. A recently proposed short-term conflict detection algorithm for terminal airspace is enhanced with this severity concept. The alerts from the resulting algorithm are compared with the Conflict Alert (CA) currently in the field, which is a legacy system for automated short-term conflict detection. Three complementary sets of aircraft track data are employed. The first set is real-world data with documented LOSs due to operational errors. It allows determination of average alert lead time while providing regression testing of the algorithm. The second set is realistic data from human-in-the-loop experiments with no <b>visual</b> <b>approaches</b> allowed and with known intervention from controllers or pilots available. As a result more objective determination of false alert rate is possible. The third set is real-world data with unknown mixed operations of Instrument Landing System (ILS) and <b>visual</b> <b>approaches</b> but with CA alerting data available from the FAA. The comparison with CA indicates that the algorithm produces a similar total number of alerts but with a much larger safety buffer and a much lower false alert rate. The study also suggests that a high-severity conflict prediction option may be used for aircraft performing <b>visual</b> <b>approaches</b> to satisfy the controller’s moral responsibility for those aircraft.

25|$|On May 2012, the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) {{released}} its final {{report on the}} investigation. It determined that a <b>visual</b> <b>approach</b> {{should not have been}} attempted due to low visibility. There was no checklist reading or crew briefing. The flight crew lacked situation awareness while trying to locate the runway and while performing the go-around. The aircraft entered a rapid descent during the go-around due to a 38-degree left roll and crew commanded flap retraction from 15 to 0 degrees. Both crew members had low experience and flying time on type. The inadequacy and ineffectiveness of the training program may lead to actions that deviate from standard operating procedure and that regress to a previous aircraft type.|$|E

Not least a departure in subject matter, Kundun also saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and <b>visual</b> <b>approach.</b> Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate tableau of colorful visual images. The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, Buena Vista Pictures, which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting Kundun’s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it generally appears Kundun has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. Kundun was the director's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following The Last Temptation of Christ.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for developing less anthropocentric approaches to researching human-nonhuman relations through visual ethnography, critically examining {{the potential for}} conceptualising nonhuman animals as participants. Arguing that method in “more-than-human geography” and animal studies has developed {{at a slower pace}} than theory, it proposes <b>visual</b> <b>approaches</b> as a means through which to foreground the behaviour and actions of nonhuman animals in social research. This challenges underlying anthropocentric assumptions of visual ethnography, questioning the meaning of “participation” in visual research. The paper presents a comparison of approaches used in studying practices of robotic milking on dairy farms in the UK. Specifically, it compares the qualities of field notes, still photography and digital video in focusing on particular sites, moments and movements of robotic milking. While <b>visual</b> <b>approaches</b> are not a panacea for more-than-human research, we suggest that they do offer a means through which nonhumans might “speak for themselves” in social research. Rather than presenting definitive accounts, the inclusion of video in such work not only illustrates arguments but also leaves the actions of nonhumans open to further interpretation; the centrality of the researcher is destabilised...|$|R
