40|$|AIM: Topographically {{modified}} substrates {{are increasingly}} used in tissue engineering to enhance biomimicry. The overarching {{hypothesis is that}} topographical cues will control cellular response at the cell-substrate interface. MATERIALS & METHODS: The influence of anisotropically ordered poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) substrates (constant groove width of ~ 1860 nm; constant line width of ~ 2220 nm; <b>variable</b> <b>groove</b> depth of ~ 35, 306 and 2046 nm) on in vitro and in vivo osteogenesis were assessed. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: We demonstrate that substrates with groove depths of approximately 306 and 2046 nm promote osteoblast alignment parallel to underlined topography in vitro.

40|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>groove</b> depth grating {{waveguide}} couplers (VGDGWCs) {{can be used}} {{to couple}} light into or out of planar waveguides. In principle an out-coupled light beam with any arbitrary irradiance profile can be obtained. VGDGWCs that produce out-coupled beams exhibiting a Gaussian irradiance profile are examined in this report. An expression for the grating groove depth variation necessary to produce Gaussian beams from VGDGWCs is derived. The design of a VGDGWC using two different materials for the host planar waveguide is presented. The designs are optimized with a consideration of the waveguide materials, the fabrication process, and the out-coupled beam quality. Two methods, that utilize ion etching to fabricate VGDGWCs are presented. Each method operates by limiting the cross sectional area of an ion beam. A scanning slit is used for one method and a moving variable width aperture is employed for the second. The ion etching process for each of the fabrication methods is characterized by a series of ion beam etching experiments. The results from the ion beam etching experiments are used to optimize the fabrication process. The variable width aperture fabrication method in combination with a post etching process, is found to produce the optimum results. The measured irradiance profile and the wavefront quality of the out-coupled beams from the fabricated VGDGWCs are compared to theory. The variable width aperture fabrication method is found to produce out-coupled beams with a nearly perfect Gaussian irradiance profile. The measured wavefront quality of out-coupled beams shows good agreement with theory...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{scaffolds}} {{can provide}} a promising alternative to antibodies for various biomedical and biotechnological applications, including therapeutics. Here we describe the design {{and development of the}} Alphabody, a protein scaffold featuring a single-chain antiparallel triple-helix coiled-coil fold. We report affinity-matured Alphabodies with favourable physicochemical properties that can specifically neutralize human interleukin (IL) - 23, a pivotal therapeutic target in autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. The crystal structure of human IL- 23 in complex with an affinity-matured Alphabody reveals how the <b>variable</b> interhelical <b>groove</b> of the scaffold uniquely targets a large epitope on the p 19 subunit of IL- 23 to harness fully the hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding potential of tryptophan and tyrosine residues contributed by p 19 and the Alphabody, respectively. Thus, Alphabodies are suitable for targeting protein-protein interfaces of therapeutic importance and can be tailored to interrogate desired design and binding-mode principles via efficient selection and affinity-maturation strategies...|$|R

40|$|Apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), {{the major}} protein {{component}} of high-density lipoprotein, {{has been proven}} inversely correlated to cardiovascular risk in past decades. The lipid-free state of apo A-I is the initial stage which binds to lipids forming high-density lipoprotein. Molecular models of lipid-free apo A-I have been reported by methods like X-ray crystallography and chemical cross-linking/mass spectrometry (CCL/MS). Through structural analysis we found that those current models had limited consistency with other experimental results, such as those from hydrogen exchange with mass spectrometry. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we also found those models could not reach a stable equilibrium state. Therefore, by integrating various experimental results, we proposed a new structural model for lipid-free apo A-I, which contains a bundled four-helix N-terminal domain (1 - 192) that forms a <b>variable</b> hydrophobic <b>groove</b> and a mobile short hairpin C-terminal domain (193 - 243). This model exhibits an equilibrium state through molecular dynamics simulation and is consistent {{with most of the}} experimental results known from CCL/MS on lysine pairs, fluorescence resonance energy transfer and hydrogen exchange. This solution-state lipid-free apo A-I model may elucidate the possible conformational transitions of apo A-I binding with lipids in high-density lipoprotein formation...|$|R

5000|$|The adult Peaks of Otter {{salamander}} {{is characterized}} by a dark-brown dorsum with heavy brassy flecking down its entire length. The dorsum and sides of P. hubrichti may also be lightly speckled with white, while the venter is not spotted and ranges from light to charcoal grey in color. Males have small mental glands immediately behind the chin. [...] While the Peaks of Otter salamander is superficially similar to the Cheat Mountain salamander (P. nettingi), the two species are differentiated by a higher concentration of metallic flecking on the dorsum of P. hubrichti, and the presence of a usual 19 costal grooves compared to the <b>variable</b> 17-19 costal <b>grooves</b> of P. nettingi. [...] Although Petranka stated that hatchlings have a distinct dorsal stripe consisting of reddish spots, this was never seen in over 100 neonates observed, which have a uniform dark-grey dorsum. Brassy flecks begin to appear when salamanders reach about 25 mm snout-to-vent length.|$|R
40|$|Modern factory {{crushing}} units process prepared {{sugar cane}} through sets of counter-rotating grooved rolls. A typical unit in Australia would process {{in excess of}} 600 tonnes of material per hour. Throughput and extraction performance {{is strongly dependent on}} material behaviour, the geometry and surface condition at the roll bagasse interface. Factories use welding procedures to arc roughen the tips of grooves in an effort to increase friction. Although industry procedures appear ad hoc it is clear that some level of roughness is crucial to performance. A similar statement can be made in respect to roll grooving given the wide variation in adopted practice. This project involved an experimental investigation into the effects of interface friction on bagasse compaction between grooved steel platens. An apparatus was developed for use in the SOE MTS testing facility. A factorial design experiment involving 105 tests randomised in blocks was conducted to discover the interaction between friction (the dependent <b>variable)</b> and <b>groove</b> angle, compaction, and roughness (independent variables). The results indicate that roughness, groove angle and compaction significantly affect friction coefficient. While roughness and groove angle contribute to increase friction coefficient, compaction causes a marked decrease. Observations on samples of bagasse exhibiting pure shear suggest that the frictional forces generated at the interface cannot be sustained by the shear strength of bagasse. Comparisons between friction coefficient and shear coefficient showed that the friction coefficient values approach the shear coefficient values under particular geometric and loading conditions. An empirical model was developed to explore variables. The effect of groove angle, degree of roughness (location and size of roughened asperity) and sample compaction on friction has been ascertained...|$|R
40|$|If an {{initially}} planar isotropic {{surface of}} a material is roughened with parallel grooves, its surface area and hence total surface free energy will increase. The roughened surface experiences a capillary driving force (i. e., a diffusion potential) equal to γ(K 1 + K 2) ≡ γκ such that curved regions of the surface tend to move toward their center of curvature. The equations governing the smoothing kinetics depend on the transport mechanism that is active. • When transport occurs by surface diffusion, the surface flux {{is proportional to the}} gradient of curvature along the surface (approximately the third derivative of the surface height profile h(x,t) with respect to x). The rate of change of height is equal to the divergence of the flux, and thus to the fourth derivative of h(x,t) with respect to x. The resulting evolution equation (see KoM Eq. 14. 10) can be solved using separation of <b>variables.</b> For sinusoidal <b>groove</b> shapes the amplitude of the grooves decays as exp[−t/λ 4] (see KoM Eq. 14. 13). • When surfaces evolve by transport through the vapor, the surface moves by a process of evaporation and/or condensation. The normal velocity of the surface is proportional to the vapor flux, and matter in the solid is not conserved. The flux in the vapor is proportional to the difference between the ambient pressure and the vapor pressure in local equilibrium with a surface element with curvature κ (see Ko...|$|R
40|$|Background: Prevention of {{slipping}} accidents requires {{provision of}} adequate friction {{through the use}} of suitable combinations of footwear and underfoot surfaces. Shoe sole tread groove is one of the important factors on friction coefficient during walking. Objective: To measure the effect of different shoe sole tread groove depths and different surfaces on the required quotient of friction (Q), heel strike velocity and occurrence time of ground reaction forces (GRF) in stance phase during walking on slippery and dry surfaces. Methods: In this semi-experimental study, 22 healthy men were studied under different conditions. The studied independent <b>variables</b> were shoe <b>groove</b> depths (included 1, 2. 5 and 5 mm) and type of walking surface (dry and slippery). Biomechanical gait analysis was carried out with 396 single steps. Data were collected by motion analysis system and two force platform. Results: The occurrence time of GRF was significantly faster on dry surface than slippery surface (p< 0. 01). Q was significantly lower on slippery surface and with groove depths of 1 and 2. 5 mm. The highest value of Q was observed with the deepest groove depth of 5 mm. Heel strike velocity did not differ significantly in the 6 conditions tested. Conclusion: Tread groove depth is a significant factor affecting the Q at the shoes-surface interface on dry and slippery floors. It seems that deeper groove is more appropriate for maintaining the stability during walking. The walking surface affects the occurrence time of GRF; the force components occur sooner on the dry than slippery surface. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to address the scope for hybrid laser-GMAW process {{improvement}} using controlled dip transfer and a high power diode laser in single and twin spot modes. It is suggested that an optimum {{combination of the two}} sources of thermal energy can enhance the speed and quality of single sided butt welds. The objectives of the current work were therefore, to investigate the process control possibilities, performance characteristics and the processes interactions of twin beam hybrid laser-GMAW welding. Since no appropriate twin beam system existed it was also necessary to design and build an experimental system. This research was made possible by using a power source which enabled flexible computer control of the GMAW current waveform and a 3 kW high power diode laser. Weld beads were produced to study the basic operating parameters for the individual arc and laser processes and these were compared with those of combined process with laser in single and twin spot modes. Bead geometry and the current waveforms captured by the data acquisition system were used to evaluate the welding processes performance. <b>Variables</b> such as <b>groove</b> shape and shielding gas were also found to be critical for full penetration of butt joints on plates. CO 2 produced weld bead with deeper penetration than with Ar based gas mixtures. A novel hybrid welding head was design and implemented to investigate the process using an extended heat source (as in multicathode GTAW and tandem GMAW) to create an elongated weld pool through the use of laser-GMAW with dual laser spots leading and trailing the GMAW heat source. To understand the process control mechanisms, a 3 D finite element model was created and implemented to analyze the temperature distribution resulting from the arc and mutual effects of the arc and laser heat sources...|$|R
