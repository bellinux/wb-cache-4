50|$|Variants at carnivals {{became popular}} in the late 20th century. With this variant, the recipe is more {{flexible}} {{so that it can}} be manufactured in smaller, mobile places, rendering it much cheaper. In this variant, butter can be replaced by vegetable oil or margarine, and milk by milk powder. Moreover, eggs can be replaced by egg powder or liquid eggs, but this ingredient can also be omitted. In exchange, grated lemon zest, natural citrus extract or citrus juice, rum or <b>vanilla</b> sugar <b>powder</b> can be added to the dough.

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{olfactory}} testings are {{subjective and}} since they depend upon the patients' response, they are prone to false positive results. The {{aim of this study}} was to use quantitative brain perfusion SPECT in order to detect possible areas of brain activation in response to odorant stimulation in patients with post-traumatic impaired smell in comparison to a group of normal subjects. Methods Fourteen patients with post-traumatic impaired smell and ten healthy controls were entered in this prospective study. All subjects underwent brain SPECT after intravenous injection of 740 -MBq 99 m Tc-ECD and 48 hours later, the same procedure was repeated following olfactory stimulus (<b>vanilla</b> <b>powder).</b> Results In most of seven regions of interest (Orbital Frontal Cortex, Inferior Frontal Pole, Superior Frontal Pole, Posterior Superior Frontal Lobe, Parasagittal Area, Occipital Pole, and Cerebellar area) the post-stimulation quantitative values show increased cortical perfusion being more pronounced in normal volunteers than the anosmic patients (except cerebellar areas and the right occipital pole). Maximal activation was observed in orbitofrontal regions (right+ 25. 45 % and left + 25. 47 %). Conclusion Brain SPECT is a valuable imaging technique in the assessment of post-traumatic anosmia and could be competitive as an alternative to other imaging techniques, especially when functional MRI is unavailable or unsuitable. However, this procedure may benefit from complementary MRI or CT anatomical imaging. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Most {{olfactory}} testings are {{subjective and}} since they depend upon the patients' response, they are prone to false positive results. The {{aim of this study}} was to use quantitative brain perfusion SPECT in order to detect possible areas of brain activation in response to odorant stimulation in patients with post-traumatic impaired smell in comparison to a group of normal subjects. Methods: Fourteen patients with post-traumatic impaired smell and ten nonanosmic controls were entered in this prospective study. All subjects underwent brain SPECT after intravenous injection of 740 -MBq 99 mTc-ECD and 48 hours later, the same procedure was repeated following olfactory stimulus (<b>vanilla</b> <b>powder).</b> Results: In most of seven regions of interest (Orbital Frontal Cortex, Inferior Frontal Pole, Superior Frontal Pole, Posterior Superior Frontal Lobe, Parasagittal Area, Occipital Pole, and Cerebellar area) the post-stimulation quantitative values show increased cortical perfusion being more pronounced in normal volunteers than the anosmic patients (except cerebellar areas and the right occipital pole). Maximal activation was observed in orbitofrontal regions (right+ 25. 45 % and left + 25. 47 %). Conclusion: Brain SPECT is a valuable imaging technique in the assessment of post-traumatic anosmia and could be competitive and/or as an alternative to other imaging techniques, especially when functional MRI is unavailable or unsuitable. However, this procedure may benefit from complementary role of MRI or CT anatomical imaging modalities. Further studies are needed to validate the clinical implication of these findings...|$|E

5000|$|A June 2010 {{investigation}} by Consumer Reports, a US consumer advocacy magazine, found {{that two of}} Cytosport's Muscle Milk products contained levels of heavy metals near or exceeding levels proposed by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). Muscle Milk's Chocolate powder had four heavy metals, and three of these metals {{were found to be}} {{at the highest levels of}} all the health drinks tested. Average cadmium levels of 5.6 µg in three daily servings exceeded the USP limit of 5 µg per day, and the average lead level of 13.5 µg also topped the USP limit of 10 µg per day. The average arsenic level of 12.2 µg was near the USP limit of 15 µg per day. Muscle Milk's <b>Vanilla</b> Crème <b>powder</b> had 12.2 µg of lead in three daily servings, exceeding the lead limits, and 11.2 µg of arsenic. In response, CytoSport said, [...] "Importantly, the tests underscored the fact that Muscle Milk Chocolate liquid shakes, by far and away our company's most popular consumer form of Muscle Milk, did not exceed the proposed maximum levels of any heavy metals tested, even when used three times per day." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{maple syrup}} event was the {{objective}} {{presence of a}} particular scent in New York City, and the response to this smell by the residents, various media outlets, and government agencies. Reports of the events {{are said to have}} begun in the fall of 2005, and continued sporadically into early 2009. New Yorkers feared the sweet smell was a form of chemical warfare. The scent was eventually traced to its source, a Frutarom Industries Ltd. factory in northern New Jersey, which was processing fenugreek seeds, commonly used in maple syrup substitutes. This source was traced through a collaborative process between the citizens of New York City, the city's 311 system, the New York City Office of Emergency Management, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, and a working group which gathered and analyzed atmospheric data. The ingredient was fenugreek seeds, which was commonly used in many sweets including curry <b>powder,</b> <b>vanilla</b> flavoring, and an imitation of pancakes.|$|R
40|$|The aglutenics {{biscuits}} {{are intended}} to those persons who are suffering due to gluten intolerance, also named celiac disease. The fabrication technologies of the aglutenics products can be developed in on two ways: by separating the gluten from the grain or by replacing the grain flour {{with other types of}} gluten less flour, in case of bakery and pastry products. In this experiment, the gluten-free biscuits were obtained from the following flours mixture: maize flour (MF), rice flour (RF) and soybeans flour (SF). Other raw materials were used, such as: palmtree oil, honey, maize starch, eggs, sugar <b>powdered,</b> <b>vanilla</b> essence and sodium bicarbonate. Four experimental variants (gluten-free biscuits) were obtained by varying the proportion of flours; these variants were coded as follows T 1, T 2 T 3 and T 4. The optimization of the aglutenics biscuits manufacture recipe was realized through sensory analyze, using the hedonic test (9 point scale). Samples of biscuits was subjected to the following physico-chemical analysis: moisture content, alkalinity, total carbohydrate content, total fat and protein content. Also the physical properties (length, width, thickness, weight and spread ratio) were determined in order to asses the blending influence on the biscuits quality. The blend with flour levels 30 : 30 : 40 (MF:RF:SF) led to the highest acceptability. </p...|$|R
