40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to compare the {{environmental}} impacts of two production processes of tissue paper using <b>virgin</b> <b>pulp</b> (virgin fiber) or waste paper pulp (recycled fiber). This comparison is based on the materials and energy used as well as emissions and waste resulting from the production of tissue paper. Life cycle assessment (LCA), ReCiPe method, was chosen as the analysis tool. The results of the research proved that electricity has the most considerable participation in the overall environmental impacts in both production processes, followed by either <b>virgin</b> <b>pulp</b> or heat. Consequently, these two production processes are the greatest contributors to the following midpoint environmental impact categories: human toxicity, climate change, human health and ecosystems, and fossil depletion. The analysis based on endpoint impact categories proved that the production process based on waste paper is more environmentally friendly than the one based on <b>virgin</b> <b>pulp</b> in all impact categories: human health, ecosystems, resources. This is largely because of its lower material and energy requirements in the entire life cycle.

The {{objective of this}} research is to investigate whether the use of new coatings (micro or nano TiO 2) and different pulp types could bring savings in wood, energy, GHG emissions and other environmental impacts in comparison with conventional printing and writing paper. We studied three types of pulp, namely i) unbleached <b>virgin</b> kraft <b>pulp,</b> ii) recovered fiber, and iii) high yield <b>virgin</b> chemithermo-mechanical <b>pulp</b> (CTMP). A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted from cradle to grave. Applying attributional modeling, we found that wood savings amount to 60 % for the nanoparticle coated recovered fiber paper and 35 % for the micro TiO 2 coated CTMP paper. According to the ReCiPe single score impact assessment method, the new product configurations allow the reduction of the environmental impacts by 10 â 35 % compared to conventional kraft paper. Applying consequential modeling,we found larger energy and GHG emission savings compared to attributional modeling because the saved wood is used for producing energy, thereby replacing fossil fuels. The nanoparticle coated recovered fiber paper offered savings of non-renewable energy use (NREU) by 100 % (13 GJ/ton paper) and GHG emission reduction by 75 % (0. 6 ton CO 2 eq. /ton paper). Micro TiO 2 coated CTMP paper offered NREU savings by 25 % (3 GJ/ton paper) and savings of GHG emissions by 10 % (0. 1 ton CO 2 eq. /ton paper). The taking into account of all environmental impacts with the ReCiPe single score method leads to comparable results as that of attributional modeling. We conclude that the nanoparticle coated recovered fiber paper offered the highest savings and lowest environmental impacts. However, human toxicity and ecotoxicity impacts of the nanoparticles were not included in this analysis and need further research.

If so, is maximal {{paper recycling}} the best policy to optimize the life cycle of the pulp and paper sector? We explore these questions using an approach that combines materials accounting methods and optimization techniques. Environmental impact data are inputs for a linear programming network flow model to find optimal configurations for the sector. These configurations consist of a mix of different pulping technologies, a geographical distribution of pulp and paper production, and a level of recycling consistent with the lowest environmental impacts. We use the model to analyse scenarios with different recycling strategies. Recycling offers a reduction in environmental impact in regions with a high population and a large production of paper and board products. Regions with a large production of graphic products should focus on cleaner <b>virgin</b> <b>pulp</b> production with energy recovery.

TyÃ¶n tavoitteena on arvioida erilaisten raaka-aineiden soveltuvuutta prosessiin koeajotulosten pohjalta sekÃ¤ tarkastella saavutettuja massan laatuarvoja ja niiden soveltuvuutta erilaisiin paperi- ja kartonkituotteisiin. Ominaisuuksiltaan uusiokuitu on aina ensikuitua heikompi. KuivajÃ¤tteestÃ¤ voidaan prosessilla erottaa kuitua, joka laadultaan kelpaa ainakin ruskeisiin pakkausmateriaaleihin. Despite of {{increasingly}} effective recycling {{the amount of}} waste keeps on growing in Finland as well as in many other countries. Landfill is still the most common place for waste and there ends up a lot of recyclable material like fibre that {{could be used as a}} raw material for recycled fibre pulp. Metso Paper has developed a process that can separate fibre and plastic from a dry waste. They have built a pilot-process to show that fibre recovery from the waste is both possible and financially profitable. The beginning of this thesis examines properties and applications of recycled fibre. Utilisation of dry waste as a raw material for recycled paper and plastic is concerned as well. Target is to evaluate raw materials that are suitable for the process based on trial results. It is also important to evaluate the quality and possible applications of the pulp. Recycled pulp's quality is always weaker than quality of the <b>virgin</b> <b>pulp.</b> Fibre that is separated from the dry waste using Metso Paper's process is still good enough quality to be suitable at least for brown packaging material.

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Business Administration at Strathmore UniversityThis study set out to explore the effect of product import competition on growth of Small and medium scale manufacturers of tissue and hygiene paper products in Uganda and recommend vi-able strategies/ policies to manufacturers and government to facilitate growth of these enterprises and the industry at large. Case study methodology was used and a combination of qualitative and quantitative data was used. Qualitative and quantitative techniques were used to analyze and interpret the data. Study findings confirmed that product imports indeed affect growth of Small and medium tissue and hygiene product manufacturing enterprises in Uganda. The study also revealed that local manufacturers have low capacity utilization and employ fewer employees than they should because the level of operations cannot sustain the optimal number of employees the company needs due to low revenues. The study also revealed lack of high quality softwood availability {{in the country to}} provide <b>virgin</b> <b>pulp</b> {{to be used as a}} raw material substitute to recycled pulp and paper. This therefore means that the government needs to encourage growth of soft wood trees to provide raw materials for the infant but growing paper products industry. The study further revealed that manufacturers also suffer from counterfeit brands. The study pro-posed a policy/ strategy that manufacturers can use to remain competitive regardless of the level of product import competition. The research findings helped propose a policy that government can implement / undertake to help Small and medium manufacturing enterprises be competitive and achieve growth regardless the level of product imports in the economy...|$|E
