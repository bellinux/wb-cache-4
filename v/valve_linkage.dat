25|$|No. A890 was {{the only}} U1 class member in {{operation}} as trials were undertaken to ascertain whether the design should be perpetuated instead of the N1 class for use on the more restricted routes of the Southern Railway. The success of the prototype U1 over the N1 design led to a construction order for a further 20 locomotives to be built at Eastleigh in 1931. Despite the possible weight savings with the Holcroft valve gear, the complexity of maintaining the linkage with the inside cylinder meant that the new class members were fitted with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear for all cylinders. As had happened with the N1 class prototype No. A822, No. A890 was modified to this revised specification in 1930 to reduce maintenance costs. Prior to the modification of No. A890, the new locomotives were visibly different {{by the absence of}} the outside-to-inside <b>valve</b> <b>linkage</b> assembly and were given larger tenders with a water capacity of , although the slab-front was retained.|$|E
50|$|In 1936 and 1937, the Indian Four had {{the valve}} {{positions}} reversed, with the exhaust valve {{in the head}} and the inlet valve in the block. In theory, this would improve fuel vaporization, and the engine was actually more powerful. However, the new system made the cylinder head very hot. The exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>linkage</b> required frequent adjustment. The design was returned to the original IOE configuration in 1938.|$|E
50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder engine {{cannot be}} reversed {{by means of}} the <b>valve</b> <b>linkage</b> (as in a normal fixed cylinder) because there is none. Reversing of the engine can be achieved by reversing the steam connections between inlet and exhaust or, in the case of small engines, by shifting the trunnion pivot point so that the port in the cylinder lines up with a different pair of ports in the port face. In the latter case, the fixed port face is usually provided with three ports, the central one being the steam feed and the outer two being exhausts, only one of which being in use at any time, depending on the required direction of running.|$|E
500|$|In 1922 {{modifications}} {{were made}} to No.822 during assembly. This was because production delays at Ashford prevented {{the building of a}} proposed 3-cylinder design drawn-up in 1919. Maunsell and Holcroft revised No.822's cylinder arrangement to accommodate a third inside cylinder fitted between the frames. The outside cylinders were also reduced to [...] diameter to accommodate the inside cylinder and its associated <b>valve</b> <b>linkages.</b> The differences between No.822 {{and the rest of the}} Nclass meant that this locomotive was re-designated as the 1919 proposal, becoming the prototype of the SR N1class when completed in March 1923.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{fine-grained}} recognition system that incor-porates part localization, alignment, and classification in one deep neural network. This is a nontrivial process, as the input to the classification module should be functions that enable back-propagation in constructing the solver. Our major contribution is {{to propose a}} <b>valve</b> <b>linkage</b> function (VLF) for back-propagation chaining and form our deep lo-calization, alignment and classification (LAC) system. The VLF can adaptively compromise the errors of classification and alignment when training the LACmodel. It in turn help-s update localization. The performance on fine-grained ob-ject data bears out the effectiveness of our LAC system. 1...|$|E

50|$|No {{damage was}} done to the track or signalling, but No. 73096 blocked the line for some time. Shuttle {{services}} were quickly organised between Alresford and Ropley and between Alton and Medstead, until the line could be cleared. Parts of the steam locomotive's 'motion' (connecting rod, <b>valve</b> gear <b>linkages</b> etc.) on the driver's side {{had to be removed}} by MPD staff to allow the locomotive to be moved. As the 5MT was unable to move under its own power, a diesel locomotive was dispatched from Ropley engine shed to retrieve it. The Gala thereafter continued with a revised timetable.|$|R

40|$|In July 2008, a {{self-employed}} construction contractor (the victim) sustained fatal injuries when he {{was crushed}} against the cab of a dump truck by the dump body at a residential construction site. At {{the time of the}} incident, the victim was using the dump truck to deliver soil to the site and then grading the soil with a backhoe. The victim worked alone and there was no witness to the incident. The incident was initially reported by the property owner who arrived on site at approximately 5 : 00 PM and found both the dump truck and the backhoe idling. The property owner saw that the victim was crushed between the back of the cab and the front of the dump body that was in the down position. With the dump body down, the width of the space was 7 inches. The dump body movement was controlled by a dump lever located inside the cab. Post-incident examination determined that the dump lever was stuck and inoperable. There was a mechanical linkage between the dump body hydraulic control lever and the dump body cylinder <b>valve.</b> The <b>linkage</b> was located underneath the chassis between the frame members. The dump body could be actuated if the linkage was pushed. It appeared that the dump body may have been stuck when the last load of soil was being unloaded. The victim may have climbed up on the truck chassis, sat on the frame facing the dump body that was in the up position with his back against the cab trying to kick the linkage to actuate the hydraulic valve to activate the dump body.
