40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} stock option expense recognition on contract design, focusing on option grant vesting schedules. Contrary to a commonly held belief that firms use boilerplate vesting schedules, we document significant variation in vesting terms. Consistent with expense recognition influencing contract design, we find that firms extend option grant <b>vesting</b> <b>periods</b> after recognizing stock option expense thereby delaying {{the recognition of the}} expense. We also test for several economic determinants of vesting terms, including the desire to extend the executive’s investment horizon, to allow for rebalancing of risk-taking incentives, and to promote executive retention. We find that the restrictiveness of the vesting schedule depends on the primary motivation for granting options. When the objective is to retain the executive and provide long horizon incentives, firms use longer <b>vesting</b> <b>periods</b> and CEO power results in less restrictive vesting terms. We also find that external monitors are associated with longer vesting and that institutional ownership influences <b>vesting</b> <b>periods.</b> Overall, this study provides evidence that vesting terms are an important component of executive compensation and that accounting regulations {{play a significant role in}} contract desig...|$|R

40|$|Motivating {{innovation}} {{is an important}} concern in many incentive problems. For example, shareholders of large corporations often need to motivate managers to pursue more innovative business strategies. This paper shows that the optimal incentive scheme that motivates innovation exhibits substantial tolerance (or even reward) for early failure and reward for long-term success. Moreover, commitment to a long-term compensation plan, job security, and timely feedback on performance are also essential ingredients to motivate innovation. In the context of managerial compensation, the optimal incentive scheme that motivates innovation can be implemented via a combination of stock options with long <b>vesting</b> <b>periods,</b> option repricing, golden parachutes, and managerial entrenchment.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{valuation}} framework that captures the main characteristics of employee stock options (ESOs), which financial regulations now require to be expensed in firms’ accounting statements. The {{value of these}} options is much less than Black-Scholes prices for corresponding market-traded options due to the suboptimal exercising strategies of the holders, which arise from risk aversion, trading and hedging constraints, and job termination risk. We analyze the combined effect {{of all of these}} factors along with the standard ESO features of multiple exercising rights, and <b>vesting</b> <b>periods.</b> This leads to the study of a chain of nonlinear free-boundary problems of reaction-diffusion type. We find that job termination risk, vesting, finite maturity and non-zero interest rates are significant contributors to the ESO cost.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the effect of managers’ pay {{duration}} on firms’ voluntary disclosures. Pay duration refers to the average period that it takes for managers’ annual compensation to vest. We hypothesize and find that pay duration can incentivize managers to provide more bad news earnings forecasts. This result holds after controlling for the level of stock-based compensation and the endogeneity of pay duration. In addition, we find that the effect of pay duration is more pronounced for firms with weaker governance and for firms with a more opaque information environment, where the marginal benefits of additional disclosures are higher. Our additional analyses indicate that managers with a longer pay duration issue more accurate earnings forecasts. Overall, our paper contributes to the literature by documenting that lengthening the <b>vesting</b> <b>periods</b> of managers’ compensation can induce managers to be more forthcoming with bad news...|$|R

Using this measure we document a robust negative relationship between CEO pay duration and abnormal accruals: firms that offer short-duration pay contracts to their CEOs have higher abnormal accruals, indicating a stronger proclivity to boost short-term earnings, even after dealing with omitted-variables and endogeneity concerns. We also propose a model that highlights how pay duration will be related to firm characteristics and find supportive evidence for the model’s predictions: CEO pay duration is longer in firms with longer-duration projects and in firms with less risky cash flows...|$|R
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that executives with more short-term incentives engage in myopic behavior by reducing real investment. We document this effect by exploiting a unique event in 2005, {{in which more than}} 700 firms accelerated the <b>vesting</b> <b>periods</b> on executive stock options to avoid an accounting expense under FAS 123 -R. To identify the effect of this shortening of incentive horizon, we exploit exogenous variation in the timing of FAS 123 -R — firms with fiscal year ending June or later had to comply in 2005, while all other firms could postpone compliance until 2006. Our instrumental variables estimates suggest that a 10 % increase in the probability of accelerating options leads firms to reduce industry-adjusted investment rates by a substantial 0. 023 in 2005, and a further 0. 014 in 2006. This reduction in investment is concentrated among industries in which investment is easier to adjust on short notice and among firms with poor governance...|$|R
30|$|Societal {{changes such as}} the {{increased}} prevalence of divorces and {{a greater share of}} unmarried couples also imply a growing importance of individual pension entitlements. Various institutional measures were introduced to improve women’s old age security in the different pillars of the old age pension system: pension entitlements for periods of childcare were improved in the statutory pension scheme for parents of children born after 1992, <b>vesting</b> <b>periods</b> for eligibility were shortened in occupational pension schemes and special state subsidies for parents were introduced for the Riester pension schemes. However, the present study concludes that so far neither these measures nor higher levels of education or {{the increased}} participation in employment have led to a distinct reduction of the gender pension gap for the younger cohort examined. Regulations within the statutory pension scheme do reduce the gender pension gap and the compensatory effect of child benefits will most probably lead to a reduction of the gender pension gap for future generations. Albeit multivariate results show that the main explaining factor for the gender pension gap is the disparity of full-time and part-time employment. This difference can neither be counterbalanced by the compensations within the statutory pension scheme nor by occupational pensions or private provisions.|$|R

Therefore, it is possible (depending on the country of origin) for employees moving to Hong Kong to pay full income tax on vested shares in both {{their country of origin}} and in Hong Kong. Similarly, an employee leaving Hong Kong can incur double taxation on the unrealized capital gains of their vested shares.|$|E

40|$|Managerial rent {{extraction}} is a non-trivial phenomenon during acquisitions: {{in a sample}} of 364 deals from 1999 - 2005, over one target CEO in four experiences compensation increases due to option grants received just before the acquisition while target shareholders suffer losses. Indeed, the top quartile of {{rent extraction}} CEOs pocket an average of 19 million dollars from option awards granted several months prior to the acquisition while shareholders of rent extraction targets experience average abnormal returns of- 22 percent during the three years ending just after the merger announcement. Rent extraction occurs in weakly governed companies. Targets exhibiting rent extraction are more likely to grant their CEOs lucrative options packages after starting negotiations with eventual acquirers, but less likely to obtain higher takeover premiums. Self-dealing CEOs benefit from stock option <b>vesting</b> <b>periods</b> and other restrictions that disappear when their firms are sold. Acquisition announcements typically result in a large increase of the target firm stock price because of the acquisition premium.

40|$|Abstract: We {{argue that}} a {{fundamental}} reason {{for the short term}} perspective of corporate executives is the short term orientation of shareholders themselves and the financial markets that drive the performance benchmarks of CEOs. Although some shareholders are prepared to take a more long-term view they are generally not rewarded for their loyalty to the company. While lengthening stock option <b>vesting</b> <b>periods</b> and introducing claw-back provisions into CEO compensation contracts help induce a more long term orientation of CEOs, we argue that it is also necessary to reinforce this more long-term performance-based compensation with a better alignment between shareholders and CEOs horizons. One way of moving towards such an alignment is to introduce L-Shares (or L-shares). These shares provide an additional reward to shareholders that have held on to their shares for a contractually specified period of time, the loyalty period. The reward would be {{in the form of a}} warrant giving the right to purchase a pre-determined number of new shares at a pre-specified price and granted to loyal investors at the expiration of the loyalty period. This paper discusses how L-shares can be structured and distributed, how they may be valued and how they affect liquidity and control of the corporation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of {{corporate}} scandals and excessive stock options compensation, International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) has introduced a new accounting standard, IIFRS 2 Share-based Payments. The scope of the standard extends beyond payments to employees, but {{for the purpose of}} this study, the focus is only on 'employee stock options'. IIFRS 2 requires a fair value of stock options records calculated on grant date, and recognized as compensation expenses over <b>vesting</b> <b>periods.</b> Prior to the introduction of IIFRS 2, stock options were not recognized and were only disclosed in the notes to the accounts. In Malaysia, the standard is mandatory for all companies listed on or after January 1, 2006. This study assumes the requirement existed in 2003. This study examines the impact of stock options expenses from 2003 to 2005, on the top 100 Malaysian companies. The three year observations show at least 24 % of the sample exceeds the 5 % materiality threshold on diluted EPS. The sectors that are impacted the most are the Trade/Service and Finance sectors. From the multiple-regression test, this study finds that fair value of stock options have a negative relationship with dividend yields (input of the Black-Scholes Merton (BSM) Model). Most companies in the sample are found to pay dividends and grant stock options at the same time. Therefore, this study suggests that companies need to restructure their compensation plan thus balancing the stock options granted and dividends paid in the future.

The liability accrued during the period equals the expense, and is accumulated in a liability under SAR plan account. That is to say that the journal entry to recognize a positive compensation expense related to SARs consists of a debit to compensation expense and a credit to liability under SAR plan.|$|E

50|$|Regardless of how or when an {{employee}} stops employment, {{the money that}} {{an employee}} invests in their 401(k) plan is retained by the employee. The contributions made by an employer {{may or may not}} be retained based on the vesting program.

The employer determines the length of time required to become vested; this is usually a one- to five-year span. A vested employee then becomes eligible to retain all retirement contributions made by an employer. After an employee is fully vested, the employee is eligible to retain the entire amount contributed by their employer, even if they leave the company before retirement.

40|$|Several of {{the more}} complex {{optimization}} problems in finance {{can be characterized as}} impulse control problems. Impulse control problems can be written as quasi-variational inequalities, which are then solved to determine the optimal control strategy. Since most quasi-variational inequalities do not have analytical solutions, numerical methods are generally used in the solution process. In this thesis, the impulse control problem framework is applied to value two complex long-term option-type contracts. Both pricing problems considered are cast as impulse control problems and solved using an implicit approach based on either the penalty method or the operator splitting scheme. The first contract chosen is an exotic employee stock option referred to as an infinite reload option. This contract provides the owner with an infinite number of reload opportunities. Each time a reload occurs, the owner pays the strike price using pre-owned company shares and, in return, receives one share for each option exercised and a portion of a new reload option. Numerical methods based on the classic Black-Scholes equation are developed while taking into account contract features such as <b>vesting</b> <b>periods.</b> In addition, the value of an infinite reload option to it's owner is obtained by using a utility maximization approach. The second long-term contract considered is a variable annuity with a guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) clause. Numerical methods are developed to determine the cost of the GMDB clause while including features such as partial withdrawals. The pricing model is then used to determine the fair insurance charge which minimizes the cost of the contract to the issuer. Due to the long maturity of variable annuities, non-constant market parameters expressed through the use of regime-switching are included in the GMDB pricing model...|$|R
