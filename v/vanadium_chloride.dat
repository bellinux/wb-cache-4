Nitrite distribution can be easily achieved by adapting the well-known colorimetric method from Griess (1879) and using a common flatbed scanner with a limit of detection about 1. 7 μmol L– 1. Nitrate distribution can be obtained after reduction into nitrite by a <b>vanadium</b> <b>chloride</b> reagent. However, the concentration of <b>vanadium</b> <b>chloride</b> used in this protocol brings coloration with a wide spectral signature that creates interference only deconvolvable by imaging treatment from an entire visible spectrum for each pixel (spectral analysis).

The methods were applied in sediments from the Loire Estuary after different treatments and allowed to precisely describe two-dimensional millimeter features.

30|$|NO {{undergoes}} {{a series of}} reactions in biological tissues leading to the accumulation of the final products nitrite and nitrate. Thus, the index of the total NO accumulation {{is the sum of}} both nitrite and nitrate levels in the tissue samples. To reduce the nitrate and nitrate pressnet in the tissue samples to NO, the samples were put in the reducing agent <b>vanadium</b> (III) <b>chloride</b> (VCl 3) in 1  mol/L HCl at 90  °C. The VCl 3 reagent converts nitrite, nitrate, and S-nitroso compounds to NO gas which is guided towards an NO chemiluminescence signal analyzer (Sievers 280 i analyzer, GE Analytical Instruments) allowing the direct detection of NO [16]. Within the reaction vessel, NO reacted with ozone to generate oxygen and excited-state NO species, of which the decay is associated with the emission of weak near-infrared chemiluminescence. This signal is detected by a sensitive photodetector and converted to millivolts (mV). The area under the curve of the detected chemiluminescence (mV∙s) represents the amount of NO-ozone reactions in time and thus the amount of bioavailable NO in the tested samples. The ratio of tissue NO to tissue protein content was used for standardization of the NO measurements.|$|R

40|$|Vanadium {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1801 by Andrés Manuel del Rio, a Spanish professor of mineralogy working in Mexico City.

Unfortunately, del Rio lost confidence in his discovery, thinking {{that he had found}} the element chromium, which had recently been discovered by the Frenchman Fourcroy. Vanadium was rediscovered in 1831 by the Swede Nils Gabriel Sefström. Its present name is derived from the Vanadis, the goddess of love and beauty of Norse mythology. Metallic vanadium was not isolated until 1867 when Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe, Professor of Chemistry at Owens College (later the University of Manchester), reduced <b>vanadium</b> <b>chloride</b> (VCl 5) with gaseous hydrogen to give vanadium metal and HCl. Natural vanadium is a mixture of two isotopes, 51 V (99. 76 %) and 50 V (0. 24 %), the latter being slightly radioactive with a half-life of > 3. 9 x 1017 years. Important sources of the metal are the minerals carnotite [K 2 (UO 2) 2 (VO 4) 2] and vanadinite [Pb(VO 4) 3 Cl]. It is also present in some crude oils in the form of organic complexes.

40|$|Tese de mestrado, Geologia Aplicada (Hidrogeologia), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2016 Soil-Aquifer Treatment (SAT) is a {{well-established}} Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) complementary method which main {{purpose is to}} increase water availability in aquifers by enhancing {{the quality of the}} injected water. SAT-MAR methods are an important way of addressing water scarcity challenges by reusing water of impaired quality, such as wastewater, converting it into a reliable resource. They can be quite useful in water resource management, particularly in semi-arid regions, helping to face decrease of rainfall and long drought periods resulting from climate change. In this context, SAT can also present itself as a relatively simple and inexpensive complementary method of treatment, lessening possible environmental problems. The research presented in this dissertation was developed in the framework of EU 7 th Framework Project MARSOL project which aims to demonstrate the reliability of MAR processes to face water scarcity problems in Southern Europe and Mediterranean regions. Several soil characterization, soil-column and batch experiments were conducted at National Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC) using a soil collected in São Bartolomeu de Messines, one of the projects demonstration sites where SAT-MAR basins are to be constructed using treated wastewater as primary infiltration water source. These experiments aimed to characterize the soil behaviour at lab scale by simulating infiltration basin conditions, determining hydraulic characteristics and contaminant retention capacities. Natural soil results obtained were later compared to those obtained for a soil mixture produced in LNEC. This soil mixture will act as a reactive layer to be installed {{in the bottom of the}} infiltration basins, increasing capacity to retain certain contaminants detected in inflow water, but also keeping acceptable hydraulic conductivity without hindering the water-soil interaction. The referred mixture results from a combination of cheap and easily available materials with the natural soil. Unregulated emerging contaminant problematic was also discussed, focussing in pharmaceutical compounds, considering the type of source water used in these experiments – São Bartolomeu de Messines (SBM) wastewater treatment plant effluent. High concentration of ammonia and sulphates were measured and traces of 17 pharmaceuticals were detected. SBM natural soil that was used in experiments is a loamy sand composed of 81. 91 % sand, 15. 95 % of silt and 2. 14 % clay, having quartz, calcite, montmorillonite and anorthite as major mineral constituents and traces of dolomite, illite, kaolinite and hematite. It has 24. 02 % of carbonates percentage, low organic matter content (2. 66 %), average bulk density of 1. 44 g/cm 3 and average porosity of 43. 6 %. Five soil-column experiments were conducted in this soil for different time lengths, testing different methods of column assembling, thickness, soil packing, saturation conditions and injection method (Column 1 to 5 – C 1 to C 5). For the three different soil mixtures produced, four soil column experiments were conducted (Column 6 to 9 – C 6 to C 9). Outflow samples were collected for the experiments that used wastewater as injection source (C 3 to C 5 and C 8 and C 9) – metals, nitrogen cycle components, major ions and pharmaceuticals were analysed. Pharmaceuticals were not measured for C 3 inflow. Considering hydraulic behaviour for natural soil, and taking as reference the first day of experiment, C 5 showed highest flow rate (1. 504 cm 3 /min) and permeability (2. 536 m/d) while C 4 showed the worst results (0. 363 cm 3 /min and 0. 589 m/d). For soil mixture behaviour, C 6 had higher flow rate and permeability (7. 722 cm 3 /min 12. 579 m/d) but this one along C 7 suffered high soil washing out along the experiment. Concerning inflow water quality, from 32 parameters analysed (excluding pharmaceuticals), C 3 had 17 values above the limit of recovery (LOR), C 4 and C 5 had 17 and C 8 and C 9 had 26. For pharmaceuticals, from the 24 parameters analysed, 14 were above LOR in C 4 and C 5 inflow, while in C 8 and C 9, nine parameters were above LOR. Comparing the outflow in terms of quality, and more precisely average concentration of metals, from 11 parameters considered, C 3 has 7 parameters where outflow concentration is higher than inflow, while C 4 has 6 and C 5 has 9. C 8 has only 3 parameters in which outflow average concentration surpasses the inflow, although inflow sample presents a slight enrichment in certain metals when compared to other columns. Phosphorus shows the highest reduction in all columns. For nitrogen cycle components, ammonia showed high concentration at inflow and a reduction at outflow for all columns, while nitrites present low concentration at inflow and high concentration at outflow. C 3, C 5 and C 8 show higher average concentration of nitrates when compared to inflow. Concentration at outflow in C 8 reaches 140. 46 mg/L, a very high value when compared to C 3 (0. 86 mg/L) and C 5 (6. 51 mg/L). Concerning major ions, for the 7 parameters considered, 4 were above inflow concentration C 4, C 5 and C 8. C 8 experiment shows a worse overall behaviour for these parameters than that with higher average concentrations. Soil samples were collected and analysed after C 3 and C 5 experiments stopped. C 3 shows almost equal concentration of boron, copper and zinc in top and bottom sections, but boron concentrations were lower. Ammonia showed higher concentrations when compared with nitrates and nitrites, being heavily retained in the soil top section, while nitrates where not detected in both sections and nitrites showed very small concentration. Phosphorous and phosphates show higher concentrations in the soil top section. From the set of selected pharmaceuticals, none showed concentrations above LOR in C 3. For C 5, boron and copper showed slightly lower concentrations to those detected in C 3, and ammonia shows a high concentration on the top section. Nitrates and nitrites were also detected in higher concentration on column top section. Phosphorous and phosphates show lower concentrations in both sections when compared to C 3 and sulphates where not detected in both sections. Caffeine was the only detected pharmaceutical compound in C 5. Batch experiments were also conducted in both natural soil and soil mixture. For the set of 32 parameters analysed in the inflow and outflow water of natural soil batch, eight showed a decrease in concentration in the outflow when compared to inflow. Highest percentage of removal is observed in aluminium, followed by iron, and the lowest in sodium. Nitrites, sulphate, barium, calcium, chromium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, <b>vanadium</b> and <b>chloride</b> showed an increased concentration in outflow. 14 of 24 pharmaceuticals analysed had values above LOR, only seven of those were persistent and were detected in the outflow (propanolol, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, naproxen, indometacin and carbamazepine). For the persistent compounds, lowest removal rate was detected for naproxen while seven of the compounds showed 100 % removal (atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, sotalol e pentoxifillin). For the same set of parameters, 25 were detected in soil mixture inflow water while only 20 were detected in the outflow water. Ammonia presented the highest adsorbed amount and copper, zinc, nitrites, calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium and chloride showed an increase of concentration in outflow. Removal was higher in antimony and lowest in lithium. For the pharmaceuticals, 14 were above LOR in inflow water and only 1 in the outflow water. 100 % removal rate was observed in atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, sotalol, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen and pentoxifyllin. Carbamazepine showed recalcitrant behaviour, but a relatively high removal rate (86. 3 %). Transport of ammonia, nitrates and nitrites was modelled in Hydrus- 1 D to understand the conditions inside the column in continuous saturated conditions using C 3 and C 4 data. Simulations showed ammonia being retained on the top of the column whereas nitrites showed a small increase in concentration as ammonia concentration decrease. Then nitrites concentration decrease at the column bottom while nitrates concentration increased. Saturation indexes (Log SI) were determined at inflow and outflow for calcite, dolomite and hematite in C 3, C 4 and C 8 by hydrogeochemical speciation in PHREEQC. C 3 inflow water is unsaturated in calcite and dolomite and it’s in equilibrium with hematite. C 4 inflow solution is close to stability concerning dolomite and calcite while high Log SI for hematite was determined, showing saturation in this iron oxide. C 8 inflow solution is slightly unsaturated in calcite and dolomite, and hematite Log SI is showing oversaturation at inflow. For all columns, outflow solutions are saturated in hematite, and oscillate from unsaturation to saturation in calcite and dolomite along the experiment. Inverse modelling in PHREEQC was also used in C 3 to understand phase transfers that occur between inflow solution and the soil media along the experiments under invariable saturation conditions. The natural soil shows some suitability to be used as a base infiltration layer for the SAT-MAR infiltration basins in what concerns infiltration capacity, but is expected to show some problems in the long term, with a continuous decrease of permeability. The soil mixture resulted in a more pervious material with a good long term hydraulic behaviour, with better response to cycles of saturation and non-saturation allowing the oxygenation of the soil. The sequential use of oxic/anoxic conditions is the best approach to ensure maximum attenuation efficiency, since some elements degrade better in oxic conditions, and|$|R
