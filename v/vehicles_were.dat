5|$|In Soviet service, the <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> {{allocated}} to brigades at {{a scale of}} 60 per brigade. During the attack, the <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> used to provide mobile fire support, being placed behind the infantry, usually in a hull-down position behind a ridge or a hill, to fire across a broad front {{to take advantage of}} the long range of the 57mm gun.|$|E
5|$|In early 1986, {{maintenance}} problems saw {{a number}} of vehicles banned from use by vehicle examiners from the Ministry of Transport. The company was forced to hire eight vehicles from other companies to keep services running; they remained in the fleet for four weeks while the regular <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> repaired. Similar issues resurfaced in February 1987, when twelve <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> hired for three weeks.|$|E
5|$|A large {{variety of}} {{different}} armoured combat <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> developed on the T-26 chassis in the 1930s. Among them were KhT-26, KhT-130 and KhT-133 flame-throwing (chemical) tanks (552, 401 and 269 <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> produced, respectively); T-26T artillery tractors (197 were produced); TT-26 and TU-26 remotely controlled tanks (162 teletanks of all models were produced); ST-26 bridge-laying tanks (71 were produced); SU-5 self-propelled guns (33 were produced); experimental armoured cargo/personnel carriers, reconnaissance vehicles, and many others. The majority of these <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> developed at the Leningrad Factory of Experimental Mechanical Engineering (from 1935 known as the Factory No. 185 named after S.M. Kirov) by talented Soviet engineers P.N. Syachentov, S.A. Ginzburg, L.S. Troyanov, N.V. Tseits, B.A. Andryhevich, M.P. Zigel and others. Various vehicle-mounted equipment was developed for the T-26, including mine-clearing attachments, inflatable pontoons and a snorkel system for fording water obstacles, devices for overcoming obstacles and many others. T-26 light tanks were also modified into different armoured combat vehicles in the field during wartime.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 962 <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} from 1942 to 1943. It {{had originally been}} planned that Britain would receive all of the examples produced through Lend-Lease, intending to use them in the Western Desert, {{but by the time}} they arrived the campaign was over. Additionally, the purpose-built M10 tank destroyer, armed with a 3-inch gun (and later a 17-pounder gun in British service) had begun to enter production. As a result, the British transferred 650 half-tracks to the Soviet Union under the Soviet Aid Program. Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US; except for one kept by the U.S. Army, these British and American <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> converted back to standard M3 Half-tracks.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the day on July 20, Dean {{ordered the}} {{headquarters}} of the 34th Infantry to withdraw. Dean remained behind and assisted the US troops in evacuating the city until the last convoy was ready to leave Taejon. As the last convoy of troops moved out of the city and fought through a North Korean roadblock, Dean, with a small force of soldiers, followed them. At the edge of the city, the final elements of the 34th Infantry, leaving the city in 50 <b>vehicles,</b> <b>were</b> ambushed and many of their <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> destroyed by machine guns and mortars, forcing the Americans to retreat on foot.

5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces {{carried out}} a winter test for {{potential}} military vehicles in March 1958. 35candidate vehicles from the two domestic producers and various importers were driven around Finland. VAT sent four vehicles to the test, three of which were 4×4s and one was an ordinary, rear-wheel driven vehicle. During the five days' testing period, all <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> continuously fully loaded. For part of the journey, the vehicles had to tow an eight-ton field cannon. The <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> tested for off-road capabilities in even, -deep snow. One of the Vanajas was destroyed in an accident. The domestic vehicles performed well in the test; {{in some cases the}} rear-wheel driven Sisus and Vanajas outperformed the 4×4-driven foreign competitors. None of the <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> clearly better than the others but the result convinced the Defence Forces of the capabilities of the domestic vehicles and led to several deals for SAT and VAT.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
