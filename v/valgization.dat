30|$|Borden et al. [8] {{presented}} a subtrochanteric <b>valgization</b> osteotomy, {{which is a}} perpendicular osteotomy in the subtrochanteric region just distal to the lesser trochanter. They introduced the concept of end-to-side <b>valgization</b> osteotomy in cases of infantile coxa vara, which presents only a minimal risk of head necrosis due to its extra-articular approach and lack of medialization of the distal femoral shaft. It also requires only one osteotomy with easier insertion of the angled plate, making it less technically demanding than the standard intertrochanteric technique [2]. Percutaneous subtrochanteric osteotomy with external fixation has been reported {{as an alternative to}} internal fixation [9], but that study included only limited follow-up.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} neurologic complications of closed wedge <b>valgization</b> osteotomy technique using electrophysiologi-cal methods. Methods: Eleven extremities of 11 patients (mean age 52. 75 ± 5. 39) with medial gonarthrosis and varus deformity were included. All patients under-went closed wedge <b>valgization</b> osteotomy in order to correct varus deformity. Results: The post-operative amplitude of nervus peroneus superficialis significantly decreased when compared to pre-operative amplitude. The mean pre-operative N. peroneus superficialis amplitude was 12. 77, whereas it reduced to 5. 44 postoperatively (p< 0. 05). Other nerve conduction velocity investigations showed no significant differences between pre- and post-operative values. A Needle Electromyography (EMG) study demonstrated neurogenic involvement in 4 patients after surgery. All of these 4 patients had denervation in the m. extensor hallucis longus needle EMG study. In 2 patients, the musculus tibialis anterior needle EMG study showed neurogenic involvement. One of these had denervation. One patient showed denervation in the m. extensor digitorum brevis needle EMG study. Conclusion: Although fibula osteotomy used in the closed wedge osteotomy technique was applied from the safe zone, electrophysiological investi...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical and {{biological}} factors {{are responsible for}} non-unions of the proximal femur. We analyse the causal treatment-possibilities of the different localisations. Fifty-five patients with non-unions of the femoral neck (average age 53 years) with or without preexistent femoral head necrosis (44 %) were treated by abduction osteotomy and followed up at regular intervals. In 15 % of cases a second operation was necessary after an average of 9. 3 years, including the early complications. At the latest control 90 % of the patients were satisfied, with an average Harris hip score (HHS) of 91. The survivorship analysis with end point total hip replacement is favourable. In the same period 22 patients were treated with a total hip replacement. The 11 survivors had a clearly worse HHS of 65. The low-risk, technically demanding <b>valgization</b> osteotomy {{should be the first}} step in the treatment of femoral neck non-unions, even in the presence of femoral head necrosis; secondary operations are not compromised. Pertrochanteric non-unions are rare. The pertrochanteric fragment very often heals, leaving a lateral femoral neck non-union which can be treated with <b>valgization</b> osteotomy. Depending on the type of non-union and the age of the patient, anatomical reduction, medial displacement and <b>valgization</b> osteotomy can be employed. With the angulated plates of the ASIF (95 degrees, 120 degrees, 130 degrees) 23 of the 24 non-unions could be healed in one operation. Fourteen patients underwent total hip replacement. In the subtrochanteric area mechanical and vascular instability leads to implant failure or fatigue fracture. Rigid compression-re-osteosynthesis is the therapy of choice, the 95 degrees condylar plate the implant. Twenty-three of our documented 24 subtrochanteric non-unions healed, 4 in the presence of an infection. Multiple operations have been necessary in 2 of the 4 non-unions following a pathological fractur...|$|E
40|$|Background: Nonunion of intertrochanteric {{fractures}} is uncommon {{because there}} is excellent blood supply and good cancellous bone in the intertrochanteric region of the femur. A diagnosis of primary intertrochanteric nonunion is made when at least 15 weeks after the fracture there is radiological evidence of a fracture line, with either no callus (atrophic) or with callus that does not bridge the fracture site (hypertrophic). There is only one published series that exclusively describes seven primary nonunions of intertrochanteric fractures. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the results of internal fixation, <b>valgization</b> with 135 ΀ dynamic hip screw (DHS), and bone grafting in patients with primary nonunion of intertrochanteric fractures. Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients with primary intertrochanteric nonunion were included in the study; 16 were male and 2 were female. The age range was 30 - 70 years (mean: 46. 9 years). The mean duration since index injury was 8. 5 months (range: 4 - 18 months). As per the AO classification, the fractures were 31 A 1. 1 (n= 1), 1. 2 (n= 1), 2. 2 (n= 3), 2. 3 (n= 9), and 3. 3 (n= 4). Three patients had hypermobile nonunion and 15 had stiff nonunion. The surgical principle was excision of pseudarthrosis, if present (n= 3); freshening of the bone ends; stable fixation with 135 ΀ DHS, with good proximal purchase; bone grafting; and <b>valgization.</b> Results: Union was achieved in all patients at an average of 5. 62 months (range: 4 - 7 months). The Harris hip score improved from 38 points preoperatively to 86 postoperatively at healing. The average limb shortening improved by 2 cm (range: 1. 5 cm- 3 cm). There was no infection and pain at the hip at final follow-up in any of the cases. All patients were subjectively satisfied with the outcome. All were capable of full weight bearing on their affected limb. Conclusion: Union in primary nonunion of intertrochanteric fractures in physiologically young patients with a well-preserved femoral head and good bone stock can be achieved with internal fixation, <b>valgization,</b> and grafting procedures...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{in cases}} of nonunions of the femoral neck, the surgeon is tempted to perform {{prosthetic}} replacement of the hip, more so if {{there is also evidence}} of avascular necrosis of the head of femur. This provides rapid pain relief and allows early mobilization. However, long-term results of hip arthroplasties, especially in younger people and in the presence of osteopenia, are not always as expected; and a less radical approach is worth considering. The intertrochanteric <b>valgization</b> osteotomy, described by Pauwels, is an excellent alternative for healthy patients up to 65 years of age with a nonunion of the femoral neck. A union rate of 80 - 90 % of the nonunion is described by most authors. Leg length inequality, rotational and angular deformities can be corrected at the same time. During the period 1973 - 1995, we performed <b>valgization</b> osteotomy according to Pauwels in 66 patients of, 18 - 72 years old (mean 49. 5 years). 24 (37 %) of our patients died 4 months to 24 years (mean: 9. 5 years) after the operation. Union of the femoral neck was achieved in 58 (88 %) of the 66 patients; union of the osteotomy in 65 patients (99 %). A good or excellent result was achieved in 62 % (23 uneventful and 13 with healed, necrosis/arthrosis without need for further treatment) of our patients. However, the method has its limits. We feel if there is too little bone stock inside the femoral head, a <b>valgization</b> osteotomy does not give good result. The radiographic signs of avascular necrosis in patients over 30 years of age is considered a contraindication for an osteotomy. However our results show that it is worthwhile trying to save the joint of young patients even in case of a segmental collapse. In the race between revascularization and collapse, often revascularization is the winner. We deliberately give nature its chance and don't rely on the result of bleeding from drill holes in the head, nuclear scans and other methods to estimate vascularity. A secondary total hip replacement if necessary because of avascular necrosis or osteoarthritis is considerably postponed; and better milieu for hip replacement can be achieved by the development of sclerotic bone in the subchondral areas of the acetabulum and femoral head. Between 65 and 80 years of age, a total hip replacement is probably the best option for fit patients. We treat fresh femoral neck fractures with a hemiarthroplasty in patients over the biological age of 80 years. Logically the same choice will be made for patients with a nonunion. During the period 1973 - 1995 we performed hemiarthroplasty (n = 34) in patient with low general condition. Their mean age was 79 years. The average survival in these patients was less than three years and that explains probably the low late complication rate: in this group. Total hip replacement was performed in 37 younger patients {{with a mean age of}} 69 years. They were not considered for a <b>valgization</b> osteotomy because of age being over 70 years, severe osteoporosis or a total collapse of the femoral head. In this group, we observed one aseptic cup revision and two extractions of the prosthesis because of a deep infectio...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTObjectives: To {{evaluate}} valgus subtrochanteric osteotomy for {{the treatment}} of trochanteric non-union. Methods: A retrospective study of cases series. From 1998 September to 2009 January, seventeen (17) cases with a diagnosis of non-union of trochanteric fracture were re-operated by the hip group of the Ortophaedic And Traumatology service of the Hospital Geral de Goiania (HGG). The patients presented pain at the fracture site, a femoral varus angle of less than 120 °, and non-union of the fracture in the 3 rd months after the initial surgery. Results: Patients with ages ranging from 30 to 73 years, with a maximum follow-up of 09 years and minimum of 09 years. The mean time from first surgery to osteotomy was six months. Bone union was observed in 16 patients, with a mean union time of 12 weeks after surgery. The mean hip varus angle was 1050 (1200 to 900). After surgery, the mean hip valgus angle was 1440 (1550 to 1350). We had one unsuccessful case; a 78 -year old patient who had osteogtomy, fixed with DHS of 1500, with <b>valgization</b> to 1540. After six months of follow-up without union of the fracture, it was decided to perform total cemented hip artroplasthy, without complications. Conclusion: Valgus subtrochanteric osteotomies can be indicated {{for the treatment}} of trochanteric treatment of pseudoarthroses, with good final results for bone union, avoiding the need for total hip artroplasthy and maintaining biological fixation, as well as reestablishing the mechanical and anatomical axis of the affected limb...|$|E
40|$|SummaryHypothesisDoes {{metatarsal}} pronation exist and, if so, {{what is its}} impact?IntroductionHallux valgus is a deformity associating angulation and a rotational component. The {{present study}} sought to investigate the nature and origin of the coronal plane displacement. Materials and methodsA prospective single-center radiological and anatomic study was conducted on 100 feet operated on for hallux valgus. Baseline X-ray determined the preoperative position of the 1 st metatarsal head in the coronal plane. The range of motion (ROM) of the cuneometatarsal joint in pronation–supination was measured peroperatively. An anatomic study investigated possible diaphyseal torsion. ResultsMean radiologic pronation in hallux valgus was 12. 7 ° (range, 0 °– 40 °). Cuneometatarsal rotational ROM was determined by adding peroperative ROM in pronation (mean, 9. 3 °; range, 0 °– 30 °) and in supination (mean, 8. 7 °; range, 0 °– 20 °). Intermetatarsal divergence showed no correlation with radiologic pronation or ROM in pronation. Radiologic pronation showed no correlation with peroperative ROM in pronation. Pronation of the metatarsal head was never observed without associated sesamoid pronation; the latter, however, was in some cases observed without the former. Twenty randomly selected metatarsal cadaver specimens from the anatomy laboratory of the University of Nice (France) showed diaphyseal torsion in 80 % of cases, with the metatarsal head in neutral position or in supination {{with respect to the}} base. DiscussionIn hallux valgus, 1 st ray pronation appears to be systematic, in contrast to the typical supination found in the general population. Metatarsal rotation is always associated with sesamoid rotation, whereas the converse is not the case: displacement of the sesamoids appears to displace the metatarsal head via the metatarsosesamoid ligaments. This “drive-belt” effect, however, varies in its mechanical properties and the transmission is imperfect and likely subject to progressive ligament stretching, so that head rotation does not exactly follow and may even become independent of the sesamoid displacement. Radiologic and clinical rotation thus do not match any longer. The anatomic study showed that, while diaphyseal torsion cannot be ruled out, the metatarsal pronation mainly derives from cuneometatarsal joint rotational instability, the evolution of which does not parallel lateral instability, no correlation being found between degree of varus and rotational instability. ConclusionThe present study found metatarsal pronation to be associated with hallux valgus, making a preoperative AP view useful; the underlying mechanism was generally cuneometatarsal instability. Although difficult to specify exactly without correlation between radiological and clinical data, any such pronation {{raises the question of whether}} replacing the metatarsal head on its sesamoid supports is sufficient to achieve stability in all planes, or whether on the contrary derotation should be associated to metatarsal <b>valgization</b> osteotomy to restore horizontal support.
