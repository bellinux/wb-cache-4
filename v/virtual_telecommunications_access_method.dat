50|$|A limited {{version of}} ACF/VTAM known as ACF/VTAME (Advanced Communications Function for the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Method</b> Entry) was made {{available}} for DOS/VSE systems running on the IBM 4300.|$|E
50|$|IBM offered {{assembler}} language macros to provide programming support. During the System/360 era, these access methods were BTAM (Basic Telecommunications Access Method) and QTAM (Queued Telecommunications Access Method) - which was later replaced by Telecommunications Access Method (TCAM). IBM introduced VTAM (<b>Virtual</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Method)</b> with the System/370.|$|E

50|$|In IBM terminology, VTAM is an <b>access</b> <b>method</b> {{software}} allowing application {{programs to}} read and write data to and from external devices. It is called 'virtual' because it was introduced at the time when IBM was introducing virtual storage by upgrading the operating systems of the System/360 series to virtual storage versions. VTAM {{was supposed to be the}} successor to the older <b>telecommunications</b> <b>access</b> <b>methods,</b> such as Basic <b>telecommunications</b> <b>access</b> <b>method</b> (BTAM) and <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Method</b> (TCAM), which were maintained for compatibility reasons. As such, VTAM is comparable with VSAM, which was at that time a new and supposedly converged <b>access</b> <b>method</b> for disk storage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Method</b> (VTAM) is the IBM {{subsystem}} that implements Systems Network Architecture (SNA) for mainframe environments. VTAM {{provides an}} {{application programming interface}} (API) for communication applications, and controls communication equipment such as adapters and controllers. In modern terminology, VTAM provides a communication stack and device drivers.|$|E
50|$|Systems Network Architecture (SNA) is IBM's {{proprietary}} networking architecture, {{created in}} 1974. It {{is a complete}} protocol stack for interconnecting computers and their resources. SNA describes formats and protocols and is, in itself, not a piece of software. The implementation of SNA {{takes the form of}} various communications packages, most notably <b>Virtual</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Method</b> (VTAM), the mainframe software package for SNA communications.|$|E
50|$|In 1971 the Time Sharing Option (TSO) for {{use with}} MVT was added as part of release 20.1. TSO became widely used for program {{development}} because it provided an editor, the ability to submit batch jobs, be notified of their completion, and view the results without waiting for printed reports, and debuggers {{for some of the}} programming languages used on System/360. TSO in OS/360 communicated with terminals by using Telecommunications Access Method (TCAM). TCAM's name suggests that IBM hoped it would become the standard access method for data communications, but in fact TCAM in OS/VS2 was used almost entirely for TSO and was largely superseded by <b>Virtual</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Method</b> (VTAM) in the mid-to-late 1970s.|$|E

50|$|Basic <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Method</b> (BTAM) was a {{low-level}} programming interface specified by IBM {{for use on}} the IBM System/360 for start-stop and binary synchronous telecommunications terminals. Later, IBM specified higher-level interfaces QTAM and TCAM.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} IBM Network Control Program {{ran on the}} 3705-I {{and supported}} access to older devices by application programs using Telecommunications Access Method (TCAM). With the advent of Systems Network Architecture (SNA), NCP was enhanced to connect cluster controllers (such as the IBM 3270) to application programs using TCAM and later to application programs using <b>Virtual</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Method</b> (VTAM). Subsequent versions of NCP were released to run on the IBM 3704, IBM 3705-II, IBM 3725. IBM 3720, or IBM 3745 Communications Controllers, all of which SNA defined as a SNA Physical Unit Type 4 (PU4). A PU4 usually had SDLC links to remote cluster controllers (PU1/PU2) or to other PU4s. Polling and addressing of the cluster controllers was performed by the NCP without mainframe intervention.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM 3745 is {{the latest}} and last of a 37xx family of {{communications}} controllers for the IBM mainframe environment. As of mid-2009 there were an estimated 7,000+ of the larger 3745 models still in active production status, down from 20,000 or more in 2007. The 3745 and associated 3746 models were once heavily used within financial, insurance and retail industries as well as within government agencies globally. However, today most organizations have migrated away {{from the use of}} 3745s. IBM's Enterprise Extender [...] and the Communication Controller for Linux on System z (CCL) [...] have largely displaced the older 3745s. IBM announced in September 2002 that it would no longer manufacture new 3745s, but IBM continues to support the hardware by providing worldwide maintenance service, by providing microcode releases and by supporting the associated software including NCP (Network Control Program) and the <b>virtual</b> <b>telecommunications</b> <b>access</b> <b>method</b> (VTAM). IBM has announced end-of-service dates for Japan, Europe and the Middle East, but has not yet announced end-of-service for the Americas and parts of Asia.|$|E
50|$|The IBM System/360 was {{announced}} in April 1964 and with it came communication <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> such as BTAM and QTAM (Basic and Queued <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Methods).</b> In 1971, TCAM, the <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Method,</b> offered its users a more advanced form of message switching or message routing. TCAM was widely accepted, especially in the financial and brokerage industries. It supported asynchronous messaging, as with the later MQ. TCAM 3.0 added in reusable disk message queues for recovery soon thereafter, as with MQ. A high-level PL/I program {{could be used to}} access TRANSIENT datasets (dynamic message queues). Reading a message from a transient dataset resulted in that message being removed from the queue, as with a non-browse READ with MQ.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, VTAM was {{provided}} {{free of charge}} like most systems software of that time. However, VTAM 2 was the last version to be freely available. ACF/VTAM (Advanced Communication Function/Virtual <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Method)</b> was introduced in 1976 and {{was provided}} for a licence fee. The major new feature of ACF/VTAM was the Multisystem Networking Facility, which introduced [...] "implementation of intersystem communication among multiple S/370s.".|$|R

50|$|The IBM-supplied <b>Tele{{communications}}</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Method</b> (TCAM) {{and communications}} controller were replaced in 1975 by a system, called Parrot, {{that was created}} locally by {{the staff of the}} Computer Laboratory, comprising their own software and a PDP-11 complex. Their goal in doing so was to provide a better user interface than was available with a standard IBM system, alongside greater flexibility, reliability, and efficiency. They wanted to support 300 terminals. The initial system, supplied in 1972, comprised the PDP-11 emulating an IBM 2703 transmission control unit, which TCAM communicated with just {{as though it were a}} 2703. The PDP-11 was used instead of a bank of 2703s because for a projected 300 terminals a bank of 2703s was not scalable, too expensive, and inadequate for the Computing Service's needs, since it required paper tape readers and card punches as well. Even this solution proved to be unsatisfactory, and in 1975 TCAM was replaced by Parrot, with 200 terminals connected to the PDP-11, of which 80 could be simultaneously active. For full technical details of Parrot, see the technical report by Hazel and Stoneley.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} telecommunications in the sustainable development of urban, rural and remote communities in the Northern Territory (NT). The NT presents a unique and challenging social, economic, demographic and geopolitical environment. The Territory covers a vast area, is sparsely populated and is isolated from all major Australian population centres. Whilst {{the majority of the}} Territory population resides in the major urban areas of Darwin and Alice Springs, almost 40 per cent of the population is spread across many small and isolated communities across the NT. The majority of the population that live in the rural and remote regions of the Territory are of Indigenous descent. Telecommunication access has been, and is integral to the social and economic development of the Territory. However, the challenge of providing <b>telecommunications</b> <b>access</b> to the remote areas of NT, to a population that is widely dispersed and experiences severe social and economic disadvantage has been a re-occurring theme {{in the history of the}} Northern Territory. Historically, <b>telecommunications</b> <b>access</b> has played a major role in not only the settlement of the Territory but also in the social and economic well-being of its inhabitants. Telecommunications is an enabling technology as it has facilitated the provision of health and education services to residents in the outback; it has enabled social interaction and economic participation and it has provided a “mantle of safety” for those living in remote and inaccessible regions of the Territory. However, disparities in <b>telecommunications</b> <b>access</b> in the Territory exist and, in recent years, these disparities have continued to widen. The rapid expansion of network technology and the seemingly ubiquitous reach of the Internet have exacerbated these inequalities. Those most affected by the difference in <b>telecommunications</b> <b>access</b> are the remote isolated Indigenous communities that are located across the NT. This thesis {{examines the}} role of telecommunications in sustainable development of urban, rural and remote communities through the theoretical lens of social capital. Social capital is a relatively new theoretical construct and it is rapidly v gaining interest among policy makers, politicians and researchers as a means to both describe and understand social and economic development. Increasingly, the concept of social capital, as opposed to the traditional economic indicators, is seen as a more accurate measure of well-being. Whilst the essence of social capital is quality social relations, the concept intersects with telecommunications and Information Communications Technology in a number of ways. The potential of ICT to disseminate information quickly, to reach vast numbers of people simultaneously and to include the previously excluded is immense. Consequently, this thesis examined the nexus in the Northern Territory between social relations of mutual benefit, <b>telecommunications</b> <b>access</b> and sustainable development. The thesis adopted a mixed methodology to provide an evidence based analysis of the role of telecommunications in the sustainable development of the NT. Four Northern Territory communities were analysed in this study. The communities consisted of a two urban, a rural and a remote Indigenous community. The four communities involved in this study were chosen as representative of the diverse lifestyles, circumstances and population of the Territory. The quantitative and qualitative research data suggested that there was a relationship between social capital and <b>telecommunications</b> <b>access.</b> A synthesis of the survey results and the qualitative data indicated that there was a positive relationship between <b>access</b> to <b>telecommunications</b> services and facilities, social and civic participation and the capacity to build and maintain relationships. However, the relationship between social capital and <b>telecommunications</b> <b>access</b> was not consistent across all locations. Geographic isolation, the density of established networks and the capacity to <b>access</b> <b>telecommunications</b> services had an extenuating effect on the telecommunication-social capital relationship. This research concluded that <b>access</b> to <b>telecommunications</b> services has the potential to facilitate the sustainable social and economic development. However, disparities in <b>telecommunications</b> <b>access</b> in the remote regions of the Territory inhibit this development...|$|R
