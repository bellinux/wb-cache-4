40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{detection}} {{and analysis of}} a time needed for getting an all-round view before entering other <b>vehicle's</b> <b>corridor</b> during different conditions and speed. In the theoretical part a brief research is made concerning the subject of causes of accidents, aspects of human perception and driver's outlook. The analytical part derives from video recordings of on-road trials. The results was processed and the obtained data evaluated {{in order to find}} out the time needed for getting an all-round and making a decision while situated in the intersection. Above that, the data served as a determination of safety during intersection passing and quality of estimates of speed and distance of incoming vehicles. The conclusion of the analytical part is dedicated to participants mutual comparison and analysis of particular situations that occurred during the trials...|$|R

Often {{referred to as the}} (Off-Highway <b>Vehicle)</b> OHV <b>Corridor,</b> Twin Valley Road (forest road 17N04) is a designated 40 mi east-west major transportation route across the south end of Mendocino National Forest connecting the Upper Lake and Grindstone Ranger Districts.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a framework and demonstrates {{results from a}} process detection based approach to tracking an airborne plume in sensor networks. Data integration and pattern detection in large sensor networks measuring gas and radiation plumes suffer from low resolution observations, missed detections, and numerous false positive reports. Large numbers of nodes and the hypothesis management concept of a Process Query System (PQS) can compensate for lower data quality. A result of the process detection based approach to this problem is models that can be implemented in many different scenarios. Plume predictor models are illustrated which allow data association between sensor nodes in typical outdoor wind conditions. We demonstrate a simulation of a mobile plume source in a sensor network designed {{for use in the}} same PQS. A kinematic model is developed for a vehicle carrying a plume source. Inverse models for this mobile plume source will work in conjunction with the existing software systems, thus allowing PQS to rapidly be adapted to a new problem domain with minimal modifications. This scenario of a mobile airborne plume source approximates a moving container emitting a detectable substance in a transportation network, where the container movement is restricted by existing <b>vehicle</b> <b>corridors...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Holden {{train was}} a new concept in Irish tourism. In 1902, A.W. Holden, a Larne hotelier who had hired trains from the BNCR for his summer tours, {{approached}} the railway to provide him with a special train. York Road works built the all first class four-car train. Three of the coaches were saloons and the fourth was a restaurant car, all being furnished to a high standard. They were bogie <b>vehicles</b> with <b>corridor</b> connections; the lower body panels were finished in match boarding and the end doors were recessed {{in the manner of}} Pullman cars. Two six-wheel vans were fitted with corridor connections to work with the train.|$|R

For a test case, the technique is applied to evolution of behavioural control programs for a simulated 2 d <b>vehicle</b> in a <b>corridor</b> following problem...|$|R
40|$|As the {{commercial}} space launch industry continues to grow, plans for new spaceports {{from which to}} base launch and reentry operations continue to take shape. Many of these new spaceports will not be located within special use airspace that is routinely cleared of air traffic, creating potential conflicts and impacts in an airspace system that is itself continuing to grow. Processes for designing space <b>vehicle</b> flight <b>corridors</b> that maximize the utility of a proposed spaceport while minimizing the impact on existing air traffic must be developed {{in order to provide}} safe and efficient access to all potential users. The Federal Aviation Administration’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation is exploring one such process. Used successfully for the Oklahoma Spaceport, this process examines existing air traffic patterns relative to proposed space vehicle requirements to help identify potential air space for space vehicle testing and operations. The FAA intends to construct a tool capable of performing this and other space and air traffic management functions in the near future...|$|R
50|$|Whatever {{configuration}} of vehicle used, to be legally operated on UK roads, vehicles must {{adhere to the}} EU defined articulated vehicle turning circle regulations, which state that any vehicle {{must be able to}} navigate a turning circle around a set-point, keeping the whole of the <b>vehicle</b> within a <b>corridor</b> bounded by two circles around that point, with the inner circle having a radius of 5.3 m, and the outer radius being 12.5 m. Vehicle turning circles are particularly important in the UK due to the historical existence of many narrow streets, and a high number of roundabouts.|$|R

40|$|The LiDAR mapping {{carried out}} using gyrocopters {{provides}} a relatively cheap alternative for traditional mapping involving airplanes. The {{costs of the}} fuel and the overall maintenance are much lower when compared to planes. At {{the same time the}} flight kinematics of the gyrocopter makes it an ideal <b>vehicle</b> for <b>corridor</b> mapping. However a limited payload and a strongly limited space prevent using stabilized platforms dedicated for aerial photogrammetry. As the proper stabilization of the laser scanner during the flight is crucial {{in order to keep the}} desirable quality of the LiDAR data, it was decided to develop the prototype of the stabilized, ultra-light mapping platform that can meet the restricted requirements of the gyrocopter. The paper starts with the brief discussion of the legal and practical aspects of the LiDAR data quality, dealing mostly with the influence of the flight imperfections on the point pattern and point density. Afterwards the mapping system prototype is characterized, taking into account three main components: stabilized platform, sensors and control. Subsequently first in-flight tests are described. Though the data are still not perfect mostly due to vibrations, the stabilization provides a substantial improvement of their geometry, reducing both roll and pitch deflections...|$|R
50|$|The first {{indication}} of changing ideas were some very handsome <b>corridor</b> <b>vehicles</b> in 1927. For the first time, the LMS abandoned outside compartment doors in corridor coaches and introduced larger windows in their stead. At first {{there were two}} such windows in each compartment (one fixed and one frameless droplight) {{in the manner of}} the characteristic Midland pattern vestibule coaches already considered. They differed from the normal twin-window style in having frameless droplights and Stones ventilators over both windows and the style soon became adopted for other vehicles. By 1930 it had made its appearance in some composites, this time with but one Stones ventilator centrally over the window pair and with large 4 ft 6 in wide corridor side windows.|$|R

40|$|Increasing freight {{demand has}} {{lead to a}} greater {{presence}} of multi-combination-vehicles, such as B-doubles, on Australia’s roads. The impacts of these vehicles on signalised urban arterial corridor performance are of concern to many road users. This paper describes the development and calibration of a microsimulation model {{to be used to}} study these impacts. The discrete-time model considers all vehicles to behave autonomously according to their own capabilities and in response to surrounding vehicles and traffic controls. Traffic flow and trajectory data from a major freight route through Brisbane’s suburbs was used to calibrate the model. Different headway distributions were found for different vehicle types, and modelled by a lognormal distribution. A GPS-equipped car followed subject <b>vehicles</b> along the <b>corridor,</b> whilst the status of 20 signalised intersections was recorded by the STREAMS traffic management system. Acceleration profiles were used to calibrate the unimpeded acceleration models for different vehicle types...|$|R
40|$|Reactive motion {{planning}} and local navigation of robots remains a significant {{challenge in the}} motion control of robotic vehicles. This thesis presents new results on vision guided navigation using optical flow. By detecting key image features, calculating optical flow and leveraging time-to-transit (tau) as a feedback signal, control architectures can steer a vehicle {{so as to avoid}} obstacles while simultaneously using them as navigation beacons. Averaging and balancing tau over multiple image features successfully guides a <b>vehicle</b> along a <b>corridor</b> while avoiding looming objects in the periphery. In addition, the averaging strategy deemphasizes noise associated with rotationally induced flow fields, mitigating risks of positive feedback akin to the Larsen effect. A recently developed, biologically inspired, binary-key point description algorithm, FReaK, offers process speed-ups that make vision-based feedback signals achievable. A Parrot ARDrone 2 {{has proven to be a}} reliable platform for testing the architecture and has demonstrated the control law's effectiveness in using time-to-transit calculations for real-time navigation...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of visual-based {{navigation}} of a mobile robot in indoors environments. The robot control system is based on a single camera that observes the navigation area, and provides the required visual feedback information. The control strategy merges two distinct paradigms that appeared recently in the technical literature, in order to provide the robustness and computation speed needed for closed loop control. On one hand, we servo on the vanishing point defined by the intersection of the corridor guidelines. This mode is used for the heading control and ensures that the <b>vehicle</b> moves along <b>corridors.</b> On the other hand, we use appearance based processes to monitor the robot position along the path and to launch different navigation tasks (e. g. turn left, enter door, etc). The combination of visual servoing techniques that provide stable control loops for specific local tasks, and appearance based methods that embed a representation of the environment at a larger scale, [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|To some extent, results {{along these}} lines have been {{achieved}} in trials performed around the globe, making use of GPS, mobile phone signals, and vehicle registration plates. [...] GPS is becoming standard in many new high-end vehicles and is an option on most new low- and mid-range vehicles. In addition, many users also have mobile phones which transmit trackable signals (and may also be GPS-enabled). [...] Mobile phones can already be traced for purposes of emergency response. [...] GPS and mobile phone tracking, however, do not provide fully reliable data. Furthermore, integrating mobile phones in vehicles may be prohibitively difficult. Data from mobile phones, though useful, might even increase risks to motorists as they tend {{to look at their}} phones rather than concentrate on their driving. Automatic registration plate recognition can provide high levels of data, but continuously tracking a <b>vehicle</b> through a <b>corridor</b> is a difficult task with existing technology. Today's equipment is designed for data acquisition and functions such as enforcement and tolling, not for returning data to vehicles or motorists for response. GPS will nevertheless be one of the key components in VII systems.|$|R

40|$|Road freight is an {{important}} aspect of the growing Australian economy. Between 2009 and 2014, there has been an increase of approximately 14. 7 % in the number of registered heavy vehicles, including light rigid, heavy rigid and articulated vehicles. Due to the operational (e. g. acceleration/deceleration, manoeuvrability) and physical (e. g. length, size) characteristics of heavy vehicles, they impose negative impacts on surrounding traffic, including increased traffic congestion, reduced traffic safety and environmental impacts, such as increased vehicular emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, NOx and carbon dioxide). The negative impacts imposed by heavy vehicles are intensified at interrupted traffic flows due to the presence of traffic lights. The acceleration/deceleration performance of heavy vehicles at traffic lights is lower than that of light vehicles. Due to the physical and operational characteristics of heavy vehicles, they impose negative impacts on the surrounding traffic. Different strategies have been applied to urban corridors to mitigate these impacts. Signal coordination will be implemented as a heavy vehicle management method. This research will test whether signal coordination may be a viable option to control heavy vehicles on an urban corridor. On the other hand, this research will implement a restriction strategy which restricts heavy vehicles based on their type (rigid, heavy combination and multi combination) as another form of heavy vehicle management. The road section that is used in this research is a section of Princes Highway in Melbourne, Australia. This section is 8. 2 km long with 3 lanes on each direction, and 13 signalised intersections within that distance. This section is selected since {{it is one of the}} main corridor in Melbourne with high percentage of heavy vehicles. In addition, many traffic signals exist in the selected section of highway which forms interrupted traffic flows. The research is initiated by modelling the corridor of study using VISSIM microscopic traffic simulation package. The model is built based on the physical characteristics of Princes Highway including number of lanes, lane widths, entry points and exit points. In this research, signal coordination is examined to assess its validity as an efficient method to reduce congestion caused by heavy vehicles. Three different signal coordination set-ups are used in this research. The first set-up targets passenger cars as the main beneficiary of signal coordination. The second set-up targets heavy vehicles as the main beneficiary of signal coordination. The third and final set-up targets all <b>vehicles</b> on the <b>corridor.</b> The influence of signal coordination was evaluated at existing heavy vehicle compositions, then the heavy vehicle composition is increased at 5 % increments reaching up to a 30 % heavy vehicle composition. Increasing the heavy vehicle compositions tested the ability of signal coordination to cope with the increased number of heavy <b>vehicles</b> in the <b>corridor.</b> The results from this research shows that signal coordination can be used as a heavy vehicle management method on a highway with interrupted traffic flows and during congestion. In addition, this research also shows that signal coordination is capable of handling high heavy vehicle compositions. On the other hand, three restriction strategies are evaluated in this thesis. Each restriction strategy restricts a certain type of heavy vehicle. The heavy vehicle types are categorised based on the guidelines used in the State of Victoria, Australia. The first management strategy restricts multi combination vehicles from using the corridor. The second strategy restricts multi and heavy combination vehicles from using the corridor. The third strategy restricts all heavy vehicles from using the corridor. This research has provided insight on the influence of a vehicle type restriction strategy. The main reason for proposing such a restriction strategy is to differentiate between the types of heavy vehicles and provide a clear picture of the influence that each heavy vehicle type poses on the surrounding traffic...|$|R
