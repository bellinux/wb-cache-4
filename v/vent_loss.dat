40|$|A pilot {{carbon dioxide}} {{miscible}} flood was initiated in the Lansing Kansas City C {{formation in the}} Hall Gurney Field, Russell County, Kansas. Continuous carbon dioxide injection began on December 2, 2003. By the end of December 2004, 11. 39 MM lb of carbon dioxide were injected into the pilot area. Carbon dioxide injection rates averaged about 242 MCFD. Vent losses were excessive during June as ambient temperatures increased. Installation of smaller plungers in the carbon dioxide injection pump reduced the recycle and <b>vent</b> <b>loss</b> substantially. Carbon dioxide was detected in one production well {{near the end of}} May and in the second production well in August. No channeling of carbon dioxide was observed. The GOR has remained within the range of 3000 - 4000 for most the last six months. Wells in the pilot area produced 100 % water {{at the beginning of the}} flood. Oil production began in February, increasing to an average of about 2. 35 B/D for the six month period between July 1 and December 31. Cumulative oil production was 814 bbls. Neither well has experienced increased oil production rates expected from the arrival of the oil bank generated by carbon dioxide injection...|$|E

A transient thermodynamic model {{was developed and}} used in this paper to evaluate the pathways that minimize both operating (<b>venting</b> <b>losses)</b> and capital (size of the cryogenic vessels cascade) costs. Various conditions were simulated, including operating conditions and vessel design. Results were given as a ratio of <b>venting</b> <b>losses</b> per kg H 2 dispensed, and as a material balance (liner and overwrap) for the cascade necessary to meet a certain given size. Typical HDSAM assumptions were used for station sizing, including the utilization profile, also known as “Chevron” profile...|$|R

40|$|The {{demonstration}} {{of a unique}} liquid hydrogen (LH 2) storage and feed system concept for solar thermal upper stage was cooperatively accomplished by a Boeing/NASA Marshall Space Flight Center team. The strategy was to balance thermodynamic venting with the engine thrusting timeline during a representative 30 -day mission, thereby, assuring no <b>vent</b> <b>losses.</b> Using a 2 cubic m (71 cubic ft) LH 2 tank, proof-of-concept testing consisted of an engineering checkout followed by a 30 -day mission simulation. The data were used to anchor a combination of standard analyses and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. Dependence on orbital testing has been incrementally reduced as CFD codes, combined with standard modeling, continue to be challenged with test data such as this...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{application}} of insulated pressure vessels for hydrogen-fueled light-duty vehicles. Insulated pressure vessels can store liquid hydrogen (LH 2); low-temperature (90 K) compressed hydrogen (CH 2); or ambient temperature CH 2. In this analysis, hydrogen temperatures, pressures and <b>venting</b> <b>losses</b> am calculated for insulated pressure vessels fueled with LH 2 or with low-temperature CH 2, {{and the results are}} compared to those obtained in low-pressure LH 2 tanks. Hydrogen losses are calculated as a function of daily driving distance during normal operation; as a function of time during long periods of vehicle inactivity; and as a function of initial vessel temperature during fueling. The number of days before any <b>venting</b> <b>losses</b> occur is also calculated {{as a function of the}} daily driving distance. The results show that insulated pressure vessels have packaging characteristics comparable to those of conventional, low-pressure LH 2 tanks (low weight and volume), with greatly improved dormancy and much lower boil-off. Insulated pressure vessels used in a 17 km/l (40 mpg) car do not lose any hydrogen when the car is driven at least 15 km/day in average. Since almost all cars are driven for longer distances, most cars would never lose any hydrogen. Losses during long periods of parking are also relatively small. Due to their high-pressure capacity, these vessels would retain about a third of their full charge even after a very long dormancy, so that the owner would not risk running out of fuel. If an insulated pressure vessel reaches ambient temperature, it can be cooled down very effectively by fueling it with LH 2 with no losses during fueling. The vessel has good thermal performance even when thermally insulated with inexpensive microsphere insulation. In addition, the insulated pressure vessels greatly ease fuel availability and infrastructure requirements, since it would be compatible with both compressed and cryogenic hydrogen reveling...|$|R

However, living related donation exposes healthy donors to a certain risk of morbidity and even mortality. Anesthetic manage- ment of elective live donation surgery with a relatively young and healthy patient is apparently simple; nonetheless, it requires both knowledge and diligence from the anesthesiologist. Some concerns persist regarding the appropriate intraoperative organ protection strategy and potential negative effects of certain surgical maneuvers on graft function. Even when careful {{attention is paid to}} maintaining intraoperative cardiorespiratory and metabolic homeostasis, pre- <b>venting</b> blood <b>loss,</b> preserving renal function, and assuring adequate postoperative analgesia, among other things, these procedures are not completely devoid of some major risks related to anesthesia and surgery. Maximal effort should be applied to minimize the perioperative risks for the donor, every minimal impending complication should be promptly recognized, and a timely treatment implemented. Some anesthetic considerations regarding the most frequently performed living organ transplantations are briefly reported in this article...|$|R

40|$|Juveniles {{from three}} species of Hawaiian gobiid fishes climb waterfalls {{as part of}} an amphidromous life cycle, {{allowing}} them to re-penetrate adult upstream habitats after being swept out to the ocean upon hatching. The importance of climbing for juvenile stream gobies is well established, but adult fish in upstream island habitats also face potential downstream displacement by periodic disturbances. Thus, retention of climbing ability could be advantageous for adult stream gobies. Climbing performance might be expected to decline among adults, however, due to the tendency for mass-specific muscular power production to decrease with body size, and a lack of positively allometric growth among structures like the pelvic sucker that support body weight against gravity. To evaluate changes in waterfall-climbing ability with body size in Hawaiian stream gobies, we compared climbing performance and kinematics between adults and juveniles from three species: Awaous guamensis, Sicyopterus stimpsoni and Lentipes concolor. For species in which juveniles climbed using ‘powerbursts’ of axial undulation, adult performance and kinematics showed marked changes: adult A. guamensis failed to climb, and adult L. concolor used multiple pectoral fin adductions to crutch up surfaces at slow speeds, rather than rapid powerbursts. Adult S. stimpsoni, like juveniles, still used oral and pelvic suckers to ‘inch’ up surfaces and climbed at speeds comparable to those of juveniles. However, unlike juveniles, adult S. stimpsoni also add pectoral fin crutching to every climbing cycle. Thus, although powerburst species appear to be particularly susceptible to size-related declines in waterfall-climbing performance, the addition of compensatory mechanisms pre- <b>vents</b> the <b>loss</b> of this novel function in some species...|$|R

The US market only 79 % when Russia markets 98 % of the gross production. The total loss is still significant, being over 8 % of the gross (flared & vented on decline, other losses on rise), but globally in decline as it was 27 % in 1950 and 16 % in 1970.
