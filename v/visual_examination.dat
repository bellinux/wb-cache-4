25|$|Many {{physicians}} in ancient history resorted to the inspection and {{examination of the}} urine of their patients. Hermogenes wrote about the color and other attributes of urine as indicators of certain diseases. Abdul Malik Ibn Habib of Andalusia d.862 AD, mentions numerous reports of urine examination throughout the Umayyad empire. Diabetes mellitus got its name because the urine is plentiful and sweet. The name uroscopy refers to any <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> of the urine, including microscopy, although it often refers to the aforementioned prescientific or protoscientific forms of urine examination. Clinical urine tests today duly note the gross color, turbidity, and odor of urine but also include urinalysis, which chemically analyzes the urine and quantifies its constituents. A culture of the urine is performed when a urinary tract infection is suspected, as bacteria in the urine are unusual otherwise. A microscopic examination of the urine {{may be helpful to}} identify organic or inorganic substrates and help in the diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{intraocular pressure}} (IOP) variations after automated <b>visual</b> field <b>examination</b> {{in patients with}} primary open-angle glaucoma and in healthy subjects.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} level of {{agreement}} between carious lesion assessments according to the <b>visual</b> clinical <b>examination</b> and the colour photograph methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data {{on the presence of}} enamel/dentin carious lesions in previously sealed occlusal surfaces in first molars were obtained by two trained and calibrated examiners through <b>visual</b> clinical <b>examination</b> and from colour photographs 4 years after sealing. Kappa statistics were applied to calculate agreement between assessment methods. Data analysis was performed using sign, Bowker symmetry and McNemar's tests. RESULTS: The prevalence of dentin carious lesions was very low. The kappa coefficients for detecting enamel/dentin carious lesions using the two assessment methods were 0. 65 (CI: 0. 56 - 0. 74) for examiner 1 and 0. 70 (CI: 0. 62 - 0. 78) for examiner 2. Examiner 2 observed more enamel/dentin carious lesions on colour photographs than did examiner 1 (p = 0. 008). Sensitivity analyses did not confirm this outcome. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the detection of enamel/dentin carious lesions in previously sealed occlusal surfaces using colour photographs vs <b>visual</b> clinical <b>examination.</b> The colour photograph method is therefore equivalent to the <b>visual</b> clinical <b>examination</b> in detecting enamel/dentin carious lesions.

500|$|When {{there is}} summer melting, the melted snow refreezes {{lower in the}} snow and firn, and the {{resulting}} layer of ice has very few bubbles so is easy to recognise in a <b>visual</b> <b>examination</b> of a core.

40|$|To {{compare the}} levels of {{agreement}} and the survival rates of sealant retention for different sealing materials over a 2 -year period assessed using the <b>visual</b> clinical <b>examination</b> and replica methods, sealant retention data were obtained by <b>visual</b> clinical <b>examination</b> and from replicas of the same sealed tooth at baseline and at 0. 5 -, 1 - and 2 -year evaluation points in 407 children and were compared for agreement using kappa coefficients. Survival curves of retained sealants on occlusal surfaces were created using modified categorisation (fully retained sealants and those having all pits and fissures partly covered with the sealant material versus completely lost sealants that included pit and fissure systems that had >/= 1 pit re-exposed) according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The kappa coefficient for the agreement between both assessment methods over the three evaluation time points combined was 0. 38 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 35 - 0. 41). More sealant retention was observed from replicas than through <b>visual</b> clinical <b>examination.</b> Cumulative survival curves at the three evaluation times were not statistically significantly higher when assessed from replicas (P= 0. 47).
