On the black mourning garments of the nobles are projected the gold-embroidered vestments, thus creating an intense ceremonial character. In the heavenly space {{there is a}} predominance of transparent harmonies of iridescence and ivoried greys, which harmonize with the gilded ochres, while in the Madonna's maforium (mantle) deep blue is closely combined with bright red.

The final scene was a <b>very</b> <b>moving</b> salute to Molly as he returns to public life after a lengthy hospital stay. Actual footage of Molly himself receiving a standing ovation as he walks out {{with the aid of a}} walking stick ends the series.|$|E
25|$|According to musicologist Gerald Abraham, the operas on {{the whole}} embody an {{enormous}} mass of music far too beautiful and interesting to be ignored. Moreover, he maintains, Tchaikovsky's search for operatic subjects, along with his views on their nature and treatment and his own work on librettos, throw considerable light on his creative personality. Nevertheless, according to musicologist Francis Maes, most of Tchaikovsky's operas failed for three reasons. First, the composer could not get good librettos, despite continued requests to some of Russia's leading playwrights and his brother Modest. Second, he was no Verdi, Puccini or Leoncavalo. While he could write music that was often beautiful and sometimes <b>very</b> <b>moving,</b> it was generally not as arresting dramatically as anything those three provided. Third, and perhaps most sadly, Tchaikovsky's enthusiasm for opera writing did not match his theatrical sense. Apparently either unaware of this deficiency or unable to curb his excitement long enough to take a cold, {{hard look at the}} true stage-worthiness of a libretto, he seemed destined to repeat his failures.|$|E

He introduced a number of progressions to painting in Cologne, especially by filling his backgrounds and landscapes with specific and elaborate details, and by rendering his figures with more bulk and volume. Wellesz described his paintings as evidencing an [...] "intensity of feeling which gives a very special and <b>very</b> <b>moving</b> quality to his work.

500|$|Cooper {{reunited with}} Lawrence in the Susanne Bier-directed drama Serena—an {{adaptation}} of Ron Rash's period novel. The pair starred as {{a married couple}} who become involved in criminal activities after realizing that they cannot bear children. The picture was filmed in 2012, but was released in 2014 to negative reviews and poor box office returns. The Canberra Times Jake Wilson said: [...] "Cooper once again proves his value as a leading man who approaches his roles like a character actor." [...] In 2014, Cooper provided the voice of Rocket Raccoon in the Marvel Studios film Guardians of the Galaxy. He returned to Broadway for the 2014 run of The Elephant Man as the severely deformed Joseph Merrick. Michael Coveney of Whatsonstage.com reviewed his performance: [...] "Cooper avoids every trap of [...] "disability" [...] acting by suffusing this outer appearance with soul and passion.

[...] In this statement, Bilheimer requested that people screening previous versions of the film tell their audiences that the presence of Somaly in the film is understandably a distraction, that the film is not primarily about Somaly but rather about the millions of children in slavery in the world, and that this focus is what is most important about the film.|$|E

He adapted 21 minutes of material taken from his electronic music for Freitag aus Licht, calling the result Zwei Paare (Two Couples), and the Brothers Quay created their animated film, which they titled In Absentia, based only on their reactions to the music and the simple suggestion that a window might be an idea to use [...] When, at a preview screening, Stockhausen saw the film, which shows a madwoman writing letters from a bleak asylum cell, he was moved to tears.

They had a scheduled session in Page's home in Malibu, California and finished the song the next day. Cowell secured a songwriting credit for coming up with the idea. In an interview with HitQuarters, Magnusson said they had thought the song would be a good idea for Irish boy band Westlife, but it was offered to British singer Leona Lewis instead. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting". Regarding the song, Lewis commented: [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational so we put it into a song.

In 1913 Shaw declared {{that he was not}} religious [...] "in the sectarian sense", aligning himself with Jesus as [...] "a person of no religion". In the preface (1915) to Androcles and the Lion, Shaw asks [...] "Why not give Christianity a chance?" [...] contending that Britain's social order resulted from the continuing choice of Barabbas over Christ. In a broadcast just before the Second World War, Shaw invoked the Sermon on the Mount, [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>moving</b> exhortation, and it gives you one first-rate tip, which is to do good to those who despitefully use you and persecute you". In his will, Shaw stated that his [...] "religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution". He requested that no one should imply that he accepted the beliefs of any specific religious organisation, and that no memorial to him should [...] "take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice".|$|E
