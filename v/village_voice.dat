From 1958—2009, he wrote weekly columns on education, civil liberties, politics, and capital punishment, among other topics for the <b>Village</b> <b>Voice.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February 2008, Hentoff was {{a weekly}} {{contributing}} columnist at WorldNetDaily.com. In January 2009, the <b>Village</b> <b>Voice,</b> which had regularly published Hentoff's commentary and criticism for fifty years, {{announced that he}} had been laid off. He then went on to write for publications such as United Features, Jewish World Review, and The Wall Street Journal. Hentoff joined the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, as a senior fellow in February 2009.|$|E
5|$|Hentoff {{wrote for}} many publications, {{including}} The New Yorker (1960—1986), The Washington Post (1984—2000), and The Washington Times.

5|$|The second {{show was}} widely {{acknowledged}} as {{superior to the}} afternoon performance, although <b>Village</b> <b>Voice</b> reviewer Don Heckman noted that many in the audience reacted to the Shankar–Khan opening set {{with a lack of}} respect. Not aiding the Indian musicians was the failure of a microphone on Rakha's hand drums, Heckman observed, so denying the crowd a vital element of the musical interplay between sitar and sarod.|$|E
5|$|The series {{attracted}} {{criticism for}} making generalizations about sexual identity, namely that homosexual men are inherently more fashionable and stylish than heterosexuals. Among those making this critique were Tom Shales in the Washington Post ("stereotypes on parade"), Richard Goldstein in <b>Village</b> <b>Voice</b> ("Haven't fags always been consigned {{to the role}} of body servant?") and United States Congressman Barney Frank speaking to the New York Post.|$|E
5|$|A Trip to the Moon {{was named}} one of the 100 {{greatest}} films of the 20th century by The <b>Village</b> <b>Voice,</b> ranked 84th.

It is widely regarded as the earliest example of the science fiction film genre and, more generally, as one of the most influential films in cinema history.|$|E

The New York Amsterdam News, based in Harlem, {{is one of the}} leading African American weekly newspapers in the United States. The <b>Village</b> <b>Voice,</b> historically the largest alternative newspaper in the United States, announced in 2017 that it would cease publication of its print edition and convert to a fully digital venture.|$|E
5|$|The video {{has been}} well received, cited {{as one of the}} first {{examples}} of machinima-based music videos, and has since spawned several fan-based imitations with Voldo dancing to various songs. Several sources such as The <b>Village</b> <b>Voice</b> have praised the video for its choreography and presentation, while several books and college professors have cited it as a notable example of machinima animation in lectures on the subject. It was also nominated at the 2005 Machinima Film Festival awards for Best Virtual Performance, and served as part of an exhibit for the San Jose Museum of Art.|$|E

5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The <b>Village</b> <b>Voice</b> writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood's career {{reached a}} turning point in 1971. Before Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had {{discussed}} the idea of Malpaso producing Play Misty for Me, a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director. The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood), who has a casual affair with Evelyn (Jessica Walter), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night, asking him to play her favorite song – Erroll Garner's Misty. When Dave ends their relationship, the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker. Filming commenced in Monterey in September 1970 and included footage of that year's Monterey Jazz Festival. The film was highly acclaimed with critics, such as Jay Cocks in Time magazine, Andrew Sarris in the <b>Village</b> <b>Voice,</b> and Archer Winsten in the New York Post all praising the film, as well as Eastwood's directorial skills and performance. Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award (Drama), for her performance in the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first {{instances}} of homosexuals fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was {{across the street from}} The <b>Village</b> <b>Voice</b> offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police. Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community {{in the weeks and months}} after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual Gay Pride events around the world.|$|E

5|$|With ultra-violent {{films such}} as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Thirst (2009), Park Chan-wook of South Korea {{has been the most}} {{prominent}} director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium. The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with the odd bit of color. The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Another comic book adaptation with similar style and elements is The Spirit (2008). This film is adapted from the comic book of the same name originally created by cartoonist Will Eisner. Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for Road to Perdition (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and A History of Violence (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film {{of the year in the}} annual <b>Village</b> <b>Voice</b> poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson's Brick (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series Veronica Mars (2004–07) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples of this sort of generic crossover have been dubbed teen noir.|$|E
