In 1572 the <b>vacant</b> <b>post</b> of Lord High Treasurer was offered to Leicester, who declined and proposed Burghley, stating that the latter was the much more suitable candidate. In later years, being at odds, Dudley felt like reminding Cecil of their [...] "thirty years friendship".|$|E

2500|$|He {{remained}} {{at his home}} studying and teaching until 1845, {{when he went to}} London to apply for the <b>vacant</b> <b>post</b> of assistant hazzan of the Spanish and Portuguese congregation in that city.

During this period he formed a close friendship with Joseph Mazzini, and that patriot's struggle for Italian freedom was warmly seconded by Morais.|$|E
2500|$|There is some {{dispute over}} whether he {{remained}} in Rome after 1566: [...] he may have moved {{to the service of}} Cardinal Luigi d'Este, but no documentation survives other than the suggestive dedication to Luigi d'Este of some motets that Portinaro published in 1568. [...] Musicologist Alfred Einstein believed that Portinaro was in Venice sometime around 1567 as a printer and publisher, not of music but poetry, including verse by Pietro Bembo and others. [...] Whether he went to Venice or not, in 1568 Portinaro moved back to Padua, and then later that same year went to Vienna, most likely to apply for the <b>vacant</b> <b>post</b> of choirmaster at the court of Maximilian II. [...] Unsuccessful in this endeavor, he returned to Padua sometime before March 1569, and he seems to have spent {{the rest of his life}} in his native city.|$|E
