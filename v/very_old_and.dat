She later appears in numerous flashbacks, illuminating her involvement not only with Angel, but also with Spike.|$|E
500|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} about the origins {{and development of the}} valkyries from Germanic paganism to later Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek suggests valkyries were probably originally viewed as [...] "demons of the dead to whom warriors slain on the battlefield belonged", and that a shift in interpretation of the valkyries may have occurred [...] "when the concept of Valhalla changed from a battlefield to a warrior's paradise". Simek says that this original concept was [...] "superseded by the shield girls—Irish female warriors who lived on like the einherjar in Valhall." [...] Simek says that the valkyries were closely associated with Odin, and that this connection existed in an earlier role as [...] "demons of death". Simek states that due to the shift of concept, the valkyries became popular figures in heroic poetry, and during this transition were stripped of their [...] "demonic characteristics and became more human, and therefore become capable of falling in love with mortals [...]" [...] Simek says {{that the majority of the}} names of the valkyries point to a warlike function, that most of valkyrie names do not appear to be <b>very</b> <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> that the names [...] "mostly come from poetic creativity rather than from real folk-belief." ...|$|E
