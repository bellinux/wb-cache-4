50|$|In 1993 Jeep re-introduced Quadra-Trac, {{this time}} on the Jeep Grand Cherokee using the NP249 {{transfer}} case. Like the NP219, this transfer case utilizes a center differential with a <b>viscous</b> <b>coupler</b> to provide smooth and efficient four-wheel drive operation on all surfaces. This system has 4WD All-Time, Neutral, and 4WD Low modes. In normal 4WD All-time mode, the center differential is open and distributes torque to both {{the front and rear}} axles. When a difference in speed occurs between the axles, heat buildup causes the viscous fluid inside the coupler to thicken, which progressively locks the center differential thus transferring power to the axle with more traction. In 4WD Low, the input torque is multiplied through a 2.72:1 planetary gearset. NP249 transfer cases used the <b>viscous</b> <b>coupler</b> to transfer power in both high and low ranges.|$|E
5000|$|The antenna {{pedestal}} {{was a high}} precision, two axis mount, using a {{hydrostatic bearing}} in azimuth and phase roller bearings in elevation to provide mobility and support to the counterbalanced, solid surface antenna. The antenna was positioned through anti-backlash dual drive pedestal gearing via a high torque-to-inertia electro-hydraulic valve motor system. A <b>viscous</b> <b>coupler</b> located between the valve motor and pedestal drive gearing damped out undesired mechanical resonances.|$|E
50|$|In general, New Process {{transfer}} {{cases are}} identified by a three-digit code. The first digit (1 or 2) determines {{the number of}} gear ranges. The second digit is a series number that reflects design, and provides minimal information about torque handling. For example, if the second digit is a 1, there is no two-wheel-drive option; {{if it is a}} 2, 2WD is available. Other numbers have similar meanings. The third digit indicates differential type: 1 means locked (no differential), 2 means open, 3 means electric locked, 4 and 5 both indicate an asymmetrical torque split planetary gear and gear drive, 6 means an electronic clutch pack, 7 means a hydraulic clutch pack (except for the unique 207), and 9 means a <b>viscous</b> <b>coupler.</b>|$|E
50|$|Selectable 4WD {{has both}} axles rigidly coupled together, which has some {{advantages}} in very poor off-road conditions. To gain the same advantage in a permanent AWD {{system with a}} differential, the differential can be locked manually with a differential lock. As this control is frequently misunderstood and mis-used, which can then cause damage due to wind-up, they {{have tended to be}} replaced by automatic locking through the <b>viscous</b> <b>couplers.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a single-axis haptic interface {{which is based}} on a dualstage actuator technique and which is aimed at achieving perfect transparency to a human user. The paper shows how all parasitic forces arising from inertia and friction can be brought below human detection thresholds, yet, the system is able to output significant torque. It has a stage with a large motor coupled to a distal stage with a smaller motor via a <b>viscous</b> <b>coupler</b> based on the principle of eddy current induction. The paper also describes its control principle and preliminary results...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDirect, manual {{interaction}} with the micro/nano scales is not straightforward because the objects at this scale obey unituitive physics. For instance, in ambient conditions at the micro-scale, capillary forces dominate over many other forces. When the scale becomes smaller, Brow-nian motion becomes pervasive. Haptic interfaces give us the option to bring the experience of this physics with the direct reach of the human sensorimotor capabilities. To cope with the limitations of conventional force feedback devices, we present here two alternative dual-stage designs suitable {{to address the needs}} of the {{interaction with}} the micro/nano scales. The first one features very low apparent inertia, a large dynamics range and a wide bandwidth. This properties are obtained by coupling a large actuator to a small one via a <b>viscous</b> <b>coupler.</b> Feedback can then be used to achieve nearly perfect transparency. The second is a conventional force feedback device augmented with a tactile transducer. The two channels are frequency compensated to achieved a flat response fro DC to one kHz...|$|E
