An alternative is a <b>victimisation</b> <b>survey</b> (or victim study) in which a random sample of the population is asked about their experiences with crime and victimisation.

40|$|The author {{argues that}} {{statistics}} of police-recorded crimes have limited utility for cross-country analyses of crime, due to varying legal definitions, reporting patterns and recording practices. In his view stand alone national <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys,</b> with their varying methodologies and questionnaires, cannot reliably {{be used for}} cross-national comparisons either. This {{is especially true for}} older versions of such surveys, modelled after the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) of the USA, which try to mimic their country’s official statistics of police-recorded crimes. <b>Victimisation</b> <b>surveys</b> in the European tradition use less legalistic definitions of the public’s experiences of crime and are therefore more conducive to international standardisation. When such surveys are standardised to cover the common ground of crime in multiple jurisdictions, {{as is the case in}} the International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS), they can provide comparable data on the level and trends of crime of individual nations at relatively modest costs. In addition, such surveys can provide comparative data on crime reporting by victims, satisfaction with responses from police and other agencies, as well as on public attitudes toward safety and criminal justice. In the discussion, the author argues for an expedient execution of the planned EU Safety Survey in the European Union (EUSASU) and further work on the standardisation of <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys</b> across the world by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) ...|$|R

50|$|Initially {{the survey}} covered England, Wales and Scotland and {{was called the}} British Crime Survey but now the survey is {{restricted}} to England and Wales. The Scottish Government has commissioned a bespoke survey of victimisation in Scotland called the Scottish Crime and <b>Victimisation</b> <b>Survey</b> (SCVS). As a result of this, the British Crime Survey was renamed the Crime Survey for England and Wales to reflect this. The British Crime Survey had been first carried out in 1982 and further surveys were carried out in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2001. Since April 2001, BCS interviews had been carried out on a continuous basis and detailed results from that point are now reported by financial years.

50|$|The Crime Survey for England and Wales is {{an attempt}} to measure both the amount of crime, and the impact of crime on England and Wales. The {{original}} survey (carried out in 1982, to cover the 1981 year) covered all three judicial areas of the UK, and was therefore referred to as the British Crime Survey, but now it only covers England and Wales. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, similar surveys, namely the Scottish Crime and <b>Victimisation</b> <b>Survey</b> and Northern Ireland Crime Survey have similar purposes. These surveys collect information about the victims of crime, the circumstances surrounding the crime, and the behaviour of the perpetrators. They are used to plan, and measure the results of, crime reduction or perception measures. In addition, they collect data about the perception of issues such as antisocial behaviour and the criminal justice system.|$|E

Introduction: This publication presents findings from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2012 – 13 Crime <b>Victimisation</b> <b>Survey,</b> which was conducted throughout Australia from July 2012 to June 2013. This is the fifth annual national survey of crime victimisation in Australia, with the first Crime <b>Victimisation</b> <b>Survey</b> conducted in 2008 – 09. The publication presents estimates {{of the extent of}} victimisation experienced by Australians aged 15 years and over of selected types of crime and whether or not the most recent incident of each crime type was reported to police. The survey also collects information about selected characteristics of incidents of victimisation (such as the location of the incident and the victim’s relationship to the offender) and socio-demographic details of victims (such as age, sex and education) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMeasuring crime trends {{can draw}} upon several data sources. <b>Victimisation</b> <b>surveys,</b> {{questioning}} population samples on offences {{to which they}} had been prey over a given period, were invented because a number of offences are not found in police and gendarmerie activity statistics.

50|$|The Ministry of Justice has {{conducted}} Crime and Safety Surveys in 2006 and 2009 to assess victimisation rates {{as well as}} other research about crime in New Zealand. Victim surveys tend to suggest that {{less than a third of}} crime is actually reported to Police which is consistent with <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys</b> in similar countries such as Australia, Britain and the USA. However, victim surveys also include reports of relatively minor matters which would not necessarily be seen as crimes by the justice system so interpretation of the figures is difficult.|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: The {{second half}} of the 20 th century has {{witnessed}} a watershed in the systematic study of crime. Until then, crime estimates were locked up in an administrative monopoly: the only available figures resulted from counting the activities of various criminal justice agencies. By contrast, from then on, alternative measurement methods were developed based on general population surveys, which severed the crime estimates’ dependency on the operation of the police or the courts. However, widening the range of the tools used for measuring crime will only be fruitful if their consideration proceeds beyond mere juxtaposition, towards genuine comparison. This volume accounts for the comparisons performed in a number of European countries between official criminal statistics and <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{the emergence of}} victimology as a major subdiscipline within criminology. Its growth is traced to intellectual debates and problematics {{in the history of}} criminology, and the interactions with wider political and social currents. Chapter I provides an overview of literature in victimology, its scope and areas of theory and research. Chapter II examines the context of the 'discovery of criminal victimisation' by the President's Crime Commission, 1967, and, the linking of state intervention in crime and poverty in the reformism of the Johns on Administration. Victimology' s growth is linked to the 'data revolution' in criminal justice and. the state fundine of <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys</b> through the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. Chapter III analyses the alliance between sooial science and social democracy, and Chapter IV deals with the alliance of criminologists and social reformism in relation to the political history of crime statistics. The latter's problems are assessed in relation to the 'dark figure' of crime, and the roles of police and victims. The chapter also evaluates the claims that <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys</b> are a superior method of counting crime. Chapter V examines the orientation towards victims. in social democratic, right-wing and radical criminologies. Chapter VI traces the intellectual and political backgrounds of the Merseyside and Islington Crime Surveys, including the debates within the Labour Party on policing and crime, and the alliance between radical v. reformists and left-realist criminologists. Chapter VII describes the design of a draft questionnaire for the Islington Crime Survey and offers a critical comparison of the questionnaires for the final Islington and Merseyside questionnaires and those used in other surveys. Chapter VIII summarizes the themes and findings of this thesis and comments upon the theoretical methodological and policy issues {{for the development of a}} radical victimology...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEstimating {{the trend}} in a type of crime {{requires}} the comparison of data from several sources.

Because of the variety of types of violence possibly experienced by survey participants, these will be divided into three categories, analysed in the following order : - serious physical violence entailing working incapacity of at least eight days, - other physical violence (less serious injury, blows, and so on), - " other " violence (such as rackets, non-violent snatching, threats, insults, and so on) ...|$|R

The survey, which measured common and non-conventional crime such as fraud, IP theft and corruption, is important because few crime victim surveys have been conducted with Chinese populations and it provides an understanding of some dimensions of crime in non-western societies. In addition, China is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and it attracts a great amount of foreign investment; however, corruption and economic crimes are perceived by some investors as significant obstacles to good business practices.

40|$|As well as {{seeking to}} measure the extent and nature of poverty, the 1990 Breadline Britain survey {{attempted}} to establish {{the extent to which}} the damage to the lives of people living in poverty is compounded by social problems such as crime and fear of crime (Pantazis and Gordon, 1997). The view held by Mack and Lansley (1985) is that poor people suffer disproportionately from victimisation, as well from the effects of victimisation. This idea has strong support from the ‘new realist ’ criminologists who argue that poor people are the disproportionate victims of working class crime (Lea and Young, 1984). The development of the local <b>victimisation</b> <b>survey</b> as a method of tapping into the crimes committed against poor people, women, and ethnic minorities is one of the main ways the ‘new realist ’ criminologists have sought to take inner city crime mor...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{accounts}} {{of fear of}} crime and victimisation have largely concentrated on factors associated with the individual such as their age, sex or ethnicity and more recently in Northern Ireland their religion. This conventional approach, adopted by many national <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys</b> such as the British Crime Surveys and the Northern Ireland Crime Survey, has lead to assertions that, for example, women and older people are more anxious about victimisation and Protestants in Northern Ireland are more worried about terrorist attack than their Catholic counterparts. Drawing {{on the results of}} the first community based crime survey conducted in Northern Ireland, this paper explores {{the extent to which the}} community in which an individual lives, as opposed to their individual characteristics, directly impacts on their fear of crime. It is argued that, by overlooking the significance of community based factors, some criminologists may actually be obscuring our understanding of the dynamics of this fear. © 1999, A B Academic Publishers-Printed in Great Britain.

50|$|The Swedish police record each {{instance}} of sexual violence {{in every case}} separately, leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries. Sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape. This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries. For example, in 2005 Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider, {{which led to a}} marked increase in reports. Additionally, the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases, in an effort to decrease the number of unreported cases. For this reason, large-scale <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys</b> have been presented by criminologists as a more reliable indicator of rape prevalence. An EU-wide survey on sexual violence against women, published by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) in 2014, showed Sweden was only third highest, below Denmark and Finland and a previous assessment by Brå have placed Sweden at an average level among European nations.|$|R
40|$|For many years, {{measuring}} crime on {{the sole}} basis of computations {{of the operations}} of the public agencies in charge of its control implied great implicit confidence in the adequacy of their action to expectations for safety-maintenance. Over the last thirty years, all comparable countries have gradually come to resort at least partially to surveys, revealing their increasing doubts about this adequacy. In 1996 the Insee [the French national institute for statistics} inserted a module on <b>victimisation</b> in its <b>survey</b> of the living conditions of households, thus yielding an opportunity to measure medium-term variations from one decade to another, {{for the first time in}} France. Comparison of these findings with the only national survey available so far (Cesdip, 1986) shows how different the picture is for violence and property offences, in terms of numbers and of trends. It is also possible to evaluate the extent -variable, depending on the kinds of victimisation- to which official statistics still reliably account for trends as well as for orders of magnitude. Aside from its methodological teaching, this analysis modifies and clarifies present controversies over crime. Robert Philippe, Zauberman Renée, Pottier Marie-Lys, Lagrange Hugues.
