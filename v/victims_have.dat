5|$|Blood lead {{concentrations}} in poisoning <b>victims</b> <b>have</b> ranged from 30->80µg/dL in children exposed to lead paint in older houses, 77–104µg/dL in persons working with pottery glazes, 90–137µg/dL in individuals consuming contaminated herbal medicines, 109–139µg/dL in indoor shooting range instructors and {{as high as}} 330µg/dL in those drinking fruit juices from glazed earthenware containers.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the scandal, formal procedures have been established to help prevent abuse, encourage the reporting of any abuse that occurs and to handle such reports promptly, although groups representing <b>victims</b> <b>have</b> disputed their effectiveness. In 2014, Pope Francis instituted the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors for the safeguarding of minors.|$|E
50|$|If the <b>victim</b> <b>has</b> no {{suspected}} cervical spine trauma, {{open the}} airway using the head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver; if the <b>victim</b> <b>has</b> suspected neck trauma, the airway should be opened with the jaw-thrust technique. If the jaw-thrust is ineffective at opening/maintaining the airway, a very careful head-tilt/chin-lift should be performed.|$|R
25|$|All of Haarmann's {{victims were}} dismembered before {{their bodies were}} discarded, usually in the Leine River, {{although}} the dismembered body of his first known <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> simply been buried, and the body of his last <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> been thrown into a lake located {{at the entrance to}} the Herrenhausen Gardens.|$|R

5|$|In total, 1,650 Whites {{died in the}} Red terror, while around 10,000 Reds {{perished in}} the White terror, which {{eventually}} became political cleansing. The White <b>victims</b> <b>have</b> been recorded exactly, while in particular {{the number of the}} Red troopers executed immediately after the combats remains unclear. Together with the prison camp experiences of the Reds in summer 1918, the executions caused the deepest mental war wounds and scars among the Finns, regardless of their political allegiance. Some of those, who carried out the killings were seriously traumatized, a phenomenon that was later to become well-documented.|$|E
5|$|Some Weiquan {{lawyers have}} {{advocated}} {{for the rights}} of HIV/AIDS victims who contracted the virus as a result of state-sponsored blood drives. In the 1990s, government officials in central China, and especially in Henan, encouraged rural citizens to sell blood plasma in order to supplement their incomes. Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being infected with HIV. According to activists, <b>victims</b> <b>have</b> not been compensated, and no government officials were held accountable. Authorities continue to suppress information about the epidemic, which is particularly sensitive in light of the involvement of Li Changchun, the Communist Party Propaganda head and formerly Party chief in Henan.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{assessment}} is recommended if simple pain relief does not resolve local pain, or systemic symptoms occur. Opioid analgesics {{may be necessary}} to relieve pain. Antivenom has been historically given for adults suffering severe local pain or systemic symptoms consistent with latrodectism, which include pain and swelling spreading proximally from site, distressing local or systemic pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, or excessive sweating (diaphoresis). A significant proportion of bites will not result in envenomation or any symptoms developing; around 2–20% of bite <b>victims</b> <b>have</b> been treated with antivenom. In an Australian study of 750 emergency hospital admissions for spider bites where the spider was definitively identified, 56 were from redbacks. Of these, 37 had significant pain lasting over 24 hours. Only six were treated with the antivenom.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female <b>victims</b> <b>have</b> been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The FBI has speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon. The head of the initiative, Michael Harrigan, says most of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them particularly vulnerable. In 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other <b>victims</b> <b>have</b> been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E

2500|$|Once back at Gacy's house, {{the victims}} would be handcuffed or {{otherwise}} bound, then sexually assaulted and tortured. To muffle his victims' screams, Gacy would often stick cloth rags or {{items of the}} victim's own clothing in their mouths. Some <b>victims</b> <b>had</b> been partly drowned in his bathtub before they had been revived, enabling Gacy to continue his prolonged assault. Many of his <b>victims</b> <b>had</b> been strangled with a tourniquet, which Gacy referred to as his [...] "rope trick"; occasionally, the <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> convulsed for an [...] "hour or two" [...] after the rope trick before dying. With only two exceptions, all his <b>victims</b> <b>had</b> died between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. When asked where he drew {{the inspiration for the}} two-by-four found at his house in which he had manacled many of his victims, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the Houston Mass Murders.|$|R

25|$|The {{fall of the}} Berlin wall in 1989, and {{the reunification}} of Germany, saw a sharp rise in violent attacks against the Turks. A series of arson attacks, bombings, and shootings have {{targeted}} the Turks in {{both public and private}} spaces, such as in their homes, cultural centres, and businesses. Consequently, many <b>victims</b> <b>have</b> been killed or severely injured by these attacks.|$|E
25|$|Police {{brutality}} entails serious {{violations of}} the human rights to life and physical security.

25|$|Although his {{disposal}} method had been {{similar to that}} of William Bonin, Kraft drugged his victims before he killed them and used differing torture methods upon their bodies, including burning the victims' chest and genitals with an automobile cigarette lighter.
