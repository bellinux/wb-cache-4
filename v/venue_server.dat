This manual describes the <b>Venue</b> <b>Server</b> component of the Access Grid Toolkit, version 2. 3.

40|$|This Master degree thesis {{deals with}} content quality {{regulation}} and motivation {{to participate in}} the Scuk. cz project - web server dedicated to reviews of restaurants and other culinary <b>venues.</b> The <b>server</b> represents a specific case of user-generated content (UGC) whose content comes from closed community of reviewers chosen among non-professional food lovers by the server's founder. Aim of this thesis is to describe this filtration and regulation process as well as the qualitative criteria applied to reviewers and reviews, both {{from the point of view}} of administrators and community members. It uses the theory of reputation systems as well as Carpentier's more dynamic concept of quality as the ever-changing result of democratic negotiations (in the context of community media, as Scuk. cz can be to a certain extent). Motivations for participation are explained with Bourdieu's concepts of social and cultural capital and their later derivations. Empirical part of the study is based on qualitative interviews with administrators and 11 community members and following thematical analysis. Interview data are completed with analysis of texts - Scuk guidelines, reviews and other community communication. We found out that the first access filter plays a key role in content regulation, creating like- minded [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Root zone {{growth to}} date (measured by numbers {{and rates of}} delegations) has been modest, driven by small {{increases}} {{in the number of}} delegated gTLDs and ccTLDs. Applications processed under the new gTLD programme is expected to result in a significantly higher growth rate. The GAC has repeatedly expressed concern that this growth be managed so as to safeguard the security and stability of the root server system. The GAC is aware 1 of concern expressed in various <b>venues</b> by root <b>server</b> operators about the implications of unbounded growth of the root zone on the security and stability of the root server system. ICANN is aware that other parties have also expressed this concern. In order to address these concerns, ICANN has committed 2 {{to limit the number of}} TLDs that will be delegated to 1000 per year (and expects that number to be in the range of 215 -‚Äê 240 delegations annually). SSAC published a report 3 on root scaling in August 2009. The study indicated that controlled delegation rates, rather than total number of delegations, were a key aspect in maintaining root zone stability...|$|R
