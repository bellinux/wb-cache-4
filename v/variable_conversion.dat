40|$|Portable {{applications}} {{often need}} step-up power converters in generating {{from a low}} battery voltage to higher voltages for functional blocks such as E 2 PROM and LCD drivers. Switched capacitor DC-DC power converters, often known as charge pumps, are attractive candidates as {{they do not need}} bulky inductors and cause less EMI problems. High efficiency is needed to extend the battery cycle, and compactness is crucial for portable applications. Very often, the conversion ratio (or voltage gain) should be adjusted according to the slowly discharging battery voltage to maintain a high efficiency. For driving noise sensitive circuits, regulated outputs are needed. In this research, a systematic study of switched-capacitor DC-DC power converters is presented. First, gate control strategies in turning on and off all charge transfer MOS transistors completely for a higher efficiency are investigated. Second, the number and configurations of charge pumps with a 2 -phase clock are addressed. The straightforward criterion is to consider those configurations with the negative terminals of the flying capacitors connected to ground during the charging phase, and a topological tree, the ANTZ (All Negative Terminal connected to Zero) tree, is constructed. All prior published charge pumps are elements of this tree, and the rest are new configurations previously unknown. An integrated charge pump is designed as an example, with a variable gain of 6 x and 7 x in a standard 0. 35 μm CMOS process using only 4 flying capacitors. The ANTZ tree excludes many non-ANTZ topologies that could be useful in realizing charge pumps with <b>variable</b> <b>conversion</b> ratios, and a more relaxed criterion is to consider all efficient configurations, and the CCA (Capacitor Charging Arrangement) tree, is constructed. An integrated charge pump with <b>variable</b> <b>conversion</b> ratios of 4 x/ 5 x/ 6 x/ 7 x/ 8 x for LCD driver applications is designed and tested. Third, to further reduce the number of flying capacitors as well as related package pins, charge pumps operating with multiphase are proposed. A 3 / 4 -phase charge pump with <b>variable</b> <b>conversion</b> ratios of 4 x/ 5 x/ 6 x/ 7 x is demonstrated for LCD driver applications. It requires only 3 off-chip flying capacitors and 5 package pins, which is the most component-efficient design among published literatures. Fourth, to minimize the effects on voltage gain and efficiency due to the parasitic capacitors of on-chip flying capacitors, a 3 -phase charge recycling scheme (CRS) is proposed. Charge redistribution loss of parasitic capacitors is reduced, which help to enhance efficiency with bottom-plate CRS, or both efficiency and voltage gain with top-plate CRS. An interleaving multi-branch topology is also suggested to increase the effective switching frequency and thus greatly suppress output voltage ripples. Fifth, to suppress switching noise and reversion leakage in dual-branch voltage doublers delivering hundreds of mA, phase delay control is proposed. Power switches are individually controlled by their lossless phase signals, and are turned on and off in proper sequence to eliminate both short-circuit and reverse leakage during phase transitions. Power transistors are partitioned into smaller groups with scheduled delay to further reduce switching noise in light load conditions. A 4 -phase driving scheme is proposed that allow interleaving the dual-branch charge pump to work with continuous input and output charging currents, further reducing switching noise. Sixth, the interleaving driving scheme is employed to a regulated voltage doubler with area-efficient continuous output regulation (COR). Dual-loop feedback capacitor multiplier is adopted for loop compensation and a super buffer with excellent current sinking capability is inserted into the loop to drive the switching capacitive load and push the pole locating at the gate of the output power transistor to high frequency for better stability. To conclude, this research addresses the important issues of topology generation, control methodology and circuit implementation of switched-capacitor DC-DC power converters...|$|E

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by American Meteorological Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] current, temperature, and conductivity measurements are used to study the temporal variability of M- 2 internal tide generation above the Kaena Ridge, between the Hawaiian islands of Oahu and Kauai. The energy conversion from the barotropic to baroclinic tide measured near the ridge crest varies by a factor of 2 over the 6 -month mooring deployment (0. 5 - 1. 1 W m(- 2)). The energy flux measured just off the ridge undergoes a similar modulation as the ridge conversion. The energy conversion varies largely because of changes in the phase of the perturbation pressure, suggesting variable work done on remotely generated internal tides. During the mooring deployment, low-frequency current and stratification fluctuations occur on and off the ridge. Model simulations suggest that these variations are due to two mesoscale eddies that passed through the region. The impact of these eddies on low-mode internal tide propagation over the ridge crest is considered. It appears that eddy-related changes in stratification and perhaps cross-ridge current speed contribute to the observed phase variations in perturbation pressure and hence the <b>variable</b> <b>conversion</b> over the ridge...|$|E

Recent theoretical works suggest that these constraints can have a significant impact and should not be neglected. However, it is not yet resolved how stoichiometry should be integrated in population dynamical models, as different modeling approaches are found to yield qualitatively different results. Here we investigate a unifying framework that reveals the differences and commonalities between previously proposed models for producergrazer systems. Our analysis reveals that stoichiometric constraints affect the dynamics mainly by increasing the intraspecific competition between producers and by introducing a variable biomass conversion efficiency. The intraspecific competition has a strongly stabilizing effect on the system, whereas the <b>variable</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency resulting from a variable food quality is the main determinant for the nature of the instability once destabilization occurs. Only if the food quality is high can an oscillatory instability, as in the classical paradox of enrichment, occur. While the generalized model reveals that the generic insights remain valid in a large class of models, we show that other details such as the specific sequence of bifurcations encountered in enrichment scenarios can depend sensitively on assumptions made in modeling stoichiometric constraints. © 2010 by The University of Chicago...|$|E

To investigate the possibility of prodrug conversion to etoposide within the gastrointestinal lumen, etoposide phosphate was dissolved in water and incubated with human gastric juice or human bile in vitro. Samples were collected during 150 min and analysed for etoposide concentration with high-performance liquid chromatography. Conversion of prodrug to etoposide during incubation with gastric juice was negligible. There was significant conversion during incubation with bile at pH 7 - 8. The percentage of prodrug converted to etoposide at pH 8 after 60 min was 78 +/- 18 % (mean +/- S. D.) for a 0. 1 mg ml- 1 prodrug solution and 36 +/- 26 % for 0. 5 mg ml- 1. At pH 7, after 60 min 22 % of prodrug was converted to etoposide when incubated at 0. 1 mg ml- 1 and 10 % at 0. 5 mg ml- 1.

EPA has promulgated a 1 -h average National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for NO 2, and major sources of NOX emissions must estimate their NO 2 air quality impacts as part of EPA's air quality permitting programs. The AERMOD dispersion model has been developed by EPA for these air quality impact analyses, and AERMOD contains three different NO to NO 2 conversion methods for estimating the ambient concentrations of NO 2. This paper describes a refinement to one of the methods, the Ambient Ratio Method version 2 (ARM 2).

The urinary formiminoglutamic acid has also {{been reported to be}} increased in macrocytic anemia of pregnancy and in patients treated with folic acid antagonists (8 - 10). These findings can be attributed to a lack of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF), since enzymatic studies have shown (11 - 14) that THF is required for the further metabolism of formiminoglutamic acid. The accumulation of formiminoglutamic acid in the urine {{can be used as a}} test for folic acid deficiency both in rats and in patients. The available assay for formiminoglutamic acid, based on the microbiological assay of the glutamic acid formed from formiminoglutamic acid by heating (4, 9), is relatively inconvenient and inaccurate.

40|$|Picophytoplankton are {{acknowledged}} to {{contribute significantly to}} primary production (PP) in the ocean while now the method to measure PP of picophytoplankton (PPPico) at large scales is not yet well established. Although the traditional 14 C method and new technologies based {{on the use of}} stable isotopes (e. g., 13 C) can be employed to accurately measure in situ PPPico, the time-consuming and labor-intensive shortage of these methods constrain their application in a survey on large spatiotemporal scales. To overcome this shortage, a modified carbon-based ocean productivity model (CbPM) is proposed for estimating the PPPico whose principle is based on the group-specific abundance, cellular carbon conversion factor (CCF), and temperature-derived growth rate of picophytoplankton. Comparative analysis showed that the estimated PPPico using CbPM method is significantly and positively related (r 2 = 0. 53, P < 0. 001, n = 171) to the measured 14 C uptake. This significant relationship suggests that CbPM has the potential to estimate the PPPico over large spatial and temporal scales. Currently this model application may be limited by the use of invariant cellular CCF and the relatively small data sets to validate the model which may introduce some uncertainties and biases.

40|$|Due to the {{relative}} lack of empirical field data, the response of very small glaciers (here defined as being smaller than 0. 5  km 2) to current atmospheric warming is not fully understood yet. Investigating their mass balance, e. g. using the direct glaciological method, is a prerequisite to fill this knowledge gap. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) techniques operating in the near infrared range can be applied {{for the creation of}} repeated high-resolution digital elevation models and consecutive derivation of annual geodetic mass balances of very small glaciers. This method is promising, as laborious and potentially dangerous field measurements as well as the inter- and extrapolation of point measurements can be circumvented. However, it still needs to be validated. Here, we present TLS-derived annual surface elevation and geodetic mass changes for five very small glaciers in Switzerland (Glacier de Prapio, Glacier du Sex Rouge, St. Annafirn, Schwarzbachfirn, and Pizolgletscher) and two consecutive years (2013 / 14 – 2014 / 15).

Geodetic mass balances were slightly less negative but in close agreement with the direct glaciological ones (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 91).

40|$|Black carbon (BC) absorbs shortwave {{radiation}} {{more strongly}} than {{any other type of}} aerosol, and an accurate simulation of the aging processes of BC-containing particle is required to properly predict aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) and climate change. However, BC aging processes have been simplified in general circulation models (GCMs) due to limited computational resources. In particular, differences in the representation of the mixing states of BC-containing particles between GCMs constitute one of main reasons for the uncertainty in ARF estimates. To understand an impact of the BC aging processes and the mixing state of BC on the spatial distribution of BC and ARF caused by BC (BC-ARF), we implemented three different methods of incorporating BC aging processes into a global aerosol transport model, SPRINTARS: (1) the "AGV" method, using <b>variable</b> <b>conversion</b> rates of BC aging based on a new type of parameterization depending on both BC amount and sulfuric acid; (2) the "AGF" method, using a constant conversion rate used worldwide in GCMs; and (3) the "ORIG" method, which is used in the original SPRINTARS. First, we found that these different methods produced different BC burden within 10 % over industrial areas and 50 % over remote oceans. Second, a ratio of water-insoluble BC to total BC (WIBC ratio) was very different among the three methods. Near the BC source region, for example, the WIBC ratios were estimated to be 80 – 90 % (AGV and AGF) and 50 – 60 % (ORIG). Third, although the BC aging process in GCMs had small impacts on the BC burden, they had a large impact on BC-ARF through a change in both the WIBC ratio and non-BC compounds coating on BC cores. As a result, possible differences in the treatment of the BC aging process between aerosol modeling studies can produce a difference of approximately 0. 3 Wm − 2 in the magnitude of BC-ARF, which is comparable to the uncertainty suggested by results from a global aerosol modeling intercomparison project, AeroCom. The surface aerosol forcing efficiencies normalized by aerosol optical thickness and by BC burden varied greatly with region in the AGV method, which allowed for the existence of internally mixed BC and sulfate, whereas these were not varied with region in the AGF method. These results suggest that the efficiencies of BC-ARF obtained by previous studies using the AGF method are significantly underestimated...|$|E

The appearance and he evaluation of antibiotic resistances toward pathogen bacterias have caused the prohibition of the use of antibiotics in the feeding and it has stimulated the search of alternatives that they possess antibacterial activity. The essential extracts and their compounds think about like an alternative to improve the efficiency of use of allowances and to reduce the losses of nutritious, likewise to improve the productive parameters of swine in the phase of weanling pigs. The essential oil was obtained by steam water destilation dried leaves of Oregano (Oreganum vulgare); the chemical composition was evaluated by means of UV, to IR and couple HPLC to masses. Thirty three swine was used, crusaders to determine the goods of the use of the essential oil and oregano extract like supplement in the growth and the production of ammoniacal nitrogen in the pigs weaned. The treatments were: Diet with the help of concentrated commercial of each phase (Control), control + 0, 6 cm. of commercial antibiotic (T 1), and control + 0. 6 cm of essential oil of Oregano (T 2). The results show that the oregano oil produce better effects on weight gain and ending weight, compared with the control treatment, however, the effect is slight compared to the antibiotic treatment...|$|E
40|$|A batteryless power {{management}} unit (PMU) that manages harvested low-level vibration energy from a piezoelectric device for a wireless sensor node is presented. An energy-adaptive maximum power point tracidng (EA-MPPT) scheme is proposed that allows the PMU to activate different operation modes according to the available power level. The harvested energy is processed by an ac-dc voltage doubler followed by on-chip charge pumps with <b>variable</b> up/down <b>conversion</b> ratios for higher efficiency. Interleaving technique is employed for the high-power output to reduce both current and voltage ripples. The PMU is designed using a 0. 35 mu m CMOS process, and simulation results are presented to demonstrate its functions...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of biological hydrogen production from glucose by Clostridium beijerinckii {{was conducted in}} a synthetic wastewater solution. A study examining the effect of initial pH (range 5. 7 – 6. 5) and substrate loading (range 1 – 3 g COD/L) on the specific conversion and hydrogen production rate has shown interaction behaviour between the two independent <b>variables.</b> Highest <b>conversion</b> of 10. 3 mL H 2 /(g COD/L) was achieved at pH of 6. 1 and glucose concentration of 3 g COD/L, whereas the highest production rate of 71 mL H 2 /(h L) was measured at pH 6. 3 and substrate loading of 2. 5 g COD/L...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A general {{method of}} the BRST–anti-BRST {{symmetric}} conversion of secondclass constraints is presented. It yields {{a pair of}} commuting and nilpotent BRST-type charges that can be naturally regarded as BRST and anti-BRST ones. Interchanging the BRST and anti-BRST generators corresponds to a symmetry between the original secondclass constraints and the <b>conversion</b> <b>variables,</b> which enter the formalism on equal footing. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: To {{identify}} prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects using a data-driven {{approach to}} determine cognitive profiles in {{mild cognitive impairment}} (MCI). Methods: A total of 881 MCI subjects were recruited from 20 memory clinics and followed for up to 5 years. Outcome measures included cognitive <b>variables,</b> <b>conversion</b> to AD, and biomarkers (e. g. CSF, and MRI markers). Two hierarchical cluster analyses (HCA) were performed to identify clusters of subjects with distinct cognitive profiles. The first HCA included all subjects with complete cognitive data, whereas the second one selected subjects with very mild MCI (MMSE >/= 28). ANOVAs and ANCOVAs were computed to examine whether the clusters differed with regard to conversion to AD, and to AD-specific biomarkers. Results: The HCAs identified 4 -cluster solutions that best reflected the sample structure. One cluster (aMCIsingle) had a significantly higher conversion rate (19 %), compared to subjective cognitive impairment (SCI, p < 0. 0001), and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI, p = 0. 012). This cluster {{was the only one}} showing a significantly different biomarker profile (Abeta 42, t-tau, APOE epsilon 4, and medial temporal atrophy), compared to SCI or naMCI. Conclusion: In subjects with mild MCI, the single-domain amnestic MCI profile was associated with the highest risk of conversion, even if memory impairment did not necessarily cross specific cut-off points. A cognitive profile characterized by isolated memory deficits may be sufficient to warrant applying prevention strategies in MCI, whether or not memory performance lies below specific z-scores. This is supported by our preliminary biomarker analyses. However, further analyses with bigger samples are needed to corroborate these findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of cardiovascular responses to chemical {{stimulation of the}} hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARCN) was studied in urethane-anesthetized adult male Wistar rats. At the baseline mean arterial pressure (BLMAP) close to normal, ARCN stimulation elicited decreases in MAP and sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). The decreases in MAP elicited by ARCN stimulation were attenuated by either gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), neuropeptide Y (NPY), or beta-endorphin receptor blockade in the ipsilateral hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Combined blockade of GABA-A, NPY 1 and opioid receptors in the ipsilateral PVN converted the decreases in MAP and SNA to increases in these <b>variables.</b> <b>Conversion</b> of inhibitory effects on the MAP and SNA to excitatory effects following ARCN stimulation was also observed when the BLMAP was decreased to below normal levels by an infusion of sodium nitroprusside. The pressor and tachycardic responses to ARCN stimulation at below normal BLMAP were attenuated by blockade of melanocortin 3 / 4 (MC 3 / 4) receptors in the ipsilateral PVN. Unilateral blockade of GABA-A receptors in the ARCN increased the BLMAP and heart rate (HR) revealing tonic inhibition of the excitatory neurons in the ARCN. ARCN stimulation elicited tachycardia regardless {{of the level of}} BLMAP. ARCN neurons projecting to the PVN were immunoreactive for glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD 67), NPY, and beta-endorphin. These results indicated that: 1) at normal BLMAP, decreases in MAP and SNA induced by ARCN stimulation were mediated via GABA-A, NPY 1 and opioid receptors in the PVN, 2) lowering of BLMAP converted decreases in MA...|$|R
