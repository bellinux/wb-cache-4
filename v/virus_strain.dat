5|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is caused}} by a new type of coronavirus. Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel <b>virus</b> <b>strain</b> caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear. The fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, <b>virus</b> <b>strain</b> is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish flu pandemic, and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the <b>virus</b> <b>strain</b> originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.|$|E

40|$|Endogenous ecotropic {{murine leukemia}} viruses (MuLV) found in low <b>virus</b> <b>strains</b> of mice {{differ from those}} found in high <b>virus</b> <b>strains</b> in both their genetic {{location}} and stability. Many investigators (1 - 7) have demonstrated that high <b>virus</b> <b>strains</b> contain multiple ecotropic proviruses, {{some of which are}} not allelic among substrains. However, low <b>virus</b> <b>strains</b> of similar genetic origin appear to contain a single ecotropic provirus that is allelic among divergent substrains (8, 9, Jenkins et al., personal communication). Recently (10), we demonstrated that low <b>virus</b> <b>strains</b> of mice also contain genes that enhance the induction or expression of ecotropic MuLV in certain F 1 hybrid mice. This increase in MuLV induction, as compared to the response of either parental strain, occurs both in iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) -treated tissue cultures and spontaneously in spleen cells (J. McCubrey and R. Risser, manuscript submitted for publication). We determined that BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) strains each contain one genetic element that, in combination, enhance virus induction, and we denoted the BALB/c locus as lnc- 1 and the B 6 locus as lnb- 1.

The glycoprotein GP 4 of the European prototype PRRSV <b>strain</b> Lelystad <b>virus</b> (LV) contains a linear neutralizing epitope that is located in a highly variable region. The current study aimed to evaluate the antibody response against this and other epitopes on GP 4 to infection of pigs with European-type PRRSV. It was shown that three <b>virus</b> <b>strains,</b> differing in the region that corresponds to the neutralizing epitope on GP 4 of LV, strongly induce antibodies against this area.

As a consequence, the World Health Organization (WHO) operates a world-wide laboratory network to monitor these changes. RIVM participates in this system.

It also compares Dutch <b>virus</b> <b>strains</b> with foreign <b>virus</b> <b>strains</b> and with the <b>virus</b> <b>strains</b> used in the current influenza vaccine. The results are reported to the WHO and to the Ministry of Health of the Netherlands. The results of such comparisons enable the Dutch health authorities to consider adaptations of the WHO-proposal about the vaccine for the next season to the epidemiological situation in the Netherlands. A total of 256 influenza A <b>virus</b> <b>strains</b> isolated in 1990 - 1992 in the Netherlands and other countries were analysed by haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests using ferret antisera and monoclonal antibodies and, partly, by determination of the nucleotide sequences of the haemagglutinin gene (HA 1).
