25|$|In Yates County, NY54 {{enters the}} town of Barrington, where Keuka <b>Village</b> <b>Road</b> soon merges in. NY54 {{continues}} north as East Lake Road, paralleling the lakeside as a two-lane residential street before forking northward as a two-lane rural roadway. A second East Lake Road serves as the local residential highway for a short distance, until the hamlet of Crosby. In Crosby, NY54 becomes a two-lane residential street until the intersection with Gray Road. There, East Lake Road continues a new parallel once again. A short distance later, NY54 crosses the town line from Barrington into Milo. At the town line, the western East Lake Road changes name to Lower East Lake Road, continuing its lakeside parallel of NY54. Entering the hamlet of Willow Grove, this merges into NY54 once again, which soon intersects with the western terminus of CR30 (Second Milo Road).|$|E
25|$|NY54 {{continues}} east through Urbana, {{crossing the}} southern end of Keuka Lake, one of New York's Finger Lakes. At this point, NY54 becomes a lakeside highway, intersecting with CR87 (HammondsportWayne Road). NY54 begins a bend to the north along Keuka Lake, as a two-lane rural highway overlooking the lake. To the west, Lake Road parallels NY54 on the lakeshore and is a residential street. This pattern continues to the northeast for several miles, leaving Urbana for the town of Wayne, where the two roads both become residential, and enter the hamlet of Grove Springs. In Grove Springs, Lake Road merges into NY54, which becomes the lakeside roadway along Keuka Lake, merging at-grade with CR94 (Grove Springs Road). NY54 bends eastward, intersecting with CR95 (Day Road) and soon an interchange with NY230, which forms a large junction to the southbound roadway. NY54 continues east of NY230, paralleling Keuka <b>Village</b> <b>Road</b> north along the lakeside, crossing the county line from Steuben County into Yates County.|$|E

Multiple coloured and textured cobbles separate traffic from pedestrians areas, however it functions as a shared space, allowing pedestrians to cross anywhere that feels safe. According to the town, businesses have seen increased foot traffic, and congestion has been considerably lessened.
