5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E
25|$|Reeves and Nass {{established}} two rules {{before the}} test- when a computer asks a user about itself, the user will give more positive responses than when a different computer asks the same questions. They expected {{people to be}} less variable with their responses when they took a test and then answered a questionnaire on the same computer. They wanted to see that computers, although not human, can implement social responses. The independent <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> the computer (there are 2 in the test), and the dependent <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> the evaluation responses. The control was a pen-and-paper questionnaire.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} {{source of}} heterogeneity among study results is {{the variation in}} techniques used to assess vitamin concentrations in milk. HPLC {{was selected as the}} ‘‘gold standard’’ method for determination of fat-soluble vitamins by AOAC International. No gold standard has been identified for water-soluble vitamins; fluorescence spectroscopy, chromatography, and microbiological methods are all referenced in the AOAC official methods. Metaregression for vitamin B1 and folate studies revealed a significant association between study and method used to quantify vitamins; however, this <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> not significant for other vitamins. Analytic methods must take into consideration separation of vitamers for each vitamin, the methodology used for calibration of external standards, retention of vitamer conformation, and successful recovery. The solvents, standards, execution of extraction procedures, and equipment used to carry out these analyses may differ among investigators and can introduce variation among studies. Hollman et al. investigated 18 laboratories that were asked to analyze water-soluble vitamin contents in selected foods. These authors reported that in contrast to the fat-soluble vitamins a wider range of methods was used for water-soluble vitamins and that results from different methods did not always agree for vitamins B2 and C.|$|E
500|$|The psychologists Paul H. Van Wyk and Chrisann S. Geist {{wrote that}} Bell et al. {{question}} a scientific consensus, established by researchers {{such as the}} psychologists Heino Meyer-Bahlburg and John Money, that biological factors have at most only a predisposing influence {{on the development of}} sexual orientation. Using their subject pool, which consisted of people interviewed between 1938 and 1963, Van Wyk and Geist produced results similar to those of Bell et al. However, there were some significant differences, which Van Wyk and Geist suggested could have been partly a result of the different methodology employed. In their view, the most important difference was that their outcome <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> based only on [...] "overt behavior" [...] whereas that of Bell et al. [...] "is an average of subjective preference and overt behavior." [...] They noted that Bell et al. [...] "excluded from their model variables that did not apply to everyone in their sample", which made it impossible to judge the effects of [...] "idiosyncratic and unique sexual and nonsexual experiences".|$|E

2500|$|That {{important}} state <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> first {{recognized and}} denoted [...] by Clausius in 1850, {{but he did}} not then name it, and he defined it in terms not only of work but also of heat transfer in the same process. It was also independently recognized in 1850 by Rankine, who also denoted it [...] and in 1851 by Kelvin who then called it [...] "mechanical energy", and later [...] "intrinsic energy". In 1865, after some hestitation, Clausius began calling his state function [...] "energy". In 1882 it was named as the internal energy by Helmholtz. If only adiabatic processes were of interest, and heat could be ignored, the concept of internal energy would hardly arise or be needed. The relevant physics would be largely covered by the concept of potential energy, as was intended in the 1847 paper of Helmholtz on the principle of conservation of energy, though that did not deal with forces that cannot be described by a potential, and thus did not fully justify the principle. Moreover, that paper was critical of the early work of Joule that had by then been performed. A great merit of the internal energy concept is that it frees thermodynamics from a restriction to cyclic processes, and allows a treatment in terms of thermodynamic states.|$|E
