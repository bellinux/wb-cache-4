40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{unemployment}} rate <b>varies</b> much <b>more</b> in some regions of Canada than in others. Denton has documented this for the period 1947 - 1964 (4), and updating his data does not change the conclusions. In principle, the unemployment rate could fluctuate more in one region than another either because employment <b>varied</b> <b>more</b> around its trend or because the labour force <b>varied</b> <b>more</b> round its trend. In this paper, we focus on the proximate reasons for employment fluctuating more about its trend in some regions than in others. ...|$|R

40|$|Two bar-press {{experiments}} with rats tested {{the rule that}} reducing expectation of reward increases the variation from which reward selects. Experiment 1 used a discrete-trial random-interval schedule, with trials signaled by light or sound. One signal always ended with reward; the other signal ended with reward less often. The 2 signals were randomly mixed. Bar-press duration (how long the bar was held down) <b>varied</b> <b>more</b> during the signal with the lower probability of reward. Experiment 2 closely resembled Experiment 1 but used a random-ratio schedule rather than a random-interval schedule. Again, bar-press duration <b>varied</b> <b>more</b> during the signal with the lower probability of reward. The results support the rule-the first well-controlled comparisons to do so...|$|R
