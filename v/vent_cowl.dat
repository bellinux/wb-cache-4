50|$|With {{the exhaust}} venting {{through the top}} rear of the vehicle engine deck similar to Cromwell. These could be fitted with cowls to {{redirect}} exhaust fumes away from the air inlet <b>vents.</b> <b>Cowls</b> were usually split into two independent covers, {{as opposed to the}} single cover fitted to Cromwell.|$|R
5000|$|B1807 - Pup under {{restoration}} to airworthy condition. Built by Standard Motors in 1917 {{and delivered}} to a Home Defence squadron. This aircraft was originally {{fitted with a}} 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome Monosoupape engine, along with the distinctive three-quarter <b>vented</b> <b>cowling.</b> It was refitted by the 80 hp (60 kW) Le Rhône engine sometime in 1918. B1807 was sold at Croydon in 1920 and entered the civil register as G-EAVX. It appeared on 16 July at the 1921 Aerial Derby at Hendon, where it was groundlooped by its pilot. The wings were removed and the fuselage disappeared until 1973, when the current owner discovered {{the remains of the}} aircraft in a barn in Dorset.|$|R
50|$|For Master of Philosophy (MPhil), {{graduates}} wear a black gown, {{and a black}} hood {{attached to}} the gown on each shoulder with a King's lion button; the sleeve <b>vents,</b> cape and <b>cowl</b> are bound in blue with the binding extending over the shoulders.|$|R
5000|$|... 1950 - Telescopic shock {{absorbers}} replace lever-action type. Last year for driver's side <b>cowl</b> <b>vent,</b> its handle is now flat steel, not maroon knob as in previous years. New serial number codes: HP ½ ton, HR ¾ ton, & HS 1 ton.|$|R
50|$|The first Pups {{delivered}} to Home Defence units utilised the 80 hp Le Rhône, but subsequent Home Defence Pups standardised {{on the more}} powerful 100 hp Gnome Monosoupape, which provided improved rate of climb. These aircraft were distinguishable {{by the addition of}} <b>vents</b> in the <b>cowling</b> face.|$|R
50|$|Specialist doctors (EdD/DClinPsy/DHC/DrPS/DthMin) {{graduates}} wear a blue gown, {{and a blue}} hood {{attached to}} the gown on each shoulder with a King's lion button. The sleeve <b>vents,</b> cape and <b>cowl</b> are bound in dark red with the binding extending over the shoulders; a King's Full f12 shape gown of deep blue cloth, with stole of red silk. The hood is fully lined with red silk.|$|R
50|$|Only 602 Z/28s {{were sold}} in 1967, along with {{approximately}} 100 Indianapolis Pace Car replicas. The 1967 and 1968 Z/28s {{did not have the}} cowl induction hood, optional on the 1969 Z/28s. The 1967 Z28 received air from an open element air cleaner or from an optional cowl plenum duct attached {{to the side of the}} air cleaner that ran to the firewall and got air from the <b>cowl</b> <b>vents.</b> 15-inch rally wheels were included with Z/28s while all other 1967-9 Camaros had 14-inch wheels.|$|R
50|$|For {{research}} degree PhD/MD(Res) graduates wear a dark red gown, {{and a dark}} red hood attached to the gown on each shoulder with a King's lion button; the sleeve <b>vents,</b> cape and <b>cowl</b> are bound in blue with the binding extending over the shoulders. Using the Groves classification system, such research graduates wear a King's Full f12 shape gown of deep red cloth, with stole of purple silk. The sleeves are held back by purple linings and gold buttons. The hood is lined with fully lined with purple silk.|$|R
5000|$|The 1936 Series 70 and 75 {{both had}} {{v-shaped}} windshield styles by Fleetwood. A narrower radiator shell {{was supported by}} the new louver style [...] "Convex vee" [...] grill. Headlights were mounted on the radiator shell. Parking lights were inside the headlights. Front fenders were new with a crease along the center line. The <b>cowl</b> <b>vent</b> was changed back to opening forward. There were built-in trunks on [...] "touring" [...] styles, town cars and 4-door convertibles. Coupes and 2-door convertibles had rumble seats plus a separate door for the spare tire at the extreme rear of the deck. All bodies now utilized the Fisher Turret Top.|$|R
5000|$|The Italia {{featured}} a radio (not yet standard equipment even on Cadillacs), form-fitting bucket seats made from foam rubber three different densities for maximum comfort covered {{in red and}} white leather, featuring reclining backrests made up of two contoured bolsters, one for the shoulders {{and one for the}} lower back. The seats were firmer at the lower back than the upper and between the two cushions was air space so [...] "the seats actually 'breathed' through the motion of the passengers." [...] A non-reflecting dash was finished in red, with bright red deep-pile Italian carpet, all contrasting with the [...] "Italian Cream" [...] exterior color. Even red leather seat belts were incorporated as they were just beginning to appear as standard equipment that was pioneered by Nash but attached only to the seats themselves. Flow-through ventilation, usually credited as a General Motors innovation, feeding through a <b>cowl</b> <b>vent</b> (just becoming usual in 1950s U.S. cars), was also standard.|$|R
40|$|The {{exhaust system}} plays {{a vital role}} in {{removing}} the gaseous emissions that is being produced within the combustion chamber during fuel-air mixture activities. The exhaust system is defined as a series of chambers and pipes that starts at the engine and ends {{at the back of the}} car with the tail pipe. However if there are any leaks in the exhaust system, it provide a direct path for the emission gaseous including carbon monoxide to enter can be very dangerous as it provides a direct path for carbon monoxide and other dangerous gaseous emissions to enter the <b>cowl</b> <b>vent</b> at the base of the windshield and directly to the passenger compartment. The risk of exposure to these hazardous gaseous is also high especially during vehicle maintenance services in suspected cases of leakages to the exhaust system.   The inspection of the exhaust system is done manually in most of the automotive services workshops. In this paper, accidental risks of performing these inspection jobs on a vehicle’s exhaust system, performed by a technician are discussed. In order to minimize the risks to technicians or mechanics, a prototype device to detect exhaust leakage was developed using a gas sensor module and a web camera. This device was successfully operated in detecting possible leakages of the exhaust system...|$|R
2500|$|... 1976 models {{featured}} steel {{floor panels}} shielding the catalytic converter exhaust. These steel floor panels weighed {{less than the}} previous fiberglass floor and reduced interior noise levels. Horsepower rose to [...] for the base L-48 engine; [...] for the optional L-82. To further reduce cabin noise levels, cowl induction was dropped {{in favor of the}} air cleaner ducted over the radiator, picking up outside air {{from the front of the}} car, thus reducing wind turbulence at the base of the windshield. The hood was carried over, with its <b>cowl</b> <b>vent</b> grille and induction system opening becoming non-functional. The optional cast aluminum wheels were finally made available, which reduced the unsprung weight of the car by 32pounds. Nearly 15% of the cars were ordered with the new wheels at a cost of $299. A standard steel rim spare was used. This was the last year for optional white striped tires, as 86% of the cars were being delivered with the optional white lettered tires. A new rear nameplate for the rear bumper cover was introduced, eliminating the individual [...] "Corvette" [...] letters used since 1968. An unwelcome change was the [...] "Vega GT" [...] 4-spoke steering wheel, although its smaller diameter did provide extra room and eased entry/exit. The steering wheel, color-keyed to the interior, continued on 1977 through 1979 models, limited to non-tilt wheel cars only. GM's [...] "Freedom" [...] battery, a new sealed and maintenance-free unit, was now installed in all cars. The rear window defroster option was changed from the forced-air type of previous years to the new [...] "Electro-Clear" [...] defogger, an in-glass heated element type. Even without a convertible model, the Corvette still set new sales records.|$|R
5000|$|The 1934 Model 355D was {{completely}} restyled and mounted on {{an entirely new}} chassis but used the same engine as in 1933. The Model 355 was divided into three series, the Series 10, 20 and 30. Bodies on the Series 10 and 20 were built by Fisher and on the Series 30 by Fleetwood. The bodies on the Series 30 were shared with the Cadillac V-12 and V-16. Styling emphasized streamlining, including concealment of all chassis features except the wheels. Body construction was improved for better insulation against engine heat and reduction of engine, road and wind noise. Bumpers were a stylish but ineffective biplane design, mounted against telescoping springs. The grille was V-shaped and sloping, set into a painted shell. Although restricted use of chrome was {{a feature of the}} overall ornamentation, a chrome plated radiator shell was available as an option. Horns and radiator filler cap were concealed under the hood. Teardrop Guide Multibeam headlights were mounted on streamlined supports attached to the fenders. Parking lamps were mounted on the headlight supports. Airfoil shaped fenders were brought low over the chassis. The hood sills were high with the entire fender shape molded into the radiator shell. A curious horizontal crease broke the nose contour of the fenders. Hoods extending nearly to the windshield carried shutter-type louvers in the side panel. Windshields were fixed and steeply sloping; 18 degrees on Fisher bodies, 25 degrees flat or a 29.5 degree V on Fleetwood bodies. <b>Cowl</b> <b>vents</b> opened toward the windshield; one vent on flat windshield bodies, two vents projecting through openings in the hood on V-shaped windshield bodies. Bodies were 2.0 in lower than on previous models. Added passenger space in the front compartment was achieved by moving the hand brake lever {{to the left of the}} driver, under the instrument panel. Rear fenders were airfoil shaped and carried rear lights that matched the headlights. The gas tank filler was on the left side at the rear of the body, on Fleetwood bodies in the left rear fender. All bodies featured beaver tail deck that completely covered the chassis. On Fleetwood bodies the spare was concealed under the rear deck, unless optional fender mounts were specified. Independent front suspension was introduced, called [...] "knee-action". Engine horsepower increased to 120.|$|R
