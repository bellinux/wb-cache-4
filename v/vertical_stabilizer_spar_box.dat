50|$|Fox's first prototype, N9WZ, was {{completed}} in 1994 and entered testing. Although it had been modified to incorporate the stronger tail of Bede's design, it broke up mid-air on 30 December 1994 when the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> failed due to a crossflow condition, killing Van Wagenen. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) later concluded that Bede's fix was severely under-designed, and offered nowhere near the strength that had been calculated. Fox had not performed any testing to verify the redesign of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> <b>spars</b> before continuing flight testing, instead relying upon the data provided by Bede.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the use of}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> is most common, it is {{possible}} to obtain directional stability with no discrete <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> {{is mounted}} exactly vertically, and the {{horizontal}} stabilizer is directly mounted to the empennage (the rear fuselage). This {{is the most}} common <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> configuration.|$|R
40|$|Results {{of tests}} on a slender delta wing will be {{presented}} to describe the effect <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> have on vortex breakdown at high angles of attack. The test will consist of flow visualization using Laser Induced fluorescence. The experimental test will vary <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> to compare the effect on the flow. It is anticipated that the presence of <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> will spatially lock the position of vortices thereby reducing the wing-rock. Using the experimental data, the geometry of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> will Be altered to provide for a well behaved flow. Tests were conducted on a modified delta wing to analyze vertical tail influence on delta wing roll oscillation...|$|R
500|$|A new <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> was {{introduced}} in 2004 beginning with MSN 555. This newer fin is shorter in height by [...] and {{was derived from the}} design of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> of the A340-500 and -600, later becoming standard on all new A330-200s.|$|R
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the YA-19 design was its horizontal stabiliser located forward of the vertical tail. The small size of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> caused some directional instability (about the yaw axis) so the last YA-19 (S/N 38-555) was equipped with enlarged <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the structural repairs in the radio compartment and tail gunner position, numerous repairs {{have been made to}} the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and related fairings. The <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> is ready for remounting. Radio mounting brackets and landing light housings have been refabricated from scratch.|$|R

50|$|A {{variation}} on the twin tail, it has three <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> An example of this configuration is the Lockheed Constellation. On the Constellation it was done to give the airplane maximum <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> area while keeping the overall height low enough {{so that it could}} fit into maintenance hangars.|$|R
50|$|The PZL.37 was {{designed}} in the mid-1930s at the PZL factory in Warsaw by Jerzy Dąbrowski.The first PZL.37/I prototype, fitted with a single <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> flew on 13 December 1936. The second prototype PZL.37/II, with twin <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and other improvements, was accepted for production. The first 10 serial aircraft were produced in 1938 as the PZL.37A variant with a single <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> however. The next 19 interim aircraft were built as PZL.37A bis, with a twin tail. They all were powered by Bristol Pegasus XII B radial engines produced in Poland under licence.|$|R
25|$|According to the {{official}} accident report, after the first officer made his initial rudder pedal input, he {{made a series of}} alternating full rudder inputs. This led to increasing sideslip angles. The resulting hazardous sideslip angle led to extremely high aerodynamic loads that resulted in separation of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> If the first officer had stopped making these inputs at any time before the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> separation, the natural stability of the airplane would have returned the sideslip angle to near 0°, and the accident would have been avoided. The airplane performance study indicated that when the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> separation began, the aerodynamic loads were about two times the loads defined by the design envelope. It can be determined that the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer's</b> structural performance was consistent with design specifications and exceeded certification requirements.|$|R

25|$|The {{crash was}} caused by turbulence-induced {{structural}} failure. Due to buffeting stresses, the stabilizer shaft broke and the B-52's <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> came off the plane.

5000|$|To reduce low-frequency {{reflections}} {{from the}} fuselage and <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> wires were strung horizontally from {{the nose of}} the aircraft to the tail, and horizontally from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> Ferrite beads were placed on the wires to tune them to the expected frequencies.
