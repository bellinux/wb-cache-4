50|$|Vibrating viscometers are rugged {{industrial}} systems used {{to measure}} viscosity in the process condition. The active part of the sensor is a <b>vibrating</b> <b>rod.</b> The vibration amplitude varies according to the viscosity of the fluid in which the rod is immersed.

Currently, many industries around the world consider these viscometers {{to be the most}} efficient system with which to measure the viscosities {{of a wide range of}} fluids; by contrast, rotational viscometers require more maintenance, are unable to measure clogging fluid, and require frequent calibration after intensive use. Vibrating viscometers have no moving parts, no weak parts and the sensitive part is very small. Even very basic or acidic fluids can be measured by adding a protective coating such as enamel, or by changing the material of the sensor to a material such as 316L stainless steel.|$|R

The analysis uses the results obtained in [1] and [2], and it is essentially based on a double application of a Darboux Lemma [3] after reducing the equation to normal form by the Liouville transformation. The new rods and their normal modes can be constructed explicitly by means of closed-form expressions. We also show how to use the above results to construct a rod under given end conditions with prescribed values of a finite set of eigenvalues. The reconstruction procedure needs the specification of an initial rod whose eigenvalues must be close to the assigned eigenvalues.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{identification}} of a small mass point in a <b>vibrating</b> <b>rod</b> based on {{the knowledge of the}} variations induced in a pair of natural axial frequencies.

The inverse problem is generally ill-posed, that is, even if the system is not symmetrical, mass points in different locations can still produce identical changes in a pair of natural frequencies. Despite this ill-posedeness, it is found that there are certain situations concerning uniform rods in which the effects of the non-uniqueness of the solution may be considerably reduced by means of a careful choice of the data. Some of the results are also valid for beams in bending and the identification technique can be extended to include the case of two equal point masses.

40|$|A design {{methodology}} for the vibration confinement of axial vibrations in nonhomogenous rods is proposed. This {{is achieved by}} a proper selection {{of a set of}} spatially dependent functions characterizing the rod material and geometric properties. Conditions for selecting such properties are established by constructing positive Lyapunov functions whose derivative with respect to the space variable is negative. It is shown that varying the shape of the rod alone is sufficient to confine the vibratory motion. In such a case, the vibration confinement requires that the eigenfunctions be exponentially decaying functions of space, where the notion of spatial domain stability is introduced as a concept dual to that of the time domain stability. It is also shown that vibration confinement can be produced if the rod density and/or stiffness are varied with respect to the space variable while the cross-section area is kept constant. Several case studies, supporting the developed conditions imposed on the spatially dependent functions for vibration confinement in <b>vibrating</b> <b>rods,</b> are discussed. Because variation in the geometric and material properties might decrease the critical buckling loads, we also discuss the buckling problem...|$|R

However, pattern-formation phenomena appearing in an oscillatory system with numerous degrees-of-freedom {{such as those of}} a system including up to 1000 oscillators have never been explored. Therefore, through experimentation, we investigate this well known and persistent fluid-engineering problem. As a model experiment, we chose complex fluid-excited vibrations exhibited by an array of vertically cantilevered elastic rods arranged on a lattice in a uniform cross-flow [1]. Nonstationary complex phenomena occurring in large arrays of up to 1000 <b>vibrating</b> <b>rods</b> in a wind tunnel were investigated in this experiment [2]. First, a critical flow velocity triggers emergence of a global dynamic pattern throughout the rod array. Second, a power law governs the scaling relationship between the rod impact rate and the flow velocity.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the fundamental equations {{of the branch}} of linear oscillatory dynamics known as Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA). The investigation described {{is limited to the}} study of two, point coupled multi-modal sub-systems which form the basis for most of the accepted theory in this field. Particular attention is paid to the development of exact classical solutions against which simplified approaches can be compared. These comparisons reveal deficiencies in the usual formulations of SEA in three areas, viz., for heavy damping, strong coupling between sub-systems and for systems with non-uniform natural frequency distributions. These areas are studied using axially <b>vibrating</b> <b>rod</b> models which clarify much of the analysis without significant loss of generality. The principal example studied is based on part of the structure of a modem warship. It illustrates the simplifications inherent in the models adopted here but also reveals the improvements that can be made over traditional SEA techniques. The problem of heavy damping is partially overcome by adopting revised equations for the various loss factors used in SEA. These are shown to be valid provided that the damping remains proportional so that inter-modal coupling is not induced by the damping mechanism. Strong coupling i...|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} is developed which quantifies the local exchange {{of energy and}} momentum between matter and the linearized gravitational field. We derive the unique gravitational energy-momentum tensor consistent with this description, and find that this tensor only exists in the harmonic gauge. Consequently, nearly all the gauge freedom of our {{framework is}} naturally and unavoidably removed. The gravitational energy-momentum tensor is then shown to have two exceptional properties: (a) it is gauge-invariant for gravitational plane-waves, (b) for arbitrary transverse-traceless fields, the energy-density is never negative, and the energy-flux is never spacelike. We analyse in detail the local gauge invariant energy-momentum transferred between the gravitational field and an infinitesimal point-source, and show that these invariants depend only on the transverse-traceless components of the field. As a result, we are led to a natural gauge-fixing program which at last renders the energy-momentum of the linear gravitational field completely unambiguous, and additionally ensures that gravitational energy is never negative nor flows faster than light. Finally, we calculate the energy-momentum content of gravitational plane-waves, the linearized Schwarzschild spacetime (extending to arbitrary static linear spacetimes) and the gravitational radiation outside two compact sources: a <b>vibrating</b> <b>rod,</b> and an equal-mass binary.
