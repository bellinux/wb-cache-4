Although both AMP-PNP and GMP-PNP {{were used}} in place of ATP and GTP by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase to transcribe vaccinia virus DNA, only GMP-PNP {{was used by the}} transcriptase present within vaccinia <b>virus</b> <b>cores.</b> AMP-PNP specifically prevented initiation of transcription, since RNA initiated in the presence of ATP, GTP, and CTP was subsequently elongated by incubating the washed cores in the presence of AMP-PNP, GTP, CTP, and UTP. The RNA formed in this manner, however, was (i) several times longer than normal transcripts, indicating a defect in chain termination and/or cleavage of nascent RNA, (ii) was not polyadenylylated (although free polyadenylic acid formed), and (iii) was not extruded from the <b>virus</b> <b>cores.</b> Nearest neighbor analysis demonstrated that AMP-PNP was incorporated adjacent to all four nucleotides, and hybridization to restriction endonuclease fragments of vaccinia virus DNA indicated that the high-molecular-weight RNA was transcribed from representative fractions of the entire genome. The possibility of a block in processing rather than or in addition to a block in chain termination was suggested by the cleavage of the high-molecular-weight RNA within the core after replacement of AMP-PNP with ATP. Cleavage of purified high-molecular-weight RNA by a soluble endoribonuclease extracted from vaccinia <b>virus</b> <b>cores,</b> however, was not dependent upon ATP, nor was it inhibited by AMP-PNP.

40|$|A {{group of}} conserved {{hydrophobic}} residues faces {{the interior of}} the coiled-coil-like structure within the N-terminal domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) capsid protein (CA). It has been suggested that these residues are important for maintaining stable structure and functional activity. To investigate this possibility, we constructed two HIV- 1 clones, in which Trp 23 or Phe 40 was changed to Ala. We also constructed a third mutant, D 51 A, which has a mutation that destroys a salt bridge between Pro 1 and Asp 51. All three mutants are replication defective but produce virus particles. Mutant virions contain all of the viral proteins, although the amount and stability of CA are decreased and levels of virion-associated integrase are reduced. The mutations do not affect endogenous reverse transcriptase activity; however, the mutants are blocked in their ability to initiate reverse transcription in infected cells and no minus-strand strong-stop DNA is detected. The defect in reverse transcription is associated with striking defects in the morphology of mutant <b>virus</b> <b>cores,</b> as determined by transmission electron microscopy. Our data indicate that the mutations made in this study disrupt CA structure and prevent proper maturation of <b>virus</b> <b>cores.</b> We propose that this results in a defect in core stability or in an early postentry event preceding reverse transcription...|$|R

50|$|Infecting viral {{particles}} {{are able to}} enter the cell via an endosmal route. The believed mechanism for {{this has to do}} with an acidification of the endosome, similar to what is done in the influenza virus. Early acidification of the endosome is thought to release components from the <b>virus</b> <b>core.</b> These components are then released into the host cell cytoplasm. VP5 often catalyzes cell fusion, which facilitates the penetration of the endosomal membrane and consequently the release of outer capsid components. Interestingly enough, EHDV does not contain large concentrations of VP5, yet it is still able to infect cell systems. EHDV is able to be infectious due to the presence of VP7 as suggested by the binding of anti-bodies to the outer core protein VP7. The binding of EHDV to the cell surface via interaction of VP7 with glycosaminoglycans in addition to other receptors is the most probable entry mechanism.|$|E

40|$|Previous studies {{established}} that vaccinia virus could enter cells by fusion with the plasma membrane at neutral pH. However, low pH triggers fusion of vaccinia virus-infected cells, {{a hallmark of}} viruses that enter by the endosomal route. Here, we demonstrate that entry of mature vaccinia virions is accelerated by brief low-pH treatment and severely reduced by inhibitors of endosomal acidification, providing evidence for a predominant low-pH-dependent endosomal pathway. Entry of vaccinia <b>virus</b> <b>cores</b> into the cytoplasm, measured by expression of firefly luciferase, was increased more than 10 -fold by exposure to a pH of 4. 0 to 5. 5. Furthermore, the inhibitors of endosomal acidification bafilomycin A 1, concanamycin A, and monensin each lowered virus entry by more than 70 %. This reduction was largely overcome by low-pH-induced entry through the plasma membrane, confirming the specificities of the drugs. Entry of vaccinia <b>virus</b> <b>cores</b> with or without brief low-pH treatment was visualized by electron microscopy of thin sections of immunogold-stained cells. Although some virus particles fused with the plasma membrane at neutral pH, 30 times more fusions and {{a greater number of}} cytoplasmic cores were seen within minutes after low-pH treatment. Without low-pH exposure, the number of released cores lagged behind the number of virions in vesicles until 30 min posttreatment, when they became approximately equal, perhaps reflecting the time of endosome acidification and virus fusion.
