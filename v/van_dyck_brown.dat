5000|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Dyck</b> <b>brown,</b> {{known in}} Europe as Cologne earth or Cassel earth, is another natural earth pigment, {{that was made}} up largely of decayed vegetal matter. It made a rich dark brown, and was widely used during the Renaissance to the 19th century It {{takes its name from}} the painter Anthony van Dyck, but it was used by many other artists before him. It was highly {{unstable}} and unreliable, so its use was abandoned by the 20th century, though the name continues to be used for modern synthetic pigments. The color of <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck</b> <b>brown</b> can be recreated by mixing ivory black with mauve or with Venetian red, or mixing cadmium red with cobalt blue.|$|E
50|$|The 17th and 18th century saw the {{greatest}} use of brown. Caravaggio and Rembrandt Van Rijn used browns to create chiaroscuro effects, where the subject {{appeared out of}} the darkness. Rembrandt also added umber to the ground layers of his paintings because it promoted faster drying. Rembrandt also began to use new brown pigment, called Cassel earth or Cologne earth. This was a natural earth color composed of over ninety percent organic matter, such as soil and peat. It was used by Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, and later became commonly known as <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck</b> <b>brown.</b>|$|E
5000|$|MacLeod {{then took}} it to a second recording, at the Royal Agricultural University, Cirencester. There, it was {{recognised}} as potentially a <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> by presenter Fiona Bruce, {{who had been working}} with art historian Philip Mould on an episode of another television programme Fake or Fortune?, which featured works by <b>van</b> <b>Dyck.</b> Mould shared her suspicions and suggested that the work be treated by an expert restorer, in what he described as [...] "the art equivalent of an archaeological excavation". The painting was restored by Simon Gillespie, who used solvent to remove layers of overpainting, in a process that took the equivalent of three weeks of full-time work. The removal of later painting returned what had appeared to be a finished portrait into a sketch with unfinished details. The ruff in particular was shown only in outline. The work was then confirmed as <b>van</b> <b>Dyck's</b> by Christopher <b>Brown,</b> a noted authority on the painter.|$|R

50|$|The {{influence}} of <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> on Thijs' style {{is due to}} his direct working relationship with <b>van</b> <b>Dyck.</b> Other possible influences are the works of slightly senior painters such as Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert and Gonzales Coques who were both early followers of <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> as well as Thijs' predecessors at the courts of Brussels and The Hague. The patrons at these courts showed a preference for <b>van</b> <b>Dyck’s</b> refined courtly style.|$|R

Today, <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck</b> Hall houses {{classrooms}} and the university's Department of History.|$|R
5000|$|Anthony <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> {{painted a}} [...] (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) around 1630-1632. The {{portrait}} {{was made to}} be engraved and included in <b>van</b> <b>Dyck’s</b> Iconography (Icones Principum Virorum), a collection of engraved portraits of leading personalities of <b>van</b> <b>Dyck’s</b> time. The painting was engraved by possibly Jacobus de Han. The inclusion of Symons in this project of <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> demonstrates that Symons was held in high esteem by his fellow artists.|$|R

50|$|Anthony <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> painted his portrait, {{which was}} {{engraved}} by Lucas Vorsterman the Elder {{for inclusion in}} the Iconography of <b>van</b> <b>Dyck.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the work he produced as an independent artist, he collaborated with other artists. He {{is known to have}} collaborated regularly with Anthony <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> during the two periods that <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> stayed in Genoa (1621 and 1625-1627). Some see the brush of Roos in the still lifes that appear in <b>van</b> <b>Dyck's</b> Vertumnus and Pomona and in Diana and Endymion. The style of <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> influenced Roos' work {{as can be seen in}} the Portrait of a boy, now in the Museo del Prado. Some of Roos' works such as [...] (Parochial church of Moltedo, Imperia) have in the past been attributed to <b>van</b> <b>Dyck.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Gonzales Coques (between 1614 and 1618 - 18 April 1684) was a Flemish {{painter of}} portraits and history paintings. [...] Because of his artistic {{proximity}} to and emulation with Anthony <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> {{he received the}} nickname de kleine <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> (the little <b>van</b> <b>Dyck).</b> Coques also worked as an art dealer.|$|R
5000|$|Vanderpoel's {{maternal}} {{grandparents were}} Jacobus [...] "James" [...] Huyck of Pompaonie and Elizabeth Huyck (née <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck)</b> (b. October 17, 1758). His great-grandparents were Arent <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck</b> and Heyltie <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck</b> (née <b>Van</b> Alen). His paternal grandparents were Johannes [...] "John" [...] Van der Poel and Annatje Staats (née Nautje).|$|R
50|$|Floris <b>van</b> <b>Dyck,</b> {{also called}} Floris van Dijck or Floris Claesz. <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> (c.1575 - before 26 April 1651) was a Dutch Golden Age still life painter.|$|R
50|$|Samson and Delilah is a 1630 {{painting}} by Anthony <b>van</b> <b>Dyck.</b> Like his 1620 {{version of the}} subject, {{it is in the}} style of his former master Peter Paul Rubens. Unlike Rubens, however, <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> shows Delilah seemingly appalled at her own betrayal of Samson and regretting her act of treason, whereas Rubens showed him as a captive and her as an unscrupulous temptress. <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck's</b> palette in the work also reveals the influence of Titian during <b>van</b> <b>Dyck's</b> stay in Italy. It is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.|$|R
50|$|It is {{inferred}} from stylistic analysis that Coques likely worked for <b>van</b> <b>Dyck.</b> The first period of collaboration probably {{took place between}} 1629 and 1632, i.e. after <b>van</b> <b>Dyck’s</b> return to Flanders and his departure for England. The second period was during the years 1634-1635 when <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> was back in Antwerp. Coques’ intimate knowledge of some of <b>van</b> <b>Dyck’s</b> later English compositions points to a possible stay of Coques in England during <b>van</b> <b>Dyck’s</b> final residence in England. This would also explain why Joannes Meyssens’ engraved portrait mentions that Coques had worked for Charles I of England. He also worked for Charles I’s two sons, Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester and Charles II during their exile in Bruges in the years 1656-1657.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Dyck</b> {{was born}} in 1875 at New Brunswick, New Jersey. [...] His father, Francis Cuyler <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck,</b> was the dean at Rutgers College, a science professor, {{and a friend of}} Thomas Edison.|$|R
50|$|He was {{appointed}} Surveyor Emeritus and advanced to GCVO on {{his retirement in}} 1988. He wrote the chapter on <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck's</b> English period for <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck,</b> A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings, published in 2004.|$|R
50|$|Franchoys’ portraits depict his sitters in a {{calculated}} informality {{in the style}} <b>van</b> <b>Dyck’s</b> portraits. His self-portrait, only known from an engraving by Coenrad Waumans, is close in style to the engraved artist portraits in <b>van</b> <b>Dyck’s</b> ‘Iconography’.|$|R
50|$|Student Teal <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck</b> won {{second place}} in the {{national}} Poetry Out Loud in 2006, earning a $10,000 scholarship. <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck</b> was also selected to be one of Bow High School's Granite State Challenge competitors on New Hampshire's PBS station, NHPTV.|$|R
5000|$|He {{worked on}} the Iconography of Anthony <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> and {{completed}} some of the portraits for the later editions of the Iconography by adding a sculptural bust and pedestal. [...] It is unknown {{whether or not this}} was <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck's</b> intention.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{critics have}} blamed <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> for {{diverting}} a nascent, tougher English portrait tradition—of painters such as William Dobson, Robert Walker and Isaac Fuller—into what certainly became elegant blandness {{in the hands}} of many of <b>van</b> <b>Dyck's</b> successors, like Lely or Kneller. [...] The conventional view has always been more favourable: [...] "When <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck</b> came hither he brought Face-Painting to us; ever since which time ... England has excel'd all the World in that great Branch of the Art’ (Jonathan Richardson: An Essay on the Theory of Painting, 1715, 41). Thomas Gainsborough is reported to have said on his deathbed [...] "We are all going to heaven, and <b>Van</b> <b>Dyck</b> is of the Company." ...|$|R

50|$|Not {{long after}} he made his will, van Egmont is {{recorded}} {{in the circle of}} Antony <b>van</b> <b>Dyck</b> as is evidenced by the fact that during a court case he stated that he had worked on a series of apostles for <b>van</b> <b>Dyck.</b>|$|R
50|$|Theodosius and Ambrose is a 1618 {{painting}} by Peter Paul Rubens, with assistance from his main pupil Anthony <b>van</b> <b>Dyck.</b> It {{is now in}} the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Rubens created the preparatory drawing, with the painting almost entirely done by <b>van</b> <b>Dyck,</b> who painted his own similar version of the subject a few years later. In the Rubens version, the architectural background is less defined, Theodosius is bearded and the spear and halberd in <b>van</b> <b>Dyck's</b> own version are omitted.|$|R
