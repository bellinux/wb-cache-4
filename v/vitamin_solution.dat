5000|$|Congregibacter litoralis KT71 is an aerobic anoxygenic {{photoheterotroph}} (AAnPs). In general terms, {{this means}} that KT71 is a strict aerobic organism with preference for low-oxygen environments. To find these environments, KT71 uses a flagellum combined with chemotaxis to move towards low-oxygen areas. [...] Though it does contain a complete photosynthesis superoperon, KT71 cannot grow autotrophically. [...] Instead, KT71 uses light for light-dependent cyclic electron transport through its photosystem to generate a proton gradient. [...] To determine the metabolism of KT71, the organism was grown in mineral medium containing: 35.0 g of sea salts, 0.1 g of NH4Cl, 0.05 g of K2HPO4, and 10 ml of a <b>vitamin</b> <b>solution.</b> The mineral medium was then supplemented with various carbon compounds to determine the ability for KT71 to use in its metabolism. From this {{it was determined that}} KT71 can grow well with carbon sources such as glutamate, pyruvate, and fatty acids as well as more complex substrates like yeast extract and trypticase peptone. Within its genome, genes, determined from genome annotation, involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, trichloroacetic acid cycle (TCA), citric acid cycle were found which correlated to the metabolism observed in culture. Further, KT71 is unable to use glucose as a sole carbon source, which was supported by genome analysis that showed a lack of glucose metabolism genes. Although the supplementation of inorganic sulfur to media did not promote growth, KT71 does contain sulfur-oxidizing (sox) genes that are uniquely arranged in its genome. [...] It is predicted that the potential use of the sox genes would be in the adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS)/ 3'-Phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) pathway.|$|E

Besides the potential of electrolyte and <b>vitamin</b> <b>solutions</b> to alleviate stress, these additives may directly boost production. Even under stress conditions, supplementing diets with salts can stimulate feed intake. Hence, Electrovite would alleviate physiological stress and provide a boost to milk production.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{represents}} the experimental results of elaboration of qualitative method to determine concentrations of vitamins A, D, and E in liquids and biological fluids by aid of computer analysis of visual data. The H. S. Skovoroda’s KNPU Chemistry department staff {{has been working}} on a software product for schools under the general name of ―ColorKit‖. The software allows analyzing photo and video files. One of ―ColorKit‖ application directions may be the investigation of liquids and fluids optical densities parameters. Concerning the <b>vitamins</b> <b>solutions,</b> the research primary task was to create a non-polar reagent for each vitamin, so that, the reagent would bind a vitamin and rapidly form a complex of specific color. The intensity of the latter would be proportional to the vitamin concentration, and would be determined by aid of web-camera and the ―ColorKit‖ program. The innovation of reagents preparation was proposed, i. e. saturated solution of SO 3 (for vitamin A), or SO 3 + N 2 O 5 (for vitamin D and E) in dichloride-ethane. The experimental video analysis according to RGB-system established logarithmic dependences of the <b>solution</b> color on <b>vitamin</b> A concentration. The correlation coefficients were equal to 0. 95 - 0. 99. The highest magnitude of R was registered for comparison of <b>vitamin</b> A experimental <b>solution</b> color with methylenic blue solution color, which was used as a colorimetric standard for the computer processing of visual data. The analysis of vitamin E video files according to RGB-system established logarithmic dependences of the <b>solution</b> color on <b>vitamin</b> E concentration with low correlation coefficients. The same analysis according to ―Black-White‖ system displayed the linear correlation between the solutions concentrations and their color with R magnitude equal to 0. 998. The experimental <b>vitamin</b> D <b>solutions</b> video analysis to ―Black White‖-system established a linear correlation in the dependence of solution color intensity on the vitamin concentration, with the high R magnitude, which was equal to 0. 94. Of high practical application might be the evaluation of <b>vitamin</b> D <b>solutions</b> concentrations dependence upon the samples brightness. Thus, algorithm of processing visual effects of vitamins qualitative colored reactions alterations was established by aid of web-camera CNR-WCAM 820 and the ColorKit program. The calibration graphs for the vitamin concentrations determination in solutions were obtained. The elaborated method may be recommended to use at school conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the combined occluding effects of fluoride-containing dentin desensitizer and neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd-YAG) laser irradiation on human dentinal tubules. All six of the groups of dentin samples (A-F) included in this study received applications of fluoride-containing dentin desensitizer. Groups B, D, and F also received Nd-YAG laser irradiation. Groups A and B served as controls, to allow observations of the occluding effects on the dentinal tubules before and after Nd-YAG laser irradiation. Groups C and D were treated with 0. 5 M <b>vitamin</b> C <b>solution,</b> whereas groups E and F underwent brushing with an electric toothbrush. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the fluoridated dentinal tubule-occluding agent (FDTOA) formed a fine crystalline deposit on the dentin surface. After soaking in 0. 5 M <b>vitamin</b> C <b>solution</b> for 3 hours, the crystalline deposit of the FDTOA was completely dissolved. Furthermore, brushing of the teeth 3, 600 times removed most of the occluding agent. When the application of FDTOA was combined with Nd-YAG laser irradiation, the dentin melted and then recrystallized. The occluding agent was thus ‘burned into’ the dentinal tubules, and could neither be dissolved by <b>vitamin</b> C <b>solution</b> nor removed by brushing. Therefore, we concluded that the FDTOA combined with Nd-YAG laser irradiation burns the occluding agent into the dentinal tubules, thereby resisting the effects of an acidic diet and brushing, and increasing the duration of the desensitizing effect...|$|R

40|$|Ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) {{leads to}} {{oxidative}} stress with free radical formation. With respect to liver surgery and transplantation this {{can lead to}} deleterious clinical effects. Protection of the liver against I/R injury is of major concern. Thus, in this study, we examined the effect of an antioxidant <b>vitamin</b> <b>solution</b> (vitamin E, C and ß-carotene) on warm I/R injury. Twelve pigs of the German landrace (7 animals in the vitamin group and 5 untreated controls) were examined in this animal model. Twenty-four hours before laparotomy, the vitamin group was initiated with a single intravenous infusion of the vitamin cocktail. The duration of complete warm ischemia of the liver was 4 hours. Serum liver enzyme levels (AST and ALT) and with thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) in liver tissue were measured. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of oxidative products (oxidized proteins and 4 -hydroxy-nonenal = 4 -HNE) in liver tissue was made. The maximum accumulation of oxidized proteins was seen six days postoperatively in the controls whereas in the vitamin group only small amounts were seen. 4 -HNE showed a marked accumulation in the controls but was almost not detectable in the vitamin group. TBARS were lower in the vitamin group compared to controls. Although the emulsifier necessary for the <b>vitamin</b> <b>solution</b> leads to increased liver enzyme levels in the vitamin group, the values returned to normal more rapidly. Antioxidant vitamins are able to improve warm I/R liver injury. Oxidative stress is directly verifiable at the tissue level. Future animal experiments as well as clinical trials are necessary to explore the optimization of the combination of antioxidative vitamins for the maximum protection from I/R injury...|$|E

40|$|Caldicellulosiruptor owensensis strain OLT (DSM 13100) is an obligately anaerobic, extreme {{thermophilic}} bacterium that {{is capable of}} utilizing a broad range of carbohydrates and producing H 2 as a metabolic by-product. The performance of C. owensensis on glucose and xylose was analyzed in lab-scale bioreactors to assess its potential use in biohydrogen production. Acetate, H 2, and CO 2 were the main end products during exponential growth of the organism on either sugar. Lactate production was triggered during the transition into the stationary phase and was associated with an increase in the levels of specific L-lactate dehydrogenase activity. In addition, minor amounts of ethanol and propionate could be detected. H 2 and acetate yields were lower on xylose than on glucose, marking an opposite trend to biomass and lactate yields. The influence of elevated H 2 partial pressure on product distribution was more dramatic in xylose-fermenting cultures. Replacement of yeast extract in the medium with a standard <b>vitamins</b> <b>solution</b> improved H 2 yield on both sugars, where it reached 100 % of the theoretical maximum, i. e. 4 mol per mol hexose, on glucose.

40|$|In {{aesthetic}} medicine a biostimulation {{is needed}} to improve the treatments for chrono and photo-aging. We theorized a mesotherapic procedure infiltrating a <b>vitamin</b> D <b>solution</b> through a 30 G needle forming a 45 degree angle with the skin surface. We postulate that adult stem cells, located inside dermal niches, whenever in contact with vitamin D, induce the expression of multiple D vitamin-dedicated receptors on new cells’ surface following an asymmetric division and therefore triggering a nuclear translocation. The effects of active vitamin D, uncorrelated to calcemic increase, are the following: growth regulation, DNA reparation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, membrane transfer, metabolic effects, cell adhesion, oxidative stress. This effects demonstrate that vitamin D is saft and should be introduced in aesthetic medicine treatments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} ozone {{damage to}} hairless mouse skin, two parameters of oxidative damage, vitamin E depletion and malondialdehyde (MDA) production, were measured in vitamin E-enriched {{and in control}} skin from mice exposed to ozone (10 ppm). A 5 % <b>vitamin</b> E <b>solution</b> (tocotrienol-rich fraction, TRF) in polyethylene glycol (PEG) was applied to 2 sites {{on the back of}} hairless mice, PEG to 2 sites. After 2 h, the sites were washed, one of each pair of sites covered and the mice exposed ozone for 2 h. Ozone exposure (compared with covered sites) increased epidermal MDA in PEG-treated sites, while vitamin E was unchanged. In contrast, ozone exposure significantly depleted vitamin E in TRF-treated sites, while significant MDA accumulation was prevented. This is the first demonstration that ozone exposure causes damage to cutaneous lipids, an effect which can be attenuated by vitamin E application...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the effect of adding}} the antioxidants vitamins C and E on the quality of semen cryopreserved of curimba (Prochilodus lineatus). Semen samples from nine breeding males were collected for analysis of rate (%) and duration (s) of sperm motility. The sperm pool was diluted into three cryoprotective solutions: Solution A: 5 gr.

The vitamins C and E were not toxic to the semen of curimba. The sperm motility did not present any significant difference. However, the semen cryopreserved with vitamin C had a longer duration of the motility after thawing. Therefore, the vitamin C is recommended for the cryopreservation of the semen of curimba. ...|$|R

This study aimed to determine whether embryonic hawksbill turtle cells respond differently to temperature than mammalian cells. Embryonic hawksbill turtle cells were established in culture, and thermal effects on these cells were investigated in vitro. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids, <b>vitamin</b> <b>solution,</b> sodium pyruvate, and 10 % fetal bovine serum at 33 °C and cell proliferation occurred at 25 – 33 °C. When cells were incubated at 37 °C (the temperature of mammalian cell culture) for 24 h, cell growth was completely inhibited. This growth inhibition was evidently recovered by changing the incuba-tion temperature back to 33 °C.
