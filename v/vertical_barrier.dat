40|$|A large {{class of}} {{scattering}} problems of surface water waves by <b>vertical</b> <b>barriers</b> lead to mixed boundary value problems for Laplace equation. Specific attentions are paid, {{in the present}} article, to highlight an analytical method to handle this class of problems of surface water wave scattering, when the barriers in question are non-reflecting in nature. A new set of boundary conditions is proposed for such non-reflecting barriers and tile resulting boundary value problems are handled in the linearized theory of water waves. Three basic poblems of scattering by <b>vertical</b> <b>barriers</b> are solved. The present new theory of non-reflecting <b>vertical</b> <b>barriers</b> predict new transmission coefficients and tile solutions of tile mathematical problems {{turn out to be}} extremely simple and straight forward as compared to the solution for other types of barriers handled previously...|$|R

50|$|Montezuma Castle is {{situated}} about 90 ft up a sheer limestone cliff, facing the adjacent Beaver Creek, which drains into the perennial Verde River {{just north of}} Camp Verde. It {{is one of the}} best-preserved cliff dwellings in North America, in part because of its ideal placement in a natural alcove that protects it from exposure to the elements. The precariousness of the dwelling's location and its immense scale - almost 4000 sq ft of floor space across five stories - suggest that the Sinagua were daring builders and skilled engineers.

40|$|Roadside {{concrete}} barriers {{have been}} widely used to protect errant motorists from hitting roadside hazards or obstacles. Two concrete <b>barrier</b> profiles, <b>vertical</b> and safety-shape, have been used for this purpose. The safety-shape profile has been shown to produce excessive vehicle climbing which tends to increase rollover propensity. The vertical profile, on the other hand, does not cause vehicle climbing, but it does produce higher lateral forces which may produce higher injury levels. ^ The objective of this research is to investigate which barrier profile is the safest based on real-world vehicle crash data. The safest barrier profile is defined as the one that produces lower injury levels. Rollover propensity was also used as a second indicator of barrier performance since rollovers may also affect injury severity. ^ Eleven years of bridge-related crash data was collected from State maintained highways in the State of Iowa. Statistical procedures were used to conduct the data analysis which was sub-divided into two major tasks: rollover analysis and injury analysis. ^ It was found that rollovers are twice more likely to occur in crashes involving safety-shape barriers as compared to <b>vertical</b> <b>barriers.</b> It was also found that crashes that involved safety-shape barriers resulted in higher injury levels as compared to crashes that involved the <b>vertical</b> <b>barriers.</b> ^ Therefore, it is believed that the expanded use of <b>vertical</b> <b>barriers</b> would improve overall highway safety. However, this conclusion is based on limited data and a more comprehensive data set covering many more States besides Iowa is recommended for analysis in the future. ...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the typical}} {{obstacles}} you may find on a course is the jumping fence, a <b>vertical</b> <b>barrier</b> the rat crawls over (it rarely jumps over them despite the name). The A-fence or ramp is a simple up and down obstacle. The slalom fence or weaving poles consists {{of a series of}} vertical sticks the rat has to navigate through. A balance fence is a narrow strip or some kind of suspended walkway. Rats don't like the ground to move so they need to trust the driver to be able to pass it. Another obstacle is the tunnel, the problem is to prevent the rat from taking a break {{in the middle of the}} tunnel. The seesaw also plays on the trust in the driver. The rat needs to dare to walk over it. It is also important that the rat doesn't turn and run back when it flips over. The up-and-down-fence is similar to the slalom fence, but vertical instead of horizontal. The rat has to go up and down over and under the sticks. Although some other versions also exist, but these are the most common.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{both the}} UK and the US, low permeability, <b>vertical</b> <b>barriers</b> (slurry walls) {{are widely used}} in systems {{designed}} and constructed for the control of groundwater such as in to temporary excavations. These <b>vertical</b> <b>barriers</b> may result in more economical dewatering for larger and/or more complex underground excavation projects than dewatering wells, the conventionally used alternative. In the US, soil-bentonite slurry wall technology is the predominant method {{for the construction of}} these low permeability barriers. In contrast, slag-cement-bentonite slurry wall technology is the most widely employed me thod in the UK. These barriers are made with water, cement, and granulated ground blast furnace slag. This paper presents an examination, comparison, and assessment of each of these practices. It is concluded that slag-cement-bentonite techniques could readily be adopted by US designers and contractors. Permeability data developed in the US using US sourced ingredients are presented which show that a mixture of about 20 % cementitious material to 80 % slurry (where the cementitious material is about 25 % Portland cement and 75 % slag) results in a barrier having a hydraulic conductivity less than 1 x 10 - 7 cm/s.

Under the assumption that at least one barrier does not occupy the entire fluid depth, the following results have been proven: for any configuration of two barriers the homogeneous problem has only the trivial solution for any frequency within the continuous spectrum: for an arbitrary configuration of three barriers the homogeneous problem has only the trivial solution for certain ranges of frequency within the continuous spectrum; for three-barrier configurations symmetric about a vertical line, it is shown that there are no correspondingly symmetric trapped modes for any frequency within the continuous spectrum; for four-barrier configurations symmetric about a vertical line, the homogeneous problem has only the trivial solution for certain ranges of frequency within the continuous spectrum.

40|$|The <b>vertical</b> {{moisture}} <b>barrier</b> (VMB) is {{an accepted}} form {{of treatment for}} highway pavements constructed on expansive clay. Many installations for rural highways in the United States and Australia have achieved great success in preserving the moisture regime in the pavement subgrade. As {{a result of this}} proven record, the method is increasingly becoming incorporated in some of the newly constructed pavements of new subdivisions in Australia. Nevertheless, many practitioners including some pavement design consultants, road contractors, and even Local Government Authority engineers, still question the technical validity of this application. Also, with the diminishing budgets of Local Authorities such serious allegations can lead to this method being completely ruled out as a measure of pavement management technique. Hence, it becomes necessary to establish whether it is the validity of this method that is under question or that of the allegations. The adaptability of this method ti the urban situation was investigated in a field trial at Horsham. Many challenges were faced during this process requiring proper address before a successful installation can be achieved. Two further locations, where <b>vertical</b> moisture <b>barriers</b> were installed, were also fully examined. The result of these investigations proves that the failure of these installations {{may be the result of}} either one or more of the following; invalid design of barrier, improper installation practice, lack of expert supervision and finally the absence of a good code-of-practice for <b>vertical</b> <b>barriers.</b> This paper addresses those issues relating to the major differences between rural and urban pavements affecting the barrier design and installation.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Using the method of matched asymptotic expansions the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated for scattering of oblique water waves by a <b>vertical</b> <b>barrier.</b> Here an assumption is made that the barrier is small compared to the wavelength {{and the depth of}} water. A number of sloshing problems are considered. The eigenfrequencies are calculated when a body is placed in a rectangular tank. Here the bodies considered are a vertical surface-piercing or bottom-mounted barrier, and circular and elliptic cylinders. When the body is a <b>vertical</b> <b>barrier,</b> the eigenfunction expansion method is applied. When the body is either a circular or elliptic cylinder, and the motion is two-dimensional, the boundary element method is applied to calculate the eigenfrequencies. For comparison, two approximations, "a wide-spacing", and "a small-body" are used for a <b>vertical</b> <b>barrier</b> and circular cylinder. In the wide-spacing approximation, the assumption is made that the wavelength is small compared with the distance between the body and walls. The small-body approximation means that a typical dimension of the body is much larger than the cross-sectional length scale of the fluid motion. For an elliptic cylinder, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used and compared with the result of the boundary- element method. Also a higher-order solution is obtained using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, and it is compared with the exact solution for a surface-piercing barrier. Again the assumption is made that the length scale of the motion is much larger than a typical body dimension. Finally, the drift force on multiple bodies is considered the ratio of horizontal drift force in the direction of wave advance on two cylinders to that on an isolated cylinder is calculated. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is used under the assumption that the wavelength is much greater than the cylinder spacing...|$|E
