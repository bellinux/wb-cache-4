5|$|No {{treaties}} which {{shall be}} directly {{opposed to the}} existing laws of the United States in Congress assembled shall be <b>valid</b> until such laws shall be repealed, or made conformable to such treaty; nor shall any treaty be <b>valid</b> which is contradictory to the Constitution of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Persons {{over the}} age of 15, and who do not have a <b>valid</b> ID, can pay a fine from 300,000 up to 500,000 Lebanese Pounds. Failure to show a <b>valid</b> ID to a police officer in a public place can result in a fine of 20,000 Lebanese Pounds.|$|E
5|$|Spam {{filtering}} imports users' {{address books}} {{to compile a}} whitelist of allowed senders. Addresses to which users send mail and e-mail tagged as <b>valid</b> mail can be automatically added to the whitelist. Using several thousand messages, PC Magazine found that Norton marked over 40 percent of <b>valid</b> e-mail as spam. Over 80 percent of <b>valid</b> newsletters were marked as spam. Norton did correctly identify 90 percent of spam e-mail.|$|E
5|$|A One Day Pass for $14.75, <b>valid</b> {{for one day}} of {{unlimited}} Metrorail travel. The pass expires {{at the end of}} {{the operating}} day.|$|E
5|$|A Sudoku {{will remain}} <b>valid</b> under {{the actions of}} the Sudoku {{preserving}} symmetries (see also Jarvis). Some Sudokus are special in that some operations merely have the effect of relabelling the digits; several of these are listed below.|$|E
5|$|Activision, through John Devecka, owns all of Devecka Enterprises' US and {{international}} patents {{that deal with}} music games. All patents issued by the USPTO are presumed <b>valid.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{isolated}} {{population in}} Crimea {{has sometimes been}} separated as T. v. tauricus, {{but this is not}} considered to be a <b>valid</b> form. Mistle thrush fossils have been found in Pleistocene deposits from Poland and Sicily.|$|E
5|$|As a formality, {{a person}} must state a justifiable reason for {{purchasing}} a B category firearm, which include collecting, sporting, hunting or cultural activity, conducting business with firearms and ammunition, providing security, exercise of profession and self-defense. The police will issue the permit {{in up to}} 30 days (usually immediately) and the permit is shall-issue if the applicant has a <b>valid</b> gun license (and fulfills all of its requirements, e.g. clean criminal record); the purchase permit is <b>valid</b> for 12 months.|$|E
5|$|Bus transport, where Goldsmith {{promised to}} allow {{electric}} cars into bus lanes, {{and said that}} busses needed to be electrified and more efficient. Khan promised a new bus ticket which is <b>valid</b> for an hour.|$|E
5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, and {{determined}} that the curfew and exclusion orders were <b>valid,</b> even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not <b>valid,</b> and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, the Scottish Government {{refused to}} pay for {{concessionary}} travel for the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be <b>valid</b> for tram travel, but {{that they should be}} paid for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be <b>valid,</b> and that travel would be paid for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Enumerating the Sudoku {{solutions}} {{breaks into}} an initial setup stage {{and then into}} two nested loops. Initially all the <b>valid</b> Band1 permutations are grouped into equivalence classes, who each impose a common constraint on the Band2,3 completions.|$|E
5|$|Following Carl Linnaeus's first {{descriptions}} of the species, several lion specimen were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as <b>valid</b> in 2005.|$|E
5|$|For Khalkha, {{the most}} {{complete}} treatment of the verbal forms is Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987. However, the analysis of predication presented here, while <b>valid</b> for Khalkha, is adapted from the description of Khorchin by Matsuoka 2007.|$|E
5|$|Herbert concludes that, {{although}} Bell's theorem {{does not}} preclude any of the aforementioned interpretations of quantum mechanics, it insists that any <b>valid</b> interpretation must allow for non-local interaction.|$|E
5|$|However, {{more than}} one <b>valid</b> Lebanese {{passport}} of the same type may not be held, except if authorized by the Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS).|$|E
5|$|Intermediate birds occur {{where the}} {{recognised}} forms meet and interbreed, and have sometimes been given subspecies status, including S. b. kreczmeri in Poland and S. b. pateffi in Bulgaria, {{but these are}} not generally accepted as <b>valid</b> taxa.|$|E

5|$|On February 19, 2008, Ne-Yo {{was arrested}} for {{reckless}} driving and driving without a <b>valid</b> license after driving through Cobb County, Georgia in his 2006 Range Rover. It was reported {{that he was doing}} about 150mph, 100mph over the speed limit. On June 2, 2008, Ne-Yo pleaded guilty to the driving without a <b>valid</b> license charge and no contest to the reckless driving charge. He was sentenced to 24 hours of community service.|$|E
5|$|On October 22, 1975, {{a federal}} judge in Atlanta, Georgia, finally ruled Jones Eshlimar's {{marriage}} was <b>valid</b> and that half of Williams' future royalties belonged to her.|$|E

5|$|Paul Oppenheimer and Edward Zalta used an {{automated}} theorem prover—Prover9—to validate Anselm's ontological thesis. Prover9 subsequently discovered a simpler, formally <b>valid</b> (if not necessarily sound) ontological argument {{from a single}} non-logical premise.|$|E
5|$|Police-issued passes do not grant {{access to}} {{government}} press conferences {{or any other}} such privileges: they are only recognized by emergency response personnel, and only <b>valid</b> within {{the jurisdiction of the}} issuing agencies.|$|E
5|$|Since March 6, 2016, SmarTrip {{cards are}} the only payment method {{accepted}} on Metrorail; paper farecards are no longer <b>valid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} regard {{other species}} as <b>valid</b> as well, for example P.erlenbergensis. Such works, however, ignore Moser (2003), the publication {{that shows the}} type series of P.engelhardti to be diagnostic, and other material to be referable to it.|$|E
5|$|The Band1 (65) symmetries {{divide the}} (56×66) Band1 <b>valid</b> {{permutations}} into (not less than) 336 (56×6) equivalence classes with (up to) 6^5 permutations each.|$|E

5|$|The Lebanese {{identity}} card {{may be used}} to verify identity and nationality having the same effect as a <b>valid</b> Lebanese passport, and may also be used as a travel document within Syria and Jordan in lieu of a Lebanese passport. In domestic non-electronic identification the driving licence has remained in a leading position. A driving licence is <b>valid</b> for almost every situation where non-electronic personal identification is needed even though they are not officially recognized as such.|$|E
5|$|The deed of settlement, however, {{confirms}} the loans are <b>valid</b> and enforceable, while waiving accrued penalty interest on overdue borrowings.|$|E
5|$|The {{fish was}} {{originally}} described as Raja laevis by Samuel Latham Mitchill in 1818. The scientific name was later changed to the currently <b>valid</b> name Dipturus laevis. It {{has also been}} misidentified as Raia granulata by Theodore Gill, an American ichthyologist, in 1879. The genus name, Dipturus, {{is derived from the}} Greek words di, meaning two, and pteryx, meaning wing. Raja, the original genus which was coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, is still recognized as a <b>valid</b> subgenus.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} whether the Act was constitutionally <b>valid</b> {{revolved}} around the fact that immigration detention {{is a form of}} administrative detention, or detention imposed by the executive branch of government. Detention generally {{is considered to be a}} judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an arrest, or detention for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, detention of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also <b>valid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The leading case, Anti-Vivisection Society, {{sets out}} a strict rule that {{charities}} cannot campaign politically. An illustration of its strictness is Bowman v Secular Society, {{where it was}} held that even when attempted changes to the law were ancillary to the main goals, it was still unacceptable. There is a dividing line; charitable trusts discussing political issues can be <b>valid,</b> as discussed by Hoffmann J obiter dicta in Attorney General v Ross. This line is considered by the Charity Commission in their official guidelines, which allow the Commission {{to look at the}} wider purpose of the organisation when deciding if it constitutes a <b>valid</b> charity.|$|E
5|$|The {{passport}} had {{a printed}} list of countries {{for which it}} was <b>valid,</b> which was added to in handwriting as validity increased.|$|E
5|$|The type species, S. osborni, was {{described}} by Barnum Brothwn in 1912 from Canadian fossils. A second <b>valid</b> species, S. angustirostris, is represented by numerous specimens from Mongolia, and {{was described}} by Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky.|$|E
