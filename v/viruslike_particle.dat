They had previously described the development, manufacture, and efficacy in mice of an A/Anhui/1/13 (H7N9) <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> (VLP) vaccine produced in insect cells {{with the use}} of recombinant baculovirus. The vaccine combined the HA and neuraminidase (NA) of A/Anhui/1/13 with the matrix 1 protein (M1) of A/Indonesia/5/05.

40|$|Small {{amounts of}} a 23 -kilobase covalently closed {{circular}} DNA molecule were isolated from unwashed cells of Methanococcus voltae A 3. Further investigation indicated {{the presence of}} greater quantities of the circular DNA in the culture supernatant, complexed with protein in a manner rendering the DNA resistant to DNase. Electron-microscopic examination of supernatant material revealed the presence of particles which morphologically resemble virus. Phenol extraction of <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> preparations resulted in the recovery of DNase-sensitive open-circular DNA molecules. As many as 30 viruslike particles per cell were recovered from some cultures. Hybridization data clearly indicated {{the presence of a}} chromosomally integrated copy of the <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> DNA. Although M. voltae PS was not observed to produce viruslike particles, DNA homologous to the <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> DNA was detected in its chromosome. A mutant of M. voltae A 3 was isolated which produced no particles; its DNA was deleted for 80 % of the integrated <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> DNA.

40|$|A {{single-stranded}} 6. 6 -kb DNA molecule complexed with protein {{was recovered}} from the supernatant of Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 6444. Electron microscopic examination of the DNA-protein complex revealed {{the presence of a}} filamentous <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle,</b> which was designated CAK 1. The possible double-stranded plasmidlike replicative form and the single-stranded prophage were also {{recovered from the}} cell culture following alkaline lysis. CAK 1 was released from the C. acetobutylicum cell culture in the absence of cell lysis. Polyethylene glycol-NaCl coprecipitation of the DNA-protein complex revealed the presence of single-stranded DNA complexed with protein in a manner rendering the DNA resistant to Bal 31 exonuclease. Proteinase treatment of CsCl density gradient-purified CAK 1 resulted in recovery of DNase-sensitive single-stranded DNA. Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of CAK 1 demonstrated the presence of a 5 -kDa major coat protein. Hybridization data indicated that the single-stranded DNA from CAK 1 has homology with the M 13 phage of Escherichia coli. An examination of various physical properties of CAK 1 suggests that it is similar to the filamentous phage recovered from gram-negative microorganisms. Although infectivity or inducibility of CAK 1 could not be demonstrated, to our knowledge this represents the first report of a nonlytic filamentous <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> containing single-stranded DNA being recovered from a gram-positive bacterium...|$|E
40|$|VP 2 is {{the major}} {{component}} of canine parvovirus (CPV) capsids. The VP 2 -coding gene was engineered to be expressed by a recombinant baculovirus {{under the control of}} the polyhedrin promoter. A transfer vector that contains the lacZ gene {{under the control of the}} p 10 promoter was used in order to facilitate the selection of recombinants. The expressed VP 2 was found to be structurally and immunologically indistinguishable from authentic VP 2. The recombinant VP 2 shows also the capability to self-assemble, forming <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> similar in size and appearance to CPV virions. These <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> have been used to immunize dogs in different doses and combinations of adjuvants, and the anti-CPV responses have been measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, monolayer protection assays, and an assay for the inhibition of hemagglutination. A dose of ca. 10 micrograms of VP 2 was able to elicit a good protective response, higher than that obtained with a commercially available, inactivated vaccine.

The envelope glycoprotein, Gn, was discovered to be necessary and sufficient for packaging of the genome, nucleocapsid protein and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase into virus particles.

40|$|The {{expression}} of the pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 occurs via a ribosomal frameshift between the gag and pol genes. The resulting protein, a Gag-Pol polyprotein, is produced at a level 5 to 10 % of that of the Gag protein. The Gag-Pol polyprotein is incorporated into virions and provides viral protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase, which are essential for infectivity. It is generally believed that the Gag-Pol polyprotein is incorporated into virions via interaction with the Gag protein, although {{the details of the}} mechanism are unknown. To further study this problem, we have constructed a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 proviral genome which overexpresses the Gag-Pol polyprotein (Pr 160 gag-pol). Transfection of this proviral genome (pGPpr-) into COS- 1 cells resulted in the {{expression of}} full-length Pr 160 gag-pol polyprotein. Although the majority of the Pr 160 gag-pol was confined to the cells, low levels of reverse transcriptase activity were detectable in the cell supernatants. The cotransfection of pGPpr- with a second plasmid which expresses only the Pr 55 gag precursor (pGAG) resulted in a significantly higher level of Pr 160 gag-pol in the medium of transfected cells. Sedimentation analysis using sucrose density gradients demonstrated that most Pr 160 gag-pol was found in fractions corresponding to the density of virion particles, indicating that the Pr 160 gag-pol polyprotein was released in association with a Pr 55 gag <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle.</b> To further characterize the requirements for the release, a mutation was constructed to express an unmyristylated Pr 160 gag-pol polyprotein. Coexpression with Pr 55 gag demonstrated that the unmyristylated Pr 160 gag-pol was also incorporated into virion particles. Subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that the distributions of the Pr 160 gag-polmyr- and Pr 160 gag-pol in the membrane and cytosol were similar under low- or high-ionic-strength conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that myristylation of the Pr 160 gag-pol polyprotein is not required for the interaction with the Pr 55 gag necessary for packaging into a <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle...</b>|$|E
40|$|The primary {{pathogens}} {{related to}} shellfish-borne gastroenteritis outbreaks are noroviruses. These viruses show persistence in oysters, which suggests an active mechanism of virus concentration. We investigated whether Norwalk virus or <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> bind specifically to oyster tissues after bioaccumulation or addition to tissue sections. Since noroviruses attach to carbohydrates of the histo-blood group family, tests using immunohistochemical analysis {{were performed to}} evaluate specific binding of virus or <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> to oyster tissues through these ligands. Viral particles bind specifically to digestive ducts (midgut, main and secondary ducts, and tubules) by carbohydrate structures with a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue in an alpha linkage (same binding site used for recognition of human histo-blood group antigens).

40|$|Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) capsids {{are formed}} {{by a single}} protein layer {{containing}} three polypeptides, pVP 2, VP 2, and VP 3. Here, we show that the VP 3 protein synthesized in insect cells, either after expression of the complete polyprotein or from a VP 3 gene construct, is proteolytically degraded, leading to the accumulation of product lacking the 13 C-terminal residues. This finding led to identification of the VP 3 oligomerization domain within a 24 -amino-acid stretch near the C-terminal end of the polypeptide, partially overlapping the VP 1 binding domain. Inactivation of the VP 3 oligomerization domain, by either proteolysis or deletion of the polyprotein gene, abolishes <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> formation. Formation of VP 3 -VP 1 complexes in cells infected with a dual recombinant baculovirus simultaneously expressing the polyprotein and VP 1 pre-vented VP 3 proteolysis and led to efficient virus-like particle formation in insect cells.

40|$|Position-specific {{integration}} of the retroviruslike element Ty 3 near the transcription initiation sites of tRNA genes requires transcription factors IIIB and IIIC (TFIIIB and TFIIIC). Using a genetic screen, we isolated a mutant with a truncated 95 -kDa subunit of TFIIIC (TFIIIC 95) that reduced the apparent retrotransposition of Ty 3 into a plasmid-borne target site between two divergently transcribed tRNA genes. Although TFIIIC 95 is conserved and essential, no defect in growth or transcription of tRNAs was detected in the mutant. Steps of the Ty 3 life cycle, such as protein expression, proteolytic processing, <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> formation, and reverse transcription, were not affected by the mutation. However, Ty 3 integration into a divergent tDNA target occurred exclusively in one orientation in the mutant strain. Investigation of this orientation bias showed that TFIIIC 95 and Ty 3 integrase interacted in two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays and that interaction with the mutant TFIIIC 95 protein was attenuated. The orientation bias observed here suggests that even for wild-type Ty 3, the protein complexes associated with the long terminal repeats are not equivalent in vivo...|$|E

Mutations close to a core protein domain of TyB, which is homologous to retroviral proteases, have striking effects on Ty protein processing, the physiology of Ty <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles,</b> and transposition. The Ty protease is required for processing of both TyA and TyB proteins. Mutations in the protease resulted in the synthesis of morphologically and functionally aberrant Ty <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles.</b> The mutant particles displayed reverse transcriptase activity, but did not synthesize Ty DNA in vitro. Ty RNA was present in the mutant particles, but at very low levels. Transposition of a genetically tagged element ceased when the protease domain was mutated, demonstrating that Ty protease is essential for transposition. One of these mutations also defined a segment of TyB encoding an active reverse transcriptase.

40|$|Previously, {{we found}} that log-phase cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain {{a new type of}} <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> {{containing}} only plus- strand L-A single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). These particles synthesize minus-strand RNA in an in vitro RNA polymerase reaction to produce L-A double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The major class of particles contains L-A dsRNA and synthesizes plus-strand L-A ssRNA by a conservative mechanism. In this paper, we show that mutations in mak 10 or the pet 18 locus, which result in temperature-dependent replication of L-A dsRNA in vivo, also result in instability of the L-A dsRNA-containing (major class) <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> in vitro. The L-A dsRNA (minus-strand) -synthesizing particles isolated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation synthesize plus-strand L-A ssRNA after completion of dsRNA (minus-strand) synthesis and have the same major coat protein as that of the major-class particles. Furthermore, the density of the dsRNA-synthesizing particles from wild-type cells shifts to that of the major-class dsRNA-containing particles {{as a result of the}} in vitro RNA polymerase reaction. Thus, L-A dsRNA-synthesizing particles undergo functional and structural maturation in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Assembly {{of viruses}} that have {{hundreds}} of subunits or folding of proteins that {{have hundreds of}} amino acids—complex biological reactions—are often spontaneous and rapid. Here, we examine the complete set of intermediates available for the assembly of a hypothetical <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> and the connectivity between these intermediates in a graph-theory-inspired study. Using a build-up procedure, assuming ideal geometry, we enumerated the complete set of 2, 423, 313 species for formation of an icosahedron from 30 dimeric subunits. Stability of each n-subunit intermediate was defined {{by the number of}} contacts between subunits. The probability of forming an intermediate was {{based on the number of}} paths to it from its precedecessors. When defining population subsets predicted to have the greatest impact on assembly, both stability- and probability-based criteria select a small group of compact and degenerate species; ergo, only a few hundred intermediates make a measurable contribution to assembly. Though the number of possible intermediates grows combinatorially with the number of subunits in the capsid, the number of intermediates that make a significant contribution to the reaction grows by a much smaller function, a result that may contribute to our understanding of assembly and folding reactions...|$|E

Quasi-isometric nucleoprotein particles (A 260 / 280 nm = 1. 4), found predominantly in pairs measuring about 20 × 33 nm, were isolated from BDMV-infected bean plants.

Freeze-fracture studies of chloroplasts of a control cell line, which lacks the viruslike particles, reveal two {{complementary}} faces {{similar to those}} observed in spinach chloroplasts. Replicas of freeze-fractured STV supergranal chloroplasts, however, show that one membrane face (B) contains widely spaced 80 Å particles and the other face (C) is essentially smooth. Isolated STV supergranal chloroplasts lack photosystem II activity as indicated by their inability to reduce dichlorophenolindophenol and are unable to reduce NADP with electrons from photosystem II or from ascorbate-reduced dichlorophenolindophenol. However, partial photosystem I activity is indicated by the reduction of methyl viologen with electrons from dichlorophenolindophenol-ascorbate. This supports the concept {{that there is not}} a direct correspondence between grana formation and photosystem II activity. Electrophoresis shows that all of the major polypeptide bands present in the STV supergranal chloroplasts are also present in the control chloroplast membranes.

40|$|For the {{maintenance}} of "killer" M 1 double-stranded RNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, more than 30 chromosomal genes are required. The requirement {{for some of these}} genes can be completely suppressed by a cytoplasmic element, [B] (for bypass). We have isolated a mutant unable to maintain [B] (mab) and found that it is allelic to MAK 10, one of the three chromosomal MAK genes required for {{the maintenance}} of L-A. The heat curing of [B] always coincided with the loss of L-A. To confirm that [B] is located on L-A, we purified viral particles containing either L-A or M 1 from strains with or without [B] activity and transfected these purified particles into a strain which did not have either L-A or M 1. The transfectants harboring L-A and M 1 from a [B] strain showed the [B] phenotype, but the transfectants with L-A and M 1 from a [B-o] strain did not show the [B] phenotype. Furthermore, the transfectants having L-A from a [B] strain and M 1 from a [B-o] strain also showed the [B] phenotype. Therefore, we concluded that [B] is a property of a variant of L-A. In the transfection experiment, we also proved that the superkiller phenotype of the [B] strain is a property of L-A and that L-A with [B] activity can maintain a higher copy number of M 1 regardless of the source of M 1 <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles.</b> These data suggest that MAK genes whose mutations are suppressed by [B] are concerned with the protection of M 1 (+) single-stranded RNA or the formation of M 1 <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> and that an L-A with more efficient production of M 1 <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> can completely dispense with the requirement for those MAK genes...|$|R

40|$|Like all viruses, HIV- 1 {{requires}} cellular host {{factors for}} replication. The mechanisms for production of progeny virions involving these host factors, however, {{are not fully}} understood. To better understand these mechanisms, we used a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genetic screen to identify mutant strains in which HIV- 1 Gag targeting to the plasma membrane was aberrant. Of the 917 mutants identified, we selected 14 mutants whose missing genes had single orthologous counterparts in human and tested them for Gag-induced <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> (VLP) release in yeast cells. We found that the Vps 18 and Mon 2 proteins were important for HIV- 1 Gag-induced VLP release in yeast. In eukaryote cells, these host proteins are highly conserved and function in protein trafficking. Depletion of hVps 18 or hMon 2 reduced the efficient production of infectious HIV- 1 virions in human cells. Our data suggest that these cellular factors {{play an important role}} in the efficient production of infectious HIV- 1 virion particles.

40|$|Ty 3 encodes {{structural}} {{proteins in}} its upstream {{open reading frame}} (GAG 3) and catalytic proteins in an overlapping open reading frame (POL 3). As {{is the case for}} retroviruses, high levels of structural protein versus catalytic proteins are synthesized and we show here that catalytic proteins are derived from a GAG 3 -POL 3 fusion polyprotein. To evaluate the relative contributions of structural and catalytic components of the Ty 3 particle, we perturbed the balance of these proteins by fusing the GAG 3 and POL 3 frames. This fusion Ty 3 was capable of complementing low levels of transposition of a donor Ty 3 which contained only cis-acting sequences required for transposition. Examination of extracts of cells expressing the GAG 3 -POL 3 fusion mutant showed that particle formation differed qualitatively and quantitatively from <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> formation by wild-type Ty 3. Suprisingly, expression of 238 codons of GAG 3, encoding only capsid protein, complemented transposition and particle formation defects of the fusion mutant, showing that the limiting deficiency was in capsid, and not in nucleocapsid, function. In addition, protein containing the capsid domain expressed alone accumulated in the same particulate fraction as viruslike particles, showing that it was sufficient for particle formation. The activity of the Ty 3 fusion mutant contrasts with the inviability of mutant retroviruses in which gag and pol frames were fused and argues that retrotransposons tolerate considerable variation in the nucleoprotein complexes that permit replication and integration...|$|E
40|$|The Ebola virus {{nucleoprotein}} (NP) is {{an essential}} component of the nucleocapsid, required for filovirus particle formation and replication. Together with virion protein 35 (VP 35) and VP 24, this gene product gives rise to the filamentous nucleocapsid within transfected cells. Ebola virus NP migrates aberrantly, with an apparent molecular mass of 115 kDa, although it is predicted to encode an ∼ 85 -kDa protein. In this report, we show that two domains of this protein determine this aberrant migration and that this region mediates its incorporation into virions. These regions, amino acids 439 to 492 and amino acids 589 to 739, alter the mobility of Ebola virus NP by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by 5 and 15 kDa, respectively, and confer similar effects on a heterologous protein, LacZ, in a position-independent fashion. Furthermore, when coexpressed with VP 40, VP 35, and VP 24, this region mediated incorporation of NP into released viruslike particles. When fused to chimeric paramyxovirus NPs derived from measles or respiratory syncytial virus, this domain directed these proteins into the <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle.</b> The COOH-terminal NP domain comprises a conserved highly acidic region of NP with predicted disorder, distinguishing Ebola virus NPs from paramyxovirus NPs.

Viral structural proteins are generated by posttranslational proteolytic processing of this polyprotein. We constructed recombinant vaccinia viruses which expressed the HAV polyprotein (rV-ORF) and the P 1 structural region (rV-P 1). rV-ORF-infected cell lysates demonstrated that the polyprotein was cleaved into immunoreactive 29 - and 33 -kDa proteins which comigrated with HAV capsid proteins VP 0 and VP 1. The rV-P 1 construct produced a 90 -kDa protein which showed no evidence of posttranslational processing. Solid-phase radioimmunoassays with human polyclonal anti-HAV sera and with murine or human neutralizing monoclonal anti-HAV antibodies recognized the rV-ORF-infected cell lysates. Sucrose density gradients of rV-ORF-infected cell lysates contained peaks of HAV antigen with sedimentation coefficients of approximately 70 S and 15 S, {{similar to those of}} HAV empty capsids and pentamers. Immune electron microscopy also demonstrated the presence of <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> in rV-ORF-infected cell lysates.

40|$|A bacteriophage-plasmid hybrid (phagemid) {{designated}} pCAK 1 {{was constructed}} by ligating 5 -kbp Escherichia coli plasmid pAK 102 (AprEmr) and the 6. 6 -kbp HaeIII-linearized replicative {{form of the}} CAK 1 <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> from Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 6444. Phagemid pCAK 1 (11. 6 kbp) replicated via the ColE 1 replication origin derived from pAK 102 in E. coli. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules complexed with protein in a manner which protected ssDNA from nucleases were recovered from the supernatant of E. coli DH 11 S transformants containing pCAK 1 {{in the absence of}} cell lysis. This suggests that the viral-strand DNA synthesis replication origin of CAK 1 and associated gene expression are functional in E. coli DH 11 S. The single-stranded form of pCAK 1 isolated from E. coli supernatant was transformed into E. coli DH 5 alpha' or DH 11 S by electroporation. Isolation of ampicillin-resistant E. coli transformants following transformation suggests that the complementary-strand DNA synthesis replication origin of CAK 1 is also functional in E. coli. The coat proteins associated with ssDNA of pCAK 1 demonstrated sensitivity to proteinase K and various solvents (i. e., phenol and chloroform), similar to the results obtained previously with CAK 1. Following phagemid construction in E. coli, pCAK 1 was transformed into C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and C. perfringens 13 by intact cell electroporation. Restriction enzyme analysis of pCAK 1 isolated from erythromycin-resistant transformants of both C. acetobutylicum and C. perfringens suggested that it was identical to that present in E. coli transformants...|$|E
40|$|Ty 3 is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{retrotransposon}} {{associated with}} tRNA genes. Two Ty 3 elements have been cloned and characterized. The complete nucleotide sequence for one element, Ty 3 - 2, was reported previously (L. J. Hansen, D. L. Chalker, and S. B. Sandmeyer, Mol. Cell. Biol. 9 : 5245 - 5256, 1988). However, this element {{is incapable of}} autonomous transposition. The complete DNA sequence of a transpositionally competent Ty 3 element, Ty 3 - 1, is presented here. Its sequence translates into two overlapping open reading frames, TYA 3 - 1 and TYB 3 - 1, which encode proteins with homology to the proteins specified by the retroviral gag and pol genes, respectively. Comparison of the Ty 3 - 1 nucleotide sequence to Ty 3 - 2 suggests that the TYB 3 - 2 open reading frame of Ty 3 - 2 is truncated by the deletion of a single nucleotide, which causes a frameshift mutation. Restoration of the reading frame with insertion of a single adenine by site-directed mutagenesis converted Ty 3 - 2 into a transpositionally active element, Ty 3 - 2 (+ A). Western blot analysis with antibodies made against synthetic peptides identified integrase (IN) proteins in <b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> preparations from cells expressing Ty 3 elements. Cells expressing Ty 3 - 1 and Ty 3 - 2 (+A) produce antibody-reactive proteins with approximate molecular masses of 61 and 58 kilodaltons (kDa), while cells expressing Ty 3 - 2 produce reactive proteins of approximately 52 and 49 kDa. Together, these data show that the 61 - or 58 -kDa protein, or both, provides the integrase function of Ty 3...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection as {{a risk factor for}} cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in immunocompetent individuals. Design: Hospital-based case-control study. Setting: Referral center for dermatologic diseases for central and southern Italy. Participants: Consecutive patients with histologically confirmed cutaneous SCC (n = 46) and control subjects (n = 84) chosen by frequency matching (age and sex) among patients admitted with unrelated diseases. Main Outcome Measure: Infection with epidermodysplasia verruciformis-related HPV types, blindly assessed by serologic testing (<b>viruslike</b> <b>particle</b> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Information was obtained on known potentially confounding risk factors (family history, history and signs of sun exposure, and pigmentary traits) and on history of HPV-related lesions and diseases, assessed by inter-view and examination by a dermatologist. Results: Positive serologic findings for HPV type 8 were associated with SCC (odds ratio, 3. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 - 7. 9) independently of other risk factors, whereas positive serologic findings for HPV type 15 were negatively associated with SCC (odds ratio, 0. 4; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 2 - 0. 9). Other variables significantly associated with the tumor were family history of skin cancer, professional or recreational sun exposure, light eye color, high number of solar keratoses and seborrheic keratoses on the body surface, and residency in radon-emitting buildings. Conclusions: Positive serologic findings for HPV type 8 are associated with SCC occurrence in immunocompetent individuals. Viral infection could act as a cofactor in the tumor development, along with genetic predisposition, solar radiation, and other environmental exposures. if confirmed, these findings could open new perspectives for treatment and prevention of SCC...|$|E
40|$|Noninfectious human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> containing chimeric envelope glycoproteins were expressed in mammalian cells by using inducible promoters. We engineered four expression vectors in which a synthetic oligomer encoding gp 120 residues 306 to 328 (amino acids YNKRKRIHIGP GRAFYTTKNIIG) from the V 3 loop of the MN viral isolate was inserted at various positions within the endogenous HIV- 1 LAI env gene. Expression studies revealed that insertion of the heterologous V 3 (MN) loop segment at two different locations within the conserved region 2 (C 2) of gp 120, either 173 or 242 residues away from the N terminus of the mature subunit, resulted in the secretion of fully assembled HIV-like particles containing chimeric LAI/MN envelope glycoproteins. Both V 3 loop epitopes were recognized by loop-specific neutralizing antibodies. However, insertion of the V 3 (MN) loop segment into other regions of gp 120 led {{to the production of}} envelope-deficient <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles.</b> Immunization with HIV-like particles containing chimeric envelope proteins induced specific antibody responses against both the autologous and heterologous V 3 loop epitopes, including cross-neutralizing antibodies against the HIV- 1 LAI and HIV- 1 MN isolates. This study, therefore, demonstrates the feasibility of genetically engineering optimized HIV-like particles capable of eliciting cross-neutralizing antibodies...|$|R
40|$|Bluetongue is {{a disease}} of ruminants. The {{etiologic}} agent is bluetongue virus (BTV), a gnat-transmitted member of the Orbivirus genus of the Reoviridae. The virus has a genome of 10 double-stranded RNA species L 1 to L 3, M 4 to M 6, S 7 to S 10). The L 2 and M 5 genes of BTV which encode the outer capsid proteins VP 2 and VP 5, respectively, were inserted into a recombinant baculovirus downstream of duplicated copies of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter. Insect cells coinfected with this virus plus a recombinant baculovirus expressing the two major core proteins VP 3 and VP 7 of BTV (T. J. French and P. Roy, J. Virol. 64 : 1530 - 1536, 1990) synthesized noninfectious, double-shelled, <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles.</b> When purified, these particles {{were found to have}} the same size and appearance as authentic BTV virions and exhibited high levels of hemagglutination activity. Antibodies raised to the expressed particles contained high titers of neutralizing activity against the homologous BTV serotype. The assembly of these bluetongue <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> after the simultaneous expression of four separate proteins is indicative of the potential of this technology for the production {{of a new generation of}} viral vaccines and for the study of complex, multiprotein structures...|$|R
40|$|Epifluorescence {{microscopy}} {{and transmission}} electron microscopy were applied to study virioplankton community in the Gulf of Trieste (northern Adriatic Sea). The total viral abundance was in a range between 2. 5 · 10 9 /L and 2. 9 · 10 10 /L and {{was positively correlated with}} trophic status of the environment. <b>Viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> were significantly correlated with bacterial abundance in all samples studied. Correlations with other physicochemical or biological parameters were not significant. The data suggest that, because of the substantial fraction of tailed viruses present (26 %), bacteriophages are {{an important component of the}} virioplankton community in the Gulf of Trieste. The abundance of <b>viruslike</b> <b>particles</b> in the seawater changed at hour intervals in a range from 1. 3 · 10 9 /L to 5. 1 · 10 9 /L. A significant fraction (71 %) of the bacterial isolates was inducible in vitro by mitomycin C, and a high occurrence (51 %) of lysogenic isolates with more than one phage morphotype present in the lysate was detected. The presence of lysogenic bacteria in the seawater was confirmed in situ with a mitomycin C induction experiment on the natural bacterial population. Results suggest that virioplankton is an abundant component of the microbial community in the Gulf of Trieste...|$|R
