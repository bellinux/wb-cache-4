Since <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present analysis we did not include <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> polar energy inputs from <b>the</b> magnetosphere, day-to-day <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> R-T growth rate are caused by day-to-day <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> neutral winds and densities and in ionospheric conductivities, which are associated with solar EUV/X-ray radiation (F 10.7 index) and atmospheric waves propagating from the lower atmosphere.|$|R

40|$|Profiles of the Mg II h and k {{emission}} features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{spectra of}} 21 late-type giant stars were obtained.

Mass loss processes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corona/outer atmosphere may be strong enough to affect the ratio of S/L: thus, rapid mass loss causes S/L to be less than unity. Rapid mass loss is likely caused by deposition of mechanical energy by stellar wind. <b>Variations</b> <b>in</b> S/L are a measure of <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rate of mechanical energy deposition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corona/outer atmosphere.

The hollow cavity inside the frontal horn of Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose.

5|$|Plant {{defenses}} can {{be classified}} generally as constitutive or induced.

Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize.
