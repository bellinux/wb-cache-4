40|$|The {{organizational}} {{concept of}} virtual Web organizations encompasses three organizational elements, namely the relatively stable virtual Web platform from which dynamic <b>virtual</b> <b>corporations</b> derive. <b>Virtual</b> <b>corporations</b> are interorganizational adhocracies that are configured temporally of independent companies {{in order to}} serve a particular purpose, such as joint R&D, product development, and production. The third element of this organizational construct is the management organization that initiates and maintains the virtual Web platform as well as forms and facilitates the operation of dynamic <b>virtual</b> <b>corporations.</b> Since the organizational concept of virtual Web organizations is hardly researched this chapter aims to provide readers with {{a better understanding of}} the organizational concept of virtual Web organizations and in particular of how such an organizational construct is managed. Based on empirical research the author developed a competence-based management model of virtual Web management organizations. This competence-based view of virtual Web management organizations presents an overview of a set of common sub-competencies underlying the three virtual Web management’s main competencies of initiating and maintaining virtual Web platforms and forming dynamic <b>virtual</b> <b>corporations.</b> Furthermore, the developed competence-based management model describes the content of the individual sub-competencies and it explains the purpose, the interrelateness and the temporal dimensions of the virtual Web management’s subcompetencies...|$|R
40|$|For {{about two}} decades {{academics}} and practitioners have {{been dealing with}} the emerging organisational paradigm of Virtual Organisations. From a inter-organisational perspective virtual organisations are temporary configurations of independent and dispersed companies facilitated by modern information and communication technologies. One particular form of these inter-organisational virtual organisations is the virtual web organisation. The organisational concept of virtual web organisations' encompasses three interrelated organisational elements, namely the virtual web platform, virtual web management and <b>virtual</b> <b>corporations.</b> The <b>virtual</b> web platform is a stable company network of pre-qualified independent partner firms that have generally agreed to co-operate in <b>virtual</b> <b>corporations.</b> The <b>virtual</b> web platform establishes a cooperative environment and prepares the conditions for the formation and operation of dynamic <b>virtual</b> <b>corporations.</b> The management of virtual web organisations facilitates the co-operative management of the virtual web platfom and facilitates the formation and operation of <b>virtual</b> <b>corporations.</b> Based on a literature review of virtual web organisations the researcher identified {{a need for a}} better understanding of how virtual web organisations are managed. Thus, this research work aims to investigate virtual web management organisations in order to reach a better understanding that contributes to academic knowledge in the field of inter-organisational virtual organisations as well as to assist practitioners with the management of virtual web organisations. From an interpretative philosophical standpoint the researcher developed a research design that addresses the need for more knowledge about virtual web management organisations. In order to view virtual web management organisations from the inside the researcher made use of resource-based theory and developed a resource-based analytical framework. A qualitative approach was adopted and five interview-based case studies were conducted as well as one participant observation case study. Based on individual within-case analysis the researcher conducted a number of cross-case analyses. Then, the research findings were compared with and discussed in the light of existing literature and knowledge in order to improve the validity of research findings of this research work. The research findings are summarised and presented in form of a resource-based framework of virtual web management organisations. The final resource-based framework of virtual web management organisations presents all sub-competencies commonly employed by virtual web management organisations in order to perform the task of initiating and maintaining virtual web platforms, and the formation of dynamic <b>virtual</b> <b>corporations.</b> Moreover, the resource-based framework of virtual web management organisations describes the content of each sub-competence; it explains the reason and purpose of the identified common sub-competencies; it describes the temporary employment and the interrelation between them; and it provides an overview of resources and capabilities underpinning each sub-competence separately...|$|R

[...] The niche that Chiron was focusing on was ophthalmology, which Mr. Penhoet said was [...] "big enough to be interesting, but small enough to service with 40 salespeople."

In this paper, two models are developed for production planning and scheduling in a <b>virtual</b> <b>corporation.</b> This <b>virtual</b> <b>corporation</b> is formed by a number of manufacturing companies (manufacturing centers) and assembly companies (assembly centers).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} the <b>virtual</b> <b>corporation</b> as {{understood}} in current management literature does not hold as a universal model throughout various industrial sectors. Complex product systems industries show peculiar features in terms of product characteristics, innovation dynamics and strategic and management options that may render the <b>virtual</b> <b>corporation</b> model inapplicable. The paper begins with a contrast between the simplistic neoclassical approach to {{the interpretation of the}} concept of knowledge and the more in-depth evolutionary view. The former understands knowledge as information and its production process and outcomes as easily decomposable. Based on this, advocates of <b>virtual</b> <b>corporation</b> claim the viability of outsourcing strategies based on simple economic factors. The evolutionary approach, on the other hand, considers knowledge as a system of processes deeply rooted in their contexts of production. Tacitness and non-decomposability of the knowledge production processes are highly emphasised in this view. In the light of this contrast and relying on a study of the aero engine industry we reinterpret the notion of <b>virtual</b> <b>corporation</b> showing its limits...|$|E

A similar unsold company, which has EBITDA at $10 Million could expect to be sold for $120 million. In some market segments, the companies do not have high EBITDA, and sometimes a multiple based on revenues (EV/sales) is used instead. To get a more accurate valuation, one should look at the multiples of more than one similar deals that are relatively recent since multiples do change from year to year.|$|R

Today's supply chains reflect this trend in that few firms control the entire supply chain from end to end.
