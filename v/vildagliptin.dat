50|$|In general, DPP-4 inhibitors are {{not very}} stable compounds. Therefore, many {{researchers}} focus on enhancing the stability for cyanopyrrolidines. The most widespread technique to improve chemical stability is to incorporate a steric bulk. The two cyanopyrrolidines that have been most pronounced, <b>vildagliptin</b> and saxagliptin, were created in this manner. K579 is a DPP-4 inhibitor discovered by researchers at Kyowa Hakko Kyogo. It had improved not only chemical stability but also a longer-lasting action. That long-lasting action was most likely due to slow dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex and an active oxide metabolite that undergoes enterohepatic circulation. The discovery of the active oxide {{was in fact a}} big breakthrough as it {{led to the development of}} <b>vildagliptin</b> and saxagliptin. One major problem in DPP-4 inhibitor stability is intramolecular cyclization. The precondition for the intramolecular cyclization is the conversion of the trans-rotamer, which is the DPP-4 binding rotamer (Figure 5). Thus, preventing this conversion will increase stability. This prevention was successful when incorporating an amide group into a ring, creating a compound that kept the DPP-4 inhibitory activity that, did not undergo the intramolecular cyclization and was even more selective over different DPP enzymes. It has also been reported that a cyanoazetidine in the P1 position and a β-amino acid in the P2 position increased stability.|$|E

50|$|Substrate-like inhibitors (Figure 4) {{are more}} common than the non-substrate-likes.

Aims: To evaluate the role of <b>vildagliptin</b> in the management of type 2 diabetes. Evidence review: Clear evidence shows that <b>vildagliptin</b> improves glycemic control (measured by glycosylated hemoglobin and blood glucose levels) more than placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes, either as monotherapy or in combination with metformin. <b>Vildagliptin</b> is as effective as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, and slightly less effective than metformin, although better tolerated. Further glycemic control is achieved when adding <b>vildagliptin</b> to metformin, pioglitazone, or glimepride. There is evidence that <b>vildagliptin</b> improves beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity. <b>Vildagliptin</b> {{does not appear to be}} associated with weight gain or with a higher risk of hypoglycemia than placebo or other commonly used oral antidiabetic agents. Economic evidence is currently lacking. Place in therapy: <b>Vildagliptin</b> improves glycemic control with little if any weight gain or hypoglycemia in adult patients with type 2 diabetes when given alone or in combination with metformin, thiazolidinediones, or sulfonylureas.

40|$|<b>Vildagliptin</b> is an oral {{incretin}} enhancer {{that acts}} to increase active {{levels of the}} incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) by inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 enzyme responsible for the rapid deactivation of GLP- 1 in vivo. This activity results in improved glucose-dependent functioning of pancreatic islet beta and alpha cells, addressing two central deficits in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). <b>Vildagliptin</b> treatment improves beta-cell sensitivity to glucose, producing increased insulin secretory rate relative to glucose in both postprandial and fasting states. Improved alpha-cell function is shown as restoration of appropriate glucose-related suppression of glucagon and, therefore, reduced endogenous glucose production during both postprandial and fasting periods. There is evidence that long-term <b>vildagliptin</b> treatment may slow underlying deterioration of beta-cell function in T 2 DM.

Patients: Drug-naïve patients with T 2 DM and baseline HbA 1 c </= 7. 5 % Intervention: <b>Vildagliptin</b> (100 mg qd) or placebo Primary Outcome Measure(s) : 1) Change in plasma glucagon levels during hypoglycemic (2. 5 mM glucose) clamp. 2) Incremental (Delta) glucagon area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 60 min (AUC 0 - 60 min) during standard meal test. Before the study, {{it was hypothesized that}} <b>vildagliptin</b> would suppress glucagon secretion during meal tests and enhance the glucagon response to hypoglycemia. Results: The mean change in glucagon during hypoglycemic clamp was 46. 7 +/- 6. 9 ng/liter with <b>vildagliptin</b> treatment and 33. 9 +/- 6. 7 ng/liter with placebo; the between-treatment difference was 12. 8 +/- 7. 0 ng/liter (P= 0. 039), representing a 38 % increase with <b>vildagliptin.</b> In contrast, the mean glucagon DeltaAUC 0 - 60 min during meal test with <b>vildagliptin</b> was 512 +/- 163 ng/liter. min vs 861 +/- 130 ng/liter. min with placebo; the between-treatment difference was - 349 +/- 158 ng/liter. min (P= 0. 019), representing a 41 % decrease with <b>vildagliptin.</b> Conclusions: <b>Vildagliptin</b> enhances alpha-cell responsiveness to both the suppressive effects of hyperglycemia and the stimulatory effects of hypoglycemia. These effects likely contribute to the efficacy of <b>vildagliptin</b> to improve glycemic control as well as to its low hypoglycemic potential...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Pharmacological {{inhibition}} {{with the}} dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitor <b>vildagliptin</b> prolongs {{the action of}} endogenously secreted incretin hormones leading to improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). We undertook a double-blinded, randomized-order, crossover study to examine the <b>vildagliptin</b> mechanisms of action on islet function and glucose utilization. Research Design and Methods: Participants with T 2 DM (n 16) who had a baseline hemoglobin A 1 c of 7. 1 0. 2 % completed a crossover study with 6 wk of treatment with <b>vildagliptin</b> and 6 wk with placebo. At the completion of each arm, participants had a study of postprandial metabolism and a two-step glucose clamp performed at 20 and 80 mU/minm 2 insulin infusions. Results: <b>Vildagliptin</b> increased postprandial glucagon-like peptide- 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide by 3 - and 2 -fold, respectively, reduced fasting plasma glucose and postprandial plasma glucose by 1. 3 0. 3 mmol/liter and 1. 6 0. 3 mmol/liter (both P 0. 01), and improved glucose responsiveness of insulin secretion by 50 % (P 0. 01). <b>Vildagliptin</b> lowered postprandial glucagon by 16 %(P 0. 01). Examined by glucose clamp, insulin sensitivity and glucose clearance improved after <b>vildagliptin</b> (P 0. 01). Conclusions: <b>Vildagliptin</b> improves islet function in T 2 DM and improves glucose metabolism in peripheral tissue...|$|E
40|$|Chantal Mathieu, Evy DegrandeDepartment of Endocrinology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, BelgiumAbstract: <b>Vildagliptin</b> {{is a new}} oral {{antidiabetic}} agent that enhances pancreatic islet cell responsiveness to glucose. An extensive clinical program involving approximately 22, 000 patients and 7000 patient-years of exposure to <b>vildagliptin</b> {{has shown that the}} agent is well tolerated and efficacious in improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Monotherapy trials have shown that significant HbA 1 c lowering is accompanied by body weight-neutral and lipid-neutral effects, low risk of edema, and low risk of hypoglycemia. These characteristics make <b>vildagliptin</b> a favorable partner for combination therapy. Studies of <b>vildagliptin</b> as an add-on to metformin have shown significant improvements in glycemic control (comparable to that of thiazolidinedione add-on), with the combination being well tolerated and associated with low risks for hypoglycemia and adverse effects on weight or lipid levels. Good tolerability and clinically relevant improvements in glycemic control have also been observed with <b>vildagliptin</b> as an add-on treatment to sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, or insulin treatment or in initial combination treatment with pioglitazone. Improved &beta;-cell function and glycemic control have been shown with <b>vildagliptin</b> in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance and in T 2 DM patients with mild hyperglycemia, with some evidence in the latter suggesting the potential for modifying disease course.

40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>vildagliptin</b> vs. glimepiride as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a 52 -week interim analysis of a large, randomized, double-blind, multicentre study. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of <b>vildagliptin</b> vs. glimepiride in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1 c)) reduction at week 52. METHODS: Patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy (HbA(1 c) 6. 5 - 8. 5 %) and receiving a stable dose of metformin (mean dose 1898 mg/day; mean duration of use 36 months) were randomized 1 : 1 to receive <b>vildagliptin</b> (50 mg twice daily, n = 1396) or glimepiride (titrated up to 6 mg/day; mean dose 4. 5 mg/day, n = 1393). RESULTS: Non-inferiority of <b>vildagliptin</b> was demonstrated (97. 5 % confidence interval 0. 02 %, 0. 16 %) with a mean (SE) change from baseline HbA(1 c) (7. 3 % in both groups) to week 52 endpoint of - 0. 44 % (0. 02 %) with <b>vildagliptin</b> and - 0. 53 % (0. 02 %) with glimepiride. Although a similar proportion of patients reached a target HbA(1 c) level of < 7 % with <b>vildagliptin</b> and glimepiride (54. 1 and 55. 5 %, respectively), {{a greater proportion of}} patients reached this target without hypoglycaemia in the <b>vildagliptin</b> group (50. 9 vs. 44. 3 %; p < 0. 01). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) reductions were comparable between groups (mean [SE] - 1. 01 [0. 06] mmol/l and - 1. 14 [0. 06] mmol/l respectively). <b>Vildagliptin</b> significantly reduced body weight relative to glimepiride (mean [SE] change from baseline - 0. 23 [0. 11] kg; between-group difference - 1. 79 kg; p < 0. 001) and resulted in a 10 -fold lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than glimepiride (1. 7 vs. 16. 2 % of patients presenting at least one hypoglycaemic event; 39 vs. 554 hypoglycaemic events, p < 0. 01). No severe hypoglycaemia occurred with <b>vildagliptin</b> compared with 10 episodes with glimepiride (p < 0. 01), and no patient in the <b>vildagliptin</b> group discontinued because of hypoglycaemia compared with 11 patients in the glimepiride group. The incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and adjudicated cardiovascular events was 74. 5, 7. 1 and 0. 9 %, respectively, in patients receiving <b>vildagliptin,</b> and 81. 1, 9. 5 and 1. 6 %, respectively, in patients receiving glimepiride. CONCLUSIONS: When metformin alone fails to maintain sufficient glycaemic control, the addition of <b>vildagliptin</b> provides comparable efficacy to that of glimepiride after 52 weeks and displays a favourable AE profile, with no weight gain and a significant reduction in hypoglycaemia compared with glimepiride...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} the dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitor, <b>vildagliptin,</b> as monotherapy have been widely confirmed in {{a large body of}} clinical studies of up to 2 years’ duration in various populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This paper reviews the data supporting the use of <b>vildagliptin</b> in monotherapy. Consideration based on baseline glycated hemoglobin levels and age is given to patient segments where metformin is not appropriate. In addition, although prediabetes is not an indication, this manuscript briefly reviews some of the existing data showing that the mechanisms at work in diabetic populations are active in patients currently classified as prediabetic, with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose. Finally, the rationale for <b>vildagliptin</b> dosing frequency in monotherapy is discussed. In summary, this review aims to define where in community practice the use of <b>vildagliptin</b> as monotherapy is most desirable, focusing on segments of the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus that might receive the greatest benefit from <b>vildagliptin</b> in the management of their disease...|$|E
