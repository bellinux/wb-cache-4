40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} (RESs), such as {{wind and solar}} generations, equip {{inverters}} to connect to the microgrids. These inverters {{do not have any}} rotating mass, thus lowering the overall system inertia. This low system inertia issue could affect the microgrid stability and resiliency in the situation of uncertainties. Today’s microgrids will become unstable if the capacity of RESs become larger and larger, leading to the weakening of microgrid stability and resilience. This paper addresses a new concept of a microgrid control incorporating a <b>virtual</b> <b>inertia</b> system based on the model predictive control (MPC) to emulate <b>virtual</b> <b>inertia</b> into the microgrid control loop, thus stabilizing microgrid frequency during high penetration of RESs. The additional controller of <b>virtual</b> <b>inertia</b> is applied to the microgrid, employing MPC with <b>virtual</b> <b>inertia</b> response. System modeling and simulations are carried out using MATLAB/Simulink® software. The simulation results confirm the superior robustness and frequency stabilization effect of the proposed MPC-based <b>virtual</b> <b>inertia</b> control in comparison to the fuzzy logic system and conventional <b>virtual</b> <b>inertia</b> control in a system with high integration of RESs.

RES units today represent a major share of the generation, and the traditional approach of integrating them as grid following units can lead to frequency instability.

Under thermal-hydraulic conditions of ANS coolant channel, micro-fine melt particles are expected. Heat transfer between melt particle and coolant, which affects particle breakup, was studied.

Our results indicate that fluctuations of fields different from the main field decelerate significantly its motion at high energies. The formalism described here is applicable {{to the majority of}} inflationary models. A smallness of temperature fluctuation of cosmic relic background could be explained within this framework. We show also that the quantum fluctuations suppress false vacuum decay in first-order phase transitions at high energies. 1. Massive fields and inflation The first models of inflation solved many conceptual problems. The price was, in general, very small coupling constants. For example, {{one of the most promising}} model, chaotic inflation [1], with the potential of the form λϕ 4 gives λ ∼ 10 − 13 to be compatible with large-scale temperature fluctuations. To overcome this difficulty, it seems necessary to take a second field into consideration with a specific coupling to the first one, as was done in many modern inflationary scenarios. For example, hybrid inflation [2] deals with two coupled scalar fields with connected classical equations of motion. There are models which take into consideration an interaction of a classical field with particles, which are produced by the main field during a classical motion [3, 4, 5]. Here we consider only a pure quantum effect of interaction of the main field with virtual particles of some other sort. Temperature effects are not considered here. It is known that a cloud of <b>virtual</b> particles, having <b>inertia,</b> is able to decelerate the motion of the classical field, which produces this virtual cloud. This phenomena is well known in solid state physics (polaron effect, see e. g. [6, 7]).

We show that the widely suggested <b>virtual</b> <b>inertia</b> solution suffers from unbounded noise amplification (infinite H_ 2 norm) when measurement noise is considered. This suggests that <b>virtual</b> <b>inertia</b> could potentially further degrade the grid performance once broadly deployed. This motivates the proposed solution in this paper that overcomes the limitations of <b>virtual</b> <b>inertia</b> controllers while sharing the same advantages of traditional droop control. In particular, our iDroop controllers are decentralized, rebalance supply and demand, and provide power sharing. Furthermore, our solution can improve the dynamic performance without affecting the steady state solution.

40|$|A {{main task}} of {{industrial}} designers is the shaping and transformations of ideas or fuzzy notions into abstract or materialized equivalents. These sketches, models or other representations {{can be described}} as the sum of form and shape aspects, aesthetics, intuitive qualities as well as technical and sustainable functionalities. The designer must understand the elements involved in this synthesis of form giving and design. Successful designers compose these characteristics carefully and join them together to form and shape artefacts into a harmonious and balanced whole, while simultaneously manoeuvring within implicit and explicit mechanical and functional aspects. With the emergence of 3 D computational design, the industrial design process shifted from traditional analogue physical representations of ideas or artefacts to digital virtual realities. This shift is creating pre-dominance of digital design over the idiosyncrasies of analogue craftsmanship of the designer. Loss of control, immediacy, manual dexterity and skills due to constraint in electronic interfaces (keyboard-mouse-monitor) and programmer's directions, gave way to alienation of the physical material world. With every new generation of design students, the widening gap is transforming intuitive design qualities and skills into <b>virtual</b> data processing <b>inertia.</b> We follow two paths in our attempt to bridge this gap. The first is a set of experiments that aim to measure the effectiveness and other qualities of various shaping techniques. Knowledge about learning curves, quality of the design results and the focus of particular methods enables decisions about ‘the right’ curriculum for Design students. The second path is the creation of a hybrid design tool where designers are engaged and in which the intuitive and imaginative skills are stimulated, explored and triggered. This paper explores the distinctions between the analogue and digital representation tools, explain our laboratory experiments, testing results, educational embedding and creative opportunities that emerge from hybrid design tools. For our testing experiments, we used seven (7) haptic representational configurations and set-ups, and involved over 150 test subjects per experiment to map results.

30|$|Online {{optimization}} is used {{to calculate}} the inertial response and the damping power, which increases the computational burden of the digital signal processor (DSP). However, for MG applications, particularly considering the requirement for autonomous operation, the VSG is desired to operate using the voltage control method (VCM) as it can provide direct voltage and frequency support for the loads. Based on this fact, the bang-bang control strategy of alternating <b>virtual</b> <b>inertia</b> for the VSG operating with VCM has been proposed to suppress frequency and power oscillations effectively [16, 17]. During each cycle of oscillations, the value of inertia is switched between a big moment of inertia and a small one for four times. Each switching may cause power oscillations. On the other hand, applying a large constant <b>virtual</b> <b>inertia</b> for bang-bang control will result in a sluggish response. Besides, this method also does not explore the use of adaptive virtual damping that acts during the oscillation following a power disturbance.
