5|$|<b>Vinegar</b> is {{typically}} 4–18% acetic acid by mass. <b>Vinegar</b> is used directly as a condiment, {{and in the}} pickling of vegetables and other foods. Table <b>vinegar</b> {{tends to be more}} diluted (4% to 8% acetic acid), while commercial food pickling employs solutions that are more concentrated. The proportion of acetic acid used worldwide as <b>vinegar</b> is not as large as commercial uses, but is by far the oldest and best-known application.|$|E
5|$|Nowadays, most <b>vinegar</b> {{is made in}} {{submerged}} tank culture, {{first described}} in 1949 by Otto Hromatka and Heinrich Ebner. In this method, alcohol is fermented to <b>vinegar</b> in a continuously stirred tank, and oxygen is supplied by bubbling air through the solution. Using modern applications of this method, <b>vinegar</b> of 15% acetic acid can be prepared in only 24 hours in batch process, even 20% in 60-hour fed-batch process.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, {{it is sometimes}} called glacial acetic acid. <b>Vinegar</b> is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid {{the main component of}} <b>vinegar</b> apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household <b>vinegar,</b> it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFifty-eight {{brands of}} balsamic <b>vinegars</b> were {{analyzed}} for lead concentrations and isotopic compositions ((204) Pb, (206) Pb, (207) Pb, and (208) Pb) {{to test the}} findings of a previous study indicating relatively high levels of lead contamination in some of those <b>vinegars</b> more than two thirds (70 %) of them exceeded California's State Maximum Level (34 mu g/L) based on consumption rates >= 0. 5 mu g Pb per day. The Lead isotopic fingerprints of all those <b>vinegars</b> with high lead concentrations were then found to be primarily anthropogenic. This isotopic analysis unquestionably reveals multiple contamination sources including atmospheric pollutant Pb and an unidentified contamination source, likely occurring after grape harvest. Organically grown grape <b>vinegars</b> display the same Pb content and isotopic signatures as other <b>vinegars.</b> This implies that pesticides might not be a significant source of pollutant Pb in <b>vinegars.</b> A significant post-harvest contamination would be inherited from chemicals added during production and/or material used during transport, processing or storage of these <b>vinegars.</b> This is consistent with the highest Pb levels being found in aged <b>vinegars</b> (112 +/- 112 mu g/L) in contrast to other <b>vinegars</b> (41. 6 +/- 28. 9 mu g/L) suggesting contamination during storage. It is, therefore, projected that lead levels in most <b>vinegars,</b> especially aged balsamic and wine <b>vinegars,</b> will decrease with improvements in their manufacture and storage processes consequential to recent concerns of elevated levels of lead in some <b>vinegars.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier B.

5|$|In the 16th-century German alchemist Andreas Libavius {{described}} {{the production of}} acetone from the dry distillation of lead acetate, ketonic decarboxylation. The presence of water in <b>vinegar</b> has such {{a profound effect on}} acetic acid's properties that for centuries chemists believed that glacial acetic acid and the acid found in <b>vinegar</b> were two different substances. French chemist Pierre Adet proved them identical.|$|E
5|$|The first {{batches of}} <b>vinegar</b> {{produced}} by fermentation probably followed {{errors in the}} winemaking process. If must is fermented at too high a temperature, acetobacter will overwhelm the yeast naturally occurring on the grapes. As the demand for <b>vinegar</b> for culinary, medical, and sanitary purposes increased, vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce <b>vinegar</b> in the hot summer months before the grapes were ripe and ready for processing into wine. This method was slow, however, and not always successful, as the vintners {{did not understand the}} process.|$|E
5|$|This {{ability of}} Clostridium to metabolize sugars directly, or to produce acetic acid from less costly inputs, {{suggests}} that these bacteria could produce acetic acid more efficiently than ethanol-oxidizers like Acetobacter. However, Clostridium bacteria are less acid-tolerant than Acetobacter. Even the most acid-tolerant Clostridium strains can produce <b>vinegar</b> in concentrations {{of only a few}} per cent, compared to Acetobacter strains that can produce <b>vinegar</b> in concentrations up to 20%. At present, it remains more cost-effective to produce <b>vinegar</b> using Acetobacter, rather than using Clostridium and concentrating it. As a result, although acetogenic bacteria have been known since 1940, their industrial use is confined to a few niche applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{biological}} action of bamboo/wood <b>vinegars</b> collected at different temperatures from the exit of chimney of earthen kiln was evaluated by Salmonella mutagenesis assay, {{as a safety}} evaluation (Ames test) and reverse mutation assay (antimutagenic activity). The compounds of the <b>vinegars</b> were analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy analysis. The acid, phenol and ketone compounds of bamboo <b>vinegars</b> were 10. 65 – 20. 09 %, 57. 87 – 65. 98 % and 10. 13 – 18. 76 %, and the compounds of wood <b>vinegars</b> were 4. 27 – 14. 51 %, 50. 23 – 65. 03 % and 12. 93 – 25. 26 %, respectively. The vinegars’ safety showed that neither cytotoxicity nor mutagenicity toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 with S 9 mix (an external metabolic activation system) at the diluting percent content of <b>vinegars</b> were lower than 20. 00 % or less, and without the S 9 mix was at 33. 33 % or less. The <b>vinegars</b> at a diluting percent content below 20. 00 % expressed a dose–dependent inhibitory effect against both 4 –nitroquinoline–N–oxide (NQNO), a direct mutagen, and the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), an indirect mutagen which requires metabolic activation, in Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. The inhibition of the <b>vinegars</b> against NQNO and AFB 1 toward TA 100 was better than those toward TA 98. In addition, the main percent of phenol and ketone compounds in the <b>vinegars</b> showed cytotoxicity/mutagenicity and an antimutagenic effect against the strains mentioned above, which may partially account for the {{biological action}} of bamboo/wood <b>vinegars...</b>|$|R
5000|$|... al Pedro Ximénez: Wines {{produced}} from the Pedro Ximénez grape are usually sweet, often very sweet, and consequently the <b>vinegars</b> {{produced from}} these wines are usually sweeter than other sherry <b>vinegars</b> {{or at the}} very least have a sweet raisin nose.

30|$|Wood <b>vinegars</b> {{prepared}} {{from various}} sources of wood and wood-based composites have been tested for their effectiveness against decay fungi and insects [5 – 10]. For example, <b>vinegars</b> obtained from wood-based composites {{have been shown to}} have inhibitory effects against decay fungi [8]. Bedtmutha et al. [5] reported the insecticidal activity of wood <b>vinegars</b> produced at 400 – 600  °C against Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say). Hossain et al. [10] tested the insecticidal activity of wood <b>vinegars</b> derived from fast pyrolysis of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose at 450 and 550  °C, and found that they were toxic at both temperatures against L. decemlineata, Trichoplusia ni, and Acyrthosiphon pisum.|$|R
30|$|Recently, Theapparat et al. [3] {{reported}} that wood <b>vinegars</b> exhibited antifungal activity against two white-rot fungi, a brown-rot fungus and a sapstain fungus. The <b>vinegars</b> {{were made from}} Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Azadirachta indica, Hevea brasiliensis (rubberwood), and Dendrocalamus asper (bamboo). The largest component in the five wood <b>vinegars</b> that exhibited high fungicidal activities, especially in those made from rubberwood and bamboo, was total phenol. A previous study suggested that phenolic compounds derived from lignocellulosic biomass might be primarily responsible for the antifungal performance of wood <b>vinegars</b> [11]. Tar oil from macadamia nut shells was employed in vitro to protect wood against various wood-decaying fungi and wood-attacking termites [12].|$|R
30|$|In this study, three wood <b>vinegars</b> {{obtained}} from oil palm trunk were examined for their antifungal activity against a brown-rot fungus, Fomitopsis palustris and a white-rot fungus, Trametes versicolor.

5|$|<b>Vinegar</b> {{was known}} early in civilization {{as the natural}} result of {{exposure}} of beer and wine to air, because acetic acid-producing bacteria are present globally. The use of acetic acid in alchemy extends into the 3rd century BC, when the Greek philosopher Theophrastus described how <b>vinegar</b> acted on metals to produce pigments useful in art, including white lead (lead carbonate) and verdigris, a green mixture of copper salts including copper(II) acetate. Ancient Romans boiled soured wine to produce a highly sweet syrup called sapa. Sapa that was produced in lead pots was rich in lead acetate, a sweet substance also called sugar of lead or sugar of Saturn, which contributed to lead poisoning among the Roman aristocracy.|$|E
