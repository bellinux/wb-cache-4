In this study, penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and dexamethasone (Dex) were successfully immobilized via electropolymerization within polypyrrole membranes coated {{on the surface of}} Ti, which is widely used in orthopedic applications. In vitro results showed that greater numbers of osteoblasts adhered on these polymer-coated substrates than on currently-used unmodified Ti. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to monitor and compare the reaction effectiveness and the yield of electropolymerization. Polypyrrole membranes conjugated with P/S and Dex, and then coated with PLGA, all possessed nanometer scale roughness, as analyzed by atomic force microscopy. In summary, this study demonstrated that drugs incorporated within electroactive polypyrrole membranes, whose release was controlled by applying <b>voltages,</b> <b>supported</b> osteoblast adhesion and could potentially fight bacterial infection...|$|R

40|$|Ancillary {{services}} for distributed generation (DG) systems become a challenging issue to smartly integrate renewable-energy sources into the grid. Voltage control {{is one of}} these ancillary services which can ride through and support the voltage under grid faults. Grid codes fromthe transmission system operators describe the behavior of the energy source, regulating voltage limits and reactive power injection to remain connected and support the grid under fault. On the basis that different kinds of voltage sags require different <b>voltage</b> <b>support</b> strategies, a flexible control scheme for three-phase grid-connected inverters is proposed. In three-phase balanced voltage sags, the inverter should inject reactive power in order to raise the voltage in all phases. In one- or two-phase faults, the main concern of the DG inverter is to equalize voltages by reducing the negative symmetric sequence and clear the phase jump. Due to system limitations, a balance between these two extreme policies is mandatory. Thus, over- and undervoltage can be avoided, and the proposed control scheme prevents disconnection while achieving the desired <b>voltage</b> <b>support</b> service. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of a control algorithm for reference current generation that provides flexible <b>voltage</b> <b>support</b> under grid faults. Two different voltage sags have been experimentally tested to illustrate the behavior of the proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>support</b> control scheme. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} distributed photovoltaic generation in low voltage distribution networks {{has led to}} higher risk of overvoltage. This has made it necessary to utilize the capability of the inverter in the photovoltaic systems to consume reactive power as <b>voltage</b> <b>support.</b> Different strategies have been developed {{in accordance with the}} <b>voltage</b> <b>support</b> capability of the inverter. The purpose of this thesis is to study different <b>voltage</b> <b>support</b> strategies used by photovoltaic system inverters and compare their ability to mitigate the overvoltage generated by high PV penetration in the LV distribution network. Reactive power efforts and losses in the network for the different inverter strategies are examined to find which is the most effective. How the different strategies affect the PV capacity of the network will also be emphasized during the evaluation of the effectiveness of the strategies. The IEEE European Low Voltage Test Feeder network is modelled in Simulink using the program GridBuilder, which is made by the author for this thesis. Photovoltaic generation is introduced to the loads in the network model with these <b>voltage</b> <b>support</b> strategies: 	Strategy 1 : Constant power factor. 	Strategy 2 : Power factor dependent on PV power production. 	Strategy 3 : Reactive power consumption dependent on the voltage. 	Strategy 4 : Power curtailment. Simulations of one day steady state operation with each strategy, using load profiles from IEEE for the loads and irradiance data from Oslo on the 4. mai 2016 for the PV systems, were performed. From the results it was found that strategy 1 and 2 utilized the most of the <b>voltage</b> <b>support</b> available through the photovoltaic systems in the grid.

Among all of the aspects for converter control, the inner current loop for grid-connected converters characterizes the system performance considerably.
