5|$|The common {{features}} of passive solar architecture are orientation {{relative to the}} Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House {{is a classic example}} of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.|$|E

In order to grasp the underground resistance distribution of Baishan Coalmine and the stability, the {{stability of}} the mine <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> is analyzed, according to the actual situation of the mine <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> and on the basis of the resistance determination of the system.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{displacement}} ventilation has been increasingly used in Scandinavia and Western Europe to improve indoor air quality and to save energy. By using a detailed computer simulation method, this study compared the energy consumption of a displacement <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> {{with that of a}} mixing <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> for three types of U. S. buildings: a small office, a classroom and an industrial workshop. The investigation covers five U. S. climatic regions and three different building zones. The study showed that a displacement <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> might use more fan energy and less chiller and boiler energy than a mixing <b>ventilation</b> <b>system.</b> The total energy consumption is slightly less with a displacement <b>ventilation</b> <b>system.</b> The displacement <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> requires a larger air-handling unit and a smaller chiller than the mixing <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> does. The first costs are lower for displacement <b>ventilation</b> if the <b>system</b> is applied in the core region of a building. In the perimeter zones, the displacement <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> needs a separate heating system, and the first costs are slightly higher. by ShiPing Hu. Thesis (S. M.)

5|$|The line {{begins at}} the four-tracked Jay Street–MetroTech station, where the IND Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue lines {{interchange}} and continue as the Culver and Fulton Street lines respectively. Running under Smith Street south of the station, the Culver tracks split into local and express tracks, with the two express tracks ramping down to the lower level of Bergen Street, while the local tracks merge with the IND Crosstown Line tracks from Hoyt-Schermerhorn Street before entering the upper level. Between Jay Street and Bergen Street, the line passes under both the IRT Eastern Parkway Line and the Fulton Line tracks curving east into Hoyt-Schermerhorn Street, requiring a deeper tunnel and extensive <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} tunnel water and frost tight, {{the walls were}} covered with {{polyethylene}} mats. Because they are highly flammable, they were then covered in a layer of gunite. Also installed were fire water pipes and <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> to remove smoke. To sound-insulate the tunnel and avoid vibrations spreading to nearby housing, the entire tunnel was covered in a layer of rock wool. By December 2010, the ballast had been laid, and in January 2011 laying of the tracks and ties started. The work to build the tracks and overhead wires has been contracted to Baneservice. The contract for the electro-technical installations was awarded to YIT Building Systems for NOK120 million. As of 2006, the whole section from Lysaker to Sandvika was estimated to cost NOK2.7 billion.|$|E

After that group left the building in 2006, Willamette spent $4.6 million ($2 million more than originally planned) to remodel the old library building over a year's time and convert it into the Oregon Civic Justice Center as part of the College of Law. The remodeling project began in the summer of 2007 and included removing a swimming pool structure that had been added to the south of the building, while also adding a new entrance to the former library on the same side as where the pool was located. Renovations also removed a mezzanine that the YWCA had added to the upper portion of the main floor.
