Respondents found multimedia content, such as images of police impropriety, is an effective tool for reader motivation. This was particularly important to respondents in areas where Internet connectivity is disrupted and risk of device confiscation is high. In this case, users wanted to store images in an encrypted manner and queue them for posting when connectivity is available.|$|R

Email: jborsack@isri. unlv. edu 1 Background The Information Science Research Institute originated out of the Department of Energy's (DOE) need to effectively capture huge amounts of documentation that relate to the Licensing Support System (LSS). The LSS is a planned system that will capture and track documents pertaining to the site licensing proceedings of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Eventually, this system will need to provide access to millions of documents. Many, if not most of the documents to be captured, will be obtained in their hard copy form. Therefore, a prototype conversion process was studied on a small representative subset to determine the capture methodology. This study produced t [...] ...|$|R

The core of the algorithm is based on building a graph representation of the contoured image, which occupies less storage space than produced by raster compression techniques. Different advanced applications of the mathematical model are discussed: recognition of handwritten characters and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> handwritten <b>text</b> and signatures for authentification purposes. Reducing the storage requirements due to the efficient mathematical model results in faster retrieval and processing times. The experimental outcomes in compression of contoured images and recognition of handwritten numerals are given. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe formal <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> {{mathematical}} <b>texts</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} interesting applications for computer systems. In fact, we argue that the expert language of mathematics is the natural choice for achieving efficient mathematician–machine interaction. Our empirical approach, the analysis of carefully authored textbook proofs, forces us {{to focus on the}} language and the reasoning pattern that mathematician use when presenting proofs to colleagues and students. Enabling a machine to understand and follow such language and argumentation is seen to be the key to usable and acceptable math assistant systems. In this paper, we first perform an analysis of three textbook proofs by hand; we then describe a computational framework that aims at mechanising such an analysis. The resulting proof-of-concept implementation is capable of processing simple textbook proofs and constitutes promising steps towards a natural mathematician–machine interface for proof development and verification...|$|R

Our investigations in this domain were brought to practice in the last version of the System for Automated Deduction (SAD). The system exploits a formal language to represent mathematical knowledge in a "natural" form and a sequential first-order formalism to prove statements {{in the frame of}} a self-contained mathematical text. In the paper, we give an overview of the architecture of SAD and its verification tools. In order to demonstrate the work of SAD, a sample verification session is examined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The MathNat 1 project aims {{at being}} a first step towards {{automatic}} formalisation and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> textbook mathematical <b>text.</b> First, we develop a controlled language for mathematics (CLM) which is a precisely defined subset of English with restricted grammar and dictionary. To make CLM natural and expressive, we support some complex linguistic features such as anaphoric pronouns and references, rephrasing of a sentence in multiple ways producing canonical forms and the proper handling of distributive and collective readings. Second, we automatically translate CLM into a system independent formal language (MathAbs), with a hope to make MathNat accessible to any proof checking system. Currently, we translate MathAbs into equivalent first order formulas for verification. In this paper, we give an overview of MathNat, describe the linguistic features of CLM, demonstrate its expressive power and validate our work with a few examples...|$|R
40|$|We propose an HMM-based text-indicated writer {{verification}} method, {{which is}} based on a challenge and response type of authentication process. In this method, a different text including ordinary characters is used on every occasion <b>of</b> <b>verification.</b> This <b>text</b> can be selected automatically by the verification system so as to reflect a specific writer's personal features. The specific writer is accepted only when the same text as indicated by the verification system is inputted, and the system can verify the writer's personal features from the inputted text. Moreover, the characters used in the verification process can be different from those in the enrollment process. This method makes it more difficult to get away with forged handwriting than the previous methods using only signatures. In the proposed method, the characteristics <b>of</b> the indicated <b>text</b> and each writer's personal features are both represented by using Hidden Markov Models. 1...|$|R

After more than five years of intensive negotiations, we have come to an agreement that will support jobs, drive sustainable growth, foster inclusive development, and promote innovation across the Asia-Pacific region. Most importantly, the agreement achieves the goal we set forth of an ambitious, comprehensive, high standard and balanced agreement that will benefit our nation’s citizens. TPP brings higher standards to nearly 40 percent of the global economy. In addition to liberalizing trade and investment between us, the agreement addresses the challenges our stakeholders face in the 21 st century, while taking into account the diversity of our levels of development. We expect this historic agreement to promote economic growth, support higher-paying jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in our countries; and to promote transparency, good governance, and strong labor and environmental protections. To formalize the outcomes of the agreement, negotiators will continue technical work to prepare a complete text for public release, including the legal review, translation, and drafting and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>text.</b> We look forward to engaging with stakeholders on the specific features of this agreement and undergoing the domestic processes to put the agreement in place...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSingle Sign On (SSO) is an {{authentication}} mechanism that enables legal user {{with a single}} credential to be authenticated by multiple service providers in a distributed computer networks. SSO obtains credential from trusted authorities i. e., Smart Card Producing Center (SCPC) and Trusted Credential Privacy (TCP) which is used for mutual authentication and authorization of legal users. Chang-Lee coined a new SSO scheme which makes use of SCPC for mutual authentication and session key establishment whereas Schnorr signature makes use of TCP which generates and verifies the signature for user's authentication.

ABE is a new public key based on one-to-many encryption that allows users to decrypt the message based on set of attributes and access policies. Decryption is an expensive process and this ABE system eliminates the decryption overhead using outsourced decryption.
