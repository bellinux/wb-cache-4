5|$|Arachnids {{have been}} used in {{traditional}} medicine, and their venom has been studied for bioactive factors. In 1993 Margatoxin was synthesized from the venom of the Central American bark scorpion, Centruroides margaritatus. This peptide selectively inhibits <b>voltage-gated</b> potassium channels. Patented by Merck, {{it has the potential to}} prevent neointimal hyperplasia, a common cause of bypass graft failure.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and colleagues}} from St Thomas' Hospital, London, {{were the first}} to mention a case with {{possible}} clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the Mayo Clinic were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium channels.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the <b>voltage-gated</b> Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium <b>voltage-gated</b> channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E
5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a {{nerve impulse}} is carried down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse {{is transferred to}} the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads {{to the opening of}} <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E
5|$|Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} muscle weakness of the limbs. It {{is the result of}} an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E
5|$|Blood tests may be {{performed}} to exclude other causes of muscle disease (elevated creatine kinase may indicate a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium channels {{can be identified}} in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also {{be performed}} to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E
5|$|When the sinoatrial {{cells are}} resting, {{they have a}} {{negative}} charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive. This is called depolarisation and occurs spontaneously. Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium channels close and calcium ions then begin to enter the cell, shortly after which potassium begins to leave it. All the ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium only start {{to move out of}} and into the cell once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called <b>voltage-gated.</b> Shortly after this, the calcium channels close and potassium channels open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarization. When the membrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium channels close and the process may begin again.|$|E
25|$|<b>Voltage-gated</b> {{potassium}} {{channels are}} {{another set of}} <b>voltage-gated</b> channels that {{play a significant role}} in the initiation of dendritic spikes. <b>Voltage-gated</b> potassium channels, similar to <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium and calcium channels, facilitate the movement of cations across the plasma membrane. But unlike <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium and calcium channels, the <b>voltage-gated</b> potassium channel moves cations out of the cell thereby having an inhibitory effect on dendritic spike initiation.|$|E
25|$|Like <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium {{channels}}, <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium {{channels are}} also integral membrane proteins {{found in the}} plasma membrane. <b>Voltage-gated</b> calcium channels generate action potentials by the same mechanisms as <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels. Various <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium channels {{have been identified in}} neurons. N- and P/Q-type <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium channels are the primary subtypes found to support synaptic transmission. These channels are concentrated at nerve terminals. T-type and R-type <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium channels have been found in basal dendrites, and it is thought that the activation of these channels during action potential bursts lead to the generation of dendritic calcium spikes. T-type and R-type channels {{are all part of the}} alpha 1 subunit class of calcium channels.|$|E
25|$|The {{transient}} A-type <b>voltage-gated</b> {{potassium channel}} {{is a specific}} channel that {{plays a key role}} in dendritic spike initiation. The density of <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium and calcium channels is similar in both dendrites and axons; however, the dendritic membrane is far less excitable than the axonal membrane. The difference in excitability can be attributed to the presence of these <b>voltage-gated</b> potassium channels. <b>Voltage-gated</b> potassium channels inhibit the ability of dendrites to generate action potentials and decrease the amplitude of dendritic spikes with increasing distance from the soma. The ability of <b>voltage-gated</b> potassium channels to modulate dendritic signaling may have significant effects on synaptic plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Distribution of <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium {{channels}} {{along the}} dendritic membrane plays {{a crucial role}} in a dendrites ability to propagate a signal. High dendritic membrane thresholds often make it harder for initiation of dendritic spikes. However, increased density of <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels may reduce the amplitude of a signal needed to initiate a spike. Clustering of <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels have been observed at the synapses of the globus pallidus neuron. It has also been demonstrated through dendritic computational models that the threshold amplitude of a synaptic conductance needed to generate a dendritic spike is significantly less if the <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels are clustered at the synapse. The same type of <b>voltage-gated</b> channels may differ in distribution between the soma and dendrite within the same neuron. There seems to be no general pattern of distribution for <b>voltage-gated</b> channels within dendrites. Different neuronal dendrites exhibit different density patterns which are subject to change during development and can be modulated by neurotransmitters.|$|E
25|$|In vitro, NEDD4 {{has been}} shown to bind and ubiquitinate a number of ion {{channels}} and membrane transporters resulting in their subsequent endocytosis and degradation by the proteasome, including the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium and <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Voltage-gated</b> {{potassium}} channels e.g., Kvs, Kirs etc.|$|E
25|$|Both enantiomers of {{propranolol}} have a local anesthetic (topical) effect, {{which is}} normally mediated by blockade of <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels. Studies have demonstrated propranolol's ability to block cardiac, neuronal, and skeletal <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels, accounting for its known membrane stabilizing effect and antiarrhythmic and other {{central nervous system}} effects.|$|E
25|$|Action {{potentials}} may {{be first}} generated at the dendrite if stimulated by strong synchronous synaptic inputs. The {{ability of a}} dendrite to initiate an action potential is not only highly dependent on synaptic input {{but also on the}} number of <b>voltage-gated</b> channels and density of <b>voltage-gated</b> channels present in the membrane.|$|E
25|$|Azaspiracid is a phycotoxin that {{inhibits}} hERG <b>voltage-gated</b> potassium channels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Voltage-gated</b> ion {{channels}} {{open and}} close in response to membrane potential.|$|E
25|$|<b>Voltage-gated</b> sodium {{channels}} are proteins {{found in the}} membrane of neurons. When electrically activated, they allow the movement of sodium ions across a plasma membrane. These {{channels are}} responsible for propagation of electrical signals in nerve cells. <b>Voltage-gated</b> sodium channels {{can be divided into}} two subunits: alpha and beta. A variety of alpha subunit <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels have been identified. <b>Voltage-gated</b> sodium channels found in mammals can be divided into three types: Nav1.x, Nav2.x, and Nav3.x. Nav1.x sodium channels are associated with the central nervous system. Nav1.1, Nav2.2, and Nav1.6 are three isoforms of the <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels that are present at high levels in the central nervous system of an adult rat brain. These channels have been well documented in the axonal membrane of the central nervous system. Nav1.2 has been primarily identified in unmyelinated axons while high concentrations of Nav1.6 have been observed at nodes of Ranvier of axons. Nav1.6 has been identified in the dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons that generate dendritic spikes; the density of Nav1.6 in these neurons is 35-80 times lower than in the initial segments of axons.|$|E
25|$|Brugada {{syndrome}} is another ventricular arrhythmia caused by <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channel gene mutations.|$|E
25|$|ENaC is {{expressed}} in epithelial cells and {{is different from the}} <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channel that is involved in the generation of action potentials in neurons. The abbreviation for the genes encoding for <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channel starts with three letters: SCN. In contrast to these sodium channels, ENaC is constitutively active and is not voltage-dependent. The second N in the abbreviation (SCNN1) represents that these are NON-voltage-gated channels.|$|E
25|$|A {{dendritic}} spike is {{initiated in}} the same manner as that of an axonal action potential. Depolarization of the dendritic membrane causes sodium and potassium <b>voltage-gated</b> ion channels to open. The influx of sodium ions causes an increase in voltage. If the voltage increases past a certain threshold, the sodium current activates other <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels transmitting a current along the dendrite. Dendritic spikes can be generated through both sodium and calcium <b>voltage-gated</b> channels. Dendritic spikes usually transmit signals at a much slower rate than axonal action potentials. Local voltage thresholds for dendritic spike initiation are usually higher than that of action potential initiation in the axon; therefore, spike initiation usually requires a strong input.|$|E
25|$|The <b>voltage-gated</b> K+ {{channels}} {{that provide the}} outward currents of action potentials have similarities to bacterial K+ channels.|$|E
25|$|Upon depolarization, <b>voltage-gated</b> {{calcium ion}} (Ca2+) {{channels}} open, allowing calcium ions {{to move into}} the cell by facilitated diffusion.|$|E
25|$|Buprenorphine also blocks <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium {{channels}} via {{the local}} anesthetic binding site, and this underlies its potent local anesthetic properties.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol (alcohol) {{reduces the}} calcium-dependent {{secretion}} of AVP by blocking <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium channels in neurohypophyseal nerve terminals in rats.|$|E
25|$|Some {{novel and}} investigational analgesics include subtype-selective <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channel {{blockers}} such as funapide and raxatrigine, {{as well as}} multimodal agents such as ralfinamide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Voltage-gated</b> K+ {{channels}} are selective for K+ over other cations such as Na+. There is a selectivity filter at the narrowest {{part of the}} transmembrane pore.|$|E
25|$|Gabapentinoids, such as {{gabapentin}} and pregabalin, are selective blockers of α2δ subunit-containing <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium channels. They {{are used}} primarily to treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} calcium {{channels}} occur, {{with a number}} of classes of blockers, but almost all of them preferentially or exclusively block the L-type <b>voltage-gated</b> calcium channel.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of primidone's anticonvulsant action is still unknown after over fifty years. It {{is believed to}} work via interactions with <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels which inhibit high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly how valproate works. Proposed {{mechanisms}} include affecting GABA levels, blocking <b>voltage-gated</b> sodium channels, and inhibiting histone deacetylases. Valproic acid is a branched short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) made from valeric acid.|$|E
25|$|The steroid {{progesterone}} {{has been}} found to modulate the activity of CatSper (cation channels of sperm) <b>voltage-gated</b> Ca2+ channels. Since eggs release progesterone, sperm may use progesterone as a homing signal to swim toward eggs (chemotaxis).|$|E
25|$|<b>Voltage-gated</b> sodium {{channels}} normally {{consist of}} an alpha subunit {{that forms the}} ion conduction pore and one to two beta subunits that have several functions including modulation of channel gating. Expression of the alpha subunit alone is sufficient to produce a functional channel.|$|E
25|$|The cell {{membrane}} of the axon and soma contain <b>voltage-gated</b> ion channels {{that allow the}} neuron to generate and propagate an electrical signal (an action potential). These signals are generated and propagated by charge-carrying ions including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl−), and calcium (Ca2+).|$|E
25|$|Ion {{channels}} may {{be classified}} by gating, i.e. what opens {{and closes the}} channels. <b>Voltage-gated</b> ion channels open or close depending on the voltage gradient across the plasma membrane, while ligand-gated ion channels open or close depending on binding of ligands to the channel.|$|E
