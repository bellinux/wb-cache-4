5|$|Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceous is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and {{the bulk}} of the fungus lives underground, associating in a mutualistic relationship with the roots of <b>various</b> <b>tree</b> <b>species.</b> The fruit bodies are found growing singly, scattered or clustered together during mid-summer to autumn in deciduous forests, often under beech or oak trees; however, it sometimes occurs in mixed hardwood-conifer forests under hemlock. A preference for sandy soil has been noted in one source. In North America, the mushroom can be found east of the Rocky Mountains, ranging from Canada to Mexico. The species has also been collected in North Korea. Fruit bodies can serve as a food source for fungus-feeding Drosophila flies.|$|E
5|$|Like all milk caps, L.volemus forms ectomycorrhizae, {{mutually}} beneficial symbiotic associations with <b>various</b> <b>tree</b> <b>species.</b> In this association, the fungal hyphae grow around {{the root of}} the plant and between its cortical cells, but do not actually penetrate them. The hyphae extend outward into the soil, increasing the surface area for absorption to help the plant absorb nutrients from the soil. It is found growing at the base of both coniferous and broad-leaved trees, although it is more common in deciduous woods. It may also sometimes be found in peat moss beds. The fruit bodies, which appear between summer and autumn, are common. They can be found growing solitarily or in groups, and are more abundant in weather that is warm and humid.|$|E
5|$|Suillus brevipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, and {{it develops}} a close symbiotic {{association with the}} roots of <b>various</b> <b>tree</b> <b>species,</b> especially pine. The underground mycelia form a sheath around the tree rootlets, and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the cortical cells of the root, forming ectomycorrhizae. In this way, the fungus can supply the tree with minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially lodgepole and ponderosa pine. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus {{has been shown to}} form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, lodgepole, loblolly, eastern white, patula, pond, radiata, and red pines. In vitro mycorrhizal associations formed with non-pine species include Pacific madrone, bearberry, western larch, Sitka spruce, and coast Douglas-fir. Fungal growth is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the heavy metals cadmium (350ppm), lead (200ppm), and nickel (20ppm).|$|E

25|$|While amate {{is made in}} a {{few small}} villages in {{northern}} Puebla, northern Veracruz and southern Hidalgo state, only San Pablito in Puebla manufactures the paper commercially. San Pablito is a village in the municipality of Pahuatl√°n located in the Sierra Norte de Puebla. Tulancingo, Hidalgo is the closest urban center. The area is very mountainous and the village itself {{is on the side}} of a mountain called the Cerro del Brujo. The making of the paper is the primary economic activity of the community and has alleviated poverty in the village. Before the villagers only had very small houses made of wood, but now they have much larger houses made of block. The paper makers here guard the process greatly and will sever contact with anyone seeking to replicate their work. In addition to providing income to the paper makers themselves the craft has been employing an increasing number of people to harvest bark, over an area which now extends over 1,500km2 in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region. The village manufactures large quantities of paper, still using mostly pre-Hispanic technology and <b>various</b> <b>tree</b> <b>species</b> for raw material. About half of this paper production is still sold to Nahua painters in Guerrero.|$|E

40|$|Teak is an {{important}} <b>tree</b> <b>species</b> for forest plantation in the tropics due to its high value timber. However, teak plantations encounter several problems including competition from weeds, as well as damage from pests and diseases.

The transformation efficiency was determined by transient expression of gus gene using GUS histochemical assay. The transient expression of gus gene revealed that nodal segment was more suitable to be used as explants than the leaf base tissue with the transformation efficiency of 58. 32 % and 44. 45 %, respectively.
