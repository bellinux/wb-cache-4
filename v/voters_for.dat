5|$|After the Convention of 1901–02, the General Assembly did {{not call}} another general {{convention}} in the twentieth century. Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s {{that might have been}} passed by the General Assembly and sent to the <b>voters</b> <b>for</b> ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the only state to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it is only one of two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{unlimited}} Convention of 1901–02, {{twentieth century}} constitutional activity {{turned to a}} mixture of Governor-appointed constitutional commissions in 1927 and 1968, and limited constitutional conventions called by the General Assembly for very specific purpose. After the century's earliest convention disenfranchising voters in a constitution that was proclaimed, each modification of the Virginia Constitution has {{been sent to the}} <b>voters</b> <b>for</b> referendum approval. Virginia's women suffrage movement was unsuccessful until the national ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, and the General Assembly did not ratify until 1952, but women could vote beginning in 1920.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{irregularities}} in {{the approval of}} the Lecompton Constitution by Kansas voters, Breckinridge agreed with Buchanan that it was legitimate, but he kept his position secret, and some believed he agreed with his friend, Stephen Douglas, that Lecompton was invalid. Breckinridge's absence from the Senate during debate on admitting Kansas to the Union under Lecompton seemed to confirm this, but his leave—to take his wife from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where she was recovering from an illness, to Washington, D.C.—had been planned for months. The death of his grandmother, Polly Breckinridge, prompted him to leave earlier than planned. During his absence, both houses of Congress voted to re-submit the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas <b>voters</b> <b>for</b> approval. On resubmission, it was overwhelmingly rejected.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi (1984–89) conferred the Bharat Ratna posthumously on film {{actor and}} former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. G. Ramachandran, {{in a bid}} to {{influence}} voters prior to the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1989. The decision was criticised for awarding Ramachandran before independence activist B. R. Ambedkar and Vallabhbhai Patel, who were bestowed the honour in 1990 and 1991 respectively. While Ravi Shankar was accused of lobbying for the award, the decision by Indira Gandhi to posthumously honour K. Kamaraj was considered to have been aimed at placating Tamil <b>voters</b> <b>for</b> the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1977. The seventh Prime Minister V. P.

5|$|It was {{revealed}} in December 2005 that Bayh had raised $1.2 {{million in the}} first two quarters of 2005, more than any other potential candidate with the exception of Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. But the cash did not translate into high marks among possible voters as a CNN poll conducted December 9–11 found that Bayh had the support of only 1% of self-identified Democrats, placing him seventh among possible candidates. Later in the month, Bayh was criticized by the video game industry for political posturing in his quest along with Senator Hillary Clinton to crack down on explicit content in video games. The manufacturers claimed that the movements were simply attempts to increase his appeal to values <b>voters</b> <b>for</b> his presidential run.|$|E
5|$|Durant's 29 {{points and}} 12 rebounds in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals against the Spurs {{led to a}} 129–115 victory that saw the Warriors advance to the NBA Finals for a third {{straight}} year while becoming the first team in league history to start the playoffs 12–0. In Game 1 of the 2017 NBA Finals, Durant had 38 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists to lead Golden State past LeBron James and the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers, 113–91. He helped the Warriors go up 3–0 in the series with a 31-point effort in Game 3, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 45.3 {{seconds left in the}} game. In Game 5 of the series, he scored 39 points to go with seven rebounds and five assists in the series-clinching 129–120 win at Oracle Arena to wrap up a 4–1 series win over the Cavaliers. He was the Warriors' top scorer in every game of the Finals, averaging 35.2 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 5.4 assists while shooting 55.5 percent from the field, 47.4 percent from three-point range, and 92.7 percent from the free throw line.

5|$|The primary {{instigator}} for {{the creation}} of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of electoral reform. The electoral system had been expected to continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council, yet at the 1973 state election Labor had, through the mass registration of new <b>voters</b> <b>for</b> the council vote, managed to gain two seats, giving a 14–6 split in the council. As half the council was elected at each election, Labor only had to retain their vote to gain an additional two seats at the 1975 state election, and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them. It was increasingly plausible that Labor would be able to gain a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it, and push through any electoral legislation it so wished.|$|E
