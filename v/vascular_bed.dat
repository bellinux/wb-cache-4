40|$|IntroductionDifferent <b>vascular</b> <b>beds</b> show {{substantial}} {{variation in}} their susceptibilities {{for development of}} vascular disease like atherosclerosis, and thereby exhibit {{a variety of different}} clinical presentations. Yet, the underlying mechanism of this heterogeneity is not well defined. Recent evidence suggests a role for the vasa vasorum (VV) in vascular disease. We hypothesized that there is a differential distribution structure of adventitial VV in different <b>vascular</b> <b>beds.</b> Hence, the current study was designed to characterize and compare the structure of the adventitial VV in the coronary and the peripheral circulation. MethodsSamples of vessels from different <b>vascular</b> <b>beds</b> were obtained from 6 female crossbred domestic pigs. The samples were scanned using micro–computed tomography, and the images reconstructed and analyzed to characterize VV architecture, including vessel wall area, VV count, VV density, intravessel spatial distribution, mean diameter of first- and second-order VVs and the ratio of second- to first-order VVs. ResultsThere were significant differences in VV density among different <b>vascular</b> <b>beds.</b> Density was highest in coronary arteries (2. 91 ± 0. 26 vessels/mm 2, P <. 05, vs renal, carotid, and femoral arteries), intermediate in renal arteries (1. 45 ± 0. 22 vessels/mm 2, P <. 05, vs femoral artery) and carotid arteries (0. 64 ± 0. 08 vessels/mm 2, P <. 05, vs femoral artery), and lowest in femoral arteries (0. 23 ± 0. 05 vessels/mm 2). A similar pattern for the ratio of second- to first-order VV was also observed. Random intravessel spatial distribution of VVs was seen in all <b>vascular</b> <b>beds.</b> ConclusionThe current study demonstrates a differential structure of the adventitial VV in different <b>vascular</b> <b>beds.</b> This intra- and intervessel heterogeneity in VV anatomy is a phenotypic variability that might determine a differential local response to systemic risk factors and, thereby, variable propensity for vascular disease among different <b>vascular</b> <b>beds.</b> Clinical relevanceAtherosclerosis is a diffuse disease with differential expression among different <b>vascular</b> <b>beds,</b> inflicting a spectrum of vascular diseases. The majority of research efforts focus on the inner and medial vascular layers, which are in fact affected at the late stage of atherosclerosis. However, recent evidence suggests that the outer wall, including the adventitial layer and the vasa vasorum, plays a significant role in maintaining vessel integrity, contributing to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. The current article extends these previous observations. Using a novel imaging technology, micro–computed tomography, we demonstrate structural heterogeneity of the adventitial vasa vasorum among different <b>vascular</b> <b>beds.</b> This heterogeneity in VV anatomy is a phenotypic variability that might determine a differential local response to systematic risk factors and a concomitant variable propensity for vascular disease among different <b>vascular</b> <b>beds.</b> Furthermore, it suggests that anti-angiogenic treatment aimed at attenuating the VV neovascularization may have a potential preventive or reversal measure against the progression of atherosclerosis...|$|R
25|$|Thomas and Blalock did {{groundbreaking}} {{research into}} the causes of hemorrhagic and traumatic shock. This work later evolved into research on crush syndrome and saved {{the lives of thousands}} of soldiers on the battlefields of World War II. In hundreds of experiments, the two disproved traditional theories which held that shock was caused by toxins in the blood. Blalock, a highly original scientific thinker and something of an iconoclast, had theorized that shock resulted from fluid loss outside the <b>vascular</b> <b>bed</b> and that the condition could be effectively treated by fluid replacement. Assisted by Thomas, he was able to provide incontrovertible proof of this theory, and in so doing, he gained wide recognition in the medical community by the mid-1930s. At this same time, Blalock and Thomas began experimental work in vascular and cardiac surgery, defying medical taboos against operating upon the heart. It was this work that laid the foundation for the revolutionary lifesaving surgery they were to perform at Johns Hopkins a decade later.|$|E

In anesthetized SHR, the penile and hindlimb vasculature were isolated and perfused, maximum dilation was induced, and a flow-pressure assessment and alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist concentration-response curves were generated. Both the baseline and maximum constrictor responses were similar in the two beds of each strain, and overall the maximum structurally-based vascular resistance in SHR was higher than in SD rats.

40|$|Â© 2017, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR). Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) {{is associated}} with increased vascular calcification, although the rate of progress of calcification is uncertain. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the progression of and the predictors for calcification in different <b>vascular</b> <b>beds</b> over 10 Â years. The 10 -year actual coronary calcium score (CS) and 10 -year predicted coronary CS, based on the pattern of the general population, were compared. Calcification of the coronary and carotid artery and the aorta was assessed by multi-detector computed tomography. Significant CS progression was determined by the difference between the square root of baseline and square root of follow-up calcium score (i. e., SQRT method). The 10 -year predicted coronary CS was based on the mathematical formula derived by the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study. A total of 49 patients (54 Â Â±Â  11 Â years, 90 % female) had a follow-up scan after 10. 0 Â Â±Â  0. 2 Â years. The CS in all <b>vascular</b> <b>beds</b> was significantly increased; 55 % of the patients had a significant progression of CS in the coronary, 29 % in the carotid, and 80 % in the aorta. Age and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were independently associated with calcification progression in all <b>vascular</b> <b>beds.</b> Importantly, the absolute increase in 10 -year actual coronary CS was significantly higher than that predicted.

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the associations between the presence and extent of calcified atherosclerosis in multiple <b>vascular</b> <b>beds</b> and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, isolated systolic hypertension, and hypertension. A total of 9510 patients (42. 5 % women) underwent electron beam computed tomography scanning as part of a routine health maintenance screening. At the same visit, blood pressure was measured with the participant in the seated position using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Mean age was 5811. 4 years, and body mass index was 27. 14. 5. The prevalences of any calcification in the carotids, coronaries, subclavians, thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, and iliacs were 31. 9 %, 57. 2 %, 31. 7 %, 37. 0 %, 54. 3 %, and 48. 8 %, respectively. In separate multivariable logistic models containing traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure were significantly associated with the presence of calcification in all of the <b>vascular</b> <b>beds</b> except the iliacs and subclavians, respectively, with pulse pressure having stronger magnitudes of the associations for most of the <b>vascular</b> <b>beds.</b> Age-stratified analyses indicated that these associations were stronger in those 60 years of age compared with subjects 60 years of age, and sex-stratified analyses demonstrated that men had a greater association compared with women.
