50|$|Where {{a supply}} of vacuum is available, but not {{pneumatic}} power, rotary actuators have even been made to work from vacuum power. The only common instance of these was for early automatic windscreen wipers on cars up until around 1960. These used the manifold vacuum of a petrol engine to work a quarter-turn oscillating <b>vane</b> <b>actuator.</b> Such windscreen wipers worked adequately when the engine was running under light load, but they were notorious that when working hard at top speed or climbing a hill, the manifold vacuum was reduced and the wipers slowed to a crawl.|$|E
40|$|In {{hydraulic}} manipulator applications effective joints movement range of above 180 ° is often needed. <b>Vane</b> <b>actuator</b> has maximum movement range about 270 °. However, water hydraulic vane actuators are quite expensive to manufacture. Thus we investigate a possibility to use so called chain drive instead of <b>vane</b> <b>actuator.</b> Chain drive {{consists of two}} cylinders which are connected in series with a chain. Reduced model for chain-drive equals to symmetric cylinder and can be compared with a <b>vane</b> <b>actuator</b> of same size. Concerns with chain drive are the smoothness of sprocket turning around, stiffness of the chain and minimum required back-pressure level for keeping chain tension. In this paper a chain drive is designed, built and tested. We also compare chain drive's and vane actuator's properties mathematically from control point of view. We can conclude that chain drive's characteristics almost equal with <b>vane</b> <b>actuator</b> and {{it is much more}} cost effective...|$|E
40|$|The {{differences}} are summarized between the attitude control requirements for {{various types of}} proposed solar sail missions (Earth orbiting; heliocentric; asteroid rendezvous). In particular, it is {{pointed out that the}} most demanding type of mission is the Earth orbiting one, with the solar orbit case quite benign and asteroid station keeping only slightly more difficult. It is then shown, using numerical results derived for the British Solar Sail Group Earth orbiting design, that the disturbance torques acting on a realistic sail can completely dominate the torques required for nominal maneuvering of an 'ideal' sail. This is obviously an important consideration when sizing control actuators; not so obvious {{is the fact that it}} makes the standard rotating <b>vane</b> <b>actuator</b> unsatisfactory in practice. The reason for this is given, and a set of new actuators described which avoids the difficulty...|$|E
40|$|Robot arm {{manipulators}} have a {{wrist to}} change the orientation of its end-effector. Since the wrist {{is located at the}} end of the robot arm, as the wrist in a human arm, its weight has a big influence in the dynamics of the robot. This is because a large weight represents large inertial forces for the arm actuators. This thesis presents the redesign and optimization of a spherical wrist for a Water Hydraulic MANipulator (WHMAN), having as a major objective reducing the size and weight of the wrist. The wrist has three actuators in order to have three degrees of freedom; these are water hydraulic rotary <b>vane</b> <b>actuators.</b> The redesign process was divided into two parts. First the redesign of the vane actuators; for this part is explained theory regarding these actuators and the equations to calculate their characteristics are defined. Also is developed and reported an approach to define the requirements and to size the water hydraulic <b>vane</b> <b>actuators.</b> Second part is the redesign of the wrist; the components of the new wrist are shown and the improvements in the design are explained. This mechanical redesign was validated with Finite Element Method (FEM) analyses, their results are presented. With this redesign work the wrist structure is more compact and weights less (about 50 %). Also the dexterity of the WHMAN is improved by reducing the hand length on the wrist. /Kir 1...|$|R

50|$|Both {{hydraulic}} and {{pneumatic power}} {{may be used}} to drive an actuator, usually the larger and more powerful types. As their internal construction is generally similar (in principle, if not in size) they are often considered together as fluid power actuators. Fluid power actuators are of two common forms: those where a linear piston and cylinder mechanism is geared to produce rotation (illustrated), and those where a rotating asymmetrical vane swings through a cylinder of two different radii. The differential pressure between {{the two sides of the}} vane gives rise to an unbalanced force and thus a torque on the output shaft. <b>Vane</b> <b>actuators</b> require a number of sliding seals and the joints between these seals have tended to cause more problems with leakage than for the piston and cylinder type.|$|R
40|$|An active {{noise control}} system for ducted fan noise was built that uses {{actuators}} located in stator vanes. The actuators were piezoelectric benders manufactured using the THUNDER technology and were custom designed for the application. The {{active noise control}} system was installed in the NASA ANCF rig. Four actuator array {{with a total of}} 168 actuators in 28 stator vanes were used. Simultaneous reductions of acoustic power in both the inlet and exhaust duct were demonstrated for a fan disturbance that contained two radial mode orders in both inlet and exhaust. Total power levels in the target modes were reduced by up to 9 dB in the inlet and total tone levels by over 6 dB while exhaust power levels were reduced by up to 3 dB. Far field sound pressure level reductions of up to 17 dB were observed. A simpler control system, matched to the location of the disturbance with two radial actuator arrays, was demonstrated to control total acoustic power in four disturbance modes simultaneously in inlet and exhaust. The <b>vane</b> <b>actuator</b> met the requirements given for the ANCF, although in practice the performance of the system was limited by the constraints of the power amplifiers and the presence of control spillover. The vane actuators were robust. None of the 168 vane actuators failed during the tests...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{formulation}} of the mechanics and elastohydro-dynamics, and performance of composite vane seals of rectangular cross-section and goalpost shape, such as those used in rotary vane actuators in aviation, automotive, and industrial appli-cations. After constructing the mathematical and computational model of such seals, results are obtained for an application involving a rotary <b>vane</b> <b>actuator</b> for aircraft wing control surfaces. Examples are presented for both steady-state and transient conditions (steady and unsteady motion). These are followed by an extensive parametric study to establish the effects of various parameters on sealing performance, such as {{the effects of the}} seal interferences, sealed pressure, speed, design clearances, operating temperature, and the degree of lubricant starvation. Sealing performance is assessed {{on the grounds of the}} mass leakage rate, hydrodynamic friction force and extrusion size during operation. The parametric study resulted in the construction of 144 diagrams with 432 performance curves in total. Based on this, the design and operational seal-ing parameters were optimized to maximize sealing performance, that is, to minimize leakage, friction, and extrusion. There was an excellent agreement between the theoretically derived opti-mum values and those recommended semi-empirically by the seal and actuator manufacturers as initial estimates. The parametric study showed that vane seals are objects of complexmechan-ical behaviour, requiring attention to details in their design and application, not only tomaximize performance, but, primarily, to establish sufficient sealing and avoid premature failure that could prove very costly indeed...|$|E
40|$|MasterHydraulic {{actuator}} {{systems are}} known to be highly nonlinear and non-differentiable due to many factors, such as leakage, friction and especially, the fluid flow expression through the servo valve. In addition, their parameter fluctuations are greater than those of electrically driven systems. For these reasons, it is relatively difficult to realize not only a stable contact work but also an accurate force control. In order to achieve a high performance force control, an accurate torque servo mechanism is essential. However, a precise torque servo mechanism for a double <b>vane</b> rotary <b>actuator</b> system is not developed yet. Therefore, to obtain an accurate torque servo mechanism, a precise torque model of the exact system model should be found. In this thesis, non-linear equations are set up based on the dynamics of a double <b>vane</b> rotary hydraulic <b>actuator</b> system. Then, to derive a torque model from the equations, the non-linear equations are linearized using the taylor series expansion. Based on the torque model, a structure of a torque servo is proposed. At last, applying this algorithm to a 2 -DOF impedance controller, the performance of the design of torque servo is verified...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the high {{performance}} adaptive robust motion control of electrohydraulic servo system driven by dual <b>vane</b> hydraulic rotary <b>actuator.</b> The recently developed adaptive robust control theory is used to handle the nonlinearities and modelling uncertainties in hydraulic systems. Aside from the difficulty of handling parametric variations, the traditional adaptive robust controller (ARC) is also a little complicated in practice. To address these challenging issues, a simplified adaptive robust control with varying boundary discontinuous projection is developed to enhance the robustness of the closed-loop system, based on the features of hydraulic rotary actuator. Compared with previous ARC controller, the resulting controller has a simple algorithm for more suitable implementation and can handle parametric variations via nonlinear robust design. The controller theoretically achieves a guaranteed transient performance and final tracking accuracy {{in the presence of}} both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities. Extensive simulation results are obtained for a hydraulic rotary actuator to verify the high performance nature of proposed control strategy...|$|R
40|$|Fig. 14 Axial {{velocity}} profiles {{exit from}} stator (1) Actuator disk theory (observed variable outlet angle). Two and three-dimensional theories identical. shown plotted in Figs. 12, 13, 14, together with various theoretical predictions based on variations of actuator disk theory. The free stream velocities behind each row {{are not the}} same, being controlled by three-dimensional effects. In all calculations the axial velocity profiles have been matched outside the boundary layer. Fig. 12 shows the axial velocity at exit from the inlet guide <b>vanes.</b> Two-dimensional <b>actuator</b> disk theory using a constant exit air angle from the disk (corresponding to that predicted from two-dimensional cascade data for the guide vane tip section) gives an exit velocity not far removed from that observed. The use of the observed varying outlet angle in the analysis enables a slightly closer approximation to the profile to be obtained. The observed axial velocity profile at exit from the rotor row is shown in Fig. 13. Use of a constant outlet angle (from cascade data for the tip rotor section) in a two-dimensional analysis pro-duces the type of profile in which the velocity increases toward the wall. Replacement of the constant outlet angle with the variable observed angle in a two-dimensional analysis gives fair agreement with the observed profile, but an extension to include the variation of blade speed as well as outlet angle with radius (i. e., the use of cylindrical polar coordinates as in section 4) gives the best prediction (see Fig. 13). Similar calculations of the exit profile from the stator row (Fig. 14) show the need for using variable outlet angles in the actuator disk analysis, but no need for inclusion of three-dimensional modifications. (Since there is no work done by the blade row on the fluid, {{the importance of a}} variation in blade speed through the boundary layer is eliminated.) ...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{first by}} using the {{structure}} of the state-input domain, that is, considering the time sequence of input-output pairs, some appropriate LDs are created. This is important, because in practice always the sequence of generation of data points is known. This is the motivation to introduce the concept of “time tag”, the label assigned to each data point to identify the sequence of them. Then using these labels, one can create some appropriate LDs. Second, the application of two novel methods, i.e., fuzzy PCA-guided robust k-means clustering algorithm [23], along with a neighborhood outlier detection algorithm [24] is studied. By customizing these methods, the performance of the existing clustering techniques is improved and usual drawbacks are solved. In fuzzy PCA-guided robust k-means clustering algorithm, {{there is no need to}} determine the cluster center, with nothing better than a random guess; therefore, poor initialization will be avoided. In addition, it should be noted that most of the clustering algorithms are not robust; this means that, repeating the execution of the clustering algorithm on the same data might be resulted in different clusters; however, in fuzzy PCA-guided robust k-means clustering, the clusters would be the same for every execution. Neighborhood outlier detection enables us to detect and eliminate the outlier before clustering. Selection of proper outliers is of crucial importance because the eliminated regressor vectors contain useful information about the problem, and most probably, improper elimination leads to imperfect results. Also, using the concept of cluster crossing curve enables us to determine the number of subsystems without any prior information. If the chosen value for the initial guess of number of subsystems was correct, the algorithm will be ended. Otherwise, the initial guess for number of subsystems will be corrected and the algorithm will be repeated. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Also, an application of the developed approach to an inlet guide <b>vane</b> (IGV) servo <b>actuator</b> is evaluated.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} steps towards {{the development of}} a low-cost wheelchair-mounted manipulator for use by the physically disabled and elderly. A detailed review of world rehabilitation robotics research has been conducted, covering fifty-six projects. This identified the main areas of research, their scope and results. From this review, a critical investigation of past and present wheelchair-mounted robotic arm projects was undertaken. This led to the formulation of the key design parameters in a final design specification. The results of a questionnaire survey of fifty electric wheelchair users is presented, which has for the first time established the needs and abilities of this disability group. An analysis of muscle type actuators, which mimic human muscle, is presented and their application to robotics, orthotics and prosthetics is given. A new type of rotary pneumatic muscle actuator, the flexator, is introduced and through extensive testing its performance characteristics elucidated. A review of direct-drive rotary pneumatic, hydraulic and electrical actuators has highlighted their relative performance characteristics and has rated their efficiency in terms of their peak torque to motor mass ratio, Tp/MM. From this, the flexator actuator has been shown to have a higher Tp/MM ratio than most conventional actuators. A novel kinematic arrangement is presented which combines the best features of the SCARA and vertically articulated industrial robot geometries, to form the 'Scariculated' arm design. The most appropriate actuator for each joint of this hybrid manipulator was selected, based on the criteria of high Tp/MM ratio, low cost, safety and compatibility. The final design incorporates conventional pneumatic linear double-acting cylinders, a <b>vane</b> type rotary <b>actuator,</b> two dual flexator actuators, and stepping motors for the fme control of the wrist/end effector. An ACSL simulation program has been developed which uses mass flow rate equations, based on one-dimensional compressible flow theory and suppressed critical pressure ratios, to simulate the dual flexator actuator. Theoretical and empirical data is compared and shows a high degree of correlation between results. Finally, the design and development work on two prototypes is discussed. The latest prototype consists of a five-axis manipulator whose pneumatic joints are driven by pulse width modulated solenoid valves. An 8051 microprocessor with proportional error feedback modilles the mark to space ratio of the PWM signal in proportion to the angular error of the joints. This enables control over individual joint speeds, reprogrammable memory locations and position monitoring of each joint. The integration of rehabilitation robotic manipulators into the daily lives of the physically disabled and elderly will significantly influence the role of personal rehabilitation in the next century...|$|R
40|$|Automation of {{production}} processes has enabled {{to meet the}} dramatic demand for manufactured products that has grown out {{of the increase in}} world population. In existing industries greater production requirements and improvement in product quality call for faster industrial robots. This study details the design and development of a high-speed visual servoing system for industrial applications. The proposed visual servoing system consists of a high speed robotic manipulator, a high-speed camera system and an embedded controller. The proposed robotic manipulator has the configuration of a Selective Compliant Assembly Robotic Arm (SCARA). It uses two custom-designed double <b>vane</b> rotary hydraulic <b>actuators</b> for driving the links of the robot. The SCARA system was mathematically modeled and simulated. Based on the simulation results, the hydraulic actuators were sized for optimal performance. A prototype actuator was subsequently designed, manufactured and experimentally evaluated. The test results show that the proposed actuator is capable of reaching torques of up to 460 Nm in 30 ms with a payload of 12 kg. This is not possible with electric motors of similar size. Then the proposed SCARA was designed and fabricated using the proposed actuators. The end effector of this manipulator was capable of reaching velocities of up to 2. 7 ms⁻¹ with a payload of 5. 3 kg. Comparable performance is not feasible with contemporary SCARA type robots. The proposed robot was designed for handling payloads up to 15 kg with speeds of up to 2 ms⁻¹. This often results in flexing of the links and twisting of the support column, adding external disturbances to the system. A high-speed camera system was designed and built to obtain the position of the end effector as feedback for the controller. It uses a two dimensional Position Sensitive Detector as the image sensor. An electronic circuit was designed and built for signal conditioning and data acquisition from the Position Sensitive Detector. It was then calibrated to account for non-linearities on the image sensor. The camera was constructed using this Position Sensitive Detector circuit, a lens and an infra red filter. It was then calibrated to estimate the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters. This camera was capable of carrying out measurements at frequencies of up to 1350 Hz. The measurements made by this camera produced an average absolute accuracy of 0. 31 mm and 0. 37 mm in x and y directions, respectively. A Field Programmable Gate Array was used in this study as the platform for developing an embedded controller for the robot. Using contemporary Field Programmable Gate Array technology, a powerful virtual processor can be synthesized and integrated with custom hardware to create a dedicated controller that out performs some of the conventional microcontroller and microprocessor based designs. The Field Programmable Gate Array based controller takes advantage of both hardware features and virtual processor technology. The input, output interfaces for this controller were implemented using hardware. Complex functions that are difficult to be implemented in hardware were implemented using a virtual soft processor. Four different types of controllers were implemented and tested. These include hardware proportional-derivative, software proportional-derivative, single time scale visual servoing and set point modification type controllers. The proposed implementation carried out single time scale visual servoing at frequencies of up to 330 Hz...|$|R
