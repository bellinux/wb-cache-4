5|$|Edward's {{body was}} embalmed at Berkeley Castle, {{where it was}} viewed by local leaders from Bristol and Gloucester. It was then taken to Gloucester Abbey on 21 October, and on 20 December Edward was buried by the high altar, the funeral having {{probably}} been delayed to allow Edward III to attend in person. Gloucester was probably chosen because other abbeys had refused or been forbidden to take the King's body, {{and because it was}} close to Berkeley. The funeral was a grand affair and cost £351 in total, complete with gilt lions, standards painted with gold leaf and oak barriers to manage the anticipated crowds. Edward III's government probably hoped to put a <b>veneer</b> <b>of</b> normality over the recent political events, increasing the legitimacy of the young King's own reign.|$|E
5|$|The Praetorian Guard was {{an elite}} {{unit of the}} Roman army formed by Augustus in 27 BC, with the {{specific}} function {{to serve as a}} bodyguard to the emperor and members of the imperial family. Much more than a guard however, the Praetorians also managed the day-to-day care of the city, such as general security and civil administration. Furthermore, their presence served as a constant reminder to the people and the Senate of the substantial armed force which served {{as the basis for the}} imperial power. Augustus was careful however to uphold the republican <b>veneer</b> <b>of</b> this regime, and only allowed nine cohorts to be formed (one fewer than in a normal Roman legion), which were inconspicuously scattered across various lodging houses in the city, and commanded by two prefects.|$|E
5|$|The December 1964 South Vietnamese coup {{took place}} before dawn on December 19, 1964, when the ruling {{military}} junta of South Vietnam led by General Nguyễn Khánh dissolved the High National Council (HNC) and arrested {{some of its}} members. The HNC was an unelected legislative-style civilian advisory body they had created {{at the request of}} the United States—South Vietnam's main sponsor—to give a <b>veneer</b> <b>of</b> civilian rule. The dissolution dismayed the Americans, particularly the ambassador, Maxwell D. Taylor, who engaged in an angry war of words with various generals including Khánh and threatened aid cuts. They were unable to do anything about the fait accompli that had been handed to them, because they strongly desired to win the Vietnam War and needed to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, Taylor's searing verbal attacks were counterproductive as they galvanized the Vietnamese officers around the embattled Khánh. At the time, Khánh's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals, as well as Taylor, who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} quality <b>of</b> laminated <b>veneer</b> lumber - LVL manufactured with <b>veneers</b> <b>of</b> Schizolobium amazonicum (paricá), Eucalyptus saligna and Pinus taeda. The LVL panels were {{manufactured in the}} laboratory conditions composed by seven veneers, 2, 0 mm thickness, with different structural compositions, using phenol-formaldehyde resin. The <b>veneers</b> <b>of</b> Schizolobium amazonicum- paricá- were pre-classified by using stress wave machine. The <b>veneers</b> <b>of</b> Eucalyptus saligna and Pinus taeda were disposed in the face layer to reinforce the structural strength of LVL panels. The LVL quality was evaluated using glue line shear strength and static bending test (MOE and MOR, edge and flat). Grading <b>of</b> paricá <b>veneers</b> based on MOEd did not affected significantly {{the results of the}} glue line shear strength and MOE and MOR edge. For the MOE and MOR flat, the use <b>of</b> <b>veneers</b> <b>of</b> MOEd grade 1 contributed significantly to increasing the average values of these properties. In the same way, using the Eucalyptus saligna veneers on the face of LVL resulted in higher average values of MOE and MOR, edge and flat...|$|R

25|$|Though {{simple and}} {{compound}} walls were often used, great houses were primarily constructed of core-and-veneer walls: two parallel load-bearing walls comprising dressed, flat sandstone blocks bound in clay mortar were erected. Gaps between walls were packed with rubble, forming the wall's core. Walls were then {{covered in a}} <b>veneer</b> <b>of</b> small sandstone pieces, which were pressed into a layer of binding mud. These surfacing stones were often placed in distinctive patterns.|$|E
25|$|Munroe {{figured that}} the best way to make pencils was by {{starting}} with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut the slots for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The next step was to glue an eighth inch <b>veneer</b> <b>of</b> wood over the slots. The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.|$|E

25|$|The <b>veneer</b> <b>of</b> {{civilization is}} thin and fragile, writes Doctorow, {{and in the}} story London exposes the {{brutality}} {{at the core of}} humanity and the ease with which humans revert to a state of primitivism. His interest in Marxism is evident in the sub-theme that humanity is motivated by materialism; and his interest in Nietzschean philosophy is shown by Buck's characterization. Gianquitto writes that in Buck's characterization, London created a type of Nietschean Übermensch — in this case a dog that reaches mythic proportions.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, the British set up the Political Warfare Executive to produce and {{distribute}} propaganda. Through the use of powerful transmitters, broadcasts could be made across Europe. Sefton Delmer managed a successful black propaganda campaign through several radio stations which were designed to be popular with German troops {{while at the same time}} introducing news material that would weaken their morale under a <b>veneer</b> <b>of</b> authenticity. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill made use of radio broadcasts for propaganda against the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The {{companies}} that were comprised by Saradha Group were incorporated in 2006. Its name is a cacography of Sarada Devi, the wife and spiritual counterpart of Ramakrishna Paramahamsaa nineteenth-century mystic of Bengal. This duplicitous association gave Saradha Group a <b>veneer</b> <b>of</b> respectability. Like all Ponzi schemes, Saradha Group promised astronomical returns in fanciful but credible investments. Its funds were sold on commission by agents recruited from local rural communities. Between 25 and 40% of the deposit was returned to these agents as commissions and lucrative gifts to quickly build up a wide agent pyramid. The group used a nexus of companies to launder money and evade regulators.|$|E

25|$|The neck is made {{of light}} wood, with a <b>veneer</b> <b>of</b> {{hardwood}} (usually ebony) to provide durability for the fretboard beneath the strings. Unlike most modern stringed instruments, the lute's fretboard is mounted flush with the top. The pegbox for lutes before the Baroque era was angled back from the neck at almost 90° (see image), presumably to help hold the low-tension strings firmly against the nut which, traditionally, is not glued in place but is {{held in place by}} string pressure only. The tuning pegs are simple pegs of hardwood, somewhat tapered, that are held in place by friction in holes drilled through the pegbox.|$|E
25|$|Glaciation and the {{resulting}} glacial and fluvio-glacial deposition has had a vast impact on the geology of England covering many areas with a <b>veneer</b> <b>of</b> glacial till in the lower lying areas north of a line running from Bristol to London. In the Ribble valley, Lancashire in north west England {{the resulting}} drumlins are clearly visible. Cromer Ridge in East Anglia is a terminal moraine. Indeed, most of East Anglia is covered with glacial till which has produced its rich loamy soils. This unconsolidated material (it is not stuck tightly together) is very easily eroded hence the rapid rate of retreat of the coastline of this region.|$|E
25|$|In the 1900s, Brandes {{fought the}} Danish {{political}} establishment on several occasions, but eventually had to curb his acidic attacks. However, his international reputation was growing. In many ways he emulated his own assessment of Voltaire, {{as an author}} against habitual thinking, hypocrisy and the thin <b>veneer</b> <b>of</b> morality. He condemned the maltreatment of national minorities, the persecution of Alfred Dreyfus, etc. During World War I, he condemned the national aggression and imperialism {{on both sides and}} his last years were dedicated to anti-religious polemic. In this late period he made new connections to intellectuals like Henri Barbusse and Romain Rolland when he was co-signer in the foundation of Clarté, as well as E. D. Morel.|$|E
25|$|Colour {{was used}} {{in a variety of}} ways to enhance {{buildings}} during this period. Rendered walls could be coloured, with different fashions prevailing in different regions. Stone buildings sometimes had external details picked out in colour. In Italy buildings were often constructed with alternating bands of brick and stone. In Venice, the palaces of wealthy families had <b>veneers</b> <b>of</b> marble which contrasted with the painted stucco.|$|R
50|$|The {{artisans}} {{performed the}} exceptionally skilled and delicate task <b>of</b> inlaying thin <b>veneers</b> <b>of</b> semi-precious stones especially selected for their colour, opacity, brilliance and grain to create elaborate decorative and pictorial effects. Items of extraordinary refinement {{were created in}} this way, from furnishings to all manner of artworks. Today, artisans trained at the Opificio assist many of the world's museums in their restoration programmes.|$|R
