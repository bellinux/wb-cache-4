5000|$|Chiropractic {{adjustments}} (also termed manipulations or mobilizations) {{are sometimes}} {{used in the}} belief that this will treat TMD. Related conditions that are also claimed to be treatable by chiropractic include tension headaches and neck pain. Some sources suggest that there is some evidence of efficacy of chiropractic treatment in TMD, but the sources cited for these statements were case reports and a case series of only 9 participants. One review concluded [...] "inconclusive evidence in a favorable direction regarding mobilization and massage for TMD". Overall, although there is general agreement that chiropractic may be of comparable benefit to other manual therapies for lower back pain, there is no credible evidence of efficacy in other conditions, including TMD. [...] However, there is some evidence of possible adverse effects from cervical (neck) <b>vertebral</b> <b>manipulation,</b> which sometimes may be serious.|$|E

The literature cautions against the use of manual therapy in individuals with osteoporosis, (Musculoskeletal Manipulation: Evaluation of the Scientific Evidence, Charles C Thomas Publisher, Springfield, IL; Common Vertebral Joint Problems, 2 nd Edition, Churchill Livingstone, New York; Maitland 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Vertebral</b> <b>Manipulation,</b> 6 th Edition, Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston; Br. J. Sports Med. 37 (2003) 195 – 196) yet clinical experience (Br. J. Sports Med. 37 (2003) 195 – 196) and published cases (J. Manip. Physiol. Ther. 15 (7) (1992) 450 – 454) suggest that these techniques are still being used by at least some clinicians. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the most common treatment modes used by a random sample of physiotherapists practicing in the province of British Columbia (BC) in the treatment of individuals with osteoporosis. To assess whether physiotherapists in BC have concerns about the use of manual therapy in individuals with osteoporosis, particularly whether physiotherapists have concerns about fracture as a complication of treatment. This cross-sectional study of 171 physiotherapists in BC used a questionnaire developed by the physiotherapist in the Osteoporosis Program at the BC Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Centre (a part of the Children 2 ̆ 7 s & Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Centre of BC). The response rate (67 / 171) was 39...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} and clinical model based on tangential (follower) loading {{as a method}} of optimal force transmission in the spine to explain the traditional chiropractic concept of a vertebral subluxation and as a description and rational for the clinical entity that has been the object of chiropractic manipulative therapy (adjustment). Method: A brief review of the literature and relevant texts relating to the application of the mechanical concept of follower and tangential loads to the spine and the chiropractic concept of the vertebral subluxation was undertaken to determine common factors and inter-related components. Results: Relevant information from the literature relating to follower and tangential loading of the spine, <b>vertebral</b> subluxations and <b>manipulation</b> was correlated and synthesised into a model describing normal spinal mechanics and the loss of mechanical integrity of the spine. The model was developed as a theoretical basis for the chiropractic concept of the vertebral subluxation and as a mechanical rationale for spinal manipulation. Three key components were identified that were common to follower and tangential loads, subluxations and manipulation of the spine and were incorporated into the model. These involved active components, passive elements and feedback mechanisms previously described by Panjabi. Conclusion: The mechanical concepts underlying tangential loading of the spine have been applied to the chiropractic concept of the vertebral subluxation and spinal adjustment. Load theory and research provides chiropractic with a testable hypothesis for the clinical response to the adjustment and a theoretical basis for the subluxation as a clinical entit...|$|R
