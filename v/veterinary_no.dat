40|$|Four {{serological}} tests and three immunofluorescence tests for IgG, IgM, and IgA were compared for {{value in the}} investigation of brucellosis in <b>veterinary</b> surgeons. <b>No</b> one serological test stood out over the others, and the immunofluorescence tests did not appear to have advantages over the {{serological tests}}.

The 2 -mercaptoethanol test and the antihuman globulin (Coombs' test) have no advantages over the other two and could be dropped. Immunofluorescence tests are not recommended for routine testing of brucellosis sera. The results and these recommendations apply to the 'vet' sera tested; it is reasonable to suppose that what applies to 'vet' sera will also apply to sera of those who work with or are in repeated contact with cattle and who will have had previous experience of brucella antigen, that is, dairy farmers, herdsmen, or slaughter house employees...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} factors that {{influence}} the survival time of sheep affected by sheep pox or enterotoxaemia, 150 sheep farms affected by sheep pox (108) and enterotoxaemia (42) were selected through multistage random sampling technique from the purposively selected Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu. Relevant data were collected for the period of two years (2000 - 01 and 2001 - 02). The data so collected were used to fit Cox hazard functional models separately for each disease. One unit increase in breed and veterinary care indicators in sheep pox affected flock would increase the hazard rate by 10. 49 and 15. 61 %, respectively. Similarly, one unit increase in age and vaccination would decrease hazard rate by 66. 40 and 67. 23 %, respectively. The relative risk for the non-provision of veterinary care indicated that the risk of dying was 4. 16 times higher for an animal provided with <b>no</b> <b>veterinary</b> care, compared to the one, which received veterinary care. One unit increase in breed and veterinary care indicators in enterotoxaemia affected flock would increase the hazard rate by 78. 00 and 2. 43 %, respectively. Similarly, a unit increase in deworming would decrease the hazard rate by 36. 01 %.

40|$|Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (AT-MSCs) are an {{attractive}} source for cell-based therapy of some diseases, including acute and chronic liver failure, in not only human medicine but also veterinary medicine. However, in <b>veterinary</b> medicine, <b>no</b> {{studies have reported}} the effects of AT-MSCs on liver injury in dogs. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of allogenic AT-MSCs on acute liver injury by carbon tetrachloride in dogs and to compare the therapeutic effects of AT-MSCs transplanted via the peripheral vein (PV) or splenic vein (SV). After transplantation of AT-MSCs through the PV or SV, serum liver enzymes were decreased significantly, and SV injection was more effective compared with PV injection. By comparing the number of engrafted AT-MSCs in the liver, SV injection was significantly more effective than PV injection. mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL- 1, IL- 6, IL- 8, and IFNγ, in the liver were decreased significantly, but those of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL- 4 and IL- 10, HGF, and VEGFA, were significantly increased after the first AT-MSC injection. These findings suggest that allogenic AT-MSCs injected via the PV or SV ameliorate acute hepatic injury in dogs, and AT-MSCs injected via the SV provide more effective improvement...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTIn total, 494 {{isolates}} of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) {{were identified}} to the species level by biochemical tests and sodA sequencing. Erythromycin resistance phenotypes were determined and specific resistance genes {{were identified by}} PCR. The prevalence of erythromycin resistance varied widely among staphylococcal species, from 0 % in Staphylococcus lugdunensis to almost 90 % in Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Most (63 %) erythromycin-resistant isolates carried constitutively expressed erm(C) as the sole resistance determinant, with the notable exception of Staphylococcus hominis subsp. hominis, which carried inducible erm(C). The erm(A) and erm(B) determinants were comparatively rare. The msr(A) gene was carried by 20 – 30 % of all erythromycin-resistant isolates, with little variation among species, and was combined in 16. 7 % of isolates with mph(C), a resistance gene of unknown clinical relevance found previously in isolates of <b>veterinary</b> origin. <b>No</b> erythromycin resistance {{that could not be}} attributed to the genes investigated was detected. It was concluded that the presence of methylases cannot be assumed in CoNS isolates that appear erythromycin-resistant and clindamycin-susceptible; thus, methods that detect the export mechanism should be used with clinically significant isolates to indicate whether use of clindamycin may be effective. In Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, 46 % and 66 %, respectively, of erythromycin-resistant, clindamycin-susceptible isolates were susceptible to clindamycin therapy...|$|R
