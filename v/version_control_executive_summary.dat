Overall im-provements in resource and energy efficiency are enabled by the DISIRE technological platform through 1) the perva-sive sensing of the properties of raw materials and product flows, 2) the development of Process Analysis Technology (PAT) to assess quality and performance requirements and 3) the development of optimal and adaptive Industrial Pro-cess <b>Control</b> strategies. <b>Executive</b> <b>Summary</b> Top researchers and world leading industrial players will cooper-ate under the DISIRE research umbrella {{in order to develop}} ro-bust, yet miniaturized in-situ Process Analyser Technology (PAT...|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{address the problem}} of {{automation}} of heavy-duty vehicles. After {{a brief description of the}} dynamic model used in our design and simulations, we develop nonlinear controllers with adaptation, first for speed control and then for vehicle follower longitudinal control. We consider both autonomous operation as well as intervehicle communication, and evaluate the performance of our controllers in several different scenarios through simulation. Keywords Adaptive Cruise Control Advanced Vehicle Control Systems Automated Highway Systems Control Autonomous Intelligent Cruise Control Buses Commercial Vehicle Operations Control Algorithms Control Systems Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems Longitudinal Control Public Transit Speed Control Trucking Vehicle Follower <b>Control</b> ii <b>Executive</b> <b>Summary</b> In the last decade, problems associated with automated highways have received a great deal of attention. While a multitude of results exists for longitudinal and lateral control of light duty vehicles, heavy-duty commercial vehicles have been largely ignored so far. These vehicles cost much more than passenger cars, are operated for profit, and spend much more time on the road. Hence, commercial vehicles may become the flagships of AVCS efforts, since the relative cost of automation is lower than in cars, while the potential financial gain is much higher. However, due to their configuration, response to braking and steering, actuator imperfections and sensitivity to winds, they cannot be controlled by simply re-tuning the controllers which have been developed for cars. In our research funded under MOU 124, we have focused on the problem of heavy-duty vehicle automation. We have developed detailed dynamical models and designed adaptive nonlinear controllers [...] ...|$|R
