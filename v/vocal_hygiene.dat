Environmental factors (eg., smoke and cold temperatures), vocal abuse and upper respiratory pathologies (e. g., colds, laryngitis and pharyngitis) seemed to increase teachers’ voice disorders (p-value <. 05). In conclusion, the absence of vocal pedagogy in the curricular plan of teachers’ higher education associated to poor working environmental conditions and professional voice demands explained the higher prevalence of vocal problems in teachers’ group...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises {{an exploration}} of the thesis that a holistic education entailing multi-disciplinary study is essential if classical singers and vocal pedagogues are to be prepared adequately for performance, for their teaching role, and for cooperation in inter-professional relations. The disciplines pertinent to vocal pedagogy are examined, and their varied contributions are discussed with a view to showing {{the ways in which they}} are mutually supportive. The case is argued on the basis of an exhaustive analysis of the relevant literature, and is underpinned by my wide professional experience as a soprano, and as a teacher both in primary, secondary and higher education, and in private practice at home and abroad. Starting with a survey of views on vocal pedagogy from biblical and classical times to the present day, important diverse roots are exposed, yielding differing and even conflicting tonal ideals which have a bearing on the consideration of different singing styles, and the interpretation of songs and arias. Ethics and psychology are identified as central to the entire pedagogical process, along with the scientific basis of singing, encompassing acoustics, anatomy and physiology, with special reference to the bearing of the latter two upon <b>vocal</b> health and <b>hygiene.</b> A detailed consideration of singing technique is the centrepiece of the dissertation, building on the scientific basis already presented. The several aspects of technique are discussed, and an understanding of the relations between good technique and scientific awareness is shown to be fundamental to good vocal pedagogical practice. In differing ways all of the disciplines thus far discussed - history, the ethics and psychology, science, vocal technique - contribute to performance, which is the next topic dealt with. In addition, since the evaluation of performance is a question of aesthetics, that branch of philosophy is introduced as a further discipline contributing to the education of the fully equipped singer and vocal pedagogue. While a considerable amount of research has been undertaken by others on the individual disciplines discussed in this dissertation, no study to date has attempted the task of showing the inter-relationships of all of them, and the ways in which together they bear upon classical singing pedagogy. The central theme of the dissertation is that the adoption of a holistic, multidisciplinary approach is of particular benefit to singers and voice teachers, and that such an approach facilitates mutual co-operation between them and other voice professionals...|$|R
50|$|Indirect therapies {{take into}} account {{external}} factors that may influence vocal production. This incorporates maintenance of <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> practices, {{as well as the}} prevention of harmful vocal behaviours. <b>Vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> includes adequate hydration of the vocal folds, monitoring the amount of voice use and rest, avoidance of vocal abuse (e.g., shouting, clearing of the throat), and taking into consideration lifestyle choices that may affect vocal health (e.g., smoking, sleeping habits). Vocal warm-ups and cool-downs may be employed to improve muscle tension and decrease risk of injury before strenuous vocal activities. It should be taken into account that <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> practices alone are minimally effective in treating dysphonia, and thus should be paired with other therapies.|$|E
50|$|Laryngitis {{caused by}} {{excessive}} use or misuse {{of the voice}} can be managed though <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> measures.|$|E
50|$|In addition, good <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> {{involves}} {{getting enough}} rest and drinking lots of water. It {{is important to}} keep the vocal fold tissue healthy and hydrated, and when possible to limit the quantity of speaking in order to avoid damage.|$|E
50|$|Following diagnosis, {{voice therapy}} should be {{implemented}} to optimize <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene.</b> However, vocal fold cysts typically do not improve with solely vocal rest or vocal therapy. Instead, a surgical procedure utilizing the microflap approach is conducted {{to remove the}} cyst (see Treatment).|$|E
50|$|For {{professional}} voice users as well {{as individuals}} who frequently experience hoarseness, <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> practices are recommended {{for the prevention of}} vocal fold nodules and other voice disorders. <b>Vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> practices include three components: regulating {{the quantity and quality of}} voice use, improving vocal fold hydration, and reducing behaviours that jeopardize vocal health. About 10% of nodules resolve on their own, which is more likely if they are smaller and the onset more recent. Treatment of vocal fold nodules usually involves behavioural intervention therapy administered by a speech-language pathologist. In severe cases, surgery to remove the lesions is recommended for best prognosis. Vocal fold nodules occur more frequently in females. In children, they are more common in males; in adulthood, they are more common in females.|$|E
50|$|Speech {{therapy is}} the main course of {{treatment}} for long-term management of VCD and includes {{a variety of techniques}} such as relaxed-throat breathing, respiratory retraining therapy, and <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> counselling. Most studies agree that symptoms of VCD improve in patients and few continue to require asthma medications six months post speech therapy intervention. Significant improvements were reported for respiratory retraining therapy, including fewer episodes of dyspnea per month and decreased respiratory stress severity.|$|E
50|$|Many {{antiviral}} {{drugs like}} cidofovir {{have been used}} to treat laryngeal papillomatosis, but none completely stops the tumors from growing. Most antivirals are injected to control the frequency of tumor growth. The efficacy of the same is debated and subject to research. Some side effects of antivirals include dizziness, headaches, and body aches. Adjuvant chemotherapy with interferon may be used in very severe cases.Regardless of the treatment used, the tumors will recur. In severe cases, tumors may occur once or twice a month. In less severe cases, tumors may occur once or twice a year. In addition, speech therapy may be beneficial to assist with <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> and retraining of voice.|$|E
50|$|Polyps may {{be treated}} with medical, surgical, or {{behavioral}} intervention. Surgical intervention involves removing the polyp from the vocal fold. This approach is only used when the growth(s) are very large, or have existed for an extended amount of time. In children, surgical intervention is rare. Existing medical problems may be treated {{in an effort to}} reduce the strain and negative impact on the vocal cords. This could include treatment for gastrointestinal reflux disease, allergies, and thyroid problems. Intervention to stop smoking and reduce stress may also be needed. Most people receive behavioral intervention, or vocal therapy, from an SLP. This might involve teaching good <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene,</b> and reducing or stopping vocal abuse behaviors. Direct voice treatments may be used to alter pitch, loudness, or breathe support to promote good voicing.|$|E
50|$|Behavioural {{voice therapy}} with a speech-language {{pathologist}} is recommended. This usually involves vocal training, voice therapy, and, occasionally, vocal rest. In rare cases, surgery {{may be required}} when behavioural interventions are ineffective. Treatment techniques focus on educating individuals, often professional voice users, about <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> and safe voice practices (see prevention). Maladaptive and phonotraumatic behaviours are identified and then minimized or eliminated. Most therapy will address the reduction of collision forces between the vocal folds, ensuring sufficient pulmonary support while speaking, and optimizing resonance of the larynx and other structures of the vocal apparatus. This may entail adaptation of an individual's breathing pattern or reshaping of their vocal tract through behavioural modifications. While behavioural modification often results in {{a reduction in the}} size and severity of vocal fold nodules and an improvement in voice quality, lesions are unlikely to resolve completely.|$|E
40|$|PurposeThis article {{presents}} {{the current state}} of knowledge regarding <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> for the voice professional. Recent findingsResearch regarding <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> has primarily focused on two areas: <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> as a preventive strategy, and <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> as a management technique for individuals with voice disorders. It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> as a preventive tool as programs are often expensive leading to limited data. <b>Vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> as a sole strategy for the treatment of voice disorders has shown minimal, but favorable results. As a component of a comprehensive therapeutic program, it is difficult to isolate the influence of <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene.</b> However, limited components of <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> including hydration and vocal rest have been associated with improved therapeutic outcomes. in addition, the current literature proposes a paradigm shift away from more restrictive therapy approaches to a holistic approach to vocal well being. SummaryVocal hygiene should be considered only as a component of a broad vocal rehabilitation program. the role of <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> as a means to prevent voice disorders remains unproven. Additionally, some of the findings may be applied to both dysphonic and healthy individuals in order to facilitate vocal well being.

40|$|Knowledge of {{differences}} in voice and speech characteristics between novice and professional broadcasters is essential for effective education of broadcast journalism students. Because newsreaders rely on optimal voice production, information pertaining to <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> is also important. The first {{aim of this study}} was to compare the voice and speech characteristics of professional newsreaders, student newsreaders and control participants. The second aim was to compare the awareness and use of <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> across these groups. Professional radio newsreaders, broadcast journalism students and two matched control groups were included in the study. Each participant recorded a news bulletin and completed a questionnaire on <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene.</b> Data analysis of the recording included objective analysis and perceptual ratings by a panel of three judges. Significant student-professional differences were found. Compared to both the students and the control groups, the professional newsreaders had greater variation in speaking fundamental frequency, a faster rate of speech, fewer pronunciation errors and higher perceptual ratings on vocal quality, emphasis, continuity, phrasing and style of newsreading. Female professional newsreaders had a higher speaking fundamental frequency than both their control participants and the student newsreaders.

40|$|Background and Aim: Vocal {{abuse and}} misuse {{are the most}} {{frequent}} causes of voice disorders. Consequently some therapy is needed to stop or modify such behaviors. This research was performed to study the effectiveness of <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> program on perceptual signs of voice in people with dysphonia. Methods: A <b>Vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> program was performed to 8 adults with dysphonia for 6 weeks. At first, Consensus Auditory- Perceptual Evaluation of Voice {{was used to assess}} perceptual signs. Then the program was delivered, Individuals were followed in second and forth weeks visits. In the last session, perceptual assessment was performed and individuals’ opinions were collected. Perceptual findings were compared before and after the therapy. Results: After the program, mean score of perceptual assessment decreased. Mean score of every perceptual sign revealed significant difference before and after the therapy (p≤ 0. 0001). «Loudness» had maximum score and coordination between speech and respiration indicated minimum score. All participants confirmed efficiency of the therapy. Conclusion: The <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> program improves all perceptual signs of voice although not equally. This deduction is confirmed by both clinician-based and patient-based assessments. As a result, <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> program is necessary for a comprehensive voice therapy but is not solely effective to resolve all voice problems...|$|E

40|$|This project aimed 1) to {{investigate}} the change of vocal function in teachers over time with voice intervention provided and 2) to compare the self-perceived quality of life (QoL) between the practicing teachers and student teachers. The project consisted of two prospective studies, in which practicing teachers (study 1) and student teachers (study 2) were recruited as subjects respectively. In study 1, the subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups: voice training group and no-training group. In study 2, the subjects were randomly assigned to three groups: <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> (VH) group, <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> and voicing technique training (VHT) group, and no-training group. Participants in the intervention groups were invited to attend the corresponding training workshops respectively. In both studies, results demonstrated no significant positive change of vocal function in subjects after intervention provided. Also, no significant difference was found between the practicing teachers and student teachers on the self-perceived QoL.

Yet, the prevalence figures {{and the negative}} impacts on child’s social, psychological and functional aspects indicate the needs for voice care promotion to this population. A cross-sectional survey on voice care knowledge, attitude and behavior towards parents in children in Hong Kong was carried out. 506 parents with children aged 5 to 12 years old were recruited from two primary schools. They were required to complete a questionnaire ascertained their voice care knowledge, attitude and behavior with children between January and March 2009.

40|$|Voice is an {{essential}} means of communication. It is the singing voice that is particularly susceptible to voice damage and fatigue as singers belong {{to a group of}} occupations with a substantial vocal load. As such they face greater chance of inducing too much strain on their vocal apparatus, which can lead to hoarseness and other voice disorders. Not only can abusive vocal and speech habits affect the quality of voice, but they can also result in inappropriate vocal technique, which is why <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene,</b> i. e. taking care of one's singing voice, is of utmost importance. What it takes is a lifestyle and behaviour that work {{in the best interest of}} one’s voice while, at the same time, improving their mental and physical well-being. The theoretical part of the present Master’s dissertation provides an overview of vocal anatomy and speech production physiology as well as speech pathology, while placing special emphasis on the risk factors that contribute to the development of voice disorders in singers. The thesis defines the role of a speech and language therapist, who – alongside a phoniatrician and a psychologist – is crucial in voice treatment. Last but not least, the study includes guidelines to improve <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> in singers, keeping their voice as healthy as possible.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to discover the impact of overall health to the perceived performance effectiveness of professionally managed classical singers and to document some of the actual vocal health practices of these singers. To accomplish this, the researcher examined related literature in several <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> categories, including hydration, diet, the effect of acid reflux on the voice, the effect of alcohol consumption on the voice and exercise; she found little empirical evidence utilizing the elite vocal athletes of singing, professionally managed classical singers, as participants. The researcher constructed an online survey, which contained 30 questions querying singer <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> behavior. The survey was sent to 227 randomly selected professionally managed classical singers. Forty-nine singers completed the survey (response rate 21. 6 %). Descriptive statistics, Chi Square tests, and tests of correlation were used to answer two research questions addressing the importance of overall health in singers' performance and in factors related to hydration, diet, alcohol consumption, and exercise. Over 81. 5 % of the singers surveyed rated overall health as important or very important to their singing effectiveness. There was no significant difference in vocal health impact ratings when compared by performance experience, health or gender. The median number of 8 oz. glasses of water that singers drank daily was 8 and the mean was 7. 8. When questioned about specific dietary and exercise practices, singers responded with a variety of health regimes. There was no correlation between singers' length of professional experience and their corresponding amount of weekly exercise. The author concluded when there was no consensus regarding <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> practices, singers followed a variety of <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> regimes to maintain vocal and overall health. In conducting the literature review, the researcher discovered numerous studies about health management utilizing athletes as participants but relatively few utilizing vocal athletes. While empirical studies measuring athletic performance and hydration, diet, alcohol consumption and exercise are somewhat transferable, athletic studies do not address the impact of hydration, diet, alcohol consumption and exercise on the vocal apparatus.

40|$|Abstract only availableVoice {{production}} {{is a complex}} task involving coordination of several systems in our body. Voice {{plays a crucial role}} in speech production. Without voice, speech will be inaudible. Voice problems hinder communication significantly. The consequence of voice problems in daily living depends on patients' lifestyle and profession. Professional voice users are those who use their voice for earning a living. This group includes teachers, sales persons, attorneys, singers, actors etc. It is obvious that the effect of voice problem will be significantly greater in professional voice users than a librarian or clerk who do not involve in active voice production during work. Among professional voice users, teachers are considered to be at high risk for voice problems. Their schedule at work, duration and extent of voice use, and lack of knowledge about <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> can worsen the condition. Voice problems in teachers can affect their teaching efficiency and also risk their job. The goal of this survey is to identify classroom teachers in Columbia, Missouri having voice problems, increase awareness among teachers about <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene,</b> and the role of speech language pathologists in helping patients with voice problems. This project will also try to identify any specific group among teachers (kindergarten, elementary, high school, and college level) who are prone to voice problems or at vocal risk.

40|$|Abstract no. 3179 Theme: Care of the Professional VoiceHerbal {{medicine}} is often employed {{as either a}} primary, an alternative or adjunctive therapy in treating voice disorders in China. The principles of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) lie in the equilibrium of yin (water) and yang (fire) concept {{and the removal of}} phlegm and stagnant blood in the body. A number of Chinese herbal medicine decoctions or formulae have been reported to be effective in treating dysphonia. Yang Yin Qing Fei (nourishment of fluid to clear dryness and heat in the lung) decoction is a popular formula used to treat chronic pharyngeal and laryngeal inflammatory diseases. It consists of eight individual herbs, Rehmannia glutinosa, Ophiopogon japonicus, Scrophularia ningpoensis, Paeonia suffruticosa, Fritillariae Cirrhosae, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Mentha haplocalyx and Paeonia lactiflora. There is however relatively little specific information on how the decoction brings about the improvement. Indeed, there exists virtually no study that employed a randomized control design with objective outcome measures to investigate efficacy of this decoction in treating chronic laryngeal inflammatory diseases. This study employed a randomized-control style to investigate the effectiveness of Yang Yin Qing Fei decoction in treating dysphonia in chronic laryngitis. Subjects with chronic laryngitis were randomly allocated into one of the two groups: (a) herbal medicine and <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> and (b) placebo treatment and <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene.</b> The outcome measures used included (a) voice range profile (phonetogram), (b) voice activity and participation profile (VAPP, Ma & Yiu, 2001) (c) sentence recording for perceptual voice evaluation, (d) stroboscopy, and (e) subjective evaluation of symptoms.

Secondly, the impact of one vocal performance on the voice was investigated by comparing objective and subjective vocal quality before and after a theater performance. Study Design: Prospective study of the actors' voice prior to and after a performance Methods: Speech samples of 26 theater actors (15 men, 11 women, mean age 41. 9 [*]years) were recorded before and after a theater performance of one and a half hour and analyzed using the software program Praat. Speech samples consisted of the combination of sustained phonation and continuous speech. For each speech sample, the Acoustic Voice Quality Index was calculated. Auditory perceptual evaluations were performed using the GRBASI scale. Questionnaires were used to inventory vocal symptoms and influencing factors. Results: Acoustic analysis showed a mean Acoustic Voice Quality Index (AVQI) of 3. 48 corresponding with a mild dysphonia. Fifty percent of the theater actors reported having (sometimes or regularly) vocal complaints after a performance. The questionnaire revealed a high presence of vocally violent behavior and poor <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> habits. Objective vocal quality, measured by the AVQI, did not change after a theater performance. The auditory perceptual evaluation of the overall grade of dysphonia showed a subtle amelioration of the vocal quality. Conclusions: The results of this study showed the presence of mild dysphonia, regular vocal complaints, and poor <b>vocal</b> <b>hygiene</b> habits in theater actors. A theater performance did not have an impact on the objective vocal qualit...|$|E
