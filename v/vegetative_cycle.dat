This rather gruesome death is in fact a ritual sacrifice, and Morana uses parts of Jarilo's body to build herself a new house.

5000|$|When {{subjected}} to environmental stress, such as nitrogen starvation {{in the case}} of Chlamydomonas, cells are induced to form gametes. Gamete formation in single-celled haploid organisms such as yeast is called sporulation, resulting in many cellular changes that increase resistance to stress. Gamete formation in multicellular fungi occurs in the gametangia, an organ specialized for such a process, usually by meiosis. When opposite mating types meet, they are induced to leave the <b>vegetative</b> <b>cycle</b> and enter the mating cycle. In yeast, there are two mating types, a and α. In fungi, there can be two, four, or even up to 10,000 mating types, depending on the species. [...] Mate recognition in the simplest eukaryotes is achieved through pheromone signaling, which induces shmoo formation (a projection of the cell) and begins the process of microtubule organization and migration. Pheromones used in mating type recognition are often peptides, but sometimes trisporic acid or other molecules, recognized by cellular receptors on the opposite cell. Notably, pheromone signaling is absent in higher fungi such as mushrooms.|$|E

50|$|When organisms were well-fed, they {{appeared}} as 4-zooid-2-nuclei pseudocolonies, and during vegetative reproduction doubled number of zooids followed by nuclei division leading to 8-zooid-4-nuclei stage with further transverse binary division into two 4-zooid-2-nuclei Polykrikos. Gamete formation was particular as pseudocolony produces 4 gametes {{of different sizes}} and morphologies than vegetative cells. Vegetative form doubled zooids and subsequently split into four gametes of a 2-zooid-1-nucleus form. Two gametes further paired up with their ventral sides and fused forming a planozygote. For P. kofoidii two copulation finger-shaped structures were observed in gametes that are presumably involved in gamete contact and fusion, but more data is needed to confirm this. The ventrally fused gametes required a complex rearrangement of eight flagella and formation of sulci and cinguli. The 4-zooid planozygote had only one nucleus and had two developmental pathways depending on food availability. Under starvation conditions the planozygote disassembled into two 2-zooid with one lacking nucleus, but further fate was not examined. Under culture conditions most organisms undergone meiosis and directly entered <b>vegetative</b> <b>cycle.</b> Very few planozygotes went through a resting cyst stage. The cyst stage persisted for 1 month, which is considered as {{a relatively short period}} in comparison to other dinoflagellates, which obligate dormancy period may reach up to 6 month. The duration of encystment is associated with ecological foraging strategies. Short dormancy period could facilitate rapid cycling between life cycle stages that could be beneficial to heterotrophic species in case of fluctuating food availability. However, possibility of chemical signalling involved in cyst hatching for Polykrikos is yet to be determined.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Nostoc punctiforme is a phenotypically complex, filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, whose {{vegetative}} {{cells can}} mature in four developmental directions. The particular developmental direction {{is determined by}} environmental signals. The <b>vegetative</b> cell <b>cycle</b> is maintained when nutrients are sufficient. Limitation for combined nitrogen induces the terminal differentiation of heterocysts, cells specialized for nitrogen fixation in an oxic environment. A number of unique regulatory events and genes have been identified and integrated into a working model of heterocyst differentiation. Phosphate limitation induces the transient differentiation of akinetes, spore-like cells resistant to cold and desiccation. A variety of environmental changes, {{both positive and negative}} for growth, induce the transient differentiation of hormogonia, motile filaments that function in dispersal. Initiation of the differentiation of heterocysts, akinetes and hormogonia are hypothesized to depart from the <b>vegetative</b> cell <b>cycle,</b> following separate and distinct events. N. punctiforme also forms nitrogen-fixing symbiotic associations; its plant partners influence the differentiation and behavior of hormogonia and heterocysts.

Ruminant digestive apparatus shows high degree of structural and functional variability, reached by means of evolutionary steps; Hofmann demonstrated the occurrence of seasonal adaptations of the digestive system in relation to forage availability and climatic conditions. Anatomical researches, supporting eco-vegetational investigations focused on the maintenance of pastoral ecosystem biodiversity demonstrated modifications of the sheep rumen related to the <b>vegetative</b> <b>cycle</b> of pasture and to interannual climatic differences. At rumen level, four indicative regions were monitored: atrium, dorsal and ventral sac, and dorsocaudal blindsac floor.

40|$|Two {{abundant}} high-mobility-group (HMG) -like proteins, HMG B and HMG C, {{exist in}} the ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena thermophila. Of these, HMG C is specific to transcriptionally active macronuclei, while HMG B is found in macronuclei and in transcriptionally inactive micronuclei [1]. Using Northern and in situ analyses, we show that the genes encoding HMG B and HMG C are not expressed uniformly throughout the <b>vegetative</b> <b>cycle</b> or during the sexual process, conjugation. Elevated expression of both genes is observed during macronuclear S phase of the <b>vegetative</b> <b>cycle</b> and during endoreplication of developing new macronuclei in later stages of conjugation. Interruption {{of any of these}} macronuclear DNA replications by aphidicolin leads to a rapid drop in the message levels of HMG B and HMG C. These results resemble what is typically observed for replication-dependent nucleosomal histones and differ from the apparent lack of cell cycle regulation observed for HMG genes in vertebrates. A specific-induction of HMG B mRNA is also observed early in conjugation and during this interval, inhibition of micronuclear DNA synthesis by aphidicolin does not affect the message level of HMG B. Thus, during conjugation, expression of HMG B shows both replication-dependent and independent regulation. Results similar to these with HMG B are obtained with histone H 4 II gene, a gene which is also expressed during micro- and macronuclear S phases during the <b>vegetative</b> <b>cycle.</b> These results demonstrate surprising complexity in the expression of HMG genes in Tetrahymena and lend support to the hypothesis that cell cycle regulation {{plays an important role in}} directing HMG-like proteins to the appropriate nucleus [2].

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the morphogenic, structural, and productive characteristics of Cenchrus ciliaris L. in response to different doses of biofertilizers that originate from the anaerobic biodigestion of goat and sheep fecal matter on Yellow Argisoil. The experiment was performed in a greenhouse, in a completely randomized factorial design using two types of biofertilizers and five dosages (0 %, 2. 5 %, 5. 0 %, 7. 5 %, and 10 % of soil volume), with four repeats, for the duration of two <b>vegetative</b> <b>cycles.</b> In the first cycle, there was an increase in leaf lifespan and leaf/stem ratio with the use of 10 % and 7. 5 % caprine biofertilizer, respectively. From the second cycle, doses of biofertilizers between 7. 5 % and 10 % led to an improvement in the development of the morphogenic variables - leaf sprouting rate, leaf and pseudostem elongation rate, leaf lifespan, and senescence, as well as the structural characteristics - expanded leaf length and width, number of sprouting, expanded and live leaves, and expanded/expanding leaf ratio, resulting in a 73 % increase in biomass. It was concluded that the use of biofertilizers improves the main morphogenic and structural characteristics of Cenchrus ciliaris L., resulting in increased fodder mass yield...|$|R
