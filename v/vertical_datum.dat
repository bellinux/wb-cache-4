5|$|Two {{different}} {{measures are}} used for storm tide and storm surge measurements. Storm tide is measured using a geodetic <b>vertical</b> <b>datum</b> (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since storm surge {{is defined as the}} rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm surge is measured using tidal predictions, with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm surge can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station. Tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic <b>vertical</b> <b>datum</b> to mean sea level (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.|$|E

40|$|The Vertical Offshore Reference Frame (VORF) is a {{model of}} various <b>vertical</b> <b>datums</b> as {{continuous}} surfaces relative to ETRF 89 that covers all the navigable waters of Great Britain and Ireland. The intended accuracy of the model was to determine the <b>vertical</b> <b>datums</b> of LAT, MLWS, MSL and CD to within 0. 100 m in near-shore areas and 0. 150 m in offshore areas bringing significant advantages to future hydrographic applications. Validation of the model to date has shown that it is fit for purpose under caveats that: advise caution in its use thereby limiting the liability of the UKHO; recommend the model is monitored and updated when new data is available; suggest documentation outlining a suitable method for testing the model is made available. The aim of this dissertation was to investigate a suitable, robust and repeatable methodology for validating the VORF transformation model. A methodology was developed after thorough investigation of vertical reference surfaces, the methods used to create VORF, the tests carried out to date and the available technology. The methodology required performing a harmonic tidal analysis on tidal data collected with a sub-sea pressure gauge positioned relative to ETRF 89. Vertical positioning was achieved by simultaneously recording both the depth of water over the gauge and the height of the water surface from a fixed surface radar gauge. These values were deducted from the ETRF 89 height of the radar gauge which had been established by means of a short levelling connection to a GPS base station. To authenticate this methodology it was implemented at two locations in the SW of England; Polperro and Brixham. This investigation showed that the methodology {{has the potential to be}} used for identifying anomalies in the VORF transformation model; however divergence between the curves observed simultaneously by the two tide gauges rendered the determination of the ellipsoidal height of the sub-sea pressure gauge uncertain and the findings of this dissertation inconclusive...|$|R
