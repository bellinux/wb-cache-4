This article places the pink film in the larger context of postwar erotic cinema.|$|E

They {{are available in}} many output power ratings with either UV-transmitting or blocking windows. The reflector options are parabolic (for collimated light) or elliptical (for focused light).

25|$|Microscopic mirrors are a core {{element of}} many of the largest high-definition {{televisions}} and <b>video</b> <b>projectors.</b> A common technology of this type is Texas Instruments' DLP. A DLP chip is a postage stamp-sized microchip whose surface is an array of millions of microscopic mirrors. The picture is created as the individual mirrors move to either reflect light toward the projection surface (pixel on), or toward a light absorbing surface (pixel off).|$|E

Materials and methods: Software implementing a full-threshold 4 - 2 -step staircase algorithm for the central 30 - 2 of the visual field (76 points) has been developed and tested in nine eyes of seven patients using an Epson TW 700 <b>video</b> <b>projector.</b> The results were compared to those obtained from the same patients using the Humphrey perimeter. Results: High correlation between the <b>video</b> <b>projector</b> visual fields {{and those of the}} Humphrey perimeter was found. The point-to-point correlation coefficient ranged from 0. 75 to 0. 90, with P< 0. 0001 for each eye. Conclusion: Visual field examination results using a <b>video</b> <b>projector</b> have high correlation with those of a Humphrey perimeter. The method is possibly suitable for clinical use.

25|$|Composition on the Table (1998/99) {{comprises}} {{four white}} tables bearing physical interface components: switches, dials, and turntables. Computer graphics images are projected onto the tables from ceiling-mounted <b>video</b> <b>projectors,</b> and loudspeakers are present. As the audience manipulates the interface elements, graphical and audio changes {{take place in}} a way that is intimately connected to the audience's input. The objective of this work was to create a mixed reality environment where multiple participants could create visuals and music together. Elements of this work are recognizable in Iwai's Nintendo DS videogame Electroplankton. The piece was presented as part of the Art Gallery at SIGGRAPH'99, Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|National Museum was {{designed}} in Neo-Palladian and Renaissance style {{and consists of}} two rectangular parallel blocks, with a dome {{at the front of}} the building. Its architects were Henry McCallum who designed the original version and J.F. McNair who designed the scaled down version of the building. The building has two rotundas, a new glass-clad rotunda at the rear area of the building. Its glass rotunda is a cylindrical shaped building which is made up of two drums, with the outer one made of glass which sheaths an inner one made of wire mesh. Black out curtains has the same length of the inner drum with images projected on sixteen <b>video</b> <b>projectors</b> in the day. The curtains are drawn after sunset, and projection can be beamed out through the glass to get a view of the city. Coats of arms are found on the building's front.|$|E

25|$|Iwai {{was born}} in Kira, Aichi, Japan. As a child, he spent time {{creating}} flip book-style animations {{in the corner of}} text books and making motor-driven mechanical toys, since these were the only technologies available to him. In 1981 Iwai matriculated in the Fine Arts Department at the University of Tsukuba, studying Plastic Art and Mixed Media. Influenced by the work of Norman McLaren, he began producing installation art that combined pre-cinema animation techniques (the phenakistoscope and the zoetrope) with modern methods of image capture and creation (photocopiers, video cameras and computer graphics) and of stroboscopic lighting (video monitors, <b>video</b> <b>projectors</b> and LEDs). His 1985 installation Time Stratum won the Gold prize at the High Technology Art Exhibition '85, held in Shibuya Seibu, Tokyo. Time Stratum II was awarded the Grand Prize at the 17th Contemporary Japanese Art Exhibition, Meguro Art Museum, Tokyo. In 1987 Iwai graduated from the University of Tsukuba with a master's degree in Plastic Art and Mixed Media. In the same year, Iwai designed his first published videogame, Otocky, in association with ASCII Corporation.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology {{relies on the}} rotation of the axis of linear polarization by the liquid crystal array. Light from the backlight (or the back reflective layer, in devices not including or requiring a backlight) first passes through a linear polarizing sheet. That polarized light passes through the actual liquid crystal layer which may be organized in pixels (for a TV or computer monitor) or in another format such as a seven-segment display or one with custom symbols for a particular product. The liquid crystal layer is produced with a consistent right (or left) handed chirality, essentially consisting of tiny helices. This causes circular birefringence, and is engineered so that there is a 90 degree rotation of the linear polarization state. However, when a voltage is applied across a cell, the molecules straighten out, lessening or totally losing the circular birefringence. On the viewing side of the display is another linear polarizing sheet, usually oriented at 90 degrees from the one behind the active layer. Therefore, when the circular birefringence is removed by the application of a sufficient voltage, the polarization of the transmitted light remains at right angles to the front polarizer, and the pixel appears dark. With no voltage, however, the 90 degree rotation of the polarization causes it to exactly match the axis of the front polarizer, allowing the light through. Intermediate voltages create intermediate rotation of the polarization axis and the pixel has an intermediate intensity. Displays based on this principle are widespread, and now are used {{in the vast majority of}} televisions, computer monitors and <b>video</b> <b>projectors,</b> rendering the previous CRT technology essentially obsolete. The use of polarization in the operation of LCD displays is immediately apparent to someone wearing polarized sunglasses, often making the display unreadable.|$|E

500|$|On January 1, 2002, the National Council {{required}} all councils {{to implement}} the updated Wood Badge for the 21st Century program which removed much of the Boy Scout-specific information from the program. This allowed the National Council to designate Wood Badge as the advanced leadership training program for Cub Scout, Boy Scout, Varsity [...] Scout, Venturing, council leaders, district leaders, and professional staff. It replaced both Boy Scout Leader Wood Badge and Cub Scout Trainer Wood Badge. Unlike the prior Wood Badge course which was conducted entirely outdoors, the modified Wood Badge program is delivered through a lecture classroom environment and in a short outdoor camping experience.

2500|$|Under the {{directorship}} of Terence Murtagh in the 1970s, Armagh Planetarium introduced {{many new}} technologies. Murtagh recognised {{the possibility of}} exploiting the new technology of <b>video</b> <b>projectors</b> to provide the show’s special effects, eliminating entirely the need for dozens of slide projectors. Video tape recorders were very new and rare at this time and this research was very ambitious with many technical hurdles standing in the way. [...] Off-the-shelf <b>video</b> <b>projectors</b> had to be optically and electronically modified to present natural-looking images of celestial bodies on the dome.
