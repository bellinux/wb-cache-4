KOMPAS was chosen by researcher as the object within December 2006 1 st until May 2007 31 st. Researcher assumed there would be some number of increasing report right before an annual day of mud disaster. To answer how the photos report in mud disaster, researcher use content analysis. The most important think is the structure of categories. The 4 categories are theme (economic, social, culture and education), kind of photos (news and features), the way of publishing the photos (single, illustration and stories photos), and the last one is angle (high, eye level and low angle). Researcher uses 2 coders to knowing how the objectivity is. From the research result, KOMPAS mostly report the social side of the mud disaster with 81 photos. In second categories, KOMPAS was publishing 55 news photos and 48 features photos. It shows that KOMPAS has a photographer standard by featuring the news. In the next categories, KOMPAS was publishing 52 single photos, 44 illustrations photos and 1 story photos. Even stories photos are highest level of photojournalism, KOMPAS only once publishing the story photos. It shows the tide selectivity of one story photos. The last categories, KOMPAS mostly report the mud disaster by the high angle with 47 photos. By the result, researcher had an advice that photos report in education section could be increasing beside the social and economic side. The publishing of emotional photos in one page newspaper is the next advice because that will be a reminder to all people about how long does the fight of those mud disaster victims.

40|$|Previous event-related {{potential}} (ERP) {{studies have}} provided mixed results regarding the earliest manifestations of conscious <b>visual</b> <b>report.</b> One {{possible explanation for}} the results could be that conscious visual perception emerges progressively rather than appearing as a binary transition. In the present study, we used electrical neuroimaging to identify the stages of processing that lead to the successful conscious identification of a briefly presented degraded stimulus. Grayscale images of faces and butterflies were presented for 16 ms and their visibility was manipulated by means of random image structure evolution (RISE). Three levels of RISE image distortions were used for each image. First, we determined an individual detection threshold of 50 % for each subject. We then added two control conditions, namely fully degraded stimuli and stimuli that yielded 80 % detection. Topographic ERP analyses revealed distinct effects for identified and unidentified stimuli at the threshold of detection. Four stages were observed that distinguished successful from unsuccessful stimulus identification. This shows that the events associated with conscious perception occurs at several distinct stages in time starting as early as 220 ms after stimulus presentation, rather than translating as a single temporal event and includes marked top-down activations when identification becomes difficult...|$|E

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: To {{develop a}} {{computer}} program that supports the overview of a follow-up care process in people {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI) in daily clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: To create a new electronic tool based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) that enables information to be registered and visualized, including the use of a net-diagram ('spider') to show a patient's long-term development. This diagram helps the clinician to recognize predispositions over time, as well as making information accessible to the patient, so as to involve him as a participant in defining current and future treatment options. Furthermore, guidelines for the prevention of common diseases, based on the recommendations of internal medicine, rehabilitation medicine and findings in the SCI literature, were implemented to provide enhanced health coaching in the area of preventative care. METHODS: In an outpatient setting, four perspectives were assessed: patient, physician, occupational therapist and physiotherapist for a comprehensive bio-psycho-social consideration. All categories were assessed and graphically visualized with the electronic tool, {{on the basis of the}} ICF domains: body function, activities/participation and environmental factors. RESULTS: The assessed data were summarized and graphically represented using three spider charts. CONCLUSION: The tool facilitates the patient counselling and the interdisciplinary work in daily clinical practice. Such a <b>visual</b> <b>report</b> helps to recognize predispositions over time. Furthermore, it helps to explain the clinical and patient-related findings accessible to the patients, to involve them as participants in defining the goals and the treatment plan...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} devised to select those clinical chemistry results that have a high probability of error for inclusion on a discrepancy report, which is printed on demand throughout the day. Each report entry is evaluated by a supervisor, who decides whether to accept the result or to re-assay. With this program, 8. 4 % of all results were included on the report, 1. 9 % were re-assayed, and 0. 83 % were judged to be in error and corrected. Checking results {{at the time of}} their re-lease to the computer has led to earlier report delivery and more convenient timing of re-assays without com-promise of patient safety. AddItIonal Keyphrases: screening of data on patients After implementation of a laboratory computer system in the clinical chemistry section of our labora-tory, it became possible to enhance quality control by <b>visual</b> <b>report</b> checking. As the numerous separate re-ports formerly issued on a single patient had now been collated into three daily nursing-unit reports followed by a cumulative six-day summary report each evening, convenient formats were available for comparing results on patients, and discrepancies were found that would have previously escaped no-tice. However, there were several obvious drawbacks to the visual checking system. First, the amount of time required to check more than 2900 results daily led to a delay in report delivery. Second, discrepancies went unnoticed by even the most experienced, well-moti-vated observers. Third, most discrepancies were found after the afternoon report printout. As a con-sequence, the re-assays created a burden for evening personnel, and, in some instances, had to be deferred until the following day, with resulting danger to the patient and inconvenience to the attending staff...|$|E
40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to contribute to the academic literature by developing a comprehensive multi-modal framework to document the impression management strategies that might underpin the narrative and visual material voluntarily included in corporate annual reports. The analysis takes as its starting point the seminal work of Goffman [1959] into self-presentation, widely acknowledged as the first comprehensive exposition of the sociological phenomenon of impression management. The eight elements identified by Goffman in his dramaturgical description of impression management performances are presented as an integrated conceptual model from which such behaviour can be analysed. Using a meso-paradigmatic approach, propositions are developed which underpin a multi-level theory explaining how micro-level incentives motivate individual organisational members to engage collectively in impression management behaviour at a meso (team) level to produce macro-level organisational phenomena such as organisational image or reputation. Prior research into impression management and organisational phenomena has typically either anthropomorphised the organisation or employed a personification metaphor in which the organisation is equated to an individual to facilitate analysis. Neither of these approaches, both of which lack empirical validity, is utilised here because the view articulated in the multi-level theory is one of the organisation as a coalition of individual actors, working collectively to produce what observers perceive as the actions or outcomes of the organisation. Focus then narrows {{to the use of the}} corporate annual report as a strategic impression management instrument. The approach adopted is holistic and multi-modal because, as Goffman [1959] clearly articulated, impression management performances are of this nature. In the context of annual reporting, it is the combination of narrative and <b>visual</b> <b>report</b> content that represents the elements of the impression management performance. However, the question of whether mutually supportive narrative and visual strategies are adopted within and across the various sections and subsections of the annual reports has been largely ignored. As such, any understanding of impression management activity in annual reports is partial at best, and it may be the case that behaviour has been misunderstood or misinterpreted. To facilitate the required holistic view, an integrated framework of mutually supportive rhetorical elements for narrative and visual annual report content is developed. This forms the basis from which three exploratory research questions are formulated. Case study analysis of the reporting practices of five large listed Australian companies is presented to explore these research questions. The evidence suggests that, on the whole, the nature of voluntary disclosure in the annual reports studied is consistent with the staging of a holistic impression management performance in the Goffmanian sense. i...|$|E
