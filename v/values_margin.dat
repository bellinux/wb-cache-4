40|$|In general, {{air quality}} is {{determined}} from {{the concentrations of}} pollutants in ambient air. Air quality criteria (limit and target <b>values,</b> <b>margin</b> of tolerances, upper and lower assessment thresholds) {{are based on the}} current legislative framework. In Slovakia, the air quality criteria are imposed by Decree No 360 / 2010 Coll, on air quality, of the Ministry of Environment [1]. In relation to the implemented measurements, it is necessary to choose effective tools needed for the pre-processing and post-processing of overall air quality assessment. The article aims at applying suitable GIS tools in the assessment process of air quality in the Košice agglomeration for the selected period 2008 - 2010. In the overall assessment of the area in question, the processing of information on emissions declared as particulate matter (PM) was considered in terms of a conservative approach to the assessment of air quality for PM 10. For the assessment, the yearbooks and reports on air quality in Slovakia in 2008 - 2010 of the Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute (SHMI) and professional publication...|$|E
40|$|For many {{assets and}} {{liabilities}} there exist deep and liquid markets so that the market value are readily observed. However, for non-hedgeable risks, {{the market value of}} liabilities must be estimated. The Draft Solvency II Directive suggests in article 75 that the valuation of technical provisions (for non hedgeable risks) shall be the sum of a best estimate and a market <b>value</b> <b>margin</b> measuring the cost of risk. The market <b>value</b> <b>margin</b> is calculated as the present value of the cost of holding the solvency capital requirement for non-hedgeable risks during the whole run-off period of the in-force portoflio. One of the major input of the market <b>value</b> <b>margin</b> is the cost-of-capital rate which corresponds to the risk premium applied on each unit of risk. According to European Commission (2007), European Insurance and Reinsurance Federation (2008), and Chief Risk Officer Forum (2008), a single cost-of-capital rate shall be used by all insurance undertakings and for all lines of business. This paper aims at analyzing the cost-of-capital rate given by European Insurance and Reinsurance Federation (2008), and Chief Risk Officer Forum (2008). In particular, we highlight that {{it is very difficult to}} assess a cost-of-capital rate by using either the frictional cost approach or the ful...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the newly}} {{developing}} International Accounting Standards, {{the evaluation of the}} liabilities arising from the outstanding claims of a general insurance portfolio should contain a market-based adjustment for risk, referred to as the market <b>value</b> <b>margin.</b> Sources of risk {{to be taken into account}} in the assessment of the market <b>value</b> <b>margin</b> are the process risk, the parameter risk and the model risk. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how the stochastic models for the future payments, based on the framework of generalised linear models and quasi-likelihood models can be used to evaluate these types of risk and, in particular, to reduce the model risk. Following a classical approach in the statistical literature, the classes of models with variance and link functions of the power family are considered. The comparison of models is performed through the log-likelihood for models with distribution in the exponential dispersion family and through the extended quasi-likelihood in the semi-parametric case in which only the first and second moments of the response variables are specified. Numerical examples on real data illustrate the methodology. KW Stochastic claims reserving,Generalized linear models,Quasi-likelihood models,Mean squared error of prediction,Model risk...|$|R

While traditionally {{the interest rate}} has been regarded as the important feature of a loan, we argue that leverage is sometimes even more important. Monitoring leverage provides information about how risk builds up during booms as leverage rises and how crises start when leverage on new loans sharply declines. Leverage data is also a crucial input for crisis management and lending facilities. Leverage at the asset level can be monitored by down payments or margin requirement or and haircuts, giving a model-free measure that can be observed directly, in contrast to other measures of systemic risk that require complex estimation.

Design/methodology/approach The study adopts correlation analysis of a sample comprised of 51 European companies from 14 industries across 15 countries to investigate the possible relationship between firm environmental performance (includes three measures: sustainable <b>value,</b> sustainable <b>value</b> <b>margin,</b> and return to cost ratio) and financial performance. Findings The paper does not find a positive relationship between firm environmental performance and financial performance.

Together with grape and wine production, it {{has become one}} of the instruments responsible for economic development in the Rota do Vale dos Vinhedos (Valley of Vineyards Route) in the municipality of Bento Gonçalves., Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. In Vale dos Vinhedos, the economy has specialized in grapegrowing and winemaking (viticulture and viniculture). The activities of current types of cultivation and production systems in the Valley present different situations, both in terms of generating economic surpluses and their distribution among the agents that participate in their appropriation, consequently leading to different impacts on the dynamics of development in this region. The main purpose of this paper is to study the economy of the Vale dos Vinhedos Route development during the 1990 - 2005 period, looking at variables wine and tourism as potential factors driving change in the local economy.
