5|$|The Minister for Environment, Faisal Saleh Hayat, {{stated that}} he had {{requested}} security for the building, but authorities had failed to provide it. Contrary to claims made earlier, Hayat said the ministry was never ordered to <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> before Pakistan Rangers deployed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the sale}} the {{building}} was mainly used for storage whilst planning applications to convert it into a hotel were made in 1986, 1993, and 2001, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The coroner's court was the last to <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises,</b> in 1998. In 2001, {{the building was}} placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register. By 2004 it was in steep decline, and momentum was building for the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels, to act.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{restoration}} {{work was}} scheduled for 2002, however the operators of the polyclinic were reluctant to leave, having occupied the building for over 40 years. In order to force the occupants out of the building, the workers boarded {{up all of the}} windows and threatened to do the same to the doors if the polyclinic did not <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises.</b> Only the president's involvement in the matter forced the polyclinic to move out completely.|$|E
25|$|Xerox <b>vacated</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> at 1200 N. Nimitz Highway {{after the}} shooting. This {{facility}} was vacant until 2004, when {{the producers of}} the TV show Lost built a sound stage there to film indoor scenes.|$|R
25|$|The various {{buildings}} are related by design {{with the intent}} to form exterior spaces which would be pleasing for its users, and were used for church school activities until November 1983 when <b>the</b> school <b>vacated</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises.</b> <b>The</b> spaces contained within the whole block have been adapted for public use, and form one of the major buildings in the Central Area.|$|R
50|$|In 1966 Canon Parsons handed-over {{ownership}} {{of the house and}} grounds to the college but, during {{the latter part of the}} 20th century <b>the</b> college <b>vacated</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> which have since been used as a cookery school and a finishing school.|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of the 9th, Crowe met with the {{committee}} and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5p.m. to <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises.</b> Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments. Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off. While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.|$|E
25|$|In October 1990, {{the militant}} Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), {{forcibly}} expelled the entire Muslim population (approx 65,000) from the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. The Muslims were given 48 hours to <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> {{of their homes}} while their properties were subsequently looted by LTTE. Those who refused to leave were killed. This act of ethnic cleansing was carried out so the LTTE could facilitate their goal of creating a mono-ethnic Tamil state in Northern Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|In December 2004, 89-year-old Miller {{announced}} that he had been in love with 34-year-old minimalist painter Agnes Barley and had been living with her at his Connecticut farm since 2002, and that they intended to marry. Within hours of her father's death, Rebecca Miller ordered Barley to <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises,</b> having consistently opposed the relationship. Miller's final play, Finishing the Picture, opened at the Goodman Theatre, Chicago, in the fall of 2004, with one character said to be based on Barley. It was reported to be based on his experience during the filming The Misfits, though Miller insisted the play is a work of fiction with independent characters that were no more than composite shadows of history.|$|E

25|$|In early 1923, and in poor health, Baird {{moved to}} 21 Linton Crescent, Hastings, {{on the south}} coast of England. He later rented a {{workshop}} in the Queen's Arcade in the town. Baird built {{what was to become}} the world's first working television set using items including an old hatbox and a pair of scissors, some darning needles, a few bicycle light lenses, a used tea chest, and sealing wax and glue that he purchased. In February 1924, he demonstrated to the Radio Times that a semi-mechanical analogue television system was possible by transmitting moving silhouette images. In July of the same year, he received a 1000-volt electric shock, but survived with only a burnt hand, and as a result his landlord, Mr Tree, asked him to <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises.</b> Baird gave the first public demonstration of moving silhouette images by television at Selfridges department store in London in a three-week series of demonstrations beginning on 25 March 1925.|$|E
2500|$|Pejoratively {{known as}} [...] "The Tuesday Massacre," [...] on the 25th of July, 2017, {{less than a}} month into the Malkowich acquisition, newly {{installed}} management summarily pink-slipped 17 senior staff. The largest lay-off in Antelope Valley Press history, at time of dismissal 17 senior employees were systematically ordered into the office at day's end, handed State of California EDD unemployment insurance pamphlets by Malkowich's newly installed enterprise management team, before being told they have 10 minutes to clean out their desks, and <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{was used as}} temporary space for offices dislocated by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process, {{as well as the}} ongoing Pentagon Renovation Program. This caused the building's life to be extended to 2011. [...] Occupants refused to <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> by the date set by the demolition program manager, causing him to cut off food service and remove the ATM to get them to leave. For the year after the {{building was}} emptied, it was used for training exercises for law enforcement officials including SWAT teams, some of which included paintball and controlled explosions.|$|E
50|$|The 75830 {{square feet}} {{building}} sits on 2.33 arces lot.

50|$|The {{front office}} staff <b>vacated</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> on January 23, 2009. Demolition began in March 2009 with {{the removal of}} the playing field. On May 13, 2009, the process of {{removing}} seats began and was completed on June 8. On September 3 and 4, the iconic white facade was dismantled.|$|R
60|$|Her {{escape from}} the village had been much easier than she had anticipated. The knife which she had used to cut {{her way through the}} brush wall of the hut to freedom she had found {{sticking}} in the wall of her prison, doubtless left there by accident when a former tenant had <b>vacated</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises.</b>|$|R
2500|$|During the American Civil War, Texas {{joined the}} Confederacy, and the Alamo complex {{was taken over}} by the Confederate Army. In February 1861, the Texan Militia, under {{direction}} from the Texas Secession Convention and led by Ben McCullough and Sam Maverick, confronted General Twiggs, commander of all US Forces in Texas and headquartered at the Alamo. Twiggs elected to surrender and all supplies were turned over to the Texans. [...] Following the Confederacy's defeat, the United States Army again maintained control over the Alamo. [...] Shortly after the war ended, however, the Catholic Church requested that the army <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> so that the Alamo could become a place of worship for local German Catholics. [...] The army refused, and the church made no further attempts at retaking the complex.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, Vel√°squez began {{focusing}} on {{national and international}} companies in addition to local growers. [...] "It {{was a big mistake}} to go after individual farmers," [...] he said, [...] "instead of {{focusing on}} the large corporations. [...] We spent a lot of years doing that, and it was a mistake." [...] From 1970 to 1983, Velasquez implemented a long-term strategy to build public support for the farmworkers, publicizing the discrimination, low wages, and often appalling working conditions they faced. In 1976, workers at a tomato cannery in Warren, Indiana, struck over the employer's tactic of overrecruiting workers in order to force down wages. The workers spontaneously barricaded themselves inside the cannery, refusing to allow the perishable crop inside until their grievances had been addressed. The workers asked FLOC to intervene. A federal district court issued an injunction requiring that the workers <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises,</b> but they refused. Although nearly all the workers were arrested, there was extensive publicity about the strike, the employer's overrcruitment tactic, the low wages and unsanitary conditions the workers suffered, {{and the use of the}} Immigration and Naturalization Service to intimidate workers and avoid paying them (through deportation proceedings). Vel√°squez later said the tomato cannery strike helped improve FLOC's negotiating and worker mobilization skills and provided a trial run for the union's dealings with large corporations.|$|E
60|$|When he had gone, {{worry and}} dread {{replaced}} this other confusing emotion. She {{turned to the}} business of meeting events. Before supper she packed her valuables and books, papers, and clothes, together with Bo's, and had them in readiness so if she was forced to <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> she would have her personal possessions.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, Pitney {{returned}} to {{ownership of the}} Variety Store and Jack Reagan returned {{at the same time}} to work for him.

After Pitney closed the store, <b>the</b> Reagans <b>vacated</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> in December 1920 and moved to Dixon, Illinois.|$|R
50|$|After {{the player}} {{has left the}} final battle, if he chose to end him the {{haunting}} young girl appears. She pours blood onto {{the ashes of the}} leader, and he is resurrected.

50|$|Callahan leads {{a daytime}} assault on Barlow's manor, {{only to find}} that <b>the</b> vampire has <b>vacated</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> in {{anticipation}} of their attack. However, the group uses the opportunity to slay the vampiric Susan, who Barlow had changed during her and Mark Petrie's earlier assault on the house, and purify the house against future vampire occupation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Moreover, American matrons are overworked {{because some}} unaccountable glamour {{leads them to}} {{continue}} to bring up their girls in the same inefficient physical habits which resulted in so much misery to themselves. Housework as they are obliged to do it, untrained, untaught, exhausted, and in company with rude, dirty, unkempt foreigners, seems to them a degradation which they will spare to their daughters. The daughter goes on with her schools and accomplishments, and leads in the family {{the life of an}} elegant little visitor during all those years when a young girl might be gradually developing and strengthening her muscles in healthy household work. It never occurs to her that she can or ought to fill any of the domestic gaps into which her mother always steps; and she comforts herself with the thought, 'I don't know how; I can't; I haven't the strength. I can't sweep; it blisters my hands. If I should stand at the ironing-table an hour, I should be ill for a week. As to cooking, I don't know anything about it.' And so, when the cook, or the chambermaid, or nurse, or all together, <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises,</b> it is the mamma who is successively cook, and chambermaid, and nurse; and this is the reason why matrons fade and are overworked.|$|E
