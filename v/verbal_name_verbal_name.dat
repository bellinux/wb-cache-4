40|$|Is {{visual memory}} purely visual, {{or is it}} {{mediated}} by words? Our ability to remember visual objects may depend on our ability to verbally name them. We tested this idea by looking for an effect of an extraneous verbal task on visual memory. If visual memory is purely visual, {{there should not be}} any interference from the verbal task. Instead, we find that having to remember a verbally-presented telephone number impairs visual memory. The effect is as strong on remembering a picture as on remembering a word, the name of the picture. Thus the visual and verbal memory tasks are competing for a common resource. Furthermore, we find that memory performance decreases with the number of syllables in the name of an object, even if observers are only tested with a visual representation of the object.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{influence}} of spokesperson appearance (visual congruence) and the sounds contained in a spokesperson’s <b>name</b> (<b>verbal</b> congruence) on consumer perceptions of spokesperson–product fit. Design/methodology/approach: Two experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 ensured that verbal congruence impacted perceptions of spokesperson–product fit. Experiment 2 compared the effect of verbal congruence versus traditional match-up (visual congruence) on perceptions of spokesperson–product fit. The mediating role of spokesperson–product fit on attitude towards the advertisement and the moderating role of need for cognition (NFC) was also tested. Findings: Findings indicate that verbal congruence influences consumer perceptions of fit, regardless of visual congruence. Perceptions of spokesperson–product fit also act as mediators between visual and verbal congruence and attitude towards the advertisement. However, verbal congruence did not influence consumer perceptions of spokesperson–product fit when the NFC was low. Research limitations/implications: This research has implications for advertisers and brand managers considering the creation of a name for a non-celebrity spokesperson or the development of a brand/spokes-character. However, this research is limited, as it examines only male names. Originality/value: This research shows that perceptions of spokesperson and product fit are not only influenced by spokesperson appearance (visual congruence) but also by spokesperson <b>name</b> (<b>verbal</b> congruence). This research also identifies limitations of the applicability of phonetic symbolism theory by identifying a condition under which phonetic symbolism (verbal congruence) exerts no effects on perceptions of spokesperson–product fit...|$|R

Previous studies have linked affective and cognitive symptoms of MDD to white matter (WM) disruption in limbic-cortical circuits.

Fractional anisotropy (FA) as a measure of WM integrity was investigated in 17 elderly MDD subjects in comparison with 18 age-matched controls using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and correlated with clinical and cognitive parameters. MDD patients revealed significantly reduced FA in the right posterior cingulate cluster (PCC) compared with controls.

A least-squares criterion of fit between prototypes and test samples was used for classification. The most significant results were these. By averaging over different subjects, as well as trials, we created prototypes from brain waves evoked by simple visual images and test samples from brain waves evoked by auditory or visual words naming the visual images.

40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} word-retrieval treatments for aphasia has generally focused on approaches that have targeted either the semantic or phonologic levels of processing (Nickels, 2002). There {{have been a few}} instances in which orthographic approaches have been studied and positive effects have been reported. Most often, letter to sound correspondences have been trained to facilitate self-cueing (see Nickels 2002 for a review), but letters cues alone have also been used (Herbert, Best, Hickin, Howard, & Osborne, 2001). An underlying assumption of such strategies is that knowledge of the written form is relatively intact. Consequently, there may be limited applicability of orthographic training in aphasia. During the course of testing the relative effects of a semantic cueing treatment and a phonologic cueing treatment, a participant, MA, insisted that her response to the treatments would be much better if she were provided the written form of the word. The treatment protocol could not be adjusted during the course of that investigation to accommodate her request.

40|$|The {{present study}} was a pilot {{investigation}} that examined the role of vocabulary level and task type in rapid automatized naming tasks (RAN/RAS) in 15 adolescent children (ages 10 - 13) with average reading abilities and with reading disorders. A series of four RAN/RAS tasks controlled for vocabulary type (nouns/verbs) and categorical complexity (one lexical category/two lexical categories/three lexical categories) were completed by the adolescents. <b>Verbal</b> <b>naming</b> completion time (seconds) and accuracy (percentage) for these tasks were compared to baseline rapid naming measures (naming time and accuracy) from the RAN/RAS test (Wolf & Denckla, 2005). These two RAN/RAS tasks represented differential vocabulary levels, as the baseline RAN/RAS test contains lower level vocabulary while the experimental RAN/RAS tasks contain higher level vocabulary. The relationship of these RAN/RAS measures were compared to a battery of pre-experimental tests including vocabulary skills (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-IV) and reading abilities involving rapid decoding and contextual reading fluency measures (Test of Word Reading Efficiency and Gray Oral Reading Test-IV). A two group design was used measuring participants under two conditions of baseline measures and several experimental tasks. A significant effect was found for vocabulary level as participants had longer <b>verbal</b> <b>naming</b> completion times for experimental RAN/RAS tasks as compared to standardized (baseline) RAN/RAS subtests. Furthermore, experimental and standardized RAN/RAS tasks were significantly correlated suggesting that all participants, regardless of reading ability, had comparable performance on both tasks for naming speed. Participants {{were found to have}} greater naming speed as a function of age. The RAN task, in both baseline and experimental task, was found to have the longest naming time for all participants. No group, vocabulary level, or task type effects were found for accuracy measures.   Additional correlations for pre-experimental testing revealed significant relationships between the Gray Oral Reading Test-IV and Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) and between the Gray Oral Reading Test-IV and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-IV for all participants. Relationships between these reading and receptive language tests were not found to correlate with the experimental RAN/RAS tasks; however, the TOWRE was found to correlate with the standardized RAN/RAS test. Results of group differences should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of adolescents with reading disorders. This investigation serves as a pilot study that examines the nature of rapid naming tasks in adolescents and the effects of task parameters in relationship to reading fluency. Clinically, this investigation underscores the use of naming speed and not accuracy when RAN/RAS tasks are used in a reading assessment battery. Further research is suggested relating to the effects of age and vocabulary level on RAN/RAS measures and the relationship of these factors to reading ability in the adolescent population.   M.
