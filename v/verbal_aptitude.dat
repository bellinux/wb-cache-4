A series of regression analyses were performed for boys and girls separately to obtain Cohen's (1992) effect size estimate (uniquely explained criterion variance expressed as a proportion of unexplained criterion variance) for various predictor variables. Cognitive predictors were verbal and non-verbal General Scholastic Aptitude Test scores. Non-cognitive variables included the hierarchical levels of self-concept: global (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), and academic and mathematics self-concept (relevant scales of Brookover, Erickson and Joiner). Socio-economic predictors included home-related variables (parental education, parental occupation, family size) and school-related factors (class size, teacher's qualification, teacher's experience). Gender differences favouring boys were found. Non-verbal and <b>verbal</b> scholastic <b>aptitude</b> and teacher's general training correlated significantly with mathematics achievement for boys and girls, with non-verbal scholastic aptitude showing the highest correlation and effect size estimate for girls and teacher's general training occupying this position for boys.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} which variables in the backgrounds of CETA. (Comprehensive Employment Training Act) Medical Records students affected their performance in Medical Terminology course-work. More specifically, the aim of the research was to delineate those variables which had a statistically significant correlation the students' numerical final exam score in Medical Terminology. All data for the study' were generated in the course of teaching a 3 -credit hour college class in Medical Terminology at Joliet Junior College, Joliet, Illinois. The 4 3 subjects, all female students in the Medical Records CETA Program at Joliet Junior College, had widely diversified personal backgrounds. They ranged in age from 18 to the late 40 ’s. Some were married. Some were divorced. Some were separated. Still others remained single. Most of the students were white. A smaller fraction were black, and a still smaller number were Oriental. The educational level of the students varied widely. Several of the subjects had not been beyond the tenth grade, while at the other extreme, a fear students had achieved the rough equivalent of bachelor's degrees. Some of the students achieved high <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude</b> and general intelligence scores, while many others had low or average scores. Interview scores, intended to "rank" students by various personality characteristics, showed much less individual deviation. Seven independent variables of student race, marital status, age, interview score (determined by a CETA Vocational Counselor), general intelligence and <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude</b> scores (according to the General Aptitude Test Battery)., and educational level, were each correlated with the dependent variable of Medical Terminology final exam score. A survey of related background literature had suggested that <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude</b> had an enhancing effect on performance in exams involving usage of grammatical terms. Likewise, educational level was seen to generally raise standardized test scores. General intelligence scores were reported to significantly affect academic and work performance of soma kinds, but to not affect others. Marital status was judged to often be involved in degree of responsibility and attitude toward completion of educational tasks. Race membership was shown to significantly effect performance on verbal tests, at least when these tests were "weighted" in favor of whites over blacks due to a "middleclass bias" of questions emphasizing lifestyles not experienced by many poorer blacks. Chronologic age was reported to be generally an asset to verbal performance, as long as this verbal performance was one benefiting from practical experience rather than one relying on speeded tests to gauge verbal competence. Student attitude was considered to be of importance in perseverance of educational task accomplishment. The final exam in Medical Terminology was subjected to item analysis by the Ball State University Testing Center and found to have sufficient reliability, discrimination, and validity to be effectively employed as a research tool. For example, reliability of the Medical Terminology final exam was determined by both the split-half technique and by the Kuder Richardson formula number 20 and 21 : reliabilities were found to range from the. 70 's to the. 80 's. Most items analyzed also had a satisfactory (0. 20 - 0. 39) or superior (0. 40 or higher) level of discrimination. Finally, the majority of items on the computer-analyzed final exam had validity indices in the. 70 ’s and. 80 's range. A stepwise regression analysis was conducted in order to ascertain the relative correlation of each of the seven independent variables with the dependent variable of Medical Terminology final exams scores. Those independent variables having a statistically significant correlation were inserted into an equation for prediction of Medical Terminology final exam score. Review of the data led to the following conclusions:According to the prediction equation, <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude</b> was he best predictor of final exam score in Medical Terminology, followed by educational levels. Although the effect of educational level was not in itself its inclusion in the equation added 31 /o of the variance. The other five independent variables of race, age, marital status, and interview score, and general intelligence had no effect on Medical Terminology final exam scores. Conclusions of this study were generally that both <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude</b> scores and level of education could be useful in the counseling and admissions process in the CETA Medical Records Program at Joliet Junior College, as well as in other similar CETA programs located in other cities. For example, CETA admissions personnel could put more weight on a student's <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude</b> score than on his general intelligence score, <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude</b> having been shown to be significantly correlated with Medical Terminology final exam score, whereas general intelligence score has not been found to be significantly correlated with this score. In addition, "borderline" applicants to the Medical Records Program could be accepted on the basis of extensive educational experience and good performance on <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude</b> tests, even when scores in other areas were fairly low. It was also judged that study findings could be used in the counseling of students who would be more likely to fail the Medical Terminology coarse. In the instance of an individual who was admitted to the CETA Medical Records Program in spite of poor performance on <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude</b> tests, special advice and counseling, or even additional tutorial sessions, could be applied in order to bring the student up to the expected level of verbal performance. Still other possibilities drawn from the findings were that CETA Vocational Counselors could better detect the root causes of poor performance by the students. For example, if an individual received low grades on Medical Terminology tests but had a high level of <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude,</b> this would suggest that the student's problems lay elsewhere, such as with difficulties in his homelife or in his particular social situation. Thus, the CETA counselors could concentrate on ameliorating these social difficulties rather than on assisting the student in the development of pre-existing verbal skills. Thesis (Ed. S. ...|$|E

Ten years of data were gathered from the public report card on the state website. In the school system under investigation, student scores on quantitative and <b>verbal</b> Scholastic <b>Aptitude</b> Test (SAT) showed a significant upward trend over 10 years. Over the same 10 years, Advanced Placement Test (AP) passing rates showed an upward development. An upward trend was also found for student scores on the state mandated graduation examinations in all four subject areas: mathematics, language arts, science, and social studies. The authors suggested school systems should consider the impact of block scheduling on student achievement measures. The high school landscape is often characterized by two competing ends of the organizational change spectrum. On one end is the high school that wishes to be fluid and agrees to look forward to transformational challenges and on the other end is the high school that remains constant in its structures and processes and prefers a traditional approach to time-honored instructional arrangements.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the relation of}} socioeconomic and scholastic aptitude variants to academic achievement, {{data were collected from}} 332 elementary students in a small midwestern city. Independent variables included group aptitude test scores from third grade and fifth grade administrations, sex of subjects, family socioeconomic status (SES) based on parental occupation, and school of attendance (Title I versus Nontitle I). Dependent variables included group achievement test scores from third and fifth grade administrations and teacher grades for Reading and Math at fifth grade. Group aptitude indices included total aptitude scores and the difference between <b>verbal</b> and nonverbal <b>aptitude</b> scores. The study was designed to examine: (a) whether achievement patterns were the same for males and females when different levels of SES, total aptitude, and differences between <b>verbal</b> and nonverbal <b>aptitude</b> were considered; (b) whether similar results would be found at third and fifth grades and across various achievement measures (i. e., achievement subtests and teacher grades at fifth grade; and (c) whether SES distinctions based on family characteristics versus more general sociological characteristics (i. e., school of attendance) provided similar information about a student 2 ̆ 7 s probable level of academic achievement. In general, the data support achievement differences between males and females based on the interaction between total aptitude and verbal-nonverbal discrepancies. The contrast between high verbal and high nonverbal students was most pronounced for females with low to average total aptitude scores at third grade and for low total aptitude females again at fifth grade. A moderate degree of similarity was found between third and fifth grade results. Little similarity was found between achievement test performance and teacher grades at fifth grade. The variables of SES, total aptitude, and difference score accounted for approximately twice the variance in Reading Total and Math Total as in Reading Grade and Math Grade.

The tape recorded speech test used in the study was the test administered to freshmen upon their entrance to Ball State in the year 1960. <b>Verbal</b> <b>aptitude</b> scores were obtained from permanent records of the School and College Aptitude Test (SCAT) administered to these same students as in-coming freshmen. The tests of 250 students were employed in the study, but 15 of this number were eliminated at the time SCAT scores were procured. Ten persons had taken complete entrance examinations but had not registered in the Fall. The verbal scores of the remaining five were doubtful or nonexistent. The grade point averages used were those of these students at the beginning of their junior year. If for some reason students were no longer in college at-the time they would have been juniors, their grade point averages at the time of drop-out were found.

A secondary {{purpose of the}} study was to determine if there is a relationship between entry-level basic preparatory nursing education and nursing leadership, the ability to make nursing diagnosis, and implementation, as well as evaluation of the nursing process. Three nursing practice categories were identified and included: professional, all-nurse, and technical. Useable data collected by short-essay questionnaire from 343 out of 344 sample subjects were computed to determine the relationship, if any, between basic preparatory nursing education and conceptual and theoretical approaches to patient care. Decisions about three Null Hypotheses were made at the 0. 05 level of significance utilizing analysis of covariance and the 0. 01 level of significance utilizing Chi-Square analysis. FINDINGS 1. For Hypothesis I, the main effect for degree work when covaried with <b>Verbal</b> Scholastic <b>Aptitude</b> Test Scores, Quantitative Scholastic Aptitude Test Scores, time, and age indicated a significance of 0. 000 for all item associations in the professional, all-nurse, and technical categories utilizing analysis of covariance, and 0. 0000 utilizing Chi-Square analysis. 2.

40|$|This is a {{longitudinal}} {{case study of}} two Farsi-speaking children learning English: 'Bernard' and 'Melissa', who were 7; 4 and 8; 4 {{at the start of}} data collection. The research deals with the initial state and further development in the child second language (L 2) acquisition of syntax regarding {{the presence or absence of}} functional categories, as well as the role and degree of L 1 influence in this regard. Some studies in the field of child L 1 acquisition are discussed to determine similarities or differences between child L 1 and child L 2 acquisition. Examining data collected from the children's spontaneous speech, the researcher's diaries and translation and other tasks over a period of 20 months, the competing claims of the two most prominent hypotheses about early L 2 grammars are tested: Vainikka & Young-Scholten's (1996) Minimal Trees/Structure Building hypothesis and Schwartz & Sprouse's (1996) Full Transfer/Full Access hypothesis. Word order, use of rote-learned formulae, suppliance of copula/auxiliary be, modals, questions, case assignment, finiteness, presence of null subjects, subject-verb agreement, negation and tense marking are investigated, and the conclusion is reached that functional categories are absent at the initial state and that they emerge without the learners' reliance on their L 1, consistent with Minimal Trees/Structure Building. A difference is observed between the two subjects regarding development of some aspects of verbal morphology, and standardized tests of intelligence, <b>aptitude,</b> <b>verbal</b> memory and phonological awareness show that processing speed and what can be described as 'verbalness' are important factors affecting the rate of development of these elements.

40|$|This {{research}} program compared computer-based and programed textbook-based curricula for training students to troubleshoot digital logic circuits. Students were witched in pairs on two pretests, a <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude</b> test, and an electronics and mathematics aptitude test, and {{randomly assigned to}} the two curricula, which contained identical theoretical material. The two training programs differed principally in that the computer-based curriculum provided simulation of trouble-shooting experience through interaction with the computer, while the programed textbook-based curriculum had to rely solely on written explanations. Two criterion measures were employed, a written multiple- choice test of theoretical knowledge and an actual trouble-shooting session on faulty digital logic circuits. These were applied within a week and repeated 9 weeks after completion of the course. While observation and anecdotal evidence suggested that the computer-based curricuXu was more interesting and stimulating, expecially for the brighter students, none of the objective measures showed an advantage for the computer group.

40|$|A biographical inventory, {{an ability}} test, and three reading tests were {{administered}} to 699 persons who were hopeful about beginning course work at the University of Calgary. These students were categorized as Mature Non-matriculants {{because they did not}} have senior matriculation which is necessary for normal entry to the university. A total of three groups were compared; (1) those who wrote tests but did not enroll in courses; (2) those who wrote tests, enrolled and dropped out; (3) those who wrote tests and successfully completed courses. Differences were found between the first and third groups in verbal ability and reading. A second study was conducted using only the successful Mature Non-matriculant students. In addition to the data from the first study, a battery of new tests were administered including a personality measure, a values scale, a study habits inventory, and a need-achievement test. All data was intercorrelated with the criterion-grade point average. Results seemed to follow those of the first study, that is, {{students are more likely to}} be successful if they excel in reading ability, <b>verbal</b> <b>aptitude,</b> and study habits.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the efficiency of the Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Tests (GRE) and the Miller Analogies Test (MAT) as predictors of academic performance for doctoral students in the Department of Psychological Services. Significance of the Study This study was expected to increase the body of knowledge in the area of prediction of academic performance and criteria selection for use in doctoral programs. Hypotheses Four hypotheses were tested. Null hypotheses one. two. and three involved bivariate analyses of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Miller Analogies Test (MAT). and academic performance (GGPA). The fourth null hypothesis employed the same variables in a multiple regression analysis. Subjects The subjects were nineteen doctoral graduates who completed graduate study during the years 1969 - 1983. in the Department of Psychological Services. School of Education at Atlanta University. Instruments The Miller Analogies Test (MAT) and the Graduate Record Examination <b>Verbal</b> and Quantitative <b>Aptitude</b> Test scores were utilized in this study. Conclusions 1. Only the Graduate Record Examination Verbal (GRE-V) was significantly correlated with graduate grade pOint average (GGPA). It made the greatest contribution to the prediction of grade point average (GPA) and was the most consistent predictor variable when used with the GRE-Q and GRE-T. 2. The Miller Analogies Test (MAT) was not a predictor of successful academic performance (GGPA). 3. The GRE-V and GRE-T were statistically significantly correlated with the Miller Analogies Test (MAT), however, the Graduate Record Examination Quantitative (GRE-Q) was not statistically significantly correlated with the Miller Analogies Test (MAT). 4. When bivariate correlation coefficients with multiple correlation, using the verbal, quantitative and total Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores were compared, the bivariate correlation involving the GRE-V provided the only statistically significant correlation. Although this correlation was statistically significant, its predictive power was limited...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{discover}} variables or combinations of variables which would predict academic success in industrial education at Norfolk State College. More specifically, it utilized standardized verbal and nonverbal tests and compared these with the presently used Scholastic Aptitude Tests as predictors of success in industrial education. The data for this study were collected from tests administered to a sample population by the writer during regularly scheduled class periods in the Fall semester, 1971, and from the Scholastic Aptitude Test records in the Office of the Registrar at Norfolk State College. The variables included in the study were: Scholastic <b>Aptitude</b> Test - <b>Verbal</b> scores, Scholastic <b>Aptitude</b> Test - Mathematical scores, Scholastic Aptitude Test - Total scores, Bennett Mechanical Comprehension Test, and the Raven Progressive Matrices. The criteria of success were the final semester grades in the following courses: Basic Woodworking, Introduction to Technical Drafting, Introduction to Industrial Education, Basic Electronics, and Automobile Engines. In order to show the relationship between the variables studied, the data were analyzed and statistics were computed throw a program developed by the Health Sciences Computing Facility at University of California at Los Angeles. This program incorporated a step-wise regression and rendered a correlation matrix, an analysis of variance, a multiple r and a standard error of estimate. All statistics utilized in this study were computed by the Ball State University Computer Center. The results of this study indicated that the variable that offered the best information of predicting academic success in industrial education at Norfolk State College was the Raven Progressive Matrices. The combinations of variables which were statistically significant were the SAT Mathematical and the Bennett MeoY~anioal Comprehension Test correlated to final grades in Electronics, and the SAT Mathematical, Raven Progressive Matrices, Bennett Mechanical Comprehension Test, and SAT Verbal correlated to final grades in Drafting. The results of the study seem to justify the following conclusions: 1. The SAT scores are not valid predictors of academic success in several of the technical areas of industrial education and probably should not be used as such. 2. The Raven Progressive Matrices showed evidence of contributing significantly to prediction of academic success in industrial education at Norfolk State College. 3. The Bennett Mechanical Comprehension Test showed a high correlation with final grades in Drafting but probably should not be used as a predictor in other areas. 4. Neither verbal or nonverbal tests used without benefit of other devices should be used as predictors of academic success in industrial education at Norfolk State College. As a result of the present investigation, it is recommended that: 1. A follow-up study of the students in this research study be conducted to ascertain their success as students and later as teachers in the field of industrial education. 2. An investigation employing individual rather than group testing as predictive devices be conducted. 3. Further study of the use of the Raven Progressive Matrices be made with larger samples and other criteria of success. Thesis (Ed. S. ...|$|R
40|$|Higher {{education}} institutions {{across the world}} {{use a combination of}} previous grades along with scores on <b>verbal</b> and quantitative <b>aptitude</b> tests in making admissions decisions for their various academic programs. Recent work suggests there are several additional factors that would likely add to the predictive validity of the admissions system, and be more fair to candidates (Harackiewicz et. al, 2002). These include measures of personality, creativity, situational judgment, critical thinking, and others (Kyllonen, 2005). Consequently, over the past several years, numerous programs in the U. S. and elsewhere have experimented with potential alternative or supplementary predictors (Peeters and Lievens, 2005; Kyllonen, 2008). The University of Luxembourg, in particular the Bachelor of Science in Education (BScE) program, will contribute to this debate by exploring and validating alternative/supplementary measures of social competency – in this case measures that gauge the potential for college success and capacity for effective teaching. Our study seeks to identify valid and reliable indicators of not only future academic success in the BScE program, but also of becoming an effective primary school teacher. Overall the goal of our project is: a) to consider {{what it means to be}} successful in school and as a teacher (and the measurement of these successful outcomes); b) to identify the most important constructs that will predict success in the BScE program; c) to examine alternative measures of these constructs with respect to psychometric properties, administrative and logistical concerns, and user acceptance, and d) to conduct a validity study examining the predictive validity of various candidate new measures in predicting successful outcomes. To accomplish this we use a sample of BScE program candidates that took a newly revised admissions exam in the summer of 2011, designed to measure both cognitive and noncognitive attributes. The composition of these candidates was made up of self-selected/self-motivated persons seeking admission to the BScE program, whose main objective is to train and prepare future primary school teachers. On average the BScE program receives yearly approximately 400 registration applications, of which about 300 complete the exam. The average age tends to be between 19 and 20 years; it is approximately 70 % female; comes mostly from the classique (nearly 70 %) and the technique (25 %) academic tracks; and over 90 % of the candidates are of Luxembourgish nationality. The noncognitive section of the exam measured basic socio-demographic characteristics and a host of social competencies ranging from personality, time management, team-work, individual adaptability, conscientiousness, teaching self-efficacy, and other attitudes and beliefs. Because some these measures are new in the multilingual context of Luxembourg, they had to be translated from English into French and German; thus requiring further investigation to establish their reliability and validity as predictors of future performance. With that in mind, this paper will report our findings investigating the psychometric and other statistical properties of our noncognitive measures. Moreover, we will report how these measures help profile successful students relative to two important validation criteria – their course grades and in-classroom teaching evaluations – measures of college success and effective teaching...|$|R
