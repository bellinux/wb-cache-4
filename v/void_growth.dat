40|$|AbstractTo {{reveal the}} {{mechanism}} of a void-dominated fracture process in bulk metallic glasses, a theoretical description of <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> undergoing remote hydrostatic tension is presented. Special {{attention is focused on}} cavitation instabilities and dynamics of a dynamic <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> process. The critical stress for cavitation instabilities is derived theoretically, which is validated by numerical simulations with a finite difference method. To characterize the dynamic <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> process, a dimensionless number is proposed, which embodies the competition of inertial effects, loading rate effects and viscous effects. It is found that inertial effects can induce vibration of the <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> rate at the rise stage of loading history and impede the growth at the steady stage. In addition, to study the <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> at the early stage of a void-dominated fracture process, quasistatic cases without inertial effects are examined. It is shown that the <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> rate strongly depends on the evolution of free volume concentration...|$|E

In addition, the number of active slip systems did not substantially modify the mechanical behavior and the <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> rate if plastic deformation along the available slip systems was compatible with overall crystal deformation prescribed by the boundary conditions.

It is shown that grain size, void spacing, and conductor line width are very important in determining void and stress behavior. For small grain sizes, stress relaxation can be rapid and can lead to void shrinkage during subsequent heating cycles. The effect of rapid quenching from process temperatures is to suppress <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> but induce large remnant stress in the conductor line.

A clear fractographic evolution from river-like vein pattern to chevron-like zone where microscopic dimples and voids coexist, followed by crack microbranching pattern, was observed on the dynamic fracture surfaces. A terminal crack velocity of about 0. 5 of the Rayleigh wave velocity was determined for the onset of such microbranching instability. Furthermore, the dynamic branched daughter cracks are favored to continue in their original mother crack plane, having ''directional stability''.

40|$|The ductile {{fracture}} process, {{which consists of}} the nucleation, growth and coalescence of microvoids, was extensively studied for materials deforming homogeneously. For materials with a non-homogeneous deformation behavior, such as those having hexagonal closed packed (HCP) crystal structure, experimental and numerical data is lacking. Therefore, the fracture properties of materials with such HCP structure, like titanium (used in aerospace and biomedical applications), zirconium (nuclear industry) and magnesium (manufacturing industry) are not well understood. The main research objective of this Ph. D. thesis is {{to better understand the}} mechanisms governing fracture in commercially pure (CP) titanium. In particular, the effect of grain orientation on <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> is investigated. The fracture process of CP titanium was visualized in model materials containing artificial holes. These model materials were fabricated using a femtosecond laser coupled with a diffusion bonding technique to obtain voids in the interior of titanium samples. Diffusion bonding was carried out either above or below the phase transformation temperature resulting in different microstructures. Changes in void dimensions during in-situ straining were recorded in three dimensions using x-ray computed tomography. <b>Void</b> <b>growth</b> obtained experimentally was compared with the Rice and Tracey model which predicted well the average <b>void</b> <b>growth.</b> However, a large scatter in <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> was observed experimentally and was explained in terms of differences in grain orientation which was confirmed by crystal plasticity simulations. It was also shown that grain orientation has a stronger effect on <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> than intervoid spacing and material strength. Intervoid spacing, however, appears to control whether the intervoid ligament failure is ductile or brittle. While this study showed a good agreement between experiments and simulations on average, there is no direct <b>void</b> <b>growth</b> comparison for particular grain orientations. In a follow-up study, an experimental approach was developed to directly relate the growth of a void to its underlying grain orientation. This is achieved by first annealing CP titanium samples below the α-β phase transformation temperature, then performing electron backscatter diffraction iii (EBSD) and finally diffusion bonding the samples together.

A laboratory-based x-ray microscopy combined with computational tomography imaging is demonstrated to have advantages over other methods of inspecting TSVs.

A series of TSV arrays filled conformally and {{from the bottom up}} were inspected by the x-ray microscope before and after annealing. Pre-existing voids in the seamline were observed in conformally filled TSVs before annealing, while bottom up-filled TSVs do not have a seamline or voids.
