40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims at {{studying the}} evaluative {{role of the}} adjective and its use as an ideology marker in authentic Greek texts, drawn from the Corpus of Greek Texts (CGT) including 450. 576 words of opinion articles from three newspapers of different political orientation (To Vima, I Kathimerini and Rizospastis). The theoretical approach followed {{is based on the}} principles and methods of corpus linguistic analysis, while the frameworks of linguistic variation analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis are combined in the study of adjectives as markers of ideology. The study of the evaluative and ideological role of adjectives presupposes the definition of the category of adjective on the basis of specific criteria, the identification of the adjectives in the corpus and their categorization with respect to their characteristics. The distinction of adjectives into categories with common characteristics provides a solid frame for the analysis of their evaluative role, while the investigation of their evaluative function can serve as a basis for the study of their use as markers of ideology. The review {{of the history of the}} adjective as a part of speech from antiquity to the present day suggests a variety of views in the literature and a multiplicity of criteria used for its external and internal categorization, i. e. its distinction from other word categories and its subcategorization, respectively. In this dissertation specific methodological criteria are used in order to distinguish adjectives from related grammatical categories (e. g. pronouns, numerals, participles), while a combination of criteria is followed for their subcategorization, according to their use in the corpus. The adjectives under study, which are the 4. 2 % of all lexical types in the corpus, were subcategorized into ten categories: classifying, descriptive, evaluative (which were further classified into modal, comment, intensifying and adjectives of importance), deictic, relational, specializing, indefinite, colour, verbal and quantitative adjectives. The adjectives of these categories present different characteristics according to the criteria used. Apart from the category of evaluative adjectives, adjectives of other categories (e. g. descriptive, classifying, indefinite) were found to have an evaluative role in the corpus. Evaluation is perceived as a bipolar notion, since the expression of an evaluative judgement is regarded as connected, directly or indirectly, with the positive or negative stance of the writer towards the object of evaluation. The positive or iv negative stance of the writer determines the evaluative frame of the text, which facilitates the reader’s comprehension. The study of the evaluative role of the adjectives in the corpus has led to the identification of their function in relation to aspects of evaluation such as its dimensions, mechanisms, scope and strategies. The dimensions of adjective evaluation include <b>value,</b> <b>comment,</b> modality, intensification and importance and are realized through the use of specific evaluative mechanisms, which function mainly on a syntactic, semantic or morphological linguistic level. Regarding the scope of evaluation, the study of the data indicates that adjectives can have both a local function and a discoursal and organizing one, while two basic strategies are followed regarding the degree of transparency of evaluation, namely overt and latent evaluation. The study of evaluation offers the ground for the study of ideologies, since the latter are based on evaluative beliefs. In order to systematically describe the evaluative role of adjectives in the corpus, quantitative data from the analysis of adjectives are taken into account and terms and models of analysis derived from the tradition of Critical Discourse Analysis, such as van Dijk’s ideological square, are employed. The study of adjectives in our data brings to light three basic aspects of the adjectives’ relation with ideology: differences in the frequency of occurrence of common adjectives in the data from the three newspapers, lexical choices (i. e. different adjectives) in the newspapers and the par excellence role of the adjective as a marker of ideology. Adjectives were found to function as markers of ideology in two main ways: as foci of attracting evaluation (by signalling the in-group or the outgroup or their fields of activity) and as evaluators. The study of the use of the adjective as a marker of ideology provides the basis for drawing conclusions about the ideological positioning of the newspapers and the means of their identity construction...|$|E

40|$|This Foreword {{is meant}} as an initial {{foray into the}} {{question}} of what agencies should do with mass public comments, particularly on broad questions of policy. Part I discusses the extent to which congressional control, presidential control, and agency procedures themselves can ensure that agency decisions are democratically responsive. In view of shortcomings in both congressional and presidential control, I underscore the need to focus closely on rulemaking procedures as a source of democratic responsiveness. The possibility that agencies may be systematically discounting certain public submissions raises difficulties, and I present some examples. Part II makes a preliminary case that agencies should more thoroughly consider public policy and <b>values</b> <b>comments.</b> Public comments filed with an agency in reaction to a concrete proposal would seem to have considerable potential as a source of information on citizen values and preferences. The presence of significant and numerous public comments in a rulemaking might at least trigger further investigation and deliberation by an agency. Alternatively, agencies should more candidly and publicly acknowledge that participation in rulemaking can serve only a limited function...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{factors that}} determine the feasibility {{and effectiveness of}} a critiquing system for asthma/COPD that will be integrated with a general practitioner's (GP's) information system. DESIGN: A simulation study. Four reviewers, {{playing the role of}} the computer, generated critiquing comments and requests for additional information on six electronic medical records of patients with asthma/COPD. Three GPs who treated the patients, playing users, assessed the comments and provided missing information when requested. The GPs were asked why requested missing information was unavailable. The reviewers reevaluated their comments after receiving requested missing information. MEASUREMENTS: Descriptions of the number and nature of critiquing comments and requests for missing information. Assessment by the GPs of the critiquing comments in terms of agreement with each comment and judgment of its relevance, both on a five-point scale. Analysis of causes for the (un-) availability of requested missing information. Assessment of the impact of missing information on the generation of critiquing comments. RESULTS: Four reviewers provided 74 critiquing comments on 87 visits in six medical records. Most were about prescriptions (n = 28) and the GPs' workplans (n = 27). The GPs <b>valued</b> <b>comments</b> about diagnostics the most. The correlation between the GPs' agreement and relevance scores was 0. 65. However, the GPs' agreements with prescription comments (complete disagreement, 31. 3 %; disagreement, 20. 0 %; neutral, 13. 8 %; agreement, 17. 5 %; complete agreement, 17. 5 %) differed from their judgments of these comments' relevance (completely irrelevant, 9. 0 %; irrelevant, 24. 4 %; neutral, 24. 4 %; relevant, 32. 1 %; completely relevant, 10. 3 %). The GPs were able to provide answers to 64 % of the 90 requests for missing information. Reasons available information had not been recorded were: the GPs had not recorded the information explicitly; they had assumed it to be common knowledge; it was available elsewhere in the record. Reasons information was unavailable were: the decision had been made by another; the GP had not recorded the information. The reviewers left 74 % of the comments unchanged after receiving requested missing information. CONCLUSION: Human reviewers can generate comments based on information currently available in electronic medical records of patients with asthma/COPD. The GPs <b>valued</b> <b>comments</b> regarding the diagnostic process the most. Although they judged prescription comments relevant, they often strongly disagreed with them, a discrepancy that poses a challenge for the presentation of critiquing comments for the future critiquing system. Requested additional information that was provided by the GPs led to few changes. Therefore, as system developers faced with the decision to build an integrated, non-inquisitive or an inquisitive critiquing system, the authors choose the former...|$|R
