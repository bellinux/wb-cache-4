5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation {{plays a major role}} in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover.</b> Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan. Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, there is some evidence that wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover,</b> and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E
5|$|The chief threats {{faced by}} the brolga, {{particularly}} {{in the southern part}} of its range, are habitat destruction, the drainage of wetlands, collision with powerlines, and predation by the introduced red fox. It is more secure in its northern habitat as the land is mostly unsuitable for farming and much of it is in national parks or private ownership, but changes in <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover,</b> encouraged by the rooting activities of feral pigs, may reduce the abundance of bulkuru sedge and may make the brolga more vulnerable by providing cover for predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> {{of coastal}} sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25-year cycles, with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 {{years after the}} beginning of a new 25-year period. Such periods are typically separated by wildfires, which clear away dead or dying vegetation and leave bare ground for new growth. The canyon is one of the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California. Approximately one hundred species of plants, most native to California, are found in Laurel and Willow Canyons alone. These include monkey flower, goldenrod, and sagebrush.|$|E

Nevertheless, since the dominant <b>vegetation</b> <b>covers</b> of our system have very different structural (Atala et al. 2008, Arambarri et al. 2011) and functional (Clark et al. 2010) characteristics, we expect {{that only a small}} quantity of QVITSb/TSub, constructed with VI time series of different <b>vegetation</b> <b>covers,</b> meet the three proposed criteria. However, this could generate problems in systems in which the different <b>vegetation</b> <b>covers</b> have similar structural and functional characteristics.

5|$|The {{surrounding}} area {{is dominated by}} mainly conifer forest, with broad-leafed birch and alder woods {{on some of the}} steeper banks and streams. An early 20th century analysis of <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> in Kajaani county recorded 385 different species of vascular plants. Talaskangas Nature Reserve, with nearly pristine natural forest and about 50 different wildlife species, is in the Vieremä and Sonkajärvi local area. Logging was planned in the 1980s, but environmental activists prevented exploitation through lobbying. The reserve was formally established in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Disturbance is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of disturbance, a climax <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow. Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E
5|$|Populations are dense in {{the higher}} {{mountain}} regions of Tasmania. Widespread throughout the state, their presence is known on King Island, located north-west from Tasmania. The ant prefers rural areas, found in warm, dry, open eucalypt woodlands; the climate provides the ant with isolation and warmth. This environment also produces the ant's food, which includes nectar and invertebrate prey. In suburban areas, this ant is found in native vegetation, and use rockeries, cracks in concrete walls, dry dirt and grass to build nests. One study found suburbs with voluminous <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> such as Mount Nelson, Fern Tree and West Hobart host jack jumper populations, while the heavily urbanised suburbs of North Hobart and Battery Point, do not.|$|E

5|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested. These include aspen, Douglas fir, and spruce fir, comprising about 20% of the historic watershed. At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin, sagebrush was and is the predominant <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover.</b> Because of deforestation, up to {{one quarter of the}} forests have been taken over by sagebrush, leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15% of the watershed. However, the lodgepole pine has increased in number, taking over historic stands of other conifers. There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in the Snake River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Watson {{argued that}} the economy {{established}} by Arab and other Muslim traders across the Old World enabled the diffusion of many crops and farming techniques across the Islamic world, {{as well as the}} adaptation of crops and techniques from and to regions outside it. Crops from Africa, such as sorghum, from China, such as citrus fruits, and from India, such as mango, rice, cotton and sugar cane, were distributed throughout Islamic lands, which, in his opinion, had not previously grown these plants. He listed eighteen such crops. He further {{argued that the}}se introductions, along with an increased mechanization of agriculture and irrigation, led to major changes in economy, population distribution, <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover,</b> agricultural production and income, population, urban growth, distribution of the labour force, industries linked to agriculture, cooking, diet and clothing in the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, five tammar {{wallabies}} {{were introduced}} onto North Island, {{and the population}} established successfully. Possible reasons for this success include {{the absence of the}} wallabies' natural predator, the carpet python (Morelia spilota imbricata); the availability of additional food and water from the fishers' huts, which are occupied during the harshest time of the year; and the presence of the air strip, which apparently provides additional food for them. By the 2000s, there were over 450 tammar wallabies on the island. The wallabies overgrazed and ringbarked the native vegetation, particularly the area burnt in 1935, thus reducing <b>vegetation</b> <b>cover</b> and causing a serious decline in populations of some plant species. In 2003, island residents asked the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM; now the Department of Environment and Conservation) for help in managing the issue. CALM staff visited the island in April and May of that year and produced a report recommending an investigation into controlling population levels by the use of implanted contraceptives. Exploration of this option began in 2005, but in July 2007 the research was discontinued. Around 60 wallabies were removed to educational institutions for research purposes, and culling began. By February 2008, the wallaby population had been reduced to around 25 individuals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Landsat 8, {{the ongoing}} {{mission of the}} Landsat {{satellites}} that have provided over 40 years of images, continues to benefit long-term research. However, {{it is important to}} know if the spectral features of Landsat 8 are of the same standard as previous Landsat imagery because Landsat 8 images have narrower bands, especially because of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculation which is the most popular vegetation index. In this study NDVI values derived from Landsat 8 images were compared with those calculated from Landsat 7 and ground measured hyperspectral data. The result shows that Landsat 8 NDVI is larger than Landsat 7 NDVI in lower <b>vegetation</b> <b>covered</b> areas and the difference becomes smaller as the value of NDVI increases. This indicates that NDVI of Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 is consistent when dealing with high <b>vegetation</b> <b>covered</b> areas (e. g. forest area and tall grass prairie) because the difference between Landsat 7 and 8 NDVI is close to zero when the value of NDVI is high, but this needs to be further investigated. There is also further need for calibration of NDVI in low <b>vegetation</b> <b>covered</b> areas in order to achieve consistency between Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) status was {{evaluated}} using {{the relationships between}} two independent soil variables, i. e.

A positive relationship was found between the weight of the finest POM fraction, i. e. fine POM fraction (250 - 50 μm) and C respiration after 1 week (R 2 = 0. 34, n = 120, p < 0. 0001) and 2 weeks (R 2 = 0. 28, n = 120, p < 0. 0001) of incubation. Therefore, we assumed that the C respiration and the weight of fine POM might be used to evaluate the SOM status under different <b>vegetation</b> <b>covers</b> and ecosystems. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the capacity of}} woody versus grassy <b>vegetation</b> <b>covers</b> to buffer high temperatures during heat waves by partitioning turbulent heat between latent (λE) and sensible (H) fluxes, and quantifying advection using the Priestley-Taylor coefficient (α), for a 16 -year old grassland and an adjoining 6 -year old plantation.

Annual evapotranspiration was 54 % lower from the grassland (384 mm) than from the plantation (834 mm).
