The current test for this is Individual <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Approval</b> (IVA), which has replaced Single <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Approval</b> (SVA). When SVA was first introduced in 1998, many believed this would kill off the kit car market, but in reality it has made the kit car market stronger, as the vehicles produced now have to meet a minimum standard. IVA was introduced in summer 2009 and {{it is too early}} to tell what impact this will have on the industry.|$|E
