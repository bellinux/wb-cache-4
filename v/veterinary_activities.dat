The pros and cons of the approaches used in European and world practice in veterinary legislation drafting are highlighted. One of the approaches includes only basic and constant principles of veterinary legislation, while the other presents all regulatory norms with dynamic character that require periodic updating of the legislative basis. An analysis also is made of the dynamics of the amendments and additions of certain articles and paragraphs of the Law on the <b>veterinary</b> <b>activities</b> for the period 2006 - 2016 and their adequacy to the antiepizootic activities is assessed. An attempt is made to analyze the interrelationship and interdependence between the legal regulations of additions and amendments to the LVA and the material-technical, organizational and structural conditions for their practical implementation. A necessity for elaboration of a new law on <b>veterinary</b> <b>activities</b> and its adoption by the National Assembly by the end of 2017 is motivated...|$|E

40|$|When {{evaluating}} {{effects of}} work on human health {{it should be remembered}} that health is a result of mutual effects of several factors. The factors include the general environment and the working environment, genetic factors and lifestyle. Further, the evaluation of a worker´s health condition should take into account his/her exposure outside work. I have selected the topic of the thesis: ``Occurrence of occupational disease in the South Bohemian region `` because I find occupational hygiene the most interesting sphere in the hygienic sector. The objective of my work was to map occupational diseases in the South Bohemian region and to determine the situation in occupational diseases in a selected period. The selected period was 2004 { [...] } 2008. At the beginning of the thesis I set two hypotheses. The first hypothesis stated that the number of occupational diseases in the South Bohemian region in 2004 - 2008 was not statistically significantly different from the national average. To test the hypothesis I used a statistical survey using the Student t-test. The second hypothesis stated that occupational diseases occurred most frequently in persons working in the sector of health and social care and <b>veterinary</b> <b>activities.</b> In the case of the first hypothesis the results have confirmed that the number of occupational diseases in the South Bohemian region does not exceed the national average, except in 2007, when the number of occupational diseases was different from the national average.

However, it is less considered in veterinary medicine, even if {{it has the potential}} to improve public health because of the role of veterinary medicine in public health. For this reason, an One Health approach is useful for communication as well. This approach leads to a “One Communication” concept, which is the result of the synergy in communicative efforts both in human and in veterinary medicine. Our analysis explores the potential of communication in several veterinary fields: institutions, food safety, companion animal and food-producing animal practice, pharmacology and drugs, wildlife fauna and environment. In almost all the areas of <b>veterinary</b> <b>activity</b> communication can contribute to human health. It takes many forms and use several channels, and this variety of communicative opportunities represent a challenge for veterinarians.

In "Morenga" (1978) Uwe Timm {{records the}} atrocities of the Germans in “South-West Africa”, as Namibia was once called. The novel relates of {{veterinary}} Gottschalk’s three-year stay (1904 - 1907) in that conflict-ravaged land, as he gradually adopts an anti-colonial {{position in the}} face of colonizer’s brutality against Nama’s uprising. This paper describes the elaboration techniques of the Other, how in "Morenga" the image of the Other is entangled and subsequently shaped in a matrix of data, fictional and archival documents. Therefore, I shall focus on the category of labour, especially as craftsmanship, in thematic and narratological terms; as a result of my analysis I will show that Gottschalk’s <b>veterinary</b> <b>activity,</b> through its potential for transformation and communication, makes possible a non-violent contact with the Other. Gottschalk’s attempt to decode the Other’s world beyond the patterns of hegemonic thinking is an example of ‘enlightenment’ literature of the late 70 s, between documentary and fiction. By repeatedly interrupting of narration, the assemblage techniques, the distance-creating gesture of reflecting and the medialization of the Other Timm avoids any exoticism and aims to deconstruct German colonialism. His narrative procedures, which are partly due to the ethnographic practice, also reflect the crisis of representation which characterizes the ethnographic discourse of those years...|$|R

40|$|Disease {{monitoring}} and surveillance systems (MOSSs) have {{become one of the}} major components of <b>veterinary</b> <b>activity.</b> Such systems are used to assess the existing levels of prevalence, the effectiveness of control programmes and, after disease eradication, to document the continued absence of disease from a given region or zone. With decreasing disease or infection prevalence, traditional approaches become less reliable and increasingly costly. The objective of this work was to summarize and discuss methodological issues related to veterinary (animal health) MOSSs. There are considerable inconsistencies {{in the use of the}} terms 'monitoring' and 'surveillance'. Passive as well as active MOSS have their disadvantages when used for rare health-related events such as emerging and re-emerging diseases. There is a need for evaluation and improvement of these approaches. Integrated systems that call for the use of several parallel surveillance activities seem to be the favoured approach, and analytical methods to combine MOSS data from various sources into a population prevalence, or probability of disease freedom, are under development. The health and safety of the animal and human generations depends on our continuous ability to detect, monitor and control newly emerging or re-emerging livestock diseases and zoonoses rapidly. Uniform surveillance definitions, sound scientifically based approaches that use the resources and data available, and a pool of researchers and veterinary public health officials with sufficient training in epidemiology, are critically important to handle this challenging task...|$|R

40|$|The {{result of}} a probit model {{analysis}} to measure determinants of veterinary participation among broiler poultry farmers showed that education, extension contact, membership of cooperatives and income from other sources were factors that encouraged continued patronage by broiler poultry farmers of veterinary services in managing the health and associated challenges of their poultry farms.

The Group reviewed the 'Labour input method' contained in an OECD publication titled 'Measuring the Non-Observed Economy - A Handbook' and the 'Method of Apportioning' proposed by Shri Ramesh Kolli and Suvendu Hazra in a paper presented in the Eighth meeting of the 'Delhi Group'. Given the existing data systems in the country, it is not found feasible to use the 'Labour Input Method' unless substantial improvements {{are made in the}} statistical system of the country. Though, it would be necessary to introduce such improvements in the statistical system, realistic estimates need to be generated in the interim-period. The Sub-committee, thus, developed an alternative method of apportioning by using estimates of labour inputs and productivity differentials of both the organised and unorganised sectors. According to the estimates worked out by the Sub-committee by using the modified apportioning method, about 50 percent of the GDP was contributed by the unorganised/informal sector in 2004 - 05.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of ‘one medicine’ and 'one ‘health’ are supported and visualised as a tree (medicine), {{placed on the}} fertile soil (basic sciences), which divides into the two major branches of human and veterinary medicine, connected by the large branch of public health; minor branches (specialisations) depart from the three larger ones. The synergy between human and veterinary medicine {{is not only a}} must for public health, but also implies ethical considerations. The basic reasons requiring synergy are found in the common sharing of the environment, in the use of animal products by humans, in the common culture and in the many problems to be faced together. The long list of adversities requiring synergy is topped by zoonoses (intended both in the classic and in the extended sense) and food safety that extends to many other items connected with nutrition, environment, human/animal coexistence and the management of public health; the entire quality of human life is affected. Human and veterinary medicine have a strong cultural background (many subject matters) in common, but unfortunately the undergraduate and postgraduate education programme (with few important exceptions) do not offer training in cooperation.

40|$|Disease {{surveillance}} of animal populations {{has taken on}} renewed importance. The literature regarding disease surveillance systems, {{particularly with respect to}} animal diseases is summarised in section 1. Section 2 explores three potential sources of dairy cattle endemic disease data, with a view to utilising this data within the national disease surveillance system and as a model for gathering data from other animal species. Disease records stored on farm computers were retrospectively sourced from forty dairy farmers, from paper records of their servicing veterinary practices and from laboratory records held by the practice for these same farmer's animals. In this way, the loss of data on recorded disease events from farmer to veterinarian to animal health laboratory could be quantified and characterised. Frequency and magnitude of <b>veterinary</b> <b>activity</b> on farms was also quantified, as an indicator of "coverage" of the dairy cattle population, with respect to disease surveillance capability. As expected farmers recorded the largest number of disease events (14. 6 per 1000 cow months at risk, the veterinary practitioners the next (5. 2 per 1000 cow months) and animal health laboratories the least (0. 58 per 1000 cow months). Twenty-five percent of farmers did not record any disease data. Of those farmers who did record diseases, 84 % of records were cases of lameness or mastitis. Farmers rarely recorded veterinary diagnoses. When lameness and mastitis were excluded, veterinary records gave the highest rate (3. 6 per 1000 cow months) and spectrum of diseases events recorded. Veterinary records had a high (22 %) percentage of undiagnosed or unspecified cases when compared to farmer records. Veterinary practices visited the farms on average 17. 8 times per year and handled on average 156 cows per 1000 cow months. The animal health laboratories made positive disease diagnoses at a rate of 0. 24 per 1000 cow months. Approximately half of these were milk samples for routine culture and sensitivity testing. Veterinary practice records offer valuable information for monitoring the temporal and spatial pattern of disease events on farms.

Therefore, {{the margins of}} veterinarians are under pressure. In addition, the sales if drugs, performance of operations or giving of advice arc more and more separated. These developments give veterinarians uncertainty about the profitability of their activities for dairy fanners. Not much is known about margins on <b>veterinary</b> <b>activities</b> on dairy farms. Moreover; {{it is interesting to}} see how much margins of the bovine practitioner differ between veterinary practises and dairy farms. In this study, invoices for bovine activities of 14 veterinary practises were combined with milk production registration data of the dairy farms of these practices. This way, the gross margin per bovine practitioner could be studied for the different veterinary practise. Moreover; the relation between gross margin and specification of the veterinary practise could be studied. Finally, the gross margin per dairy farm and the factors that influenced this gross margin were studied. The most important result was the observation that the gross margin per bovine practitioner was dependent on the number of dairy farms per practitioner, the margin on drugs and the region of the veterinary practise. The size of the veterinary practise, the share of the dairy farming within the practise and the source of the gross margin (drugs, time or operations) did not influence the gross margin. Variables that explained the gross margin per dairy farm were, amongst others, the number of dairy cows, the milk production level of the farms and participation in PIR-DAP system to support the veterinarians herd health and management program).

40|$|Classical {{swine fever}} (CSF) has been present in Serbia {{for a long}} period of time as an endemic disease, and it occurs with lesser or greater {{intensity}} from year to year. Since it is a highly contagious disease of domestic and wild pigs, the outbreaks of the disease causes severe consequences for animal welfare, livestock production and economic losses to the national economies in countries where it occurs. Therefore, CSF has a great epizootiological and economic importance to the swine production, primarily because of trade restrictions for live pigs and pork products. CSF eradication and control programmes are generally based on vaccination strategies in countries with endemic occurrence of CSF or non-vaccination policies in contries wich successfully eradicated or are free of CSF. Whatever the general eradication stategy is in place, in the case of an outbreak of CSF the stamping-out method is used for suppression and eradication of the disease, with strict implementation of specific veterinary-sanitary measures in the infected and surveillance zones, clearly defined by legal provisions. In the period before 2006, there were certain regions in Serbia where CSF occurred almost every year, including regions where pig farming was not the primary branch of animal husbandry. Pig identification and implementation of vaccination, as well as the control of trade of pigs from infected areas to other parts of the country were not very successful. Due to the serious losses inflicted by the disease, a new Programme of CSF control was adopted in 2006, which inter alia included the obligatory identification of pigs, registration of pig holdings and free of charge vaccination of all susceptible animals in the country, as well as the implementation of other statutory measures, including obligatory evidence of <b>veterinary</b> <b>activities</b> in the national Veterinary information system. The results obtained in the period after the implementation of the Programme of CSF control (2007, 2008 and 2009) indicate a positive impact on the reduction of outbreaks of CSF, as well as on the reduction of prevalence (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Summary: Extension {{programmes}} {{could be}} defined as the dissemination of technical knowledge in order to benefit the community in general. When referring to veterinary extension programmes, Veterinary Services appear to be involved to varying degrees. <b>Veterinary</b> extension <b>activities</b> in the Middle East region are, in general, the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture, since the private sector and other organisations still contribute very little to extension activities. Currently, the resources allocated to veterinary extension are very limited. Veterinary extension presently faces many problems due to the weakness and/or absence of effective extension services, in addition to the absence of well defined programmes to guide and support animal production, and health programmes designed for the control of animal disease and improvement of food safety standards. This weak veterinary extension is also caused by the insufficient number of veterinarians working in the region and their limited practical experience interacting effectively with animal producers, especially women, in order to tackle animal health issues and nutrition-related diseases more generally. Despite playing a vital role in animal production activitie...|$|R
40|$|Veterinary {{training}} plays {{a crucial}} role in increasing effectiveness of veterinary response to epidemic and non-epidemic emergencies. Being able to assess learning needs and to deliver training is acknowledged as a strategic priority in <b>veterinary</b> public health <b>activities.</b> The validation of an e-learning system that is able to respond to the urgent needs of veterinary professionals to ensure the despatch of rapid teaching methods on emerging and re-emerging animal diseases and zoonoses was the core of a research project developed in the Mediterranean Basin between 2005 and 2009. The project validated a new transferable, sustainable and repeatable learning model, the main components of which are described. The model is applied to an emergency situation that occurred in Italy in 2008, when West Nile disease outbreaks were reported in northern Italy. Approximately 450 official veterinarians were trained, using an e-learning system that showed adaptability and effectiveness in transferring knowledge, skills and competence to face the situation. The case was used to validate the effectiveness of the model and proved that it can be applied in any emergency situation, i. e. every time that rapid dissemination of knowledge and skills is required...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPorcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome (PRRS) was first detected in Cambodia in 2010. The disease {{was responsible for}} high morbidity and high mortality in adult pigs and the outbreak had a costly impact on those farmers affected. The {{aim of this study}} was to generate a better understanding of Cambodian swine producers’ behaviour, in relation to PRRS and its control, in areas that have previously been affected by the disease. A survey of the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAPs) of pig owners with regard to PRRS was conducted in semi-commercial and backyard farms in Takeo province in southeast Cambodia. The survey was designed to assess knowledge of PRRS disease and its transmission, farmers’ attitudes and practices related to preventive and control measures, knowledge on vaccination and perception towards local <b>veterinary</b> authority <b>activities.</b> Descriptive statistics were used to summarise qualitative data, while multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the association between selected outcomes and a number of hypothetical predictors. When presented with clinical signs typical of PRRS, most farmers identified an infectious disease as the most likely explanation for the listed clinical conditions. Farmers were also confident in recognising direct contact between pigs as one of the main ways of disease transmission; however, other viral transmission patterns typical of PRRS were mostly unknown or ignored. In general, male farmers and farmers with a higher level of education were more likely to have a better knowledge of transmission routes between pigs. In terms of attitude towards control measures, vaccination and disinfection were perceived as the most effective control practices. Farmers with a better knowledge of vaccine protocols were more likely to find vaccination effective. Village animal health workers (VAHWs) were generally in contact more with backyard farmers, while semi-commercial farmers were more prone to treat pigs themselves, raising the issue of easy and uncontrolled access to medication and vaccination. In general, farmers had a positive attitude towards local veterinarians, and lack of contact between farmers and the veterinary authority was associated more with logistic constraints than with farmers’ mistrust towards the authority...|$|R
