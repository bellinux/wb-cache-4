40|$|Simulation of the {{propagation}} of very low frequency (VLF) waves in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide remains a significant computational challenge {{as a result of}} the variable wavelength at these frequencies in the magnetized plasma environment of the lower ionosphere. The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is naturally and easily adapted to nonuniform grids and so is ideal for simulation in media where the characteristic length scale varies significantly. We present an automatic procedure based on minimal system realization to incorporate any linear, anisotropic dispersive material in the DG framework, with application to a perfectly matched layer and scattering from strong disturbances in a magnetoplasma. We apply these techniques to modeling of scattering from lightning electromagnetic pulse-induced ionospheric disturbances, calculating the full 3 -D scattered VLF wavefields from intense lightning-induced ionospheric perturbations over a large volume. We plot the spatial distribution of the phase and amplitude response as seen by a ground-based receiver over a large area.

The main goal of this investigation is to understand the propagation dynamics of fluid mud underflows that depends upon a number of factors, including: concentrations, rheological properties and released configurations of fluid mud. Laboratory experiments were conducted with different initial fluid mud concentrations in three different experimental set-ups: rectangular flume for constant volume release, rectangular flume for constant flux release, and a square pool for radial constant flux release of fluid mud. The experiments in the rectangular flume generated two-dimensional underflows.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the application of}} a recently developed chart for determining the directional properties of sound emitted from the open end of a ventilation duct. When designing a duct silencer to reduce noise from a large <b>vertical</b> <b>discharge</b> duct, it is useful to note that the first 5 to 10 dBA noise reduction may result from directivity losses at 90 degrees and can be accurately predicted. In 1971 the first author conducted sound directivity tests with 300 and 600 mm diameter ducts and the results were made into a rough chart of Duct Directivity Losses that ultimately found its way into the NSW EPA Environmental Noise Control Manual (5 June 1985, page 207. 1). It is wrong in principle and rather inaccurate, but some users are unaware of its failings. Over the last 13 years further duct directivity testing has been conducted and a new duct directivity chart drawn. It is based on sound directivity testing on ducts of 305, 400, 610, 915 and 1220 mm diameter. The directivity data has been related to the sound power level of noise emitted from the duct and the spherical dispersion of sound energy. The new Duct Directivity Chart allows the directivity gain or loss to be obtained for any diameter from 100 mm to 10 metres, at angles from zero to 135 degrees without the need for complex calculations.

40|$|We {{provide the}} high speed flow {{visualization}} and dynamic measurement {{results for the}} U-shaped and the inverted U-shaped heat driven pumps. The U-shaped heat driven pumps at the high heating powers consist of a succession of tiny bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence process. Once the "larger" spherical bubble or the bubble slug forms, it expands quickly in both upstream and downstream directions. The increased pressure leads to the liquid discharge through the outlet check valve. When the advancing vapor/liquid interface reaches a higher position in the <b>vertical</b> <b>discharge</b> branch, the condensation heat transfer in the discharge branch shrinks the bubble slug, leading to the decreased pressure and initiating the open of the inlet check valve. Thus the fresh liquid can be sucked into the system. Heat driven pumps operating at the low heating powers display the similar process. However, two major differences are identified. (1) A full cycle includes a set of positive pressure pulses corresponding {{to a set of}} tiny bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence process in each substage. Only {{at the end of the}} cycle, an apparent negative pressure pulse is created (2) For each substage in each cycle, when the newly formed bubble slug is chasing the ahead "old" bubble slug, the deformed liquid bridge is formed due to the gravity,force effect. When the two bubble slugs are merging together, a wave vapor/liquid interface occurs along the bottom of the capillary tube. For the inverted U-shaped heat driven pumps, there are fewer positive pressure pulses included, corresponding to lesser number of new bubble nucleation, growth, and coalescence process. The bubble slug in the capillary tube is very standard with the smooth vapor/liquid interface. The cycle periods and the pumping flow rates are given versus the heating powers...|$|E

40|$|Chlorinated {{aliphatic}} hydrocarbons (CAHs), which {{are among the}} most prev alent groundwater contaminants in the industrialized world, have a large potential to discharge into rivers as contaminated baseflow. This cause s diffuse contamination of the surface water and imposes environmental r isks. However, the fate of the infiltrating groundwater pollutants is in fluenced by the sediment zone in eutrophic rivers where biodegradation o f CAHs may reduce the discharge. The strong reducing conditions that may prevail in such river sediments, the abundance of organic material and the presence of CAHs could provide an ideal environment for halorespirin g bacteria, which yield energy for growth from the reductive dechlorinat ion of CAHs. By transforming the CAHs into their nontoxic end products d uring passage of the groundwater, the river sediment would act as a natu ral biobarrier, protecting the surface water from CAH pollution. This study explored the potential of eutrophic river sediments to attenu ate the infiltration of CAH-polluted groundwater discharging into the ri ver Zenne near Brussels, Belgium. Active biotic reductive dechlorination of CAHs in the sediment was suggested by a high dechlorination activity in batch- and column biodegradation tests performed with sediment sampl es, and by the detection of dechlorination products in sediment pore wat er. Monitoring of CAH concentrations and stable isotope ratios of the CA Hs (d 13 C) and the water (d 2 H and d 18 O), allowed to identify different bi otic and abiotic CAH attenuation processes and to delineate their spatia l distribution in the riverbed. In a 45 by 15 m long stretch of the rive r Zenne, pore water samples were repeatedly collected at 25 locations an d three depths in the riverbed. Microbial reductive dechlorination of th e CAHs was observed at 30 to 40 % of the investigated locations and there fore appeared the most widespread CAH attenuation process in the Zenne r iverbed, followed by dilution by surface water-mixing and unpolluted gro undwater discharge. The distribution of those processes proved to be spa tially and temporally heterogeneous. Analysis of pore water samples from stationary sampling devices, installed at three locations in the Zenne riverbed, revealed that the extent of biodegradation from 120 to 20 cm d epth in the riverbed, measured by the increase in d 13 C of the CAHs, rema ined rather constant over time. At those locations, the observed decreas e in the pore water CAH concentrations during <b>vertical</b> <b>discharge</b> of the CAH-polluted groundwater from 120 to 20 cm depth in the sediments, was c aused by a combination of biodegradation and dilution by infiltrating su rface water. The relative contribution of those two processes to the obs erved CAH attenuation varied both spatially and temporally in the Zenne riverbed. Since dilution by surface-water mixing, which is criticized as a natural attenuation process, occasionally contributed to the observed concentration decrease to a larger extent than biodegradation, this cou ld affect acceptance of the Zenne as a natural biobarrier. Bacteria from the genus Dehalococcoides, known for their CAH dechlorinat ion capacity, were detected in Zenne sediments from all investigated riv erbed locations and depths within the test area. Since these species wer e enriched in river sediment columns that actively degraded the CAHs, th ese bacteria were probably associated with the reductive dechlorination activity in the Zenne sediments. The detection of genes related to bvcA and vcrA, encoding the vinyl chloride reductive dehalogenase enzymes in Dehalococcoides, strengthened this hypothesis. Their detection implies t hat energy for growth is recovered from the degradation of the main grou ndwater pollutants discharging into the Zenne, i. e. cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC), to nontoxic ethene. By using DGGE-fing erprint analysis of relevant nucleic acid markers, it was shown that the Zenne river sediments were inhabited by a metabolically diverse bacteri al community. A large diversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria, Geobactera ceae and methanogens, which potentially compete with halorespiring bacte ria for electron resources, was identified. The high organic carbon leve l {{in the top of the}} riverbed, originating from organic matter deposition from the eutrophic surface water, resulted in a homogeneous microbial c ommunity structure that differed from the microbial community structure of the sediment underneath this layer. Continuous tests performed with Zenne sediments or aquifer collected wit hin the CAH plume adjacent to the river demonstrated that the Zenne sedi ments have a higher CAH reductive dechlorination potential than the poll uted aquifer. While reductive dechlorination of the CAHs to their non-to xic end products continuously occurred in all columns containing river s ediments, biodegradation of CAHs was never observed in the aquifer colum ns. Furthermore, results of the column tests indicated that CAH biodegra dation in the riverbed is affected by the groundwater residence time and the presence of co-contaminants. Whereas 21 µM VC, 3 µM cis-D CE and 0. 37 µM 1, 1 -dichloroethane (1, 1 -DCA) were totally removed fr om the groundwater at a pore water velocity of 2. 7 and 5. 4 cm/day, those CAHs reached the top of the approximately 1 m long sediment layer in th e columns at a pore water velocity of 9. 2 cm/day. Biodegradation of 1, 1 - DCA was inhibited by the presence of cis-DCE and VC and therefore only o ccurred at heights in the river sediment columns where cis-DCE and VC we re partially reduced. Although CAHs were never detected in the surface water, 26 to 28 % of the investigated locations in the riverbed did not show CAH attenuation. Mo reover, CAHs were not completely removed from the discharging groundwate r at 20 cm depth in the riverbed in 67 to 70 % of the remaining riverbed locations. Although attenuation processes in the top 20 cm of the riverb ed could further remove residual CAH, our data suggest that CAHs reached the surface water at certain locations in the studied riverbed section. Therefore, it was concluded that an increase in the extent of biodegrad ation in the riverbed is needed for acceptance of the Zenne biobarrier a s a viable remedial option for attenuation of discharging CAH-polluted g roundwater. Since the moderate extent of biodegradation of the CAHs in t he riverbed, despite the presence and activity of halorespiring bacteria and apparently ideal conditions for reductive dechlorination, was possi bly due to a low residence time of the CAHs in the Zenne sediments, an i ncrease in the groundwater residence time in the riverbed could improve the Zenne biobarrier efficiency. status: publishe...|$|E

This paper describes the process and its possible variations in more detail. As a first variant we investigated the horizontal hollow-cathode discharge with two different anode configurations. A row of hollow-cathode systems arranged side by side across the web creates a dense plasma shield that is located directly below the substrate. Al 2 O 3 coatings deposited via this plasma shield show a clear improvement of microstructure, hardness and abrasion resistance. A further remarkable improvement of the Al 2 O 3 properties can be attained by a <b>vertical</b> hollow-cathode <b>discharge</b> between the aforementioned plasma shield near the substrate and an anode {{in the vicinity of}} the evaporator crucible.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 This thesis {{presents}} the results of an experimental and analytical study of single-port buoyant turbulent jets discharged into shallow water. The experimental results include the measured downstream dilution, centerline concentration and trajectory. Independent parameters considered were Froude number, submerged depth, discharge angle and velocity ratio. Results indicate that decreasing the discharge depth provides earlier occurrence of surface effect and greatly decreases dilution. Dilution increases with decreasing Froude number. Increasing the discharge angle from the horizontal into cross current increases the dilution ratio. The effect of ambient current on dilution depends on the angle of discharge. For cross-flow discharges, the dilution rate decreases with increasing ambient current, while for co-flow discharge the reverse trend was observed. As plumes reach the water surface, the dilution rate increases with increasing ambient velocity. The jets bend over rapidly for cross-flow discharges when large ambient currents are present. The analytical portion of this report presents an integral method proposed by Davis (1975) for merging multiple buoyant jets. This merging model was used to simulate the single-port buoyant jet in shallow water. This was done by using an image method where the submerged depth was simulated by the spacing between images. The entrainment function as presented by Kannberg and Davis (1978) was used except for a modification within the zone of merged plumes. Comparisons of the model prediction were made with experimental data. Results indicate that good predictions are obtained for buoyant jets discharging at 0 and 45 degrees into shallow water by using the image method as long as the Froude number is above 13. 5. For lower Froude number and <b>vertical</b> <b>discharges,</b> model predictions are only fair...|$|R

We also observe that the probability of clogging along the pipe decreases with the height, i. e. most of the clogs are developed near the bottom. This spatial dependence may be attributed to different pressure values within the pipe which might also be related to a spontaneous development of an helical structure of the grains inside the pipe...|$|R

Observations of {{extremely}} low frequency (ELF) radio atmospherics (sferics), the transient electromagnetic fields radiated by lightning discharges, are {{used to determine the}} current moment waveforms of <b>vertical</b> lightning <b>discharges.</b> In order to extract this information the propagation of radio atmospherics from source to receiver must be modeled accurately, especially in view of the important role played by the D and E regions of the ionosphere at these long (> 200 km) wavelengths. We model broadband ELF sferic waveforms by adapting a single-frequency ELF propagation code to calculate an ELF propagation impulse response under the assumption of horizontal ionospheric homogeneity, with which we extract the source lightning current waveform from an observed ELF sferic waveform using a deconvolution method based on linear regularization. Tests on modeled sferics indicate that the method is accurate and relatively insensitive to noise, and we demonstrate the application of the technique with a sprite-associated sferic. Since ELF sferics can often be observed many thousands of kilometers from the source discharge, the technique developed here represents a powerful new method of remotely sensing lightning current waveforms. 1...|$|R

The momentum discharge rate is converted to a mass discharge rate based on estimates of the velocity and jet pressure as constrained by a simple fluid dynamical model.

40|$|A {{connection}} between thunderstorms and the ionosphere has been hypothesized since the mid- 1920 s(1). Several mechanisms {{have been proposed}} to explain this connection(2 - 7), and evidence from modelling(8) as well as various types of measurements(9 - 14) demonstrate that lightning can interact with the lower ionosphere. It has been proposed, {{on the basis of}} a few observed events(15), that the ionospheric 'sporadic E' layer - transient, localized patches of relatively high electron density in the mid-ionosphere E layer, which significantly affect radio-wave propagation - can be modulated by thunderstorms, but a more formal statistical analysis is still needed. Here we identify a statistically significant intensification and descent in altitude of the mid-latitude sporadic E layer directly above thunderstorms. Because no ionospheric response to low-pressure systems without lightning is detected, we conclude that this localized intensification of the sporadic E layer can be attributed to lightning. We suggest that the co-location of lightning and ionospheric enhancement can be explained by either vertically propagating gravity waves that transfer energy from the site of lightning into the ionosphere, or <b>vertical</b> electrical <b>discharge,</b> or by a combination of these two mechanisms...|$|R

An experimental technique is devised to simulate the unsteady cross-flow situation in the laboratory. A vertical jet-pipe-nozzle assembly is physically oscillated backward and forward in the steady flow stream of a laboratory flume, and the flow patterns are viewed by an observer moving with the jet. Dispersion patterns of the dye-marked jet fluid are studied with a phase-locked analysis of digitized flow images. Oscillations in cross-flow velocity are found to organize the jet fluid into regular large-scale fluid patches, which, after time averaging, lead to a widened jet width and enhanced dilution. Experiments are also carried out on a <b>vertical</b> jet <b>discharging</b> into a current with surface waves, a situation that approximates to a genuine oscillating cross-flow with a nonzero mean velocity. The two sets of experimental observations are found to match with each other.

Both chemical and isotopic data indicate that bacterial SO 4 reduction affects all these waters, especially those discharged by the secondary reservoirs. Therefore, geothermal waters must get in contact with oil, acquiring the relatively oxidized organic substances needed by SO 4 -reducing bacteria.

The length of the are was 1 1 / 2 cm, the current ca. 5 A and the axial field strength ca. 30 V/cm. The spectrum of the arc showed cyanogen bands and silver lines, the intensities of which were measured photographically. The arc temperature was derived from intensity ratios of the CN bands; in most cases the temperature was 5000 to 6000 °K. For every exposure the relative populations of the upper levels of the silver lines were derived from the temperature. From these populations and the measured intensities of the silver lines the relative transition probabilities of the lines were calculated. The results are compiled in table I. As the concentration of the silver vapour in the arc is not accurately known, reliable values of the absolute transition probabilities cannot be derived from our measurements; we have confined ourselves to a rough estimation.

Significant sources of heat inside the aforementioned laboratory are firing furnace, designed to simulate high temperature effects on structures and products of various types in case of fire development. The excess heat production in the laboratory during the tests is due to firing furnaces. The laboratory room is considered as an object consisting of two control volumes (CV), in each of which there may be air intake and air removal, pollutant absorption or emission. In modeling air exchange conditions the following processes are being considered: the processes connected with air movement in the laboratory room: the jet stream in a confined space, distribution of air parameters, air motion and impurity diffusion in the ventilated room. General upward ventilation {{seems to be the}} most rational due to impossibility of using local exhaust ventilation.

The jet-wave interaction generates two flow regimes; jet-momentum dominated near field (JDNF) and wave-momentum dominated far field (WDFF). Comparing to those of jet flow in regular waves, the transition point between the two regimes is closer to the jet outlet and the velocity decay in WDFF is milder. A Lagrangian integral model has been developed to predict the characteristics of jet in random waves. Using the commonly adopted values of the radial and forced entrainment coefficients, the computed results match the experimental data closely for cases of small to medium waves (usig/W 0 < 0. 05, usig = mid-depth maximum orbital velocity, W 0 = jet outlet velocity), while for large waves the jet width is underpredicted, showing that the entrainment coefficients are wave dependent.

40|$|Based on both {{physical}} and biological data collected from cruises in different seasons between 2010 and 2011, {{we found that the}} phytoplankton bloom was highly seasonally variable along the longitudinal axis of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and was confined to very limited locations because of the variation in the coupled physical-biological forcing of the phytoplankton growth and accumulation. We investigated the relative importance and joint control of the bloom's variation by freshwater residence time, water column stability, and light limitation that were governed by river <b>discharge,</b> <b>vertical</b> mixing, and turbidity in the PRE, respectively. We found that the bloom occurred {{in the middle of the}} well/partially mixed estuary during the dry season when river discharge was relatively small. Although the water nutrient concentration and residence time were favorable for phytoplanlcton accumulation during this season, the bloom was absent in the upper and lower parts of the estuary likely associated with high turbidity in the upper region and strong vertical mixing in the lower region. In contrast, strong river discharge during the wet season pushed the nutrient-rich river plume farther seaward and formed a salt-wedged estuary. With a stable water column and relatively low turbidity during this season, the bloom could only occur in the lower part of the estuary where the phytoplankton growth rate was greater than the water turnover rate.

40|$|Emphasizing the {{physical}} intricacies of integrated hydrology and feedbacks in simulating connected, variably saturated groundwater-surface water systems, the Integrated Hydrologic Model Intercomparison Project initiated a second phase (IH-MIP 2), increasing {{the complexity of}} the benchmarks of the first phase. The models that took part in the intercomparison were ATS, Cast 3 M, CATHY, GEOtop, HydroGeoSphere, MIKE-SHE, and ParFlow. IH-MIP 2 benchmarks included a tilted v-catchment with 3 -D subsurface; a superslab case expanding the slab case of the first phase with an additional horizontal subsurface heterogeneity; and the Borden field rainfall-runoff experiment. The analyses encompassed time series of saturated, unsaturated, and ponded storages, as well as <b>discharge.</b> <b>Vertical</b> cross sections and profiles were also inspected in the superslab and Borden benchmarks. An analysis of agreement was performed including systematic and unsystematic deviations between the different models. Results show generally good agreement between the different models, which lends confidence in the fundamental physical and numerical implementation of the governing equations in the different models. Differences {{can be attributed to the}} varying level of detail in the mathematical and numerical representation or in the parameterization of physical processes, in particular with regard to ponded storage and friction slope in the calculation of overland flow. These differences may become important for specific applications such as detailed inundation modeling or when strong inhomogeneities are present in the simulation domain...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{long waves}} with periods of several minutes have been {{recognised}} {{as an important}} exciting component to beach erosion, sedimentation in harbours, and oscillations of water and moored ships in harbours. Although long waves are usually involved in a wave train with wave groups as nonlinear bound wave components, the energy of free long waves increases drastically near the surf zone, which implies some energy transfer mechanisms from short to long waves near the shoreline. The present study regards the air bubble entrainment due to plunging breakers as another energy transfer mechanism. Air bubble entrainment by breaking waves is {{a significant factor in}} the surf zone under high wave conditions. However the air bubble entrainment process is improperly scaled by a Froude similitude (WOOD 1991, CHANSON 1997), and most laboratory experiments tend to underestimate its effects. During the present study, air bubble entrainment at plunging breakers was investigated in a large-size facility. The breaker plunging jet was modelled by an unsteady <b>vertical</b> jet <b>discharging</b> into a 20 -m long wave 0. 8 -m wide flume. The falling nappe was 0. 75 -m wide and 0. 07 -m thick at the orifice and the free-fall height ranged from 0. 82 up to 1. 32 m. The wave field downstream of the nappe impact was recorded for a range of initial flow conditions : initial water depths, initial water volumes of the pseudo plunging breaker, initial wave field. For some experiments, air entrainment was suppressed by a factor of 2 to 3 by inserting 18 -mm thin plastic sheets inhibiting bubble entrainment at the plunging jet impingement. Air entrainment at the plunging jet is associated with a rise in water level caused by the liquid displacement. FUHRBOTER (1990) suggested that the entrained air causes a transfer of energy into potential energy. The subsequent release of that energy may contribute to the generation of 2 ̆ 7 free 2 ̆ 7 long waves with periods corresponding to the duration of the water level rise. The spatial variation of the water level rise in the wave group might also generate 2 ̆ 7 free 2 ̆ 7 waves of period equal to the wave group period. In laboratory, the suppression of air entrainment is associated with a reduction of wave energy flux corresponding to about the rise bubble time. Altogether the study demonstrates the generation of 2 ̆ 7 free 2 ̆ 7 long waves by air entrained at wave breaking...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{establish}} the arc discharge in water method as a valid method of producing metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) with dielectric properties. A <b>vertical</b> arc <b>discharge</b> system was designed and fabricated and several diagnostic tools were attached to the system in order to monitor in situ the propagation of the plasma. Electrical measurements, high speed imaging, optical emission spectroscopy and electrode mass reduction measurements were employed to three different anode materials; aluminum and tantalum rods {{as well as a}} mixture of copper-tantalum compressed powder grains. The cathode of the DC arc was in all cases was a carbon rod. The product of the discharge was collected in powder form and examined by means of electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). The experiments showed that, during discharge, the physical processes occurring between the electrodes, force the anode material to evaporate in the atomic level. While atomization takes place, the water molecules surrounding the plasma region gets vaporized due to the localized high temperature resulting in the division of oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Metal and oxygen atoms bond, becoming the seeds for nanoparticle formation. The particle growth stops when quenching occurs due to the continuous condensation and expansion of the plasma. High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) examination revealed that spherical crystalline nanoparticles are formed, with an average size of 40 nm when using either aluminum or tantalum rod. XRD and XPS analyses concluded that high purity Ah 03 and Ta 20 s NPs are produced by using the arc discharge method respectively. HR-TEM was also employed to the nano-product of the composite anode showing a peculiar core-shell NP structure (mean size 20 nm). Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) was used in High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) imaging and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) modes to identify the atomic arrangement resulting in the formation of an oxidized copper core with an oxidized tantalum shell. The nano-powder was tested via BDS showing a capacitive behavior. Throughout this work it was been proven that arc discharge in water is a cost- effective and easy to implement method of preparing dielectric NPs. A methodology for studying both the process as well as the product has been described. High purity Ah 03 and Ta 20 s have been successfully produced. CuO- Ta 20 s core-shell NPs were synthesized {{for the first time and}} were characterized structurally and electrically. Adjustments in order to improve the efficiency of the system were proposed and new ideas for the formation of composite metal oxides have emerged.

40|$|The Navajo Aquifer (N-Aquifer) is an {{important}} groundwater source that provides drinking water for the Navajo and Hopi tribes in Black Mesa, Arizona. In 1968, Peabody Western Coal Company, a private sector coal company, began coal strip mining operations with the usage of the N-Aquifer. Each year Peabody withdraws 1, 200 acre-feet {{of water from the}} N-Aquifer and extracts 8 million tons of bituminous coal to fuel the Navajo Generating Station (NGS) in Page, Arizona. Electricity generated from NGS is then used to pump 1. 6 million acre-feet of Colorado River water through a 333 mile canal system to Phoenix and Tucson. In result to Peabody’s industrial withdrawals, the N-Aquifer has dropped 200 to 400 feet. This research is to assess the usage of the N-Aquifer in comparing withdrawal rates between Peabody mine and Navajo-Hopi communities. The study demonstrates that Peabody’s industrial withdrawal rates of the N-Aquifer has far exceeded municipal withdrawal rates of the Kayenta Well System and has caused spring discharge rates to decline among natural springs near Hopi villages. In addition, Peabody mine’s industrial withdrawal rates surpassed groundwater model predictions used in the mine’s impact assessments. Although the depletion of the N-Aquifer is evident through USGS monitoring data and residential observations, the Cumulative Hydrologic Impact Assessment (CHIA) criteria, which is assessed by the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) – fails to resolve, identify, and evaluate current and prospective impacts of material damage among the N-Aquifer because it is dependent on hypothetical computer groundwater model results rather than physical data from groundwater monitoring wells. While 62 percent of the total groundwater withdrawals continue to be used for coal mining activity, it is critical that OSM revises the CHIA criteria that will provide an informative baseline data model and resolution to <b>vertical</b> leakage, spring <b>discharge,</b> and base flow in washes on the Black Mesa basin...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the possible sources of high phosphate (PO 43 -) {{concentration in the}} unconfined coastal aquifer of the Po River Delta (Italy), a detailed characterization of groundwater and chemical fluxes was carried out. The unconfined aquifer is connected with the drainage system, consisting of a dense network of canals and pumping stations that continuously drain the soil. The land use is essentially agricultural {{and for this reason}} nutrients like PO 43 - could leach in the unconfined aquifer. At first PO 43 - concentrations were analyzed in 32 shallow piezometers screened {{at the top of the}} unconfined aquifer, then PO 43 - and chloride (Cl-) concentrations were also analyzed every meter in four piezometers located along a flow line via multilevel sampling technique. PO 43 - and Cl- were analyzed via an ion chromatography system Dionex ICS- 1000. In order to calculate horizontal and <b>vertical</b> specific <b>discharge</b> fluxes within the aquifer and between surface and groundwater, a detailed characterization of equivalent freshwater heads and intrinsic permeability was performed in the selected piezometers. In addition core samples were extracted for water soluble PO 43 -. Milly-Q water was used to extract the PO 43 - from the sediment samples, using a sediment:water weight ratio of 1 : 5; the sediment and water were mixed and sealed in beakers, shaken for 1 h, and centrifuged for 1 h at 25 °C to separate the sediment and the solution, then analyzed using the ICS- 1000. PO 43 - concentrations in shallow piezometers was in general below detection limits (0. 1 mg/l), except for peaty soils where concentration up to 22 mg/l were detected. PO 43 - concentrations along the selected flow line range between 12. 3 mg/l to below detection limits, the average concentration was 3. 9 mg/l generally increasing with depth. PO 43 - peak concentrations of groundwater and sediments overlapped with recent and buried peaty layers, emphasized that in this lowland coastal aquifer the high PO 43 - concentration is associated with elevated organic matter content and also related with the groundwater ionic strength, which favors the PO 43 - mobilization. In addition, the drainage system generates an upward flux of salinized groundwater mitigated only by irrigation canals during the cropping season and by natural recharge during winter time. This could threaten crop yields during years of low recharge as salinity could reach level which is not tolerable by crops like cereals. Moreover surface waters could suffer of eutrophication induced by geogenic nutrients like PO 43 -. Thus, it is concluded that the elevated PO 43 - concentrations found in groundwater come principally from sediments originated in paleo-marsh environments and cannot be “a priori” attributable to agricultural inputs. To distinguish between anthropogenic PO 43 - input and natural presence a detailed characterization of both aquifer’s hydraulics and geochemistry is required...|$|R
