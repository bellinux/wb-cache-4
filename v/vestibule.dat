5|$|The ruined Temple of Baal-hamon {{was located}} {{on the top of}} Jabal al-Muntar hill which oversees the spring of Efqa. Constructed in AD 89, it {{consisted}} of a cella and a <b>vestibule</b> with two columns. The temple had a defensive tower attached to it; a mosaic depicting the sanctuary was excavated and it revealed that both the cella and the <b>vestibule</b> were decorated with merlons.|$|E
5|$|A second long-distance {{platform}} {{and a new}} hall were built at Zoo station from 1934 to 1940. The station hall was only glazed in the 1950s, however. The notable terraced <b>vestibule</b> dates from the same time.|$|E
5|$|Below {{the tower}} is an Italianate building. On {{the ground floor}} was the Scarlet Drawing Room and a <b>vestibule</b> with an annexe which housed a kitchen and offices. The first floor held the Crimson Drawing Room, {{sanctuary}} and library.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{subterranean}} <b>vestibules,</b> each {{linked with the}} platform via an escalator. During {{the construction of the}} <b>vestibules,</b> orders of the Moscow's party committee prohibited the obstruction of traffic, so American bridges had to be built over the pits of the future <b>vestibules.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{identical}} <b>vestibules,</b> each {{on the northern}} side of the Leningradsky Avenue, and the architect for the <b>vestibules</b> was Dmitry Chechulin.|$|R
50|$|The station {{contains}} two <b>vestibules</b> underground <b>vestibules,</b> the northern one offering an exit to the Peterburgskaya Street, whilst the southern one is {{located near the}} intersection between Peterburgskaya and Esperanto street. In perspective {{it has been suggested}} to create a set of subways on the intersection. The interior aesthetics of both <b>vestibules</b> repeat that of the station.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{inside the}} {{entrance}} {{there is a}} <b>vestibule,</b> with stairs on either side {{leading up to the}} gallery. Inside {{the main body of the}} chapel is a continuous tiered gallery carried on cast iron columns.|$|E
5|$|The main door in {{the south}} face leads to the <b>Vestibule</b> or Entrance Hall. It has a floor of encaustic tiles which include depictions of the arms of Liverpool and the liver bird.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} entrance, on {{the south}} side of the belltower, leads to a small <b>vestibule</b> from which short flights of stairs rise to the sanctuary level and descend to the basement.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{underground}} <b>vestibules,</b> {{located on the}} intersection between the Andropova avenue and the Nagatinskaya/Novinki street. Both <b>vestibules</b> are interlinked with underpasses that offer exits to the surface level which covered glazed pavilions.|$|R

5|$|In 1994 the buildings' {{stained glass}} windows, parapet tower, and brownstone were repaired, {{landscaping}} redone, and, with {{a grant from}} the Sol Goldman Charitable trust, the bimah and <b>vestibule</b> were refurbished. Membership had increased to almost 200 families by 1995, and in 1996 Samuel H. Weintraub was hired as rabbi.|$|E
5|$|Refurbishment and {{improvement}} works completed in 2007 included new and reconstructed cross bridges between platforms and {{the installation of}} lifts for mobility impaired passengers. Cosmetic improvements carried {{out at the same}} time included the reinstatement of pole-mounted roundels {{on the sides of the}} entrance <b>vestibule.</b> Other work in the 2000s at the station includes the construction of a substantial air rights building spanning across the cutting.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{historian}} (I might add) {{we have seen}} in our youth in the streets of Gniezno a wooden chapel, which in the vernacular lenguage is called <b>vestibule,</b> where exist two great stones in the shape of millstones reddened with the blood of that lady, who are completely worn and faded, and were deposited in her tomb at Gniezno cathedral.|$|E
50|$|The main {{entrance}} is via two symmetrically positioned concrete stairs {{on the southern}} side of the Infants' School. At {{the top of the}} stairs are recessed porches, now enclosed by double glass doors, which open onto entry <b>vestibules.</b> Access to classrooms and offices is via these <b>vestibules</b> and the central corridor which connects them. The corridor, <b>vestibules</b> and porches have concrete floors. The rest of the building has timber floors. Some of the classrooms retain panelled folding partitions between adjoining classrooms. The classrooms are well lit via banks of timber casement windows. Hipped tiled awnings over the windows are supported on timber brackets.|$|R

5|$|Synagogue dues were {{collected}} by the shamash (the equivalent of a sexton or beadle), who augmented his salary by working as a glazier and running a small food concession stand in the <b>vestibule.</b> There mourners who came to recite kaddish could purchase a piece of sponge cake and small glass of brandy for ten cents (today $0).|$|E
5|$|The Temple of Baalshamin {{dates to}} the late 2nd century BC in its {{earliest}} phases; its altar was built in AD 115, and it was substantially rebuilt in AD 131. It consisted of a central cella and two colonnaded courtyards {{north and south of}} the central structure. A <b>vestibule</b> consisting of six columns preceded the cella which had its side walls decorated with pilasters in Corinthian order.|$|E
5|$|The plans {{called for}} a two-track station which would be {{connected}} to the surface via elevators. At ground level, {{there would have been a}} <b>vestibule</b> with traveller facilities and ticket sales. The main entrance was to be from Balchensgate, with a secondary entrance from the street junction Elisenbergveienâ€“Frognerveien.|$|E
50|$|The station {{contains}} two underground <b>vestibules,</b> the northern one opened with the station whilst the southern one was completed later and opened only on 16 May the following year. Unlike the medieval {{theme of the}} platforms, the <b>vestibules</b> aesthetics contrast with high-tech finishes a set of domed glazed skylights and lifts for the disabled.|$|R

5000|$|A purely {{utilitarian}} use of <b>vestibules</b> {{in modern}} buildings {{is to create}} an [...] "air lock" [...] entry. Such <b>vestibules</b> consist of merely a set of inner doors and a set of outer doors, the intent being to reduce air infiltration to the building by having only one set of doors open at any given time.|$|R
5|$|The {{western front}} facade {{is flanked by}} two square towers. They are both three stories high topped with silver domes and a Christian cross on top of these. Both towers have windows at each level. Access to the towers is through either of two small wooden doors located in the {{interior}} northwest and southwest corners of the church <b>vestibule.</b>|$|E
5|$|If {{the temple}} is small it {{will consist of}} only a closed mantapa (enclosed with walls {{extending}} {{all the way to}} the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed mantapa, well decorated inside and out, is larger than the <b>vestibule</b> connecting the shrine and the mantapa and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (Jali or Latticework) that serve as windows in the navaranga (hall) and Sabhamantapa (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, the {{congregation}} voted {{by a margin}} of over two to one to re-orient the synagogue pews in the manner of Christian churches, and introduce mixed seating. However, nothing was done about this until 1879, when the renovations were carried out: the front pews were removed, the side pews extended to the walls, and the <b>vestibule</b> moved outside the sanctuary. Led by rabbi Dr. E. M. Myers, the synagogue was re-dedicated on September 7.|$|E

5000|$|The station {{contains}} two <b>vestibules,</b> both located under the Stroginsky Boulevard, although {{the opening of}} the Western one was postponed due to the delays of escalator contractor in Saint Petersburg. Both <b>vestibules</b> are connected to subways that lead to large glazed pavilions, located not far from the intersection with the Tallinskaya street (Eastern) and the Kulakova street (Western).|$|R

The BEST operates a total of 4,608 buses with CCTV cameras installed, ferrying 4.5million passengers daily over 390 routes. Its fleet consists of single-decker, double-decker, <b>vestibule,</b> low-floor, disabled-friendly, air-conditioned and Euro III compliant diesel and compressed natural gas powered buses. BEST introduced air-conditioned buses in 1998. BEST buses are red in colour, based originally on the Routemaster buses of London.|$|E
5|$|On {{each side}} on the entry of the cathedral is a stone {{crucifix}} and a holy water font. High {{on the left side}} there is a brick from the Lateran Basilica, and on the right side a jubilee 2000 medal. The crypt is accessed through the door in the right wall of the <b>vestibule,</b> then up to the organ matroneum and finally down through the door on the left wall. In the crypt, there is an oratory, as well as Catechism rooms and the office of the Caritas charity.|$|E
5|$|Pennethorne's gallery was {{demolished}} for {{the next}} phase of building, a scheme by Sir John Taylor extending northwards of the main entrance. Its glass-domed entrance <b>vestibule</b> had painted ceiling decorations by the Crace family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised, and that space is now taken up by Frederic, Lord Leightonâ€™s painting of Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence (1853â€“55), lent by the Royal Collection in the 1990s.|$|E
