5|$|Also {{known as}} Paul Faraj Rahho and Paulos Faradsch Raho, {{he was an}} ethnic Chaldean, born in Mosul, where he lived almost his entire life. The city of Mosul has a long {{established}} community of Chaldean Catholics. Rahho came to worldwide attention in 2008 when he was kidnapped by gunmen and subsequently found dead in Mosul, an event that drew condemnation from the <b>Vatican</b> <b>and</b> foreign governments.|$|E
5|$|Several {{churches and}} palaces, {{including}} Saint Mark's Basilica, were looted by the French, which outraged the Italians and their artistic and cultural sensibilities. In 1797, the Treaty of Tolentino {{was signed by}} Napoleon, and two statues, the Nile and Tiber, were taken to Paris. These statues had previously been in the <b>Vatican,</b> <b>and</b> both were housed in the Louvre until 1815. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Nile was returned to Italy. However, the Tiber remained in the Louvre Museum and {{can be seen in}} the collections today.|$|E
5|$|This bill {{establishes}} {{a weapon of}} violence against our citizenry far more wicked than anything ever known in recorded history — far worse than the Siberian prison camps of the Czars or the Communists, or {{the violence of the}} Spanish Inquisition … The plot of wickedness revealed in this bill fairly reeks of the evil odor of the black forces of the Jesuits who dominate the <b>Vatican,</b> <b>and,</b> through officiates in our Government, dominate our politics.|$|E

5|$|From 1960, {{the regime}} {{increasingly}} implemented anti-Catholic policies, including harassment, atheistic propaganda, and measures that made carrying out religious practices more difficult. In 1965, the Conference of Polish Bishops issued the Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops. In 1966, the celebrations of the 1,000th {{anniversary of the}} Baptism of Poland led by the primate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński and other bishops, who toured the country, turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the Catholic Church in Poland. In fierce competition, the state authorities conducted their own national celebrations, stressing {{the origin of the}} Polish statehood, but the display of the Polish Church hierarchy's command of enormous crowds in a land ruled by the communists must have impressed the Catholic prelates in the <b>Vatican</b> <b>and</b> elsewhere. The state-church dialogue, symbolized by the presence of the few Znak independent Catholic deputies in parliament, was rapidly deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|Prince Paul {{recognised}} {{the lack}} of national solidarity and political weakness of his country, and after he assumed power he made repeated attempts to negotiate a political settlement with Maček, {{the leader of the}} dominant Croat political party in Yugoslavia, the HSS. In January 1937, Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović met with Maček at Prince Paul's request, but Stojadinović was unwilling or unable to grapple with the issue of Croat dissatisfaction with a Yugoslavia dominated by the Serb ruling class. In 1938, the Anschluss brought the Third Reich to the borders of Yugoslavia, and early elections were held in December. In this background, the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (VVKJ) commander, General Dušan Simović had been involved in two coup plots in early 1938 driven by Serb opposition to the Concordat with the <b>Vatican,</b> <b>and</b> another coup plot following the December election.|$|E
5|$|Deflated by his situation, Nguyễn Ánh asked Pigneau {{to appeal}} for French aid, and allowed Pigneau {{to take his}} son Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh with him {{as a sign of}} good faith. This came about after Nguyễn Ánh had {{considered}} enlisting English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish assistance. Pigneau advised against Nguyễn Ánh's original plan to seek Dutch aid from Batavia, fearing that the support of the Protestant Dutch would hinder the advancement of Catholicism. Pigneau left Vietnam in December, arriving in Pondicherry, India in February 1785 with Nguyễn Ánh's royal seal. Nguyễn Ánh had authorized him to make concessions to France in return for military assistance. The French administration in Pondicherry, led by acting governor Coutenceau des Algrains, was conservative in outlook and resolutely opposed intervention in southern Vietnam. To compound the already complex situation, Pigneau was denounced by Spanish Franciscans in the <b>Vatican,</b> <b>and</b> he sought to transfer his political mandate to Portuguese forces. The Portuguese had earlier offered Nguyễn Ánh 56 ships to use against the Tây Sơn.|$|E
