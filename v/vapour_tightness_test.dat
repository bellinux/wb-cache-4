40|$|Sealing roof constructions against {{water and}} vapour {{on both sides}} only works well {{as long as the}} seal is {{perfectly}} tight and no water was built in, because any water trapped in the construction can not dry out. Therefore, a common way to build wooden lightweight roofs is to compensate for the <b>vapour</b> <b>tightness</b> of the roofing membrane by installing a moderately permeable membrane at the inside to provide some drying potential for safety reasons. However, drying to the indoor space will only happen if the solar heat gains of the roof are high enough to reverse the vapour flow for a sufficient time period. The application of PV elements on a roof leads to permanently shaded areas on the roof surface. To account for the attenuation of solar radiation below such panels a model has been developed which computes the influence of radiation on a point shaded by a quadrilateral object obscuring part of the sky. Using this data the balance of interstitial condensation in such constructions and subsequent drying is investigated using an adapted hygrothermal simulation tool for heat and moisture transport in building components. The investigations show that attaching PV elements on wooden lightweight roof constructions may cause problems by moisture accumulation in some assemblies...|$|R

An absence of a tightening standard for such systems decreases the confidence in their performance under fatigue loading. Past research has shown that a tightening standard should include the development of preload in the anchor bolt sufficient to provide adequate resistance to fatigue failure. Preload should be measured by a turn-of-the-nut method. Laboratory progressive tightening tests were performed in order to monitor the stress ranges occurring in the bolt at various locations of interest at various degrees of turn-of-the-nut <b>tightness.</b> <b>Tests</b> were performed on six diameters of anchor bolt ranging from 1 to 2 - 1 / 4 inches in diameter and two different categories of thread pitch: UNC and 8 UN.

40|$|Traditionally, {{buildings}} in the Inner Himalayan valleys of Bhutan were constructed from rammed earth in the western regions and quarry stone in the central and eastern regions. Whilst basic architectural design elements have been retained, the construction methods have however changed over recent decades alongside expectations for indoor thermal comfort. Nevertheless, despite the need for space heating, thermal building performance remains largely unknown. Furthermore, no dedicated climate data is available for building performance assessments. This paper establishes such climatological information for the capital Thimphu and presents an investigation of building physics properties of traditional and contemporary building types. In a one month field study 10 buildings were surveyed, looking at building air tightness, indoor climate, wall U-values and water absorption of typical wall construction materials. The findings highlight comparably high wall U-values of 1. 0 to 1. 5 W/m²K for both current and historic constructions. Furthermore, air <b>tightness</b> <b>tests</b> show that, due to poorly sealed joints between construction elements, windows and doors, many buildings have high infiltration rates, reaching up to 5 air changes per hour. However, the results also indicate an indoor climate moderating effect of more traditional earth construction techniques. Based on these survey findings basic improvements are being suggested...|$|R

The range of motion (ROM) of the trunk, hip, and ankle joints was measured and a <b>tightness</b> <b>test</b> in the hip joint was performed to assess flexibility. The peak torque of the maximum voluntary isometric contraction in hip extension and hip abduction was measured in order to assess isometric muscle strength. One month after the assessments, the onset of lower back pain was investigated.

The results showed that the laterality of the internal and external rotation ROM of the hip joint was significantly higher in the LBP group than in the n-LBP group (p < 0. 05). The peak torque of the hip abduction was significantly lower in the LBP group compared with the n-LBP group. It is possible that the onset of lower back pain was caused by the laterality of the hip rotation ROM and weakness of the gluteus medius muscle...|$|R

Hence, it is important to focus on the building envelope properties of a BIPV system in addition to energy generation performance when conducting experimental investigations of BIPVs. The aim of this work was to illustrate challenges linked to the building envelope properties of a BIPV system, and to develop and evaluate relevant methods for testing the building envelope properties of BIPV systems.

In the Energy Cube, students design and construct (using cardboard, clear plastic, and glue) a model of a building that admits as much daylight as possible while being energy efficient and aesthetically pleasing. The students, working in teams of four, complete most of the work within six four-hour blocks allotted for the project.

40|$|In Norway, an {{emerging}} method in ensuring {{the air and}} <b>vapour</b> <b>tightness</b> of light weight timber framed walls, positions a sealed wind barrier at the exterior and a sealed vapour barrier to the interior. It {{has been found that}} the exterior layer alone is often sufficient in ensuring an acceptable level of air tightness. In terms of the overall airtightness requirements set on the building, it is thought that the interior vapour barrier could be left unsealed as the wall possesses a certain degree of redundancy. It is then important to assess whether the durability of the envelope is compromised due to moisture ingress from the interior driven by convection and diffusion. This project investigates the effect of convection on moisture accumulation, and mould growth potential, in a light-weight timber frame wall system where the air barrier is situated at the exterior and the unsealed vapour retarder at the interior. A two dimensional numerical HAM (Heat, Air and Moisture) model is used. The model is constructed and verified in COMSOL Multiphysics to evaluate the hygrothermal behaviour of a light-weight timber frame wall system with the previously described attributes. The studied wall is subject to climate conditions representative of the Gothenburg region of Sweden over one year. The light-weight timber wall system assessed is comprised of bitumen impregnated soft fibreboard with a treated exterior surface as the exterior air barrier, mineral wool as the cavity insulation and orientated strand board type 3 (OSB/ 3) as the interior vapour retarder. The unsealed nature of the interior vapour retarder is represented by the introduction of two 1 mm gaps in the layer. As means of comparison a wall assembly possessing a sealed interior OSB layer is simulated separately (no gaps). The mould growth potential of the wall system is assessed and compared utilizing the data output from the numerical model simulations and a material specific mould growth index. The results suggest that the joints of the interior vapour retarder need not be sealed considering the exterior air barrier, wall geometry, material properties and imposed boundary conditions. While the degree of moisture accumulation is comparatively larger behind the exterior air-tight layer of the simulated wall assembly possessing an unsealed interior OSB layer, especially {{at the top of the}} wall section, the influence on mould growth potential is limited. This is because the disparities in moisture accumulation between the two wall assemblies is only apparent during the winter months when low exterior temperatures prevent any kind of mould growth regardless of critical humidity values...|$|R

In 2013 JSC “NIIEFA” delivered 95 high voltage insulation breaks to the IO ITER, i. e. 65 breaks with spiral channels and 30 breaks with uniflow channels. These high voltage insulation breaks were designed, manufactured and tested {{in accordance with the}} ITER Technical Specifications: «Axial Insulating Breaks for the Qualification Phase of ITER Coils and Feeders». The high voltage insulation breaks consist of the glass-reinforced plastic cylinder equipped with channels for cryoagent and stainless steel end fittings. The operating voltage is 30 kV for the breaks with spiral channels (30 kV HV IBs) and 4 kV for the breaks with uniflow channels (4  kV HV IBs). The main design feature of the 30  kV HV IBs is the spiral channels instead of a linear one. This approach has enabled us to increase the breakdown voltage and decrease the overall dimensions of the high voltage insulation breaks.

In developing this new repair technique, the self-healing efficiency of various cementitious materials was considered. Likewise, a crack repair stick was developed to apply to concrete structures with 0. 3 mm or lower crack widths. The crack repair stick was made with different materials, such as cement, an expansive material (C 12 A 7), a swelling material, and calcium carbonate, to endow it with a self-healing property. To verify the performance of the crack repair stick for concrete structures, two types of procedures (field experiment and field absorption test) were carried out. As a result of such procedures, it was concluded that the developed crack repair stick could be used on concrete structures to reduce repair expenses and for the improved workability, usability, and serviceability of such structures.

The cable-type wall system is a newly developed system, {{which could be used}} as an existing exterior skin system, and can effectively support the wind load acting on the exterior of the high-rise buildings by the pre-induced initial tension force to the cable supporting the glass. The main advantages of the cable-type wall system are that the expense of construction could be reduced due to the simplicity of the construction. The experiment of structural analysis and air/water tightness was performed to evaluate its feasibility of industrialization. The structural performance of the cable-type wall system was evaluated through the structural analysis and the full-scale experiment to predict the initial pre-tension force and the design load displacement of the vertical one-way cable-type wall system {{that can be used for}} a typical floor of the high-rise building.

Test results show that the cable-type wall system satisfies the air/water tightness performance standards ASTM E 283, E 331 and AAMA 501.1 - 05 which are the most basic standards that the facade system must provide. As a result of this study, it is expected that the proposed cable-type wall system could be used for facade system, not only the structural performance but also air/water tightness performance are secured.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA helium inlet and {{dummy joint}} between {{conductors}} {{are one of}} the most important elements of the winding pack of the ITER PF - 1 coil double pancakes. A helium inlet is used for letting liquid helium into the PF- 1 coil conductor. A full-scale helium inlet sample for fatigue tests and the respective tooling were designed and manufactured. Fatigue tests of the full-scale helium inlet sample were conducted in accordance with ITER requirements testing parameters in order to check the fatigue strength of the structure. Before the fatigue tests thermo-cycling of the helium inlet in the temperature range of 77  to 293  K was conducted. Before and after the fatigue <b>tests</b> the leak <b>tightness</b> of the full-scale helium inlet sample was validated by the vacuum chamber method. A low ohm electrical joint is used to connect two NbTi «CICC» conductors of PF- 1 coil into a single electrical loop. To qualify the design and technology of manufacturing of the electrical joint, a full-scale dummy joint sample was developed for fatigue tests at 77  K. The main design feature of the full-scale dummy joint sample for fatigue tests is a symmetrical model of two dummy joint samples with simultaneous loading to compensate the bending moment. Fatigue tests of the full-scale helium inlet sample at 77  K have been successfully conducted in 2013. Fatigue tests of the full-scale dummy joint sample will be conducted in 2014. This paper represents the results of calculating the stress-strain state of the symmetrical model of the full-scale dummy joint sample for fatigue tests with the prescribed loading and strain, the work on designing the symmetrical model of the dummy joint sample for fatigue tests and the test facility for conducting fatigue tests at 77  K. Also the results of the leak <b>tightness</b> <b>tests</b> and thermo-cycling of the full-scale helium inlet and the results of it fatigue tests at 77  K, are presented...|$|R
