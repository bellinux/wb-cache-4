40|$|This report {{describes}} the pathologic and microbiologic findings in tracheal stenosis of feedlot cattle. Although this condition {{is well known}} to some veterinarians and laboratory diagnosticians, it has received limited attention in the lit-erature. In this condition, extensive edema and hemorrhage in the dorsal wall of the trachea results in coughing, dyspnea, and respiratory stertor, giving rise to the colloquial ‘term “honker cattle. ” 7 In many instances, affected animals may be found dead with few or no premonitory signs. Practition-ers report that this condition is most common in <b>heavier</b> <b>cattle</b> during the warmer months of the year, and episodes seem to be precipitated by strenuous movement of <b>heavy</b> <b>cattle</b> in hot, dusty feed yards. Several lesions and diseases associated with the bovine larynx and trachea have been reported, including tracheitis, 1 contact ulcers of the voca...|$|R

40|$|Orissa {{is one of}} {{the most}} flood prone states of India. The floods in Orissa mostly occur during monsoon season due to <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> {{rainfall}} caused by synoptic scale monsoon disturbances. Hence a study is undertaken to find out the characteristic features of <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall (24 hours rainfall ≥ 125 mm) over Orissa during summer monsoon season (June–September) by analysing 20 years (1980 – 1999) daily rainfall data of different stations in Orissa. The principal objective of this study is to find out the role of synoptic scale monsoon disturbances in spatial and temporal variability of <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall over Orissa. Most of the <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall events occur in July and August. The region, extending from central part of coastal Orissa in the southeast towards Sambalpur district in the northwest, expe-riences higher frequency and higher intensity of <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall with less interannual vari-ability. It is due to the fact that most of the causative synoptic disturbances like low pressure systems (LPS) develop over northwest (NW) Bay of Bengal with minimum interannual varia-tion and the monsoon trough extends in west–northwesterly direction from the centre of the system. The <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall occurs more frequently with less interannual variability on the western side of Eastern Ghat during all the months and the season except September. It occurs more frequently with less interannual variability on the eastern side of Eastern Ghat during Sep-tember. The NW Bay followed by Gangetic West Bengal/Orissa is the most favourable region of LPS to cause <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall over different parts of Orissa except eastern side of East-ern Ghat. The NW Bay and west central (WC) Bay are equally favourable regions of LPS to cause <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall over eastern side of Eastern Ghat. The frequency of <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rain-fall does not show any significant trend in recent years over Orissa except some places in north-east Orissa which exhibit significant rising trend in all the monsoon months and the season as a whole. 1...|$|R
