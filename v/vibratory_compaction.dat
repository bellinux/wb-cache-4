This project aims to use a <b>vibratory</b> method of <b>compaction</b> using an electric jackhammer to address these problems. Background: The MDR test is used to establish the Maximum Dry Density (MDD) and the Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) of coherent constriction materials for embankments, footings and pavements. This result is compared to {{the result of a}} field density test to find the relative density for quality control of construction projects. Methodology: A 1240 W electric jackhammer with a flat compaction plate was to supply compaction energy to the sample. The jackhammer was initially used hand held to find the compaction characteristics of the jackhammer then an apparatus was designed and built to hold the jackhammer during operation. Comparison was made between the results from Queensland Main Roads test method Q 110 A and the project results. Testing consisted of 4 test series exploring the relationships between: - The time of compaction and maximum dry density. - The reciprocating mass of the electric jackhammer and maximum dry density. - Standard deviation, spread of results, average maximum dry density and optimum moisture content between the project method and test method Q 110 A. - The performance of the project method as applied to different soil types.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Compaction {{is one of}} the key {{processes}} in the construction of road pavement layers. Not only is it significant in ensuring the structural integrity of the material in the road layers, but it also has an influence on the engineering properties and performance of the soil material. A poorly compacted material is characterised by low density, high porosity and below standard shear strength. This, as a result causes rutting, moisture susceptibility, potholing, corrugations and passability problems on the road. Therefore, it is vitally important that field compaction is done correctly. For this reason, laboratory compaction methods have been developed to simulate the field compaction process in the laboratory. The Mod AASHTO test has long been used as the laboratory compaction method of choice by virtue of its simplicity and the lack of bulky equipment required. However, previous studies have established that the Modified AASHTO method does not adequately simulate field compaction criteria especially for cohesionless materials. Two reasons have been advanced; The Mod AASHTO compaction method does not adequately simulate the compaction done in the field when the granular mix is laid; The compaction method may cause disintegration of the material. Alternative tests have been considered and much research has focused upon the use of a modified demolition hammer (vibratory hammer) for laboratory compaction of granular materials. This study undertook to evaluate the influence of test factors pertinent to the <b>vibratory</b> hammer <b>compaction</b> method. The influence of these test factors on compaction time and obtainable material density was assessed with the objective of developing a compaction method for granular materials. <b>Vibratory</b> hammer <b>compaction</b> tests were conducted on G 3 hornfels, G 4 hornfels and G 7 sandstone material types and to a lesser extent, reclaimed asphalt (RA). Densities obtained were referenced to Mod AASHTO compaction density. Findings of the study showed that, the mass of the tamping foot has a significant influence on the obtainable compaction density. Other factors such as, moisture content, frequency and frame rigidity were also found to affect <b>compaction</b> with the <b>vibratory</b> hammer. In addition, it is shown that the surcharge load does not significantly influence the obtainable compaction density but does contribute to the confinement of the material and restricts the upward bounce of the hammer. On the basis of the results and findings, a compaction method was proposed, incorporating test parameters and factors that would provide ideal results for a set compaction time. Repeatability tests showed that, the developed <b>vibratory</b> hammer <b>compaction</b> method was effective in compacting graded crushed stone material types (i. e. G 3 and G 4) and probably RA. The test was not as effective on the G 7 material. Further studies on this material (G 7) are required. In addition to the previous testing regime, a comparative assessment of the developed <b>vibratory</b> hammer <b>compaction</b> method in relation to the vibratory table method was done. The results show that the vibratory hammer is capable of producing specimens of densities comparable to those of the vibratory table. A sieve analysis undertaken before and after compaction showed that compaction with the developed <b>vibratory</b> hammer <b>compaction</b> method does not result in any significant material disintegration. Based on the results of this study, a specification for the determination of maximum dry density and optimum moisture content of granular material using the vibratory hammer is recommended. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Kompaksie is een van die belangrikste prosesse in die konstruksie van die padplaveisel. Dit is nie net waardevol vir die versekering van strukturele integriteit van die materiaal, maar dit het ook 'n invloed op die ingenieurseienskappe en vermoë van die grond materiaal. 'n Swak gekompakteerde materiaal word gekenmerk deur 'n laë digtheid, hoë porositeit, on onvoldoende skuifweerstand. Die kenmerke maak die material vatbaar vir vogen. Lei tot spoorvorming, slaggate, golwe en deurgangs probleme op die pad. Dit is dus uiters noodsaaklik dat veld kompaksie korrek gedoen word. Om hierdie rede, is kompaksie metodes in die laboratorium ontwikkel om sodaend veldkompaksie te simuleer. Die “Mod AASHTO” laboratorium kompaksie toets is die gekose laboratorium kompaksie metode op grond van sy eenvoudigheid en gebruik van minimale toerusting. Vorige studies het egter bevestig dat die “Mod AASHTO”-metode nie veldkompaksie akkuraat kan simuleer nie, veral vir kohesielose materiaal. As gevolg van twee hoofredes; Die Mod AASHTO kompaksiemetode is nie ‘n realistiese en vergelykende simmulering van kompaksie soos dit in die veld gedoen word nie; Die kompaksie metode mag verbrokkeling van die materiaal veroorsaak. Alternatiewe toetse was oorweeg en baie navorsing het gefokus op die gebruik van 'n aangepaste vibrerende hamer. Hierdie studie het onderneem om verskeie relevante toetsfaktore van die vibrerende hamer en hul invloed op die kompaksie en verkrygbare digtheid te bestudeer. Die invloed van hierdie toetsfaktore op kompaksietyd en verkrygbare materiaal digtheid was geassesseer met die doel om 'n kompaksiemetode vir granulêre materiaal te ontwikkel. Vibrerende hammer kompaksietoetse was uitgevoer op G 3 hornfels, G 4 hornfels en G 7 sandsteen materiaal en tot 'n mindere mate herwinde asfalt. Digthede verkry was verwys na die Mod AASHTO kompaksie digtheid. Resultate van die studie het getoon dat die gewig van die stamp voet ‘n merkwaardige invloed het op die verkrygbare kompaksie digtheid. Ander faktore soos voginhoud, frekwensie en raam styfheid het ook getoon om kompaksiedigtheid te beïnvloed met die vibrerende hammer. Benewens was ook getoon dat die toeslaglading geen beduidende invloed het op die verkrygbare kompaksie digtheid nie, maar wel bydrae tot die inperking van die materiaal en verhoed die vertikale terugslag van die hammer. Gebaseer op die resultate en bevindinge was ‘n kompaksiemetode voorgestel wat toets parameters integreer met toetsfaktore en tot volg ideale resultate vir ‘n gegewe kompaksietyd voorsien. Herhaalde kalibrasie toetse het getoon dat die ontwikkelde kompaksiemetode effektief is in die kompaktering van gegradeerde gebreekte klip materiaaltipes (G 3 en G 4) en moontlik herwanne asfalt. Die toets was nie so doeltreffend op die G 7 materiaal nie. Verdere studies op hierdie materiaal (G 7) is dus nodig. Addisioneel tot die vorige toets, is bevind dat ‘n vergelykende assesering van die ontwikkelde vibrerende hammer kompaksiemetode in verhouding tot die vibrerende tafel. Die resultate wys dat die vibrerende hammer die vermoë het om toetsmonsters met digthede vergelykbaar met die vibrerende tafel te produseer. Sifanalise voor en na kompaksie het getoon dat verdigting met die ontwikkelde vibrerende hamer kompaksie metode nie lei tot die disintegrasie van die materiaal nie. Gebasseer op die resultate van dié studie was ‘n spesifikasie vir die bepaling van maksimum droé digtheid en optimale voginhoud van granulêre material aangeraai...|$|R
40|$|Vibratory rollers are {{commonly}} used for compaction of embankments and landfills. This task is time consuming and constitutes {{a significant part of}} most large construction and infrastructure projects. By improving the compaction efficiency, the construction industry would reduce costs and environmental impact. This research project studies the influence of the vibration frequency of the drum, which is normally a fixed roller property, and whether resonance can be utilized to improve the compaction efficiency. The influence of frequency on roller compaction has not before been studied but the concept of resonance compaction has previously been applied successfully in deep compaction of fills and natural deposits. In order to examine the influence of vibration frequency on the compaction of granular soil, small-scale compaction tests of sand were conducted under varying conditions with a vertically oscillating plate. Subsequently, full-scale tests were conducted using a <b>vibratory</b> soil <b>compaction</b> roller and a test bed of crushed gravel. The results showed that resonance can be utilized in soil <b>compaction</b> by <b>vibratory</b> rollers and plates and that the optimum compaction frequency from an energy perspective is at, or slightly above, the coupled compactor-soil resonant frequency. Since rollers operate far above resonance, the compaction frequency can be significantly reduced, resulting in a considerable reduction in fuel consumption, environmental impact and machine wear. The thesis also presents an iterative equivalent-linear method to calculate the frequency response of a vibrating foundation, such as a compacting plate or the drum of a roller. The method seems promising for predicting the resonant frequency of the roller-soil system and can be used to determine the optimum compaction frequency without site- and roller-specific measurements.

The objective of the literature review is to determine what standard laboratory test methods based on vibration exist for the control of compaction, to what soil types these tests are applicable and what the factors are which affect laboratory <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction.</b> The study revealed that extensive research {{has been carried out}} in the USA and Europe, where standard laboratory compaction tests exist for the determination of the maximum dry density of cohesionless, free-draining soil. The US methods are based on the use of a vibratory table, while the European practice is based on the use of a vibratory tamper. No standard tests appear to exist for soil exhibiting cohesion, though limited research has been carried out in the USA into the behaviour of such soils under laboratory <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction.</b> The factors; frequency, amplitude, mould size and shape surcharge intensity and manner of application, soil type, time of vibration, number of layers and moisture content are all reported to {{have an effect on the}} maximum dry density achievable. It has been recognised that significant interaction occurs between the factors affecting <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction,</b> but the extent of the interaction appears to be only partly understood.

The effects on dry density of changing the frequency, the time of vibration, mould size, surcharge pressure, grading and moisture content were investigated. It is concluded that the graded crushed stone in question can be compacted to Mod.

40|$|Although it {{is known}} that impact {{compaction}} tests are not appropriate for granular soils, these tests continue to be widely used. Excessive settlements frequently occur in granular soils where specified field compaction is based on Standard Proctor (ASTM D 698; AASHTO T 99) maximum dry unit weights. A laboratory test program evaluated alternative test methods for granular soil compaction control and showed that a Vibrating Hammer method (similar to British Standard BS 1377 : 1975, Test 14) has great promise for laboratory compaction of these soils. A One-Point Vibrating Hammer test on an oven-dry soil sample is able to provide the maximum dry unit weight and water content range for effective field compaction of most granular soils. The maximum dry unit weight obtained is comparable to that from other current methods such as the Vibrating Table test (ASTM D 4253) and the Modified Proctor test (ASTM D 1557), and is greater than that from the Standard Proctor test (ASTM D 698). The method is applicable to a broader range of soils than current <b>vibratory</b> table <b>compaction</b> tests (up to 35 percent non-plastic fines and up to 15 percent plastic fines). The equipment is relatively inexpensive and is portable enough to be taken into the field. The test is easier and quicker to perform than the other methods mentioned above and provides reproducible and consistent results. Large sized granular soils/aggregates create potential problems for compaction control methods due to the presence of oversize particles. Oversize particles defined here are those retained on a 3 / 4 -inch (19 -mm) sieve. INDOT Specification 202. 34 (b) 2 requiring correction of densities from laboratory compaction tests on soils with oversized particles is not being used in practice. It is not being followed primarily because guidance is not provided. As a result, the values of maximum dry unit weight from standard compaction tests will be significantly lower than those corrected for oversized particles. This finding may be the biggest reason why granular fills with oversized particles are under- performing. The proposed Vibrating Hammer Method of Compaction specifically addresses the influence of oversize particles. Based on the results from this research, a draft ASTM Standard for the Vibrating Hammer Method of Compaction has been written, is well into the balloting process, and should become an ASTM Standard Method of Test in late 2007 or early 2008. It is included in Appendix A. This report also introduces a simple calibration procedure to verify that the vibrating hammer is supplying sufficient energy to the soil. The Vibrating Hammer Method of Compaction is an alternative method for specifying maximum dry unit weights for granular soils. The method also establishes a water content range for field compaction. This research expands the applicable range of granular soils to those containing oversize particles. An experimental program, along with review of previous compaction research, was carried out to determine the effect of oversize particles on compaction performance. Testing was performed in two sizes of compaction molds, 6 - inch and 11 -inch, in determining this effect. An oversize correction method was considered for water content and dry density when performing a test in a 6 -inch mold with scalping, i. e. removal of oversize particles. Results of an INDOT pilot implementation project used to determine the viability of using the Vibrating Hammer for field compaction are reported. Results indicate that the Vibrating Hammer method is sufficient for use with oversize particles and that maximum dry unit weights may occur at or near saturation...|$|R

The morphology analysis in micro scale and elemental analysis of samples were carried out by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The optimum compressive strengths of rubber cement stabilized gravel (RCSG) with static compaction method and with <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction</b> method were obtained by controlling compaction degree and vibration time, respectively.

The impact method of testing soil in the laboratory is conservatively used by engineers for design and construction control purposes even when the specified mode of compaction on site is vibratory. Furthermore, the effects of <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction</b> are not fully understood, and hence this mode of compaction in the field has not always been effectively utilized. The objective of this research project was to determine whether the vibrating hammer method could be used in the laboratory for design and control purposes, through an investigation of its operating characteristics, and a comparison of its effectiveness against that of the impact method, following a study of the compaction properties of a range of different soils used in road and embankment construction. The results of the study showed that the vibrating hammer can be used in place of impact in the laboratory for non-cohesive soils and gravels.

In {{order to}} solve the problem of aeolian sand {{subgrade}} compaction, we studied the technology of impact compaction, applied it to the engineering practice and analyzed its effect with Rayleigh wave.

Nine different compaction patterns varying from 2 to 6 passes with minimum 7 Mg rollers and utilizing combinations of static and <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction</b> were employed on six different overlay paving projects. Core densities were determined at five random locations on each control strip, resulting in 270 (5 x 6 x 9) core densities. Densities between compaction patterns were compared. Although the data indicate that introducing vibration and increasing the required number of passes from 4 to 6 would increase densities from those achieved with the curren...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEstablishment of the {{fragility}} of historic structures near rights of way often produces costly delays in construction. Autonomous Crack Measurement (ACM) of micro meter response of cracks can be employed to assess the potential for adjacent construction activities to cause cosmetic cracking in both historic and non-historic structures. ACM measurement of micro meter crack width changes caused by long term climatological and vibratory roller compaction adjacent to an adobe (native mud brick) structure is employed to illustrate the use of micro meter changes in crack width {{as a tool for}} structural health monitoring. It was found that long term or weather-induced crack responses are much larger than those induced by high frequency <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction,</b> even at US and above European regulatory limits. At more typical levels the potential for formation of cosmetic cracks in newer adobe structures are negligible. Thus for this class of adobe structures, normal regulatory guidance is sufficient for construction or operation of transportation facilities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this work, the {{numerical}} equation {{has been established}} to simulate the <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction</b> system based on the hysteresis loop of Davidenkov and with the gap ignored between the piston and the materials, and the dynamical characteristics and influence of parameters on the vibration compaction effect were analyzed with different stiffness, damping, amplitude and mass. Two types of experiments were carried out to study the dynamical characteristics and validate {{the numerical}} analysis and simulation. The first type of experiments {{was done with the}} different exciting vibration amplitude. The second type of experiments was done with the different water saturation instead of the stiffness and damping. The numerical and experimental results show that the equivalent natural frequency and vibration amplitude of the system increased with the stiffness, exciting amplitude increased and damping decreased. The experimental results agree well with results from a theoretical model in general. The research results will be used in intelligent granular compaction in the future...|$|E
40|$|Compaction {{forms an}} {{integral}} part {{in the formation of}} the aggregate orientation and structure of an asphalt mixture and therefore has a profound influence on its final volumetric and mechanical performance. This article describes the influence of various forms of laboratory (gyratory, vibratory and slab-roller) and field compaction on the internal structure of asphalt specimens and subsequently on their mechanical properties, particularly stiffness and permanent deformation. A 2 D image capturing and image analysis system has been used together with alternative specimen sizes and orientations to quantify the internal aggregate structure (orientation and segregation) for a range of typically used continuously graded asphalt mixtures. The results show that in terms of aggregate orientation, slab-compacted specimens tend to mimic field compaction better than gyratory and <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction.</b> The mechanical properties of slab-compacted specimens also tend to be closer to that of field cores. However, the results also show that through careful selection of specimen size, specimen orientation and compaction variables, even mould-based compaction methods can be utilised with particular asphalt mixtures to represent field-compacted asphalt mixtures...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{modified}} wood particles used to particleboards manufacture may, at {{the same}} time, improve the dimensional stability and damage the internal bond. The aim {{of this research was}} find the optimal point of acetylation for particleboards. Pinus taeda particles with different degrees of acetylation, 8, 15 and 20 % of weight percentage gain (WGP), were used in the production of particleboards with urea-formaldehyde resin and wood-cement composites produced by mechanical and <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction.</b> It was evaluated the water absorption, thickness swelling and internal bind of the particleboards according to the European standards EN 317 and EN 319. Particleboards produced with 15 WPG showed the lowest water absorption and thickness swelling values. However, the use of chemically modified wood had a negative influence in the internal bind of the boards. This phenomenon can be explain due to the similar behavior between resin and water, that way, the high degree acetylation stops the adhesive and adherent bind. In the case of wood-cement composites, the internal bind improves as the acetylation degrees get higher. Nevertheless the inhibition of acetylated wood particles to the cement hydration got higher when the WPG was higher than 8 %...|$|E
40|$|A {{fabrication}} {{facility with}} related process equipment has been constructed to fabricate fuel rods containing /sup 233 /U and thorium oxide by the bulk oxide-vibratory compaction route {{and is now}} in operation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. While the initial motivation for the facility was to fabricate /sup 233 /U-bearing 1 / 2 -in. -dia x 46 -in. -long Zircaloy- 2 clad fuel rods for criticality experiments at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, sufficient flexibility has been incorporated into the facility to accommodate a variety of development work on a pilot-plant scale. The facility consists of a number of permanent alpha-tight cubicles which are shielded with 41 / 4 -in. steel. The fabrication process is carried out remotely in these cubicles with the exception of several gloved-hand operations which occur where the dexterity required for manipulation exceeds that of the remote castle-type tongs. The fabrication equipment that has been installed in the facility performs the operations associated with oxide powder comminution and classification, <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction</b> of oxide in fuel tubes, tube closure, fuel rod decontamination, and fuel rod inspection. Both the facility and the process equipment are described in detail, and detailed assembly drawings of the process equipment are included. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Phase II {{research}} {{included the}} following: (1) develop and evaluate alternative soil design and embankment construction specifications based on soil type, moisture, density, stability, and compaction process; (2) assess various quality control and acceptance procedures {{with a variety}} of in-situ test methods including the Dual-mass Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP); and (3) develop and design rapid field soil identification methods. At the start of the research, soils were divided into cohesive and cohesionless soil types, with each category being addressed separately. Cohesionless soils were designated as having less than 36 % fines content (material passing the No. 200 sieve) and cohesive soils as having greater than 36 % fines content. Subsequently, soil categories were refined based not only on fines content but soil plasticity as well. Research activities included observations of fill placement, in-place moisture and density testing, and dual-mass DCP index testing on several highway embankment projects throughout Iowa. Experiments involving rubber-tired and <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction,</b> lift thickness changes, and disk aeration were carried out for the full range of Iowa soils. By testing for soil stability the DCP was found to be a valuable field tool for quality control, whereby shortcomings from density testing (density gradients) were avoided. Furthermore, critical DCP index values were established based on soil type and compaction moisture content...|$|E
40|$|Aubrey Berrangé, a South African roads engineer, {{invented the}} impact {{compactor}} in 1949 {{with the intention}} of achieving improved compaction to greater depths than possible with conventional equipment available at the time. The aim of this dissertation is to present a simple prediction model for the profile of improvement in the ground, using surface settlement as the main input parameter. The model is based on the information reviewed, observation of field data and a static numerical analysis. For simplicity sake, no attempt is made to predict the energy requirement to achieve the input value of settlement. The model is then verified on fifteen impact compaction profiles at six different sites. A 2 ton-meter dropping mass compactor was also used in the verification process with reasonable success. In addition, the model was tested against comprehensive testing performed at a dynamic compaction site with very promising results. The method is also shown to give acceptable results for prediction of density increase during a <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction</b> trial. It is concluded that the improvement in the ground can be estimated with reasonable success if the surface settlement is monitored, providing strains are taken into account.

40|$|A {{theory was}} {{developed}} to allow the separate determination {{of the effects of}} the interparticle friction and interlocking of particles on the shearing resistance and deformational behavior of granular materials. The derived parameter, angle of solid friction, is independent of the type of shear test, stress history, porosity and the level of confining pressure, and depends solely upon the nature of the particle surface. The theory was tested against published data concerning the performance of plane strain, triaxial compression and extension tests on cohesionless soils. The theory also was applied to isotropically consolidated undrained triaxial tests on three crushed limestones prepared by the authors using <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction.</b> The authors concluded that, (1) the theory allowed the determination of solid friction between particles which was found to depend solely on the nature of the particle surface, (2) the separation of frictional and volume change components of shear strength of granular materials qualitatively corroborated the postulated mechanism of deformation (sliding and rolling of groups of particles over other similar groups with resulting dilatancy of specimen), (3) the influence of void ratio, gradation confining pressure, stress history and type of shear test on shear strength is reflected in values of the omega parameter, and (4) calculation of the coefficient of solid friction allows the establishment of the lower limit of the shear strength of a granular material...|$|E
40|$|Issue: The {{moisture}} {{content of a}} fill material will affect its compaction characteristics {{and needs to be}} evaluated during quality control of the fill operation. When the fill is drier than its optimum {{moisture content}}, any moisture in the fill serves as a lubricant and helps the relative movement of the particles when densifying under <b>vibratory</b> <b>compaction.</b> When the fill is wetter than its optimum moisture content, the moisture absorbs part of the compaction energy and prevents the formation of a denser material. Hence, moisture content determination constitutes an important part of quality control because the information is used in evaluating the compaction efficiency and material behaviors. Accurate assessment of the moisture content of a fill material is important also because the density requirement of fill is based on the dry density of the material, and the dry density is calculated based on the measurements of wet density corrected for moisture content. When using a nuclear densometer, the most popular test device, these measurements are conducted simultaneously using separate mechanisms. The dry density is then calculated by an integrated circuit in the densometer. Therefore, an accurate measurement of the moisture content is necessary for an accurate assessment of dry density and meaningful quality control. For a free-draining material such as cullet aggregate, the accuracy of moisture content measurement by a nuclear densometer may suffer from nonunifor...|$|E
