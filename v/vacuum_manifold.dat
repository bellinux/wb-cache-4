This construction forms a specialized field of glassblowing requiring precise control of shape and dimension. In addition to repairing expensive or difficult-to-replace glassware, scientific glassblowing commonly involves fusing together various glass parts—such as glass joints and tubing, stopcocks, transition pieces, and/or other glassware {{or parts of}} them to form items of glassware, such as <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifolds,</b> special reaction flasks, etc.|$|R

50|$|The more {{supersymmetry}} there is, {{the stronger}} the restriction on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold.</b> Therefore, if a restriction appears below for a given number N of spinors of supercharges, then it also holds for all greater values of N.|$|E

5000|$|The PCV valve is a {{variable}} orifice {{that controls the}} flow of crankcase fumes, admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract. With no <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> a restrictor—generally a cone or ball—is held by a light spring in a position exposing the full size of the valve's orifice to the intake manifold. With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a vacuum leak, causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume of crankcase fumes generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume of crankcase fumes; because of the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume of crankcase gas is present. Most of it escapes under its own pressure via the crankcase breather, flowing into the engine's intake tract via the air cleaner.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century {{electron}} ionization {{has been one}} of the most popular ionization techniques because of the large number of applications it has.

50|$|The first {{restriction}} on {{the geometry of}} a moduli space was found in 1979 by Bruno Zumino and published in the article Supersymmetry and Kähler Manifolds. He considered an N=1 theory in 4-dimensions with global supersymmetry. N=1 means that the fermionic components of the supersymmetry algebra can be assembled into a single Majorana supercharge. The only scalars in such a theory are the complex scalars of the chiral superfields. He found that the <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold</b> of allowed vacuum expectation values for these scalars is not only complex but also a Kähler manifold.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{is often}} used to drive {{auxiliary}} systems on the vehicle. Vacuum-assist brake servos, for example, use atmospheric pressure pressing against the engine <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> to increase pressure on the brakes.

Vacuum tanks were installed on trailers to control their integrated braking systems.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the geometric volume of a soliton coincides with the thermodynamical volume also for field theories with higher-dimensional <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifolds</b> (e. g., for gauged scalar field theories supporting vortices or monopoles). We apply this observation to understand Bradlow type bounds for general abelian gauge theories supporting vortices. In the case of SDiff BPS models (being examples of perfect fluid models) we show that the geometric "volume" (area) of the vortex, which is base-space independent, is exactly equal to the Bradlow volume (a minimal volume for which a BPS soliton solution exists). This can be finite for compactons or infinite for infinitely extended solitons (in flat Minkowski space-time). Comment: Latex, 31 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

50|$|Additionally, it is {{necessary}} to decide whether each line is to be monitored individually and how this is to be done. If there is a single vacuum sensor, whether an electronic transducer connected to the control computer or only a sensitive gauge checked visually, determining which vacuum bag is leaking means shutting each one off in turn and watching for a slight change in <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure. Given the airflow restrictions in the average lay-up and vacuum lines, even a complete vacuum bag failure may show up {{as little more than a}} small change in vacuum level.|$|E
50|$|In {{quantum field}} theories, the {{possible}} vacua are usually labelled by the vacuum expectation values of scalar fields, as Lorentz invariance forces the vacuum expectation values of any higher spin fields to vanish. These vacuum expectation values can take any value {{for which the}} potential function is a minimum. Consequently, when the potential function has continuous families of global minima, the space of vacua for the quantum field theory is a manifold (or orbifold), usually called the <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold.</b> This manifold is often called the moduli space of vacua, or just the moduli space, for short.|$|E
5000|$|In an [...] 4D SUSY theory the moduli {{space of}} the hypermultiplets, called the Higgs branch, has a hyper-Kähler metric and is not renormalized. In the article Lagrangians of N=2 Supergravity - Matter Systems it was further shown that this metric is {{independent}} of the scalars in the vector multiplets. They also proved that the metric of the Coulomb branch, which is a rigid special Kähler manifold parametrized by the scalars in [...] vector multiplets, is independent of the scalars in the hypermultiplets. Therefore the <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold</b> is locally {{a product of a}} Coulomb and Higgs branch. The derivations of these statements appear in The Moduli Space of N=2 SUSY QCD and Duality in N=1 SUSY QCD.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} using the vacuum is to {{eliminate}} background signal and avoid intermolecular collision events, therefore, providing a long mean free path for the ions. The vacuum system, including the vacuum pumps and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold</b> with its various interfaces, is often the heaviest part and consumes the most power in a mass spectrometer. In the case of TOF, if the length of drift region is decreased, the pressure inside region can be operated at higher value because the free collision region is still maintained for a short traveling distance of the ions. As a result, the vacuum system requires less power to run the system. For a trap-type mass analyzer, because the ions are trapped in the device for long periods and the accumulated trajectory length is much longer than {{the size of the}} mass analyzer, the size reduction of the mass analyzer may not directly affect the adequate operating pressure. Miniature rough-turbo pump configurations similar to lab-scale instruments have been developed to be compatible with MMS. For high-vacuum pumping, turbomolecular pumps are also upgraded. A Thermo Fisher Orbitrap used three turbo pumps in LC-MS modes to achieve a vacuum below 10−10 torr.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the leading}} groups in academy for {{creating}} ion-trap MMS is Prof. Graham Cooks with his associate Professor Zheng Ouyang at Purdue University. They have built a series of mini mass spectrometer based on quadrupole ion trap called Mini 10, Mini 11, Mini 12. The group used Mini 10 mass spectrometer weighing 10 kg to analyze proteins, peptides and alkaloids in complex plant materials with electrospray ionization ESI. The group used low radio frequency of resonant ion ejection to increase mass range up to 17,000 Da proteins. For interfacing ESI source with MMS, a 10 cm stainless steel capillary was fabricated to transfer the ions directly into the <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold.</b> The resulting high pressure of 20 mTorr, which is several orders of magnitude higher than that used in lab-scale mass spectrometers is compensated by using the pressure-tolerant rectilinear ion trap (RIT). One of the key component of this MMS is the commercial turbo-bump and the MS can be operated at 10−3 torr. To overcome the problem of continuous sample introduction {{because of the small}} size of the pump, the group developed a technique called discontinuous atmospheric pressure introduction (DAPI). This technique performs direct chemical analysis without sample pretreatment and enables the coupling of miniature mass spectrometers to atmospheric pressure ionization sources, including ESI, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and various ambient ionization sources. The ions are transferred from ionization source and hold at a punch-valve and injected to MS periodically. The performance of a hand-held Mini-10 mass spectrometer was upgraded with negative ion mode for detecting explosive compounds and hazardous mateirals at picogram level which is highly applicable for airport luggage checking.|$|E
