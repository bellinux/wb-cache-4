40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} was to study mite {{diversity}} in vineyard plots planted with Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir cultivars and on associated non-cultivated plants in two <b>viticultural</b> <b>regions</b> of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Monthly assessments of leaves and buds of vines and of non-cultivated plants were undertaken between October 2006 and September 2007. Twelve thousand mites belonging to 17 families and 46 genera and representing 61 mite species were collected. The most abundant phytophagous mites were Calepitrimerus vitis, Colomerus vitis and Panonychus ulmi on grapevines. Among the predatory mites, the most abundant were Neoseiulus californicus and Agistemus floridanus. The non-cultivated plants species that showed the greatest richness of mites were Plantago tomentosa, Plantago lanceolata and Senecio sp. The most abundant phytophagous mites on non-cultivated plants were Tetranychus ludeni and Brevipalpus phoenicis in the <b>viticultural</b> <b>regions</b> of Bento Gonçalves and Candiota, respectively, and Pronematus anconai was generally the most abundant predatory mite.

Today this area has been resurrected and is now home to over 40 different wineries. Amador County is renowned for its Zinfandel, but many other varietals are produced as well. Amador County has a high percentage of old Zinfandel vines. Some of the Zinfandel vineyards in this county are more than 125 years old, including the original Grandpère vineyard, planted with Zinfandel before 1869 and believed to be the oldest Zinfandel vineyard in America. This 10 acre vineyard is home to some of the oldest Zinfandel vines on Earth, with proof of their existence dating to 1869 when it was listed as a descriptor on a deed from the U.S. Geological Survey.

Furthermore, considering that DNA markers for hap-loid, uniparentally inherited genomes, such as the chloro-plast DNA, are important indicators of pedigree, CpSSR analysis was also performed and this identified cases of maternal common origin among the analysed cultivars. The results show that these molecular tools allow uni-vocal genotype identification and that the analysed germ-plasm has a wide genetic dissimilarity.
