5|$|Swift died, aged 44, in the Munich air {{disaster}} after {{reporting on}} Manchester United's European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade in Belgrade, Yugoslavia for the News of the World. On 6 February 1958, the {{flight back to}} Manchester carrying the Manchester United team and journalists made a refuelling stop at Munich-Riem Airport in poor weather. Two take-off attempts were abandoned due to engine problems, with the weather continuing to deteriorate. On the third attempt, slush on the runway prevented the aircraft from reaching the required speed for take-off. The plane <b>veered</b> <b>off</b> the runway and crashed into a house. One of 23 victims of the disaster, Swift {{was one of two}} journalists pulled alive from the wreckage but died on his way to hospital, as his seat belt had cut into his aorta.|$|E
5|$|The {{second wave}} came in LCIs. These were craft {{that had no}} ramps; {{infantry}} disembarked from the down gangways. That they were not suitable for an assault landing was not overlooked, {{but they were all}} that was available. The first wave's mission had been to capture Scarlet Beach and the foreshore. Since that had not been done, they came under fire from the Japanese bunkers. Despite explicit orders not to, they replied with their Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Some helped to suppress the Japanese machine guns, while others fired wildly and caused casualties among the Australian troops ashore. Like the first wave, they <b>veered</b> <b>off</b> to the left, adding to the chaos. At least three of the LCIs grounded on a sand bar, but were able to retract and make better landings, although still on the wrong beach.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the LCP(R)s in {{the first}} wave <b>veered</b> <b>off</b> course to the left, landing between Siki Creek and the rocks of the {{headland}} between Siki Cove and Arndt Point. All the boats landed successfully except for one carrying 11 Platoon of the 2/15th Infantry Battalion, which had broken down and was towed by the LCP(R) carrying 10 Platoon, delaying both. Another LCP(R) appeared and took the platoon in. But {{only three of the}} sixteen landed on Scarlet Beach. In some ways this was good, as it meant that the plywood landing craft were not subjected to intense machine gun fire, which might have caused heavy casualties; but there were still serious disadvantages to landing on the wrong beach. On the right, Captain T. C. Sheldon's B Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, accompanied by the anti-tank platoon and 10 Platoon the Papuan Infantry Battalion, landed roughly where they were supposed to, and pushed on to their objective, North Hill.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Dixon {{succeeded in}} {{bringing}} his ship alongside the Spanish frigate {{and opened a}} heavy fire, to which Gerraro replied with his own broadside. The larger and more powerful British ship was able to rapidly inflict severe damage to the Santa Dorotea, and within minutes the mizenmast had fallen and the mainmast and rudder were severely battered. As Santa Dorotea <b>veered</b> <b>off</b> course, O'Neil passed Lion for a third time, at an even greater distance than before, and once again his broadsides failed {{to have an effect}} and again he came under fire from the British vessel. His last attempt to save Santa Dorotea defeated, O'Neil turned away and his ships raised all sail in the direction of Cartagena at 13:10. Gerraro, his isolated ship trapped by Lion, which was slowly turning back towards the drifting frigate, raised the Union Flag upside down as a sign of surrender.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1958, a B-47B Stratojet crashed {{while taking}} off from Loring, killing all four crewmembers on board. The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. The plane was {{described}} as having reached {{two-thirds of the way}} down the runway, when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north of the runway. On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly in the same area as the B-47 three days before. Two crewmembers were thrown to safety by the impact of the crash. The Air Force stated that after a four-hour mission, the crewmembers were practicing taking off and landing on the runway. On 18 November 1960, a KC-135 crashed upon landing at Loring, killing one and injuring sixteen others. The plane landed after a six-and-a-half-hour training mission, <b>veered</b> <b>off</b> {{to the left of the}} runway, and skidded three thousand feet while on fire. Surviving crewmembers were able to use the emergency chutes to evacuate the plane safely. On 9 May 1962, six crewmembers of a KC-135 were killed when their plane crashed during takeoff into a surrounding marsh, about fifteen hundred feet north of the runway. On 4 January 1965, four crewmembers were killed three miles north of Loring when their KC-135 crashed into the ground after takeoff. On 5 September 1969, a B-52 Stratofortress crashed approximately three miles north of the runway after taking off. Seven men were killed, including six crewmembers, during a Minimum Interval Takeoff drill. On 4 October 1989 a KC-135 crash killed all 4 crewmembers. The jet, which crashed about 2.4 miles off the TransCanada Highway in New Brunswick, was attempting to land at Loring.|$|E
25|$|In the end, {{the inquiry}} had a larger {{focus on the}} crews of the San Juan and S.C.T. Dodd. After {{interviewing}} survivors, it became disputed whether the crew acted appropriately towards the disaster or not. Turner claimed that either way, nothing {{could have been done}} to help passengers survive the sinking as {{there was no time for}} action. First Officer Charles Tulee of the San Juan reported a similar statement to the inquiry. The inquiry claimed the San Juan had <b>veered</b> <b>off</b> course. Third Officer Robert Papenfuss of the San Juan, despite having claimed the S.C.T. Dodd had been the ship which <b>veered</b> <b>off</b> course, was found guilty of negligence, leading to his license being revoked. Evidence surfaced after the inquiry's conclusion, proving that the S.C.T. Dodd had <b>veered</b> <b>off</b> course rather than San Juan, proving Papenfuss' innocence.|$|E
