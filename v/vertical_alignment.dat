5|$|Since {{the first}} modern {{measurements}} of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie, various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations. It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in the Plough / Big Dipper which was known to Egyptians as the thigh. It is thought that a <b>vertical</b> <b>alignment</b> between these two stars checked with a plumb bob was used to ascertain where north lay. The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction.|$|E
5|$|According to Chapter I, Article 28, {{paragraph}} 2 of the Constitution, {{the national}} colors of Poland are white and red.

If the colors are displayed vertically, the white stripe {{is placed on the}} left from the onlooker's viewpoint. Attachment no. 2 to the Act shows the national colors in both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>alignment,</b> as well as the official shades of both colors expressed as coordinates in the CIE xyY (CIE 1931) color space with the tolerated color differences (ΔE) specified in the CIE 1976 (L*, u*, v*) color space (CIELUV).|$|E
5|$|For his String Quartet, Lutosławski had {{produced}} only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind {{them in a}} full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in <b>vertical</b> <b>alignment</b> to coincide, {{as is the case}} with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called mobiles), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the formulation of}} a three-dimensional highway alignment optimization model. The coordinates of the highway is parametrized by using a three-dimensional cubic spline polynomial interpolation. The solution is obtained by locating the optimal horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>alignments</b> simultaneously while subject {{to a wide range}} of possible constraints. These constraints may be bounds on the slope or curvature, as well as avoidance of inaccessible region. It is an extension from a previous research work where optimal <b>vertical</b> highway <b>alignment</b> was determined for a preselected horizontal alignment. Two numerical examples based upon the actual ground conditions in Singapore are presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. Some computational details such as scaling and selection of initial variables which affect the rate of convergence are also briefly discussed. ...|$|R

[...] Concerned as always with Modernismo's need to break from the past, he formulated {{a distinction between the}} classical music of 18th- and 19th-century Europe, and what he called the music of the future, which would be based simultaneously on modernist breakdowns of musical form and on an understanding of folk and popular music. [...] The music of the past, he said, was conceived in terms of space: whether counterpoint, with its multiple voices arranged in <b>vertical</b> <b>alignment,</b> or the symphonic forms, in which the dominant voice is typically projected on top of a complex accompaniment. [...] Future music would be arranged in time rather than space: [...] "moment by moment" [...] (in Luper's translation).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a program for}} optimizing forest road alignments using the Dijkstra shortest path method and a cubic spline function. We previously developed a method for optimizing forest road alignments once a series of intersection points (IPs) were selected manually using Tabu Search. The application of the program to a part of Capitol State Forest in Washington State, USA indicated that the program successfully found better alignments than manually selected initial alignments. In order to find initial solutions without manually initialized solutions, the Dijkstra method and a cubic spline function were combined with our optimization program. The Dijkstra method connected some segments between two end points and the spline function generated smooth <b>vertical</b> <b>alignments</b> between two end points based on the horizontal alignments. In order to adapt the new method for forest road design to our existing method, the program converted the spline curves to straight and parabolic sections. The solution using a spline function was 10 % poorer than the solution without a spline function, but computing time significantly reduced from 73 hours to 19 hours using the spline function. Furthermore, the program generated smooth <b>vertical</b> <b>alignments</b> automatically. This study reports our initial effort to use the spline function in optimal road design. Additional investigation could improve solution quality using the Dijkstra method and cubic splines...|$|R

2500|$|Printed {{music is}} often written on several {{different}} staves. [...] For instance, piano music is typically written {{on two different}} staves combined into the grand staff: one for treble clef and one for bass clef, while choral music often has four different staves (one each for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). [...] The notes in different staves that play simultaneously are aligned vertically. Because of the linear nature of braille music {{and the fact that}} the blind musician can typically read only one staff at a time, multiple staves are handled in several ways depending on the complexity of the music and other considerations. Bar over bar format is most similar to print music. [...] Simple piano music in bar over bar format is quite similar to print music, with right-hand notation on the top line and left-hand notation on the bottom line. [...] Some degree of <b>vertical</b> <b>alignment</b> between the right and left hands is maintained. Other ways of dealing with multiple-staff music are line over line format, , paragraph style, and bar by bar format. [...] As a rule these formats take up less space on the page but require more of the musician in working out how to fit the staves together. For instance, in a piano score notated in section by section format, the right-hand part may be written out for the first 8 measures, followed by the left-hand part. [...] No attempt is made to align the parts. The same procedure is followed for measures 9-16, and so on, section by section, throughout the score. The blind musician learns and memorizes one section right hand alone, then left hand alone, then works out the hands together by memory and referencing various spots in the braille score to work out how the sections fit together. A note from the transcriber often clarifies the format used. [...] However, with many older and more complex scores the format must be determined by examination of the music and context.|$|E
