40|$|Oomycete {{diseases}} cause significant losses {{across a}} broad range of crop and aquaculture commodities worldwide. These losses can be greatly reduced by disease management practices steered by accurate and early diagnoses of pathogen presence. Determinations of disease potential can help guide optimal crop rotation regimes, <b>varietal</b> <b>selections,</b> targeted control measures, harvest timings and crop post-harvest handling. Pathogen detection prior to infection can also reduce the incidence of disease epidemics. Classical methods for the isolation of oomycete pathogens are normally deployed only after disease symptom appearance. These processes are often-time consuming, relying on culturing the putative pathogen(s) and the availability of expert taxonomic skills for accurate identification; a situation that frequently results in either delayed application, or routine ‘blanket’ over-application of control measures. Increasing concerns about pesticides in the environment and the food chain, removal or restriction of their usage combined with rising costs have focussed interest in the development and improvement of disease management systems. To be effective, these require timely, accurate and preferably quantitatve diagnoses. A wide range of rapid diagnostic tools, from point of care immunodiagnostic kits to next generation nucleotide sequencing have potential application in oomycete disease management.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>varietal</b> <b>selection</b> of flax (Linum Usitatissimum L) {{has always}} focused on {{specific}} criteria fulfilling requirements of farmers and textile workers. Thus, the current development of composites using flax as reinforcement presents new challenges for flax breeders {{in terms of}} fiber quantities and quality. However, {{the impact of the}} <b>varietal</b> <b>selection</b> on the mechanical properties of resulting fibers is yet to be determined. In the present study, several architectural characteristics of flax stems are defined. Stem transverse sections from four varieties selected from the 1940 s to 2011 are compared. Anatomical changes over time are highlighted. The most important ones involve the gap between fiber bundles and the amount of fibers which can be improved with the selection (from 7. 8 % to 13. 4 % of the tissue area per section). This trend coincides with the increase in biomass production over time expected from the selection work. Moreover, this study demonstrates that flax fibers preserve their good mechanical performances in spite of the anatomical differences. Thus, through <b>varietal</b> <b>selection,</b> it is possible to increase the biomass yield while preserving the excellent specific mechanical properties of flax fibers. Finally, flax fibers can compete with glass fibers to reinforce composite materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Intercropping of cabbage with a clover (Teunissen et al. 1995) or encouraging clover in the grassways around the fields may serve to increase natural enemies (Pobožniak and Wiech 2005). Another option may be mulching which Trdan et al. (2008 b) found to show potential for increasing early cabbage production. While not examined in this study, the reproductive modes of T. tabaci may offer an opportunity for control. Li et al.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsTerry GriffinWeather {{uncertainty}} plays a {{large role}} in farm management decisions. Changes in weather trends or increased variability during the growing season may alter the optimal farm management choices regarding machinery purchases, crop allocation to available acreage, <b>varietal</b> trait <b>selection,</b> and crop management practices. These farm management decisions impact the expected length of time available from planting to harvest. The dates that farmers most actively plant and harvest crops changes from year to year based on annual weather patterns that affect the number of days suitable to conduct fieldwork. This research analyzed corn planting and harvest progress, as well as the number of days suitable for fieldwork in Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri. Variability of days suitable for fieldwork across crop reporting districts within each state was reported. The total number of days suitable for fieldwork during the ‘most active’ planting and harvest weeks in each state were then analyzed to determine if increasing or decreasing trends exist and estimated as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The outcomes presented in this research indicated a statistically significant decreasing trend in days suitable for spring planting in Iowa, and positive trend in Missouri during fall harvest. However, no statistically significant trends were observed in Kansas for either time period. Farm management implications were examined in relation to the results of the days suitable for fieldwork analysis, specifically regarding machinery sizing decisions. Profit maximizing producers must manage machinery such that they are not over-equipped, but have adequate equipment capacity to plant and harvest all acreage within the available days suitable for fieldwork. Results of these analyses are directly of interest to farmers desiring to optimally equip their farms, agricultural lenders providing farmers with financing of equipment, and equipment manufacturers...|$|R

This investigation was conducted to study the relationship between RFLP-derived genotypes and heterotic patterns {{of a group of}} maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines. A total of 22 inbreds was crossed to four testers (B 73, B 76, Mo 17, and Va 26) in combinations that minimized crossing within heterotic groups. Forty-seven single-cross progeny were subsequently evaluated for several agronomic traits (including grain yield and moisture, ear height, and root lodging) over 2 – 4 consecutive years at two to four Iowa locations in a randomized complete-block design. The inbred lines were subjected to RFLP analysis, which involved 47 genomic clones and the restriction enzymes EcoRI and HindIII. Hybrid RFLP patterns were predicted from their inbred parents. Modified Roger 2 ̆ 7 s distances were computed to estimate genetic distance among the inbred lines. Principal component analysis facilitated ascertainment of relative dispersion of the inbreds based on the frequency of variants at specific RFLP loci. Evident associations of variants with genes affecting agronomic traits were identified by principal component regression analysis, in which adjusted hybrid means were regressed on the matrix of hybrid variants frequencies. The hybrid means were adjusted by removing environmental effects, using residuals as dependent variables in the regression analysis. Results from this study suggest that RFLP analysis may be of value in allocating maize inbreds to heterotic groups, but no relationship between RFLP-based genetic distance and hybrid performance was apparent.

The genotype by location interaction trials were planted at two different locations of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The study of top vs. bottom segments performance was conducted on farmer's field at Dargai (Malakand). All these experiments were conducted in triplicate RCB, Design with plot area of 67 m 2 (10 m x 6. 7 m). The cluster analysis based on 20 morphological attributes divided 16 sugarcane genotypes into four different clusters by UPGMA method at Euclidean distance of 4. 99. Pair wise Euclidean distance ranged from 2. 30 to 7. 43. The highest Euclidean distance was recorded between genotypes Hoth 127 and MS 91 CP 238 while the lowest was recorded between genotypes S 96 SP 1215 and MS 99 HO 93.

40|$|Published online: 05 Nov 2009 A {{number of}} {{improved}} varieties {{have been developed}} by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), combining diverse plant type with resistance or tolerance to several diseases, insect pests, and parasitic weeds and possessing other good agronomic traits. Trials were established with farmers to evaluate several new IITA-bred cowpea varieties on-farm {{in a process of}} participatory <b>varietal</b> <b>selection.</b> Central to this has been a ‘mother-daughter’ approach with researcher-managed ‘mother’ trials and farmer-managed ‘daughter’ trials in order to combine researchers' and farmers' criteria in evaluation of new varieties. In both set of trials, new varieties IT 89 KD- 391, IT 97 K- 499 - 35, and IT 89 KD- 288 were favoured by farmers because of their high grain and fodder yields. Farmers have also shown interest in the continuous use of a local variety Kanannado Brown. It is suitable for relay intercropping; having a creeping habit, and the ability to smother weeds. The brown seeds fetch higher market prices. The implications are that improved cowpea varieties should be suitable for relay-intercropping and controlling weeds, be brown in colour, have large grain size, be pest resistant as well as give high yields of grain and fodder. At the same time, {{it is important that the}} farmer's criteria should be considered in breeding and <b>varietal</b> <b>selection</b> programmes.

40|$|An {{intensive}} <b>varietal</b> <b>selection</b> {{program was}} begun at the Experiment Station in 1936, when only 5 acres of (seedling) macadamias had been planted in Hawaii. By 1959 over 2000 acres had been planted, mostly of selected clonal varieties {{named by the}} Station in 1948. In this bulletin the authors, having published {{an evaluation of the}} collection in 1952, narrowed the list of seven named cultivars to three recommended ones based on vigor and bearing capacity but primarily on anthracnose resistance. The bulletin reviews grafting techniques, cultural practices for the young and bearing orchard, major pests and diseases, and processing technology...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{adoption}} and impact of an improved groundnut cultivar in Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, India. Despite positive results in farmer-participatory <b>varietal</b> <b>selection,</b> adoption was extremely low despite promotional efforts of a local NGO. The few farmers who adopted the variety generated significant benefits. They earned higher profits per hectare and their agricultural asset portfolios (a measure of wealth) increased significantly more than those of non-adopters. This {{raises the question of}} why, if the variety is beneficial, adoption is so low. Some possible explanations and their implications for future varietal development and dissemination are discussed...|$|E
