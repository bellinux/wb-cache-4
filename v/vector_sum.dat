5|$|The orbital angular {{momentum}} of electrons is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that {{is proportional to the}} {{angular momentum}}. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the <b>vector</b> <b>sum</b> of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) cancel each other out.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the <b>vector</b> <b>sum</b> are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E

Specically, it is shown that <b>vectors</b> of <b>sums</b> of comonotonic random variables dominate in the orthant convex order <b>vectors</b> of <b>sums</b> of random variables that are smaller in the increasing convex sense, whatever their dependence structure. This result is then used to derive orthant convex order bounds on random <b>vectors</b> of <b>sums</b> of random variables.

(Because of overall charge neutrality, the dipole moment is independent of the observer's position r.)

25|$|Electrical loads {{consuming}} {{alternating current}} power consume both real power and reactive power. The <b>vector</b> <b>sum</b> of real and reactive {{power is the}} apparent power.

We define a notion of expected governor markup, which <b>sums</b> <b>vectors</b> indexed by governors and scaled by probabilistic tree weights. The quantity is computed in a parse forest representation of the set of tree analyses for a given sentence, using <b>vector</b> <b>sums</b> and scaling by inside probability and flow. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{impedance}} Z is the <b>vector</b> <b>sum</b> of reactance and resistance; {{it describes}} the phase difference and {{the ratio of}} amplitudes between sinusoidally varying voltage and sinusoidally varying current at a given frequency.

25|$|In the leftmost figure above, the x and y {{components}} of the light wave are in phase. In this case, the ratio of their strengths is constant, so {{the direction of the}} electric vector (the <b>vector</b> <b>sum</b> of these two components) is constant. Since the tip of the vector traces out a single line in the plane, this special case is called linear polarization. The direction of this line depends on the relative amplitudes of the two components.|$|E
25|$|A rock is {{a mixture}} of minerals, each with its own Curie temperature; the authors {{therefore}} looked for a spectrum of temperatures rather than a single temperature. In the ideal sample, the PDC did not raise the temperature of the fragment beyond the highest blocking temperature. Some constituent material retained the magnetism imposed by the Earth's field when the item was formed. The temperature was raised above the lowest blocking temperature and therefore some minerals on recooling acquired the magnetism of the Earth as it was in AD 79. The overall field of the sample was the <b>vector</b> <b>sum</b> of the fields of the high-blocking material and the low-blocking material.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of distant objects and a {{rotating}} reference frame, what {{must be taken into}} account is the resultant force of centrifugal and Coriolis force. Consider a distant star observed from a rotating spacecraft. In the reference frame co-rotating with the spacecraft, the distant star appears to move along a circular trajectory around the spacecraft. The apparent motion of the star is an apparent centripetal acceleration. Just like in the example above of the car in circular motion, the centrifugal force has the same magnitude as the fictitious centripetal force, but is directed in the opposite, centrifugal direction. In this case the Coriolis force is twice the magnitude of the centrifugal force, and it points in centripetal direction. The <b>vector</b> <b>sum</b> of the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force is the total fictitious force, which in this case points in centripetal direction.|$|E
25|$|Consider {{a generic}} example {{in which the}} initial {{transition}} state along a concerted pathway is represented by a black dot on a red diagonal (Figure 1). Changing {{the height of the}} corners can have two effects on the position of the transition state: it can move along the diagonal, reflecting a change in the Gibbs free energy of the reaction (ΔG°), or perpendicular to it, reflecting a change in the energy of competing pathways. Thus, in accordance with the Hammond postulate, the transition state moves along the diagonal towards the corner that is raised in energy (a Hammond effect) and perpendicular to the diagonal towards the corner that is lowered (an anti-Hammond effect). In this example, R is raised in energy and I(2) is lowered in energy. The transition state moves accordingly and the <b>vector</b> <b>sum</b> of both movements gives the real change in its position.|$|E
25|$|CIV - Critical Ionization Velocity Experiment (1990-9/AFRL-Kirtland AFB) Release of xenon {{and carbon}} dioxide gases from nozzles on the ARGOS {{orbiting}} with a velocity of about 7.4km/s {{at an altitude of}} about 800km is proposed. The releases will be conducted mostly in darkness over the Maui telescope site. The <b>vector</b> <b>sum</b> of the satellite and gas velocities will exceed the velocity requirement for the critical ionization velocity (CIV) process of xenon. It is feasible that the xenon gas will achieve critical velocity ionization. Associative ionization and collisional stripping will not occur for the xenon gas and there is no photo-ionization in darkness; ionization processes competing with CIV are absent. Neutral density, ambient magnetic field, and seed ionization effects on the xenon gas CIV will be discussed. Unlike xenon, carbon dioxide will not undergo CIV because of its higher velocity requirement. However, it is feasible that carbon dioxide colliding with the atmospheric species will form excited CO and OH molecules, which will radiate subsequently. Optical, IR, and UV observations on the satellite and at Maui Optical Telescope will provide diagnostic measurements for the experiment.|$|E

It is more complicated than simply using only the low pair vector differences to make models since the complementary data set (the low pair <b>vector</b> <b>sums)</b> is needed in order to resolve other field constituents. In the next section such a mechanism is indeed developed. The application of this mechanism to Swarm will be discussed in Section 5.|$|R
