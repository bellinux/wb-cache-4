5|$|The {{implementation}} of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals {{to qualify for}} refugee status prompted {{some of them to}} opt for the <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriation</b> programme; between 1,000 and 2,000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR. In the early 1990s, as Vietnam began to experience economic growth, the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia dropped. Joint collaborations between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia {{to reduce the size of}} its Vietnamese refugee populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong refugee camp in November 1991. 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriation</b> programme, and Malaysia's refugee populace reduced to 6,000 by 1994. Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass the UNHCR screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants. The majority of them expressed their reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam; demonstrations and rioting broke out when news of the camp's impending closure was announced in 1995. Sungei Besi refugee camp was later closed in June 1996. The last refugees returned to Vietnam in 2005.|$|E
25|$|John Tyndall only {{received}} 411 (30%) of the votes, giving Griffin {{the majority}} with 70%. After Griffin won he began modernising the party's image, though the crucial policy change from compulsory to <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriation</b> {{had already been}} accomplished under Tyndall's leadership. Griffin moved the party from {{a focus on the}} status of Jews in Britain, to allowing Jews to stand for the party. A new monthly newspaper, The Voice of Freedom, was initiated, as well as a journal, Identity. During the 2001 general election, following the milltown riots, Oldham and Burnley polled highest for the BNP. Following 9/11 the BNP made further political capital.|$|E
25|$|In late 1941, with Romania's {{participation}} on the Eastern Front as a German ally, Manuilă again proposed, in his memos to Antonescu, {{a population}} exchange, meaning {{to solve the}} issue of Northern Transylvania. He and Antonescu discussed this matter face to face, during a meeting in the Bessarabian town of Tighina. Manuilă also envisaged the mass return of ethnic Romanians from Bulgaria and Serbia, the eventual relocation to Germany of all Germans in Romania, and a <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriation</b> of the Csangos and Romanian Turks. He later advised Antonescu on resettling scattered communities of Romanian Ukrainians into the more compact Transnistria. These were to be then moved in other areas, where they were to replace Jews, Ukrainians and Russian Bessarabians—a measure that was actually set in motion in November 1941.|$|E
50|$|In August 2010 {{following}} an earlier fatal incident involving travellers and gendarmerie at Thésée, near St. Aignan, Loir et Cher, Hortefeux has vigorously pursued {{a policy of}} destroying illegal travellers' camps and imposing conditions for <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriations</b> of Roma (or gypsies) to Romania and Bulgaria, {{a considerable number of}} which are in progress. A circular emanating from his office (chef de cabinet: Michel Bart) on 5 August 2010, specifically mentioning an ethnic criterion for these deportations provoked the ire of ministerial colleagues such as Eric Besson and the European commissioner, Viviane Reding. An eirenic exchange with Cardinal André Vingt-Trois, the President of the French Bishops' Conference, representing contrasting reactions within the Catholic community, also ensued.|$|R
40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this paper {{are those of the}} author and not of USAID. 2 This paper discusses the challenge of contemporary repatriation, which has been transformed from relatively small <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriations</b> that are safe and follow fundamental changes to large returns to troubled countries where repatriation is often violent, compelled, and premature. Because the nature of return has a direct effect {{on the nature of the}} reintegration program, the paper discuss issues such as protracted complex emergencies; reintegration of returnees and restoration of civil society; coordination and closure of assistance; and rehabilitation, development, and funding shortfalls. This decade has seen a great variety of refugee repatriation and return. Although virtually all of the individual numbers and totals are suspect, they do reveal a broad pattern. Of the 14 million refugees who have returned home in the 1990 s, almost 90 percent are spontaneous returns, refugees making their own decision to go home without waiting for significant international assistance. In addition, they are not returning to post-conflict societies, they are returning during conflict to societies where there is no peace to keep or it is a fragile peace at best...|$|R

It stressed the importance of the <b>voluntary</b> disarmament, demobilisation, <b>repatriation,</b> reintegration and resettlement (DDRRR) programme and for all armed groups to participate in the process.|$|R
25|$|The UN counterattack in the {{aftermath}} of the Chinese Spring Offensive stabilized the front along the 38th parallel. The rest of the war involved little territory change, large-scale bombing of the population in the north, and lengthy peace negotiations, which started in Kaesong on July 10, 1951. Even during the peace negotiations, combat continued. For the South Korean and allied forces, the goal was to recapture all of what had been South Korea before an agreement was reached in order to avoid loss of any territory. The Chinese attempted similar operations at the Battle of the Hook and the Battle of Kumsong. A major issue of the negotiations was repatriation of POWs. The Communists agreed to <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriation,</b> but only if the majority would return to China or North Korea, something that did not occur. The war continued until the Communists eventually dropped this issue.|$|E
500|$|In August 1988, Malaysia and Vietnam jointly {{proposed}} an involuntary repatriation agreement, which provided for Vietnamese refugees {{that failed to}} gain admittance to Western countries to be counselled to return to Vietnam. A few Vietnamese government delegations were deployed to conduct [...] outreach sessions {{at some of the}} refugee camps. This arrangement was considered unsuccessful because less [...] than 40 individuals registered for the <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriation</b> programme between 1988 and 1989. A deadline was set for 14 March 1989, whereby all Vietnamese who arrived before that date would automatically be considered refugees and all refugees arriving after that date would undergo a screening process to assess whether they qualified for refugee status. The screening process was proposed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in June 1988; it involved thorough background checks on arrivals to determine whether they qualify for refugee status to be sent to any Western countries that were willing to accept them. Within 10 months, 4,000 of 9,000 refugees were sent to Western countries. In the same period, an additional 11,000 refuges arrived in Malaysia.|$|E
2500|$|Tyndall {{suggested}} {{replacing the}} EEC with a trading association among the [...] "White Commonwealth", namely countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

However, officially the BNP {{had no plans to}} re-establish the British Empire or secure dominion over non-white nations. In the 2000s, it called for an immediate military withdrawal from both the Iraq War and the Afghan War. It has advocated ending overseas aid to provide economic support within the UK and to finance the <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriation</b> of legal immigrants.|$|E
50|$|In Part I, para 23, the VDPA reaffirms that everyone, without {{distinction}} of any kind, {{is entitled to}} the right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution, as well as the right to return to one's own country. In this respect it stresses the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, its 1967 Protocol and regional instruments. It expresses its appreciation to States that continue to admit and host large numbers of refugees in their territories, and to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for its dedication to its task. It also expresses its appreciation to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. And VDPA recognises that, in view of the complexities of the global refugee crisis and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, relevant international instruments and international solidarity and in the spirit of burden-sharing, a comprehensive approach by the international community is needed in coordination and cooperation with the countries concerned and relevant organisations, bearing in mind the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. This should include the development of strategies to address the root causes and effects of movements of refugees and other displaced persons, the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms, the provision of effective protection and assistance, bearing in mind the special needs of women and children, as well as the achievement of durable solutions, primarily through the preferred solution of dignified and safe <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriations,</b> including solutions such as those adopted by the international refugee conferences. And underlines the responsibilities of States, particularly as they relate to the countries of origin. And regarding disasters, that in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of humanitarian law, VDPA emphasizes the importance of and the need for humanitarian aid to victims of all natural disaster and man-made disaster.|$|R

50|$|On 30 July 2002, the {{different}} parties signed the Pretoria agreement. The {{nature of the}} mission of the peacekeepers changed. The military observers monitored the withdrawal of 20 000 Rwandan soldiers, but they also noted the rise of ethnic violence in Ituri. At the end of 2002 there were a total of 4200 UN soldiers in the DRC. By Resolution 1445 the Security Council authorized the increase of military personnel to 8500. The principle of two independent intervention forces was also approved. MONUC had to support the <b>voluntary</b> disarmament, demobilization, <b>repatriation,</b> reintegration and resettlement (DDRRR) process, but without using force.|$|R
2500|$|When Griffin {{took control}} of the party, the policy of <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriation</b> was officially adopted, with the party {{suggesting}} that this could be financed through the use of the UK's pre-existing foreign aid budget. It stated that any non-whites who refused to leave would be stripped of their British citizenship and categorised as [...] "permanent guests", while continuing to be offered incentives to emigrate. Griffin's BNP also stressed its support for an immediate halt to non-white immigration into Britain and for the deportation of any illegal migrants in the country. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show in 2009, Griffin declared that, unlike Tyndall, he [...] "does not want all-white UK" [...] because [...] "nobody out there wants it or would pay for it".|$|E

40|$|The {{choice between}} {{temporary}} and permanent migration is today {{central to the}} design of migration policies. The authors draw a distinction between the two types of migration {{on the basis of the}} associated social cost and the dynamics of learning by migrants. They find that unilateral migration policies are globally inefficient because they lead to too much permanent migration and too little temporary and overall migration. Existing international agreements on labor mobility, such as the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services, have failed to do better because they seek primarily to induce host countries to make commitments to allow entry. Instead, Pareto gains and more liberal migration could be achieved through multilateral agreements that enable host countries to commit to <b>repatriation.</b> <b>Voluntary</b> and Involuntary Resettlement,International Migration,Health Monitoring&Evaluation,Anthropology,Human Migrations&Resettlements...|$|R
40|$|Objective: While living {{overseas}} in another culture, retirees need {{to adapt to}} a new environment but often this causes difficulties, particularly among those elderly who require healthcare services. This study examines factors affecting healthcare service utilisation among Japanese retirees in Malaysia. Design: We conducted 6 focus group discussions with Japanese retirees and interviewed 8 relevant medical services providers in-depth. Guided by the Andersen Healthcare Utilisation Model, we managed and analysed the data, using QSR NVivo 10 software and the directed content analysis method. Setting: We interviewed participants at Japan Clubs and their offices. Participants: 30 Japanese retirees who live in Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh, and 8 medical services providers. Results: We identified health beliefs, medical symptoms and health insurance as the 3 most important themes, respectively, representing the 3 dimensions within the Andersen Healthcare Utilisation Model. Additionally, language barriers, <b>voluntary</b> health <b>repatriation</b> to Japan and psychological support were unique themes that influence healthcare service utilisation among Japanese retirees. Conclusions: The healthcare service utilisation among Japanese retirees in Malaysia could be partially explained by the Andersen Healthcare Utilisation Model, together with some factors that were unique findings to this study. Healthcare service utilisation among Japanese retirees in Malaysia could be improved by alleviating negative health beliefs through awareness programmes for Japanese retirees about the healthcare systems and cultural aspects of medical care in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|Research on the Japanese {{living in}} Manchukuo in August 1945 has {{generally}} fostered {{the assumption that}} all Japanese there wanted to return to Japan as soon as possible. Yet, some made the conscious and voluntary decision to stay, {{at least for the}} short to medium term. Among those who chose to delay repatriation were a number of technicians employed by Mantetsu’s (South Manchurian Railroad Company) Ch¯uo Shikenjo. This paper looks at the political and personal realities faced by these technicians when making their decisions as whether to stay or leave in terms of the concepts of <b>voluntary</b> and involuntary <b>repatriation.</b> It shows that the circumstances faced, and consequently the decisions made by the technicians, differed over time. It argues that there were three main reasons behind any decision to stay: pragmatism, a sense of responsibility for Japan’s activities during the war and a sense of loyalty...|$|R

The contingent soldiers totaled 1869. They came from South Africa, Uruguay, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia. Guard units protected MONUC installations in Kinshasa, Kananga, Kisangani, Kalemie, Goma and Mbandaka. A Uruguayan riverine unit and a South African air medical evacuation team were also deployed.

5000|$|The International Support and Verification Commission (Comisión Internacional de Apoyo y Verificación, CIAV) {{was created}} as a joint {{approach}} to repatriating the Contras by the secretaries-general of the United Nations and the Organization of American States on August 25, 1989 {{in support of the}} Esquipulas II Peace Plan. Its mandate was to assist in the <b>voluntary</b> demobilization, <b>repatriation</b> or resettlement of the Nicaraguan Resistance (the Contras) in Nicaragua and third countries as well as assistance in the voluntary demobilization of all persons involved in armed actions in all countries of the region. In practice the UN involvement in CIAV was relatively short (from late 1989 through mid-1990), while the OAS participated in CIAV from the beginning and was deeply involved until 1993. In part this situation was due to the UN's emphasis on ONUCA (Observadores de las Naciones Unidas en Centro América - UN Observer Group in Central America), but it also reflected a geographic division of labor: the UN was assigned repatriation responsibilities in Honduras (where it was active only in late 1989 and early 1990), Costa Rica (where there were few Contras) and El Salvador (where there were practically none, and where the FMLN was having no part in any [...] "voluntary repatriation"). CIAV-OAS, on the other hand, was assigned geographic responsibilities for Nicaragua, which meant that they were responsible for every Contra and Contra family member who crossed the border into Nicaragua, and continued to be responsible for the support of most of them through 1993.|$|R
50|$|In April 1968, the Conservative Party {{politician}} Enoch Powell {{made his}} Rivers of Blood speech, a populist appeal against non-white immigration into Britain, which helped make immigration the foremost political {{topic in the}} country's media. Powell used language {{similar to that of}} the NF, although proposed policies that were moderate than those which it espoused; in contrast to the Front's calls for the compulsory removal of non-white migrants from the UK, Powell instead advocated a <b>voluntary</b> system of <b>repatriation.</b> Tyndall believed that Powell's speech would benefit the NF more than the Conservatives, and a growing number of individuals on the right-wing of the Conservative Party defected to the NF. The NF sought to capitalise on this by organising a training scheme in autumn 1968 in which branch officers and group organisers met at Tyndall's Nationalist Centre to learn skills in public speaking, propaganda, and branch organisation. Conversely, the NF also feared losing some of its members to hard right elements of the Conservatives, such as the Monday Club. The NF also supported the infiltration of Conservative branches, in the belief that this could help to undermine the party as a whole.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principle}} of <b>voluntary</b> <b>repatriation</b> was first codified. However, {{the situation in}} the country of origin to which the refugee would return, was not defined and thus a fundamental change in circumstances and human rights standards in that country is not needed.|$|E

50|$|The Norwegian {{government}} made {{progress in the}} identification and protection of trafficking victims during the reporting period. Through employment of proactive identification procedures, government officials reported identifying 292 possible trafficking victims, 80 of whom were forced labor victims, in 2009 - an increase from 256 victims, 71 of whom were forced labor victims, identified in 2008. In September 2009, the government conducted a three-day seminar on trafficking victim identification for NGOs and over 200 officials, including police, prosecutors, child welfare specialists, asylum reception center workers, and immigration authorities. The government provided direct assistance services to victims as well as funding for NGOs offering victim services. The government gave trafficking victims in Norway shelter in domestic violence centers, medical care, vocational training, stipends, Norwegian classes, and legal assistance. The government encouraged victims to participate in trafficking investigations and prosecutions; all victims who assisted in the conviction of their traffickers received $20,000 or more in restitution from the government for their trafficking experiences. Victims were permitted to stay in Norway without conditions during a six-month reflection period, a time for victims to receive immediate care and assistance while they consider whether to assist law enforcement - 73 applied for the reflection period, of which 50 were approved and 23 were denied. After the reflection period and deciding {{to cooperate with the}} police, 20 victims applied for longer term residency permits, and 10 received such permits. Trafficking victims reportedly were not penalized during the reporting period for unlawful acts committed {{as a direct result of}} being trafficked.
