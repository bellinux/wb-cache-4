5000|$|The vista into Franconia Notch {{from the}} south {{became known as the}} [...] "Artist's View." [...] Boston artist George Albert Frost expands our {{understanding}} of the White Mountains with an imaginative interpretation of Franconia Notch. Classically composed, with dark foliage framing {{the left side of the}} canvas and an expansive open space in the middle ground, giving way to atmospheric mountains in the distance, the notch is presented as an Arcadian idyll. Franconia Notch's appeal as a subject may reflect that life in the area was still slow-paced. Its <b>virgin</b> <b>landscape</b> was as yet hardly altered by railroads, hotels, and related improvements.|$|E
50|$|Aboriginal burning {{has been}} blamed {{for a variety of}} {{environmental}} changes, {{not the least of which}} is the extinction of the Australian megafauna, a diverse range of large animals which populated Pleistocene Australia. Kershaw (1986), among others, has argued that Aboriginal burning may well have modified the vegetation to the extent that the food resources of the megafauna were diminished, and as a consequence the largely herbivorous megafauna became extinct. Indeed, Kershaw is one of a small but growing group of palynologists who suggest that the arrival of Aborigines may have occurred more than 100,000 years ago, fire-stick in hand, eager to burn the <b>virgin</b> <b>landscape.</b> He suggests that their burning caused the sequences of vegetation changes which he detects through the late Pleistocene. The first to propose such an early arrival for Aborigines was Gurdip Singh from the Australian National University, who found evidence in his pollen cores from Lake George indicating that Aborigines began burning in the lake catchment around 120,000 years ago (Singh and Geisler, 1985).|$|E
50|$|The Old Norse (Icelandic) Saga {{literature}} has a mythological background. The {{characters of the}} Sagas originated as personifications of mythological concepts such as fertility, justice, time, death and the four elements. Einar argued {{that many of the}} potential symbols in the Sagas would become meaningful when matched with symbols occurring in Mediterranean and Celtic mythology. In Njáls saga in particular, Kári would become associated with time and air, Njáll with creation, fertility and water, Skarphéðinn with death, justice and fire, Höskuldr with grain and fertility, Gunnar with the Sun, Mörðr with the Earth and Bergthora with the Underworld. The mythology was that of the Norse fertility deities Freyr and Freyja who were based on the same principles as fertility deities in the Mediterranean region, primarily Osiris and Isis. The fertility mythology became part of a local ritual landscape in each main valley of Iceland, - the same geographical unit as that of the Sagas. The establishment of the ritual landscape was, according to Einar's thesis, {{a vital part of the}} 9th-10th century settlement process, a way of taming the <b>virgin</b> <b>landscape,</b> - creating cosmos out of chaos. With time this localized mythology merged to a varying degree with historical characters and their actions, to become the material for the Saga writers centuries later.|$|E

50|$|On 28 June 1972 the Catholic parishes of Bystrzyca Kłodzka were redeployed {{from the}} {{traditional}} Hradec Králové diocese (est. 1664; Ecclesiastical Province of Bohemia) into the Archdiocese of Wrocław. Between 1975 and 1998 Bystrzyca belonged to the Wałbrzych Voivodeship. It continued {{to be one of}} the principal mountain resorts of the area. Thanks to its historical landmarks as well as <b>virgin</b> <b>landscapes,</b> Bystrzyca Kłodzka remains one of the most popular centres of tourism and winter sports in Lower Silesia.|$|R

40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{primarily}} {{focuses on}} the colonial and imperial aspects of travel writing about Hawai‘i produced in the late 19 th century (1870 s and 1890 s). I argue that narrative themes found in these travel writings created {{the vision of the}} “Imagined Hawai‘i” for the consumption of white (primarily Euro-American) visitors and settlers. Travel writers invited visitors and settlers to a <b>virgin</b> <b>landscape</b> of agricultural opportunity, while constantly questioning the civility of Kānaka ‘Ōiwi and the viability of the Hawaiian monarchy. The culmination of these narrative themes suggested that Hawai‘i was the rightful inheritance of Euro-American settlers, and that both Hawai‘i and Kānaka ‘Ōiwi would be better off under American control. The historiography of travel accounts is dominated by European and Euro-American writers, therefore, I consider mo‘olelo huaka‘i (stories of travel) of Kānaka ‘Ōiwi as an important but missing space of discourse. By doing so, I show that Kānaka ‘Ōiwi engaged in travel much differently than their Euro-American and European counterparts...|$|E
30|$|Energy {{storage is}} {{currently}} a key focus of the energy debate. In Germany, in particular, the increasing share of power generation from intermittent renewables within the grid requires solutions for dealing with surpluses and shortfalls at various temporal scales. Covering these requirements with the traditional centralised power plants and imports and exports will become increasingly difficult as the share of intermittent generators rises across Europe. Pumped hydropower storage plants have traditionally {{played a role in}} providing balancing and ancillary services, and continue to do so. However, the construction of new plants often requires substantial interventions into <b>virgin</b> <b>landscape</b> and bio-habitats; this is often fiercely opposed by local citizens. Utility-scale lithium ion batteries have recently entered the energy scene. Albeit much smaller than most pumped hydropower plants, they can also provide the required balancing and ancillary services. They can be constructed on brownfield sites as and where needed, to support the move towards increasingly decentralised energy systems. Although they are seen by some as a more environmentally friendly option, they do cause impacts relating to the consumption of limited natural resources during the production stage. Addressing initially technological capacity of pumped hydropower storage and utility-scale battery to meet the required services, a simplified LCA will be performed to examine the environmental impacts throughout their life cycles. This includes two sensitivity analyses. Issues addressed in this paper include also methodological issues relating to comparability and those parameters that are pivotal to the LCA result.|$|E
40|$|In Hohe Tauern National Park one of {{the last}} post-glacial <b>virgin</b> <b>landscapes</b> in the central Eastern Alps was {{designated}} as a protected area. It is the largest national park in Central Europe and includes a significant section of the Austrian Central Alps shaped by glaciers and glacial periods. Its highly diverse flora and fauna is representative for all altitudinal zones of the Eastern Alps. Two thirds of the total area of 1 856 km² are designated as core zone and represent a natural landscape almost totally free of human intervention. Hohe Tauern National Park was founded in Carinthia in 1981, in Salzburg in 1984 and in Tyrol in 1992...|$|R
30|$|Recently, biophysically {{oriented}} studies more rigorously analyze climate or instrumental weather data, but cultural {{variables are}} usually not evaluated due to the often-made assumptions that people, past or present, only infrequently ignite fires (Johnson and Larsen 1991), or that many areas of Canada were <b>virgin</b> <b>landscapes</b> with low human occupation and few human effects on ecosystems (Bergeron et al. 2001). However, research from archaeology, history, anthropology, and traditional knowledge increasingly does not support these viewpoints (McMillan 1995, Pyne 2007). Cultural studies continue to fail to appreciate that, although humans may have favored burning during dormant seasons outside the main summer period of drought (Lewis 1980, Barrett and Arno 1999), their fires could persist on the landscape and eventually grow, similar in pattern to lightning-caused fire (Pyne 2007). In addition, there is increasing evidence that, through carelessness, warfare, or other means, human fires were ignited in locations and time periods in which widespread burning did occur (Boyd 1997, Pyne 2007). To simply summarize, both people and lightning cause fires, and under certain combinations of biophysical conditions, any fire can burn vast areas.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{big number}} of {{tourists}} that gather there, Prasonisi has lost its pristine beauty and there is great evidence of environmental damage. Visitors (mostly tourists) used to drive all around the beach with scooters and cars. As such, the sand has a solid feeling now and it is almost like concrete at {{certain parts of the}} beach although this is changing since the creation of a line that cannot be crossed by vehicles. The protected turtle known as Caretta caretta used to hide its eggs at the specific region but this rarely happens anymore {{due to the lack of}} environmental management of the territory. For this reason rigorous protective measures have to be undertaken to protect <b>virgin</b> nature <b>landscapes</b> and ancient archaeological sites in the area.|$|R
40|$|Tourism is {{considered}} {{as the main}} pillar of the Syrian national economy. It is expected to match the hard currency earnings generated by the diminishing oil exports. Syria is very rich in its spiritual offerings, however the tourism sector in still {{in its early stages}} of development. SyriaÃ�Â¢Ã¢Â�Â¬Ã¢Â�Â¢s investment in promoting tourism has been very limited relative to what Syria has to offer in tourism and branding is relatively a new term to the Syrian society that needs to be carefully exploited. As spiritual tourism is the fastest growing travel segment within the international market, Syria needs to seize this opportunity to brand itself as a spiritual destination. This research focuses on the significance of branding Syria as a spiritual destination. A list of key stakeholders in the tourism industry was interviewed to enhance the research with information that could not be obtained through the survey. Additionally, a survey was conducted that collected information regarding such issues as the image of Syria, its strengths and weaknesses, its competitors and the potential of spiritual tourism within Syria. The results from this research shows that Syria enjoys a valuable potential for tourism that is still unknown to some, misconceived by many, and currently appreciated by only a few. With strongly distorted images of Syria in Western countries due to political and regional considerations, it is in reality a safe destination adored by those who experience it. Syria has a very solid background to build on such as a wealth of monuments and sites, an abundance of religious temples, diversified <b>virgin</b> <b>landscapes,</b> and uniquely hospitable people. More importantly, it is a land that has carefully held on to its genuine authenticity, and where a true tolerance and brotherhood of religious diversity resides. With a carefully planned branding strategy, efficient marketing, and a serious attentiveness to weaknesses of the sector, Syria can definitely become a top spiritual destination visited by millions of avid spirituality seekers...|$|R
60|$|In {{the east}} a brighter, yellower light than the moon's began to show. It was the dawn, from which I {{gathered}} {{that it must}} be approaching the thirteenth hour. Pesaro could not be {{more than a couple of}} leagues farther, and, presently, when we had gained the summit of the slight hill we were ascending, we beheld in the distance a blurred mass looming on the edge of the glittering sea. A silver ribbon that uncoiled itself from the western hills disappeared behind it. That silvery streak was the River Foglia; that heap of buildings against the <b>landscape's</b> <b>virgin</b> white, the town of Pesaro.|$|R
40|$|With the Christmas card of 1968 in {{the form}} of poster, Superstudio inaugurates the {{production}} of photomontages which will bring fame to the group. It is however for the competition dedicated to the theme of Architecture and Freedom, launched in 1969 by the Tri-National Biennial of Graz, that the photomontage becomes for Superstudio the privileged graphical tool {{for the construction of a}} «discorso per immagini», a narrative in which project descriptions and traditional forms of architectural representation are replaced by images representing enigmatic volumes, seemingly devoid of function and open to multiple interpretations. Compared to similar and contemporary images produced, among others, by Archigram and Yona Friedman, the photomontages of Superstudio do not intend to give veracity to futuristic urban and territorial visions. The impenetrable volumes, designed beyond any program or structural logic, are an expression of absolute rationality and order which Superstudio has been searching since its founding to ward crisis and uncertainty of contemporary era. With a Christmas card from 1968 {{in the form}} of a poster, Superstudio inaugurated the production of photomontages which were to bring fame to the group. It is, however, for the competition dedicated to the theme of Architecture and Freedom, launched in 1969 by the Tri-National Biennial of Graz, that photomontage became the preferred graphical tool for the construction of a «discorso per immagini» for Superstudio, a narrative in which project descriptions and traditional forms of architectural representation are replaced by images representing enigmatic volumes, seemingly devoid of function and open to multiple interpretations. Compared to similar and contemporary images produced, amonst others, by Archigram and Yona Friedman, the photomontages of Superstudio do not intend to give veracity to futuristic urban and territorial visions. The impenetrable volumes, designed beyond any program or structural logic, are an expression of absolute rationality and order which Superstudio has been searching for its founding to ward off the crisis and to ward for uncertainty of contemporary era. Graphic techniques used by the group for their representations evolved over the years, and were adapted to achieve different effects, all still oriented to building a strong environmental realism, as far away as possible from comic and surprising effects. Through the «discorso per immagini» the theory of the group became eloquent: after having imagined a new form of land occupation designed as a monumental infinite linear structure that crosses cities and <b>virgin</b> <b>landscapes</b> – the Continuous Monument – Superstudio staged the dissolution of conventional boundaries of architecture, to move towards its «non-physical» re-foundation. After all, the «happy death of architecture should not frighten anybody: we have been preparing for long, increasingly distancing ourselves from the physicality of the construction», as revealed by one of the members of the group in 1971.

50|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} youthful Virgin Mary {{playing with the}} Christ child and handing him carnations. (The Italian title, La Madonna dei garofani actually means The Madonna of the Carnation.) These flowers, whose botanical name is dianthus (Greek for ‘flower of God’), are a premonition of Christ's Passion - according to Christian legend, the flower first appeared when the Virgin wept at the Crucifixion. The event {{takes place in a}} dimly-lit domestic setting influenced by Netherlandish art. The composition is based closely on the Benois Madonna by Leonardo da Vinci, although the colour scheme of blues and greens that link the <b>Virgin</b> with the <b>landscape</b> is Raphael's own. Through the arched window is a landscape with a ruined building, symbolising the collapse of the pagan world at the birth of Christ.|$|R
