Stouffer argued that the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>migration</b> had less to do with distance and population totals than with the opportunities in each location.

At the same time in the 1980s, the number of students and skilled emigrants from the People's Republic of China began to rise. Since the early 1990s, the UK has also witnessed a rising inflow of economic migrants from areas in China without any previous migratory link to the UK, or even elsewhere in Europe. A relatively small number of Chinese enter Britain legally as skilled migrants. However, most migrants arrive to work in unskilled jobs, originally exclusively in the Chinese ethnic sector (catering, Chinese stores, and wholesale firms), but increasingly also in employment outside this sector (for instance, in agriculture and construction). Migrants who enter Britain for unskilled employment are from both rural and urban backgrounds. Originally, Fujianese migrants were the dominant flow, but more recently increasing numbers of migrants from the Northeast of China have arrived in the UK as well. Migrants now tend to come from an increasing number of regions of origin in China. Almost all Chinese unskilled migrants enter the country illegally [...] and work in the nether economy, as the Morecambe Bay tragedy of February 2004 showed. Many claim asylum in-country, avoiding deportation after exhausting their appeals.|$|E

Romanian migration to Italy is a relatively recent phenomenon, but the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>migration</b> has been so great that now Italy hosts the largest numbers of Romanians abroad. This has created tensions which have not disappeared with Romania’s accession to the European Union. Although Romania is now legally ‘within ’ the European Union and will enjoy full rights to freedom of movement in all countries by 2014, an analysis of articles in Italy’s most widely read newspaper, La Repubblica, shows that Romanian migrant populations in Italy are still marginalized, creating a novel position for Romanians as both ‘insiders ’ and ‘outsiders ’ in Europe. The continued marginalization of post-accession Romanian immigrants may have implications for other highly mobile nationals seeking EU membership...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe radial and {{tangential}} neural migration pathways are {{two major}} neuronal migration streams in humans that are critical during corticogenesis. Corticogenesis is a complex process of neuronal proliferation that is followed by neuronal migration {{and the formation of}} axonal connections. Existing histological assessments of these two neuronal migration pathways have limitations inherent to microscopic studies and are confined to small anatomic regions of interest. Thus, little evidence is available about their three-dimensional fiber pathways and development throughout the entire brain. In this study, we imaged and analyzed radial and tangential migration pathways in the whole human brain using high-angular resolution diffusion MR imaging (HARDI) tractography. We imaged ten fixed, postmortem fetal (17 gestational weeks (GW), 18 GW, 19 GW, three 20 GW, three 21 GW and 22 GW) and eight in vivo newborn (two 30 GW, 34 GW, 35 GW and four 40 GW) brains with no neurological/pathological conditions. We statistically compared the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> the left and right radial and tangential migration pathways, and the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> the radial <b>migration</b> pathways <b>of</b> the anterior and posterior regions of the brain. In specimens 22 GW or younger, the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> radial <b>migration</b> pathways <b>of</b> the left hemisphere was significantly larger than that of the right hemisphere. The <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> posterior radial <b>migration</b> pathways was also larger when compared to the anterior pathways in specimens 22 GW or younger. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the radial <b>migration</b> pathways <b>of</b> brains older than 22 GW. Moreover, our study did not identify any significant differences in volumetric laterality in the tangential migration pathways. These results suggest that these two neuronal migration pathways develop and regress differently, and radial neuronal migration varies regionally based on hemispheric and anterior-posterior laterality, potentially explaining regional differences in the amount of excitatory neurons that migrate along the radial scaffold...|$|R

It {{suggests}} that {{when a group of}} host countries faces an upward supply of immigrants, tax competition does not indeed lead to a race to the bottom; competition may lead to higher taxes than coordination. We identify a fiscal externality (fiscal leakage) that causes tax rates (on both labor and capital), and the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>migration</b> (of both skill types), to be higher in the competitive regime than in the coordinated regime. If the population growth rate is positive the young are always in the majority.

Tax rate is positive if the (state variable) the capital stock is within a certain range, or zero, otherwise. Migration share of native born population is at the max if the state variable, the capital stock, is in the above mentioned range, or intermediate level, otherwise. In the case of private saving only regime, the migration share is intermediate level. Thus, migration shares in the social security-cum-private-savings regime are either the same, or is more liberal than in the private savings-only regime.

Because moving incurs costs, the expected advantage from it is, ceteris paribus, lower the older the person is. From this follows that among adult people who move primarily for economic reasons there is a tendency that the probability to move decreases by age. Such a description fits relatively well the stream of migrants who have arrived in Sweden from other high-income countries.|$|R

The relationship between international migration and economic growth and development within India is an emerging area of key research and policymaking within the nation. In particular, intense and increasing scrutiny and legislation is being applied to the enhanced social mobility apparently enabled by overseas migration, and to the remittances, investments and philanthropic donations transmitted “home” by Indian diasporic communities living abroad. Punjab and Kerala record {{some of the highest}} levels of overseas remittances in the world, let alone within India (Upadhya and Rutten 2012). In this context, the two states are often held up as exemplars of the overseas migration-regional development nexus, as models for other Indian states to follow (Zachariah et al 2001; Dusenbery and Tatla (ed) 2009).
