40|$|International audienceSince {{the start}} of 2010 {{there has been a}} {{flare-up}} of measles in France, following on the resurgence observed in 2008. The aim {{of this study was to}} present results of the epidemiological surveillance of measles in the French armed forces and to describe the increase in incidence. Measles was surveyed from 1992 to 2010. Criteria for report were those used for French national compulsory notification. The data, concerning active military personnel, were provided by the physicians in the armed forces using anonymous data collection forms. Between 1992 and July 2010, 689 cases of measles were notified. Since 2002, the mean incidence rate was 1 case per 100, 000. A significant increase has been observed for 2010 (13. 9 cases per 100, 000 in 2010 versus 1. 8 in 2009). The 28 cases reported in 2010 involved five clusters and three isolated cases. The mean age of affected subjects was 27  years. Only 30 % of cases had been vaccinated. The epidemic resurgence of measles observed in 2010 in the French armed forces follows the same pattern as that observed nationally and at European level, and can be seen as the likely consequence of inadequate <b>vaccination</b> <b>cover...</b>|$|E

The results of FC-AFPA were reported along the sera titration curve (1 : 128 – 1 : 524, 288), as percentage-of-positive-fluorescent-parasite (PPFP). The use of PPFP = 20 % as a cut-off edge to segregate negative and positive results at sera dilution 1 : 2048 revealed outstanding performance indexes that elect FC-AFPA-IgG and IgG 2 (both detected by polyclonal FITC-labeled second step reagent) applicable to the serological diagnosis of CVL, with 100 % of specificity for both IgG and IgG 2 and 97 and 93 % of sensitivity, respectively. Moreover, FC-AFPA-IgG, applied at sera dilution 1 : 2048, also appeared as a useful tool to discriminate L. chagasiinfected dogs from Leishmune® vaccinees, with 76 % of specificity. Outstanding likelihood indexes further support the performance of FC-AFPA-IgG for exclusion diagnosis of CVL in Leishmune® vaccinees. Analysis of FC-AFPA-IgG at sera dilution 1 : 8192 revealed the most outstanding indexes, demonstrating that besides the ability of PPFP 20 % to exclude the diagnosis of CVL, a PPFP values higher 80 %, mostly observed for infected dogs (INF) have a minimal change to come from a non-infected animal (NI) or Leishmune®...|$|R

Based on a questionnaire survey of 2682 people in 3 Beijing villages, we identified 283 children aged 0 – 15 years, from 246 households, who were eligible for a TBD. Multinomial logistic regression and statistical analyses were used to examine factors explaining TBD rates for LG, FGM and SGM children. Surprisingly, the TBD for LG Beijing children was not significantly different from migrant children.

40|$|Purpose: Although the measles-mumps-rubella <b>vaccination</b> <b>covers</b> most {{children}} against mumps in Korea, {{the development of}} mumps has been reported. However, the clinical manifestations of mumps orchitis in postpubertal vaccinated patients have never been investigated. Herein we report the clinical features of mumps orchitis in postpubertal vaccinated patients. Materials and Methods: This study included a total of 62 postpubertal males who devel-oped acute mumps orchitis from 2005 to 2010. The clinical manifestations such as the incubation period, febrile duration, and the mean duration of orchitis were retro-spectively investigated. The laboratory and sonographic findings were also reviewed and compared with the features of previously reported cases of unvaccinated post-pubertal mumps orchitis. Results: The {{mean age of the}} 62 patients was 17. 56 years (range, 15 to 29 years). All patients were serologically confirmed with acute mumps infection (positive im-munoglobulin [Ig] M and negative or positive IgG). The mean incubation period was 5. 39 days (range, 0 to 23 days), with a febrile duration of 1. 8 days (range, 0. 5 to 3 days), and a mean duration of orchitis of 4. 96 days (range, 0 to 17 days). Sonography revealed unilateral orchitis in 58 patients (93. 6 %) and bilateral orchitis in only 6 (6. 4 %). Conclusions: In our study, mumps orchitis in postpubertal vaccinated patients showed a relatively shorter febrile duration. In addition, less scrotal swelling and a lower in-cidence of bilaterality were found upon physical examination and ultrasonography. In the future, additional long-term follow-up is needed to determine the features of mumps orchitis in postpubertal vaccinated males, and an additional booster vaccination should be considered.

40|$|Abstract Retroviruses and LTR-retrotransposons are {{widespread}} in all living organisms and, {{in some instances}} such as for HIV, can be {{a serious threat to}} the human health. The retroviral nucleocapsid is the inner structure of the virus where several hundred nucleocapsid protein (NC) molecules coat the dimeric, genomic RNA. During the past twenty years, NC was found to play multiple roles in the viral life cycle (Fig. 1), notably during the copying of the genomic RNA into the proviral DNA by viral reverse transcriptase and integrase, and is therefore considered to be a prime target for anti-HIV therapy. The 6 th NC symposium was held in the beautiful city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on the 20 th and 21 st of September 2007.

40|$|Vaccination {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} preventive epidemiological measures. My thesis focuses on comparing vaccination strategies of the EU countries with those of the Czech Republic. When collecting information, I studied the present situation of all twenty seven EU countries, including WHO recommendations on immunization, and suggestions of both ECDC and vaccine producers. Available incidence data about particular preventable diseases and vaccination coverage are also mentioned. Furthermore, I also point out the effectiveness of vaccination, illustrating the fact on the occurrence of specific illnesses. This is especially apparent from Czech vaccination schedule for measles, which, owing to taken measures, occur only as an imported malady. Vaccination schedules vary considerably among the EU countries. The Czech Republic follows same schedules as most of the EU countries and has a well-developed vaccination system, established in Notice no. 537 / 2006 Sb. of vaccination against infectious diseases, as amended. The number of illnesses, vaccination against which is prescribed, almost doesn?t differ from other European countries, and neither does the sickness rate. Quite to the contrary; compared to certain EU states, vaccination coverage in the Czech Republic is steadily high and recommendations to update vaccination schedules arise only from new findings and freshly emerged epidemiological situation. New vaccines against infectious diseases are being introduced to the market each year and individual countries therefore often reappraise, adjust and update their vaccination schedules. It?s imperative that they take into consideration present epidemiological situation, both in the countries themselves and in surrounding states, and also the knowledge of trends in infectious diseases occurrence. It?s necessary to update vaccination schedules and to increase the number of vaccines ? be it within periodic <b>vaccinations</b> <b>covered</b> by state, or personally requested vaccinations compensated by insurance companies ?, thus improving vaccination coverage. 5 Attempts at unification are unrealistic. In view of various epidemiological situations, means of individual countries, and attitudes towards vaccination in certain liberal leaning states, it is not possible to dictate vaccine use or vaccination schedules to any country. Considering the scope of the issue, the aim of my thesis isn?t to suggest solutions, but rather to monitor the present circumstances in individual states, find sources of information, and compare the situation in the EU and Czech Republic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV, genus: Phlebovirus, family: Bunyaviridae), is an {{arbovirus}} {{which causes}} significant {{morbidity and mortality}} in animals and humans. RVFV was introduced {{for the first time}} in Egypt in 1977. In endemic areas, the insect vector control and vaccination is considering appropriate measures if applied properly and the used vaccine is completely safe and the <b>vaccination</b> programs <b>cover</b> all the susceptible animals. Egypt is importing livestock and camels from the African Horn & the Sudan for human consumption. The imported livestock and camels were usually not vaccinated against RVFV. But in rare occasions, the imported livestock were vaccinated but with unknown date of vaccination and the unvaccinated control contacts were unavailable for laboratory investigations. Also, large number of the imported livestock and camels are often escaped slaughtering for breeding which led to the spread of new strains of FMD and the introduction of RVFV from the enzootic African countries. This article provide general picture about the present situation of RVFV in Egypt to help in controlling this important disease. </p...|$|R
50|$|Antigenic escape is {{not only}} crucial for {{resistance}} of a host's natural immune response, {{but also for the}} resistance against vaccinations. The problem of antigenic escape has greatly deterred the process of creating new vaccines. Because vaccines generally cover a small ratio of strains of one virus, the recombination of antigenic DNA that lead to diverse pathogens allows these invaders to resist even newly developed vaccinations. Some antigens may even target pathways different than those the vaccine had originally intended to target. Recent research on many vaccines, including the malaria vaccine, has focused on how to anticipate this diversity and create <b>vaccinations</b> that can <b>cover</b> a broader spectrum of antigenic variation.|$|R

This paper describes a 6 month-old Belgian filly with transient colic signs attributed to a proliferative enteropathy, with L. intracellularis being the causative organism. Diagnosis of L. intracellularis proliferative enteropathy was made using serum ELISA, however other means of diagnosing L. intracellularis infections are discussed.

However, there is lack of documented evidence on the distribution of the disease across the various regions in the country. A retrospective epidemiological study was therefore conducted to investigate the pattern, distribution and prevalence of PPR disease in Ghana. The study also investigated the impact of vaccination on PPR burden using descriptive epidemiological analysis. Data on PPR outbreaks from 2005 to 2013 as well as vaccination records from the Veterinary Services Directorate in Ghana and from the International Office of Epizootics (OIE) were collated and used for this study. Results from the study indicated that PPR was endemic in Ghana, at a prevalence level of 6. 84 % per 1, 000 population.

A FISPGHAN working group on acute diarrhea aimed at estimating the current RVI coverage and identifying barriers to implementation worldwide. Methods A survey was distributed to national experts in infectious diseases and vaccinations, and health-care authorities (March 2015 -April 2016), collecting information on local recommendations, costs and perception of barriers to implementation. Findings RVI is recommended in 27 / 49 countries (55 %) participating in the survey. Although five countries have recommended RVI since 2006, a large number (16, 33 %) included RVI in a National Immunization Schedule between 2012 and 2014.

40|$|Dengue {{disease has}} emerged as a major public health issue across {{tropical}} and subtropical countries. Infections caused by dengue virus (DENV) can evolve to life-threatening forms, resulting in about 20, 000 deaths every year worldwide. Several animal models have been described concerning pre-clinical stages in vaccine development against dengue, each of them presenting limitations and advantages. Among these models, a traditional approach is the inoculation of a mouse-brain adapted DENV variant in immunocompetent animals by the intracerebral (i. c.) route. Despite the historical usage and relevance of this model for vaccine testing, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms by which the protection is developed upon <b>vaccination.</b> To <b>cover</b> this topic, a DNA vaccine based on the DENV non-structural protein 1 (pcTPANS 1) was considered and investigations were focused on the induced T cell-mediated immunity against i. c. -DENV infection. Immunophenotyping assays by flow cytometry revealed that immunization with pcTPANS 1 promotes a sustained T cell activation in spleen of i. c. -infected mice. Moreover, we found that the downregulation of CD 45 RB on T cells, as an indicator of cell activation, correlated with absence of morbidity upon virus challenge. Adoptive transfer procedures supported by CFSE-labeled cell tracking showed that NS 1 -specific T cells induced by vaccination, proliferate and migrate to peripheral organs of infected mice, such as the liver. Additionally, in late stages of infection (from the 7 th day onwards), vaccinated mice also presented reduced levels of circulating IFN-γ and IL- 12 p 70 in comparison to non-vaccinated animals. In conclusion, this work presented new aspects about the T cell-mediated immunity concerning DNA vaccination with pcTPANS 1 and the i. c. infection model. These insights can be explored in further studies of anti-dengue vaccine efficacy...|$|R

Immunization (RVI) has been available since 2006, and the Federation of International Societies of Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (FISPGHAN) identified RVI as a top priority for the control of diarrheal illness. A FISPGHAN working group on acute diarrhea aimed at estimating the current RVI coverage worldwide and identifying barriers to implementation at local level. METHODS: A survey was distributed to national experts in infectious diseases and health-care authorities (March 2015 -April 2016), collecting information on local recommendations, costs and perception of barriers for implementation. RESULTS: Forty-nine of the 79 contacted countries (62 % response rate) provided a complete analyzable data. RVI was recommended in 27 / 49 countries (55 %). Although five countries have recommended RVI since 2006, a large number (16, 33 %) included RVI in a National Immunization Schedule between 2012 and 2014. The costs of <b>vaccination</b> are <b>covered</b> by the government (39 %), by the GAVI Alliance (10 %) or public and private insurance (8 %) in some countries. However, in most cases, immunization is paid by families (43 %). Elevated cost of vaccine (49 %) is the main barrier for implementation of RVI. High costs of vaccination (rs=- 0. 39, p= 0. 02) and coverage of expenses by families (rs= 0. 5, p= 0. 002) significantly correlate with a lower immunization rate. Limited perception of RV illness severity by the families (47 %), public-health authorities (37 %) or physicians (24 %) and the timing of administration (16 %) are further major barriers to large- scale RVI programs. CONCLUSIONS: After 10 years since its introduction, the implementation of RVI is still unacceptably low and should remain a major target for global public health.

40|$|The Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) is an {{independent}} expert committee, consisting of 12 to 18 members, as stipulated in the Infection Against Protection Law [Infektionsschutzgesetz (IfSG) ]. The members are appointed by the German Federal Ministry of Health {{in consultation with the}} federal state health authorities for a period of 3 years. In accordance with the IfSG the committee provides recommendations on vaccinations and other measures for the specific prophylaxis of communicable diseases. When developing a new vaccination recommendation the STIKO conducts a medical and epidemiological risk-benefit assessment based on the best available evidence. This means beyond individual aspects the benefit of the vaccination at population level (e. g. expected epidemiological effects of the vaccination) is taken into account. STIKO recommendations serve the federal health authorities as a basis for their public recommendations. Following Volume V of the Social Insurance Code ([Sozialgesetzbuch Fünftes Buch (SGB V) ] the STIKO recommendations are also the basis for the decision of the Joint National committee [Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss (G-BA) ] whether the costs of the <b>vaccination</b> are <b>covered</b> by the statutory health insurance. Vaccinations are among the most effective and significant medical measures. Modern vaccines are well tolerated, and irreversible serious adverse events (SAE) are observed only in very rare cases. The immediate goal of vaccination is to protect an individual from a specific disease. Given a high level of acceptance within the population high vaccination coverage rates can be attained. Consequently, it is possible to achieve regional elimination of single pathogens, and eventually to eradicate them worldwide. Elimination of measles, rubella, and poliomyelitis are declared and achievable goals of national and international health policy. In Germany vaccinations and other means of specific prophylaxis are “publicly recommended” by the health authorities of the federal states {{on the basis of the}} STIKO recommendations according to § 20 (3) IfSG].

Nationwide representative data on vaccination coverage against varicella of children under two years of age are not available. We aimed to determine varicella vaccination coverage in statutory health insured children under two years of age in twelve German Federal States using data from associations of statutory health insurance physicians (ASHIPs), in order to investigate {{the acceptance of the}} recommended routine varicella vaccination programme. Methods: We analysed data on varicella vaccination from 13 of 17 ASHIPs of the years 2004 to 2007. The study population consisted of all statutory health insured children under two years of age born in 2004 (cohort 2004) or 2005 (cohort 2005) in one of the studied regions.

40|$|The {{social and}} {{demographic}} characteristics of ~ 65, 000 Tibetan refugees in India were determined from data collected 1994 - 1996. Approximately 55, 000 refugees were living in 37 settlements widely distributed around India. The remaining 10, 000 refugees were monks living in monasteries associated {{with some of the}} settlements, mostly in the south of India. In the settlements, a community-based surveillance system was established and data were collected by trained community health workers in house to house visits. In the monasteries, data were collected by the community health workers in monthly interviews with a designated liaison monk at each monastery. These data indicated little immigration of new civilian refugees in the past 10 years into the settlements but a steady influx of new monks into the monasteries. The age distribution in the settlements showed a prominent mode in the 15 - 25 year age range, a declining birth rate, and an increasing proportion of elderly. In general, refugees born in India were educated through secondary school, while refugees born in Tibet were often illiterate. The principle occupations were education involving 27 % (including students), farming, 16 %, and sweater selling, 6. 5 %; another 6. 5 % were too young or too old for employment, and only 2. 4 % were unemployed. The overall crude birth rate was determined to be relatively low at 16. 8 / 1000, although this may underestimate the true figure. Infant mortality varied from 20 to 35 / 1000 live births in the different regions. Child <b>vaccination</b> programs <b>cover</b> less than 50 % of the population. The burden of illness in this society was mainly characterized by diarrhoea, skin infections, respiratory infections, fevers, and, among the elderly, joint pains and cardiovascular problems. Although calculated death rates were unrealistically low, due to under-reporting, causes of death, derived from "verbal autopsies", were mainly cancer, tuberculosis, accidents, cirrhosis and heart disease in order of decreasing frequency. Overall, the sociodemographic and health characteristics of this population appear to be in transition from those typical of the least developed countries to those typical of middle income and more affluent societies.

40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} the second most common cancer among women worldwide. Every year {{approximately}} 500. 000 new cases are diagnosed and 270. 000 women die from this malignancy. The tumor is caused by a persistent infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV). The recently developed vaccination prevents infections with high-risk HPV 16 and HPV 18, two of the most frequent virus types. Nevertheless, there are several unsolved problems: The <b>vaccination</b> does not <b>cover</b> all high risk HPV types, there is no effective treatment for infected women available and the vaccine is still not sufficiently available in the most severely affected regions, in developing countries. Therefore, an antiviral therapy would be highly desirable. During papillomaviral infections the viral genomes are tethered to mitotic chromosomes to pass the infection on to the next generation of cells during replication. For this maintenance mechanism the viral E 2 protein binds to the cellular bromodomain protein Brd 4. Our previous work has also established that the Brd 4 -E 2 interaction is involved in viral transcriptional regulation mechanisms, which are involved in cervical cancer pathogenesis. The goal of the presented work is to analyze and further characterize the protein-protein interaction networks underlying these genome maintenance mechanisms and thereby to gain additional insights into the mitotic complexes involved. Furthermore, we are working on the development of target-specific anti - HPV drugs and will discuss the impact for the prevention of cervical cancer...|$|R
40|$|This report {{supplements}} the 2001 {{statement by}} the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (CDC. Vaccinia [smallpox] vaccine: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP], 2001. MMWR 2001; 50 [No. RR- 10]: 1 - 25). This supplemental report provides recommendations for using smallpox vaccine in the pre-event vaccination program in the United States. To facilitate preparedness and response, smallpox vaccination is recommended for persons designated by public health authorities to conduct investigation and follow-up of initial smallpox cases that might necessitate direct patient contact. ACIP recommends that each state and territory establish and maintain > or = 1 smallpox response team. ACIP and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) recommend that each acute-care hospital identify health-care workers who can be vaccinated and trained to provide direct medical care for the first smallpox patients requiring hospital admission and to evaluate and manage patients who are suspected as having smallpox. When feasible, the first-stage vaccination program should include previously vaccinated health-care personnel to decrease the potential for adverse events. Additionally persons administering smallpox vaccine in this pre-event vaccination program should be vaccinated. Smallpox vaccine is administered by using the multiple-puncture technique with a bifurcated needle, packaged with the vaccine and diluent. According to the product labeling, 2 - 3 punctures are recommended for primary vaccination and 15 punctures for revaccination. A trace of blood should appear at the vaccination site after 15 - 20 seconds; if no trace of blood is visible, an additional 3 insertions should be made by using the same bifurcated needle without reinserting the needle into the vaccine vial. If no evidence of vaccine take is apparent after 7 days, the person can be vaccinated again. Optimal infection-control practices and appropriate site care should prevent transmission of vaccinia virus from vaccinated health-care workers to patients. Health-care personnel providing direct patient care should keep their <b>vaccination</b> sites <b>covered</b> with gauze in combination with a semipermeable membrane dressing to absorb exudates {{and to provide a}} barrier for containment of vaccinia virus to minimize the risk of transmission; the dressing should also be covered by a layer of clothing. Dressings used to cover the site should be changed frequently to prevent accumulation of exudates and consequent maceration. The most critical measure in preventing contact transmission is consistent hand hygiene. Hospitals should designate staff to assess dressings for all vaccinated health-care workers. When feasible, staff responsible for dressing changes for smallpox health-care teams should be vaccinated, all persons handling dressings should observe contact precautions. Administrative leave is not required routinely for newly vaccinated health-care personnel unless they are physically unable to work as a result of systemic signs and symptoms of illness; have extensive skin lesions that cannot be adequately covered or if they are unable to adhere to the recommended infection-control precautions. Persons outside the patient-care setting can keep their <b>vaccination</b> sites <b>covered</b> with a porous dressing hand hygiene remains key to preventing inadvertent inoculation. FDA has recommended that recipients of smallpox vaccine be deferred from donating blood for 21 days or until the scab has separated. Contacts of vaccinees, who have inadvertently contracted vaccinia, also should be deferred from donating blood for 14 days after complete resolution of their complication. In the pre-event vaccination program, smallpox vaccination is contraindicated for persons with a history or presence of eczema or atopic dermatitis; who have other acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions; who have conditions associated with immunosuppression; are aged 4 weeks apart. Health-care workers scheduled to receive an annual purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test for tuberculosis screening should not receive the skin test until > 1 month after smallpox vaccination. Persons with progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, and severe generalized vaccinia or inadvertent inoculation might benefit from therapy with VIG or cidofovir, although the latter has not been approved by FDA for this indication. Suspected cases of these illnesses or other severe adverse events after smallpox vaccination should be reported immediately to state health departments. VIG and cidofovir are available from CDC under Investigational New Drug protocols. Clinically severe adverse events after smallpox vaccination should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Reports can be made online at [URL] or by postage-paid form, which is available by calling 800 - 822 - 7967 (toll-free). ACIP will review these recommendations periodically as new information becomes available related to smallpox disease, smallpox vaccines, the risk of smallpox attack, smallpox vaccine adverse events, and the experience gained as recent recommendations are implemented. Revised recommendations will be developed as needed. prepared by Melinda Wharton, Raymond A. Strikas, Rafael Harpaz, Lisa D. Rotz, Benjamin Schwartz, Christine G. Casey, Michele L.

40|$|Abstract Background Since July 2004, routine {{varicella}} vaccination {{is recommended}} by the German Standing Vaccination Committee in Germany. Health Insurance Funds started to <b>cover</b> <b>vaccination</b> costs at different time points between 2004 and 2006 in the Federal States. Nationwide representative data on vaccination coverage against varicella of children under two years of age are not available. We aimed to determine varicella vaccination coverage in statutory health insured children under two years of age in twelve German Federal States using data from associations of statutory health insurance physicians (ASHIPs), in order to investigate {{the acceptance of the}} recommended routine varicella vaccination programme. Methods We analysed data on varicella vaccination from 13 of 17 ASHIPs of the years 2004 to 2007. The study population consisted of all statutory health insured children under two years of age born in 2004 (cohort 2004) or 2005 (cohort 2005) in one of the studied regions. Vaccination coverage was determined by the number of children vaccinated under 2 years of age within the study population. Results Varicella vaccination coverage of children under two years of age with either one dose of the monovalent varicella vaccine or two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine increased from 34 % (cohort 2004) to 51 % (cohort 2005) in the studied regions (p Conclusions Our study shows increasing varicella vaccination coverage of young children, indicating a growing acceptance of the routine varicella vaccination programme by the parents and physicians. We recommend further monitoring of vaccination coverage using data from ASHIPs to investigate acceptance of the routine vaccination programmes over time. </p...|$|R
40|$|Influenza is {{an acute}} {{respiratory}} illness caused by infection with an influenza virus. The illness affects the upper and/or lower respiratory tracts, is usually self limiting with recovery in two to seven days {{but it can be}} severe. Individuals infected with the virus may develop sudden fever, chills, headache, myalgia, sore throat and a non-productive cough. Serious respiratory complications can develop, including pneumonia, to which older people and all those with certain chronic medical conditions are particularly susceptible. Influenza outbreaks occur virtually every year, almost exclusively in the winter months, although the extent and severity of such outbreaks vary widely. Influenza is highly contagious, spreading rapidly, especially in long stay residential facilities. Influenza vaccination has been shown to resuk in significant reductions in hospitalisation for all acute and chronic respiratory conditions. It is also associated with a reduction in hospital admissions due to congestive heart failure. A systematic review of research shows that vaccinating older people against influenza is an effective, safe and cost effective way of reducing influenza related deaths and illness. There is now a significant body of evidence which shows that giving influenza vaccine to all older people, irrespective of whether they have any underlying disease, is cost effective. Extending the influenza <b>vaccination</b> programme to <b>cover</b> all older people should result in significant health gain and social gain for all concerned.. There is also a growing body of evidence of the benefits, to both staff and patients, of key healthcare staff in hospital and community services getting the influenza vaccination...|$|R
40|$|Canine rabies, {{and thus}} human {{exposure}} to rabies, {{can be controlled}} through mass vaccination of the animal reservoir if dog owners are willing to cooperate. Inaccessible, ownerless dogs, however, reduce the vaccination coverage achieved in parenteral campaigns. This study aimed to estimate the vaccination coverage in dogs in three study zones of N'Djaména, Chad, after a pilot free parenteral mass vaccination campaign against rabies. We used a capture-mark-recapture approach for population estimates, with a Bayesian, Markov chain, Monte Carlo method to estimate {{the total number of}} owned dogs, and the ratio of ownerless to owned dogs to calculate vaccination coverage. When we took into account ownerless dogs, the vaccination coverage in the dog populations was 87 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 84 - 89 %) in study zone I, 71 % (95 % CI, 64 - 76 %) in zone II, and 64 % (95 % CI, 58 - 71 %) in zone III. The proportions of ownerless dogs to owned dogs were 1. 1 % (95 % CI, 0 - 3. 1 %), 7. 6 % (95 % CI, 0. 7 - 16. 5 %), and 10. 6 % (95 % CI, 1. 6 - 19. 1 %) in the three study zones, respectively. Vaccination coverage in the three populations of owned dogs was 88 % (95 % CI, 84 - 92 %) in zone I, 76 % (95 % CI, 71 - 81 %) in zone II, and 70 % (95 % CI, 66 - 76 %) in zone III. Participation of dog owners in the free campaign was high, and the number of inaccessible ownerless dogs was low. High levels of vaccination coverage could be achieved with parenteral mass vaccination. Regular parenteral <b>vaccination</b> campaigns to <b>cover</b> all of N'Djaména should be considered as an ethical way of preventing human rabies when post-exposure treatment is of limited availability and high in cost...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in heterosexual patients attending two genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in the West Midlands and to examine whether heterosexual activity is {{a risk factor for}} acquiring HBV infection with the view to extend HBV <b>vaccination</b> policies to <b>cover</b> this group. DESIGN: HBV markers were determined in the GUM study group and compared with that of the control groups. Responses to a questionnaire were used to examine sexual behaviour patterns that may be related to heterosexual acquisition of HBV infection. SETTING: The West Midlands, UK April 1992 -January 1993. SUBJECTS: 788 male patients and 688 female patients attending GUM clinics were compared with 498 male blood donors and 563 females attending antenatal clinics for the seroprevalence of HBV markers. Potential risk factors related to heterosexual activity were assessed in 1436 patients in the study group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of HBV markers in the GUM study group and the controls. The possible use of the risk factors examined as predictors for acquiring HBV infection. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) in GUM patients was 1. 9 % and 0. 5 % in the control group. In the study groups the prevalence of anti-HBc from Birmingham was 3. 2 % while that from Coventry was 0. 8 %. The low seroprevalence of HBV prevented a multiple logistic analysis. A limited regression analysis showed that being non-white (p < 0. 001) and duration of sexual activity (p = 0. 013) were risk factors for HBV infection. However, these two factors were poor predictors of the risk to exposure to HBV infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HBV infection in heterosexual patients in the West Midlands is very low and does not provide any indications to broaden HBV vaccination into heterosexual patients attending GUM clinics. Risk factors were poor predictors of the exposure to HBV infection. This is partially due to the low prevalence of HBV infection in this study. Further studies are required before definitive conclusions are made regarding the potential predictive value of risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is {{a leading}} cause of {{childhood}} morbidity and mortality around the world. The available polysaccharide-based vaccines are limited by either low efficacy in young children or narrow serotype coverage. Recent research has focused on developing protein vaccines. Pneumococcal pilus- 1 proteins {{play an important role in}} pneumococcal adherence to host respiratory epithelium and subsequent bacterial colonization or invasion; and may therefore be an effective vaccine candidate. This PhD project investigated natural immunity in humans to pneumococcal pilus- 1 proteins and its association with nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus. Nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus was analysed by bacteriological culture of nasal swabs on blood agar. Pneumococci were identified based on their colony morphology and optochin sensitivity; and further confirmed by PCR detection of pneumolysin gene in the isolates. Pneumococcal carriage was found to be common in young children, which gradually decreased with advancing age. PCR detection of pilus islet 1 (PI- 1) gene revealed that percentage of pilus- 1 positivity was low among these carriage isolates. This low prevalence may be associated with the recent introduction of pneumococcal conjugate <b>vaccination,</b> which <b>covers</b> the common piliated serotypes. ELISA based measurement of serum and salivary antibodies to pilus- 1 proteins detected significant antibody levels to both RrgA and RrgB, presumably developed as a part of natural immune response in children and adults. An age-dependent increase in serum antibody levels to both RrgA and RrgB was also observed, and anti-RrgA appeared to develop earlier in childhood than anti-RrgB. Moreover, higher levels of antibody, especially anti-RrgA were found in children who were culture-negative than in those who were culture-positive for pneumococcus. It suggests that these naturally developed antibodies may contribute to the protection against pneumococcal carriage in humans. Using an in vitro model of human NALT, the study revealed that adenotonsillar tissues are important induction sites for immune response to these antigens, by priming B cell memory. The induction of antibody secreting cells in NALT was enumerated by ELISpot assay; and the antibody production was measured by antigen-specific ELISA. In vitro stimulation with a wild type (TIGR 4) pneumococcal culture supernatant (containing both RrgA and RrgB proteins) induced a significant memory B cell and antibody response in adenotonsillar cells. Current carriage in vivo enhanced the memory B cell response and antibody production. Flowcytometric analysis of CFSE labelled adenotonsillar MNC suggested that pneumococcal pilus- 1 proteins RrgA and RrgB were capable of stimulating CD 4 + T cell proliferative response in human NALT. Stimulation with pneumococcal CCS induced Th 17 related cytokines production in both human adenotonsillar MNC and PBMC culture supernatant. Importantly, this in vitro production of Th 17 cytokines after stimulation with TIGR 4 wt CCS was significantly higher than that of CCS derived from its isogenic RrgA-/- and RrgB-/- mutants, indicating a contribution from both of these proteins. The ability of these pilus- 1 proteins to stimulate CD 4 + T cell proliferation and Th 17 response may contribute to the natural immunity to pneumococcus in humans. This study has revealed that both of these pilus- 1 proteins, RrgA and RrgB are immunogenic and are capable of priming for memory B and T cell response in human NALT. These findings aid to our understanding on the naturally developed immune response to pilus- 1 proteins, and may inform future vaccination strategy with intranasal immunisation containing protein antigens against pneumococcal infection...|$|R
