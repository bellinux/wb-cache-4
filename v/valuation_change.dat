A firm's change in inventory is informative if its percentage change in cost of goods sold is positively and significantly associated with its lag one percentage of production added to inventory (a measure of change in inventory). Sample firms are divided into two groups: firms with informative change in inventory, and other firms. Analyses then are performed to examine the association between stock price and earnings. Results consistently show that the association is higher for firms with informative change in inventory. Thus, knowledge on the informativeness of change in inventory is useful for firm valuation.

We confirm that the United States enjoys an ‘exorbitant privilege’ on flow income from foreign assets, which is primarily related to foreign direct investment (FDI). The geographical allocation of FDI assets explains {{only a small part}} of the US yield advantage. The key reason is that US, and also British and Japanese, investors were able to outperform the average yield earned in the countries of their FDI destinations, while most continental European investors earn the average. Further research should explore if large FDI investment in ‘tax optimisation’ countries, the improper consideration of intellectual property, or financial sophistication contributed to these high yields. For several countries, <b>valuation</b> <b>changes</b> were larger than current account and financial transactions, highlighting the importance of such changes. In the European Union, the generally negative international investment positions of a number of central and southern European countries were greatly supported by EU transfers. <b>Valuation</b> <b>changes</b> on net foreign assets do not look random and played an important role in the sustainability of international investment positions before and after the 2008 crisis. Countries with negative net international investment positions tend to have positive revaluation gains, while countries with large net foreign assets tend to suffer from revaluation losses. Large net foreign asset holders including China, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Japan and Germany, suffered significant losses in 2007 - 16, helping the sustainability of the negative positions of other countries.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple {{approach to the}} pricing of options on spread and some {{arguments in favor of}} modelling the spread using its two components instead of the spread itself. We show that, even in a simple Gaussian setting, the spread should not be modelled directly, and that convergence speeds of the two components are crucial parameters. There exist conditions, discussed in this paper, under which the analysis can be reduced to a two-factor model based on the dynamics of the spread itself. Hence, we propose a three-factor model based on the dynamics of the riskless rate and of the two components of the spread. This is done by following the Longstaff (1990) methodology and with the assumption that both the riskless rate and the spread or its two components follow correlated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Greeks analysis shows that spread options have some very specific features compared to the Black-Scholes-Merton (1973) option model. Moreover, the results show that the mispricing is important and not systematic when one chooses a spread option model based on the dynamics of the spread instead of using the dynamics of its two components. We finally show how the spread option model allows us to price other yield derivatives, like options to exchange a yield for another or the options on the maximum or the minimum of two yields.

40|$|Pro forma {{financial}} performance evaluation of agricultural producers {{is an important}} issue for lenders, internal management and policy makers. Lenders strive to improve their credit risk management. Internal management is interested in understanding the financial impacts of alternative strategic decisions. And policy makers often assess the magnitude and distributional effects of alternative policies on the future {{financial performance}} of farm business. Data limitations are a major impediment in assessing farm financial performance. Most traditional farm operations are private firms and thus, public traded equity information which can be converted into market <b>valuation</b> <b>change</b> is not available. Moreover, historical loan performance data on agricultural loans such as past due and defaults are not readily available. These aspects present substantial methodological issues when establishing an independent variable to use in assessing future performance. Credit risk modeling and financial performance assessment have been remotivated and gained unprecedented academic attention in recent years(Barry 2001, Kachova and Barry 2005, Saunders and Allen 2002). However, some of the new approaches and models have limitations when applied to agricultural producers. Adapting the models and approaches to utilize the available information of farm business needs careful attention and validation. In this paper, Altman's Z' score model and Z" score model are applied to farm accounting data for the detection of farm operating and financial difficulties. i. e., farms with high credit risk. The well-developed and widely used Altman models have not been applied to agricultural data. The results are compared to an experienced based credit risk migration model (Splett, et al) and a logistic, lender-based model (Featherstone, Roessler, and Barry 2006). The experience based model is a primary model used in the current farm credit analysis. The logistic model is claimed for better statistical prediction accuracy and no binding assumption on multivariate normality (Altman 1968). Results from each of these models are compared across a common database of Midwestern grain farms. Farms are grouped into different categories with different levels of financial. Instead of focusing on farm loan defaults, earned net worth growth rate (ENWGR) and term debt coverage ratio (TDCR) are used as two major indicators for financial stress situation of farm credit quality.

40|$|The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{issued a}} Roadmap in 2008 {{regarding}} {{a change in}} the American accounting standards system. The Roadmap proposes a potential adoption from the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The objective with the adoption is to enhance a one-set of accounting standards used in the world in order to increase comparability between public limited companies in different jurisdictions. With the adoption, the valuation of inventories for American companies will change, since the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method is allowed under US GAAP, but not under IFRS. A study from 2008 shows that approximately 36 per cent of American public limited companies is using LIFO. They would therefore be forced to use another inventory valuation method, such as First-In, First-Out (FIFO). The LIFO method is normally used by companies exposed to inflation and increases the cost of goods sold (COGS) and consequently lowers the net income and income tax provision. With the potential adoption, these companies would face large increases of income tax provisions, which would affect them severely. This thesis is a review study with the objective to connect recent research with the SEC Roadmap in order to answer the following research questions: How will US companies that are using LIFO be affected by the inventory <b>valuation</b> <b>change</b> to FIFO, from an economic and accounting-based approach? What are the positive and negative aspects with a removal of LIFO regarding the IFRS adoption? There is a clear benefit for the US companies using LIFO regarding the smaller income tax provisions. Opponents consider that LIFO will disappear with the US adoption to IFRS. At the same time, recent research considers or doubts that the LIFO method will not face its death with the adoption from US GAAP to IFRS. As a conclusion, the negative effect of removing LIFO as a consequence of this adoption, is the implementation time period, which is too optimistic. Even though, the credibility with a shift from LIFO to FIFO will grow stronger and create a more comparable business world...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four self-contained studies on mergers and acquisitions in the international insurance industry. It focuses on the wealth effects of merging parties and their competitors, change of risks and risk management, determinants of wealth effects, determinants of the risk changes, and managers and investors learning by observing information spilled over from previous merger activities. The first study investigates the risk and <b>valuation</b> <b>change</b> experienced by European banks when they acquire insurance companies. The empirical results indicate that total risk and systematic risk generally remain the same while positive wealth effects are documented. This finding supports the argument that regulators {{do not need to}} be overly concerned about bank and insurer mergers possibly introducing volatilities to the financial services industry. The second study extends insurance M&A literature by revealing that quality governance and favourable macro-economic conditions in the target firm’s country determine risk and wealth effects, as well as transaction and firm-specific factors. The third study extends the previous chapter by examining competitors’ wealth effects in the global banking and insurance industry arising from mergers and acquisitions. The empirical results indicate that rival firms are reassessed as next potential targets, this being a result of acquisition events. Investors revalue competitors according to an acquirer’s over-bidding premium and the rival firm’s characteristics. The fourth study provides evidence that insurance firm mergers result in improvements in long-term financial performance, and reduction in risk, and those improvements are significantly related to previous M&A activities. Past research proves that bank managers and investors have learnt from previous merger activities in regards to wealth creation (DeLong and DeYoung 2007). This insurance merger study contributes to literature by extending the research to include the risk management perspective. The empirical results support the argument that risk management is a main consideration in Mergers and Acquisitions, as well as wealth creation. In a high uncertainty environment, insurance mergers are new phenomenon for managers and investors. Managers learned from previous M&As in order to create wealth and reduce risk, while investors wrongly evaluated those mergers. Our findings are consistent with semi-strong market efficiency...|$|E
