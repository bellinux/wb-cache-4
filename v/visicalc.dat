5|$|<b>VisiCalc</b> – was {{the first}} {{spreadsheet}} computer program for personal computers, originally released for the Apple II by VisiCorp. MIT alum Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston rented time sharing at night on an MIT mainframe computer (that cost $1/hr for use).|$|E
25|$|WordStar, one of {{the first}} widely used word processors, and dBASE, an early and popular {{database}} program for small computers, were originally written for CP/M. Two early outliners, KAMAS (Knowledge and Mind Amplification System) and its cut-down successor Out-Think (without programming facilities and retooled for 8080/V20 compatibility) were also written for CP/M, though later rewritten for MS-DOS. Turbo Pascal, the ancestor of Borland Delphi, and Multiplan, the ancestor of Microsoft Excel, also debuted on CP/M before MS-DOS versions became available. <b>Visicalc,</b> the first-ever spreadsheet program, was made available for CP/M. Another company, Sorcim, created its Supercalc spreadsheet for CP/M, which would go on to become the market leader and de facto standard on CP/M. Supercalc would go on to be a competitor in the spreadsheet market in the MS-DOS world. AutoCAD, a CAD application from Autodesk debuted on CP/M. A host of compilers and interpreters for popular programming languages of the time (such as BASIC, Borland's Turbo Pascal and FORTRAN) were available, among them several of the earliest Microsoft products.|$|E
2500|$|The Apple II, also {{invented by}} Wozniak, was {{introduced}} on April 16, 1977, {{at the first}} West Coast Computer Faire. It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded {{by the introduction of}} a 5¼inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II. The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first [...] "killer app" [...] of the business world: <b>VisiCalc,</b> a spreadsheet program. <b>VisiCalc</b> created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office. Before <b>VisiCalc,</b> Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electronic}} spreadsheet organizes data information into computerized software defined columns and rows. Primarily used {{for business and}} accounting purposes, the data can then be [...] "added up" [...] by a formula to give a total or sum. The spreadsheet program summarizes information from many paper sources {{in one place and}} presents the information in a format to help a decision maker see the financial [...] "big picture" [...] of a company. Spreadsheets in paper format have been used by accountants for hundreds of years. However, computerized, {{electronic spreadsheet}}s are of much more recent origin. In 1961, Richard Mattessich, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, pioneered the concept of electronic spreadsheets for use in business accounting. In the autumn of 1978, Harvard Business School student, Dan Bricklin, {{came up with the idea}} for an interactive visible calculator. Bricklin and Bob Frankston then co-invented the software program <b>VisiCalc,</b> the world's first [...] "killer application" [...] and electronic spreadsheet for use on personal computers.|$|E
2500|$|Other early word-processing {{software}} required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys labelled [...] "copy" [...] or [...] "bold". (In fact, many early PCs lacked cursor keys; WordStar famously used the E-S-D-X-centered [...] "diamond" [...] for cursor navigation, and modern vi-like editors encourage use of hjkl for navigation.) However, the price differences between dedicated word processors and general-purpose PCs, {{and the value}} added to the latter by software such as <b>VisiCalc,</b> were so compelling that personal computers and word processing software soon became serious competition for the dedicated machines. Word processing became the most popular use for personal computers, and unlike the spreadsheet (dominated by Lotus 1-2-3) and database (dBase) markets, WordPerfect, XyWrite, Microsoft Word, , {{and dozens of other}} word processing software brands competed in the 1980s; PC Magazine reviewed 57 different programs in one January 1986 issue. Development of higher-resolution monitors allowed them to provide limited WYSIWYG—What You See Is What You Get, to the extent that typographical features like bold and italics, indentation, justification and margins were approximated on screen.|$|E
2500|$|The University of Manchester {{built the}} world's first {{programmable}} computer, the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, on 21 June 1948; the Williams–Kilburn tube {{on the machine}} was the world's first computer memory, {{and the beginning of}} random-access memory (RAM); the baby computer was made from 550 Mullard valves. [...] The first commercially available computer, the Ferranti Mark 1, was made in Manchester and sold in February 1951 to the University of Manchester. The world's first transitorised computer was the Manchester Transistor Computer in November 1953. Atlas was another important computer developed at the University of Manchester, largely developed by Tom Kilburn; at the time in 1962 it was most powerful computer in the world. The government had dropped its financial support of this computer, and was only funded by Ferranti—the total development cost was around £1m. Britain was leading the world at this time in computing, with the only main competitor being IBM; after the mid-1950s America took over the industry. The spreadsheet was invented in 1974, known as the Works Record System, and used an ADABAS database on a IBM 3270 at ICI in Northwich; it was developed by Dr Robert Mais and it was around four years before (the more well-known) <b>VisiCalc</b> in 1978. The University of Manchester has collected 25 Nobel prizes, though recent years have been less notable.|$|E
50|$|By 1982 VisiCalc's price {{had risen}} from $100 to $250. Several {{competitors}} appeared in the market, notably SuperCalc and Multiplan, each of which added more features and corrected deficiencies in <b>VisiCalc,</b> but could not overcome its market dominance. A more dramatic change occurred with the 1983 launch of Lotus Development Corporation's Lotus 1-2-3, written by a former <b>VisiCalc</b> employee. Unlike the PC version of <b>VisiCalc,</b> 1-2-3 was written {{to take full advantage}} of the PC's increased memory, screen and performance. Yet it was designed to be as compatible as possible with <b>VisiCalc,</b> including the menu structure, to allow <b>VisiCalc</b> users to easily migrate to 1-2-3.|$|E
5000|$|The VisiCalc-Apple {{connection}} {{suggested the}} hypothesis of the [...] "killer app"—or the [...] "software tail that wags the hardware dog." [...] Once <b>VisiCalc</b> caught on, people came into computer stores asking for <b>VisiCalc</b> and then also the computer (the Apple II) {{they would need to}} run the program. <b>VisiCalc</b> sales exceeded 700,000 units by 1983.|$|E
5000|$|The first spreadsheet, <b>VisiCalc,</b> {{had helped}} launch the Apple II {{as one of}} the {{earliest}} personal computers in business use. With IBM's entry into the market, <b>VisiCalc</b> was slow to respond, and when they did, they launched what was essentially a straight port of their existing system in spite of the greatly expanded hardware capabilities. Lotus' solution was marketed as a three-in-one integrated solution, which handled spreadsheet calculations, database functionality, and graphical charts, hence the name [...] "1-2-3", though how much database capability was debatable given Lotus' sparse memory. 1-2-3 quickly overtook <b>VisiCalc,</b> as well as Multiplan and SuperCalc, two <b>VisiCalc</b> competitors.|$|E
50|$|Bricklin {{was awarded}} the Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1981 for <b>VisiCalc.</b> Bricklin never {{received}} a patent for <b>VisiCalc,</b> since software programs weren't made eligible for patents by the Supreme Court until after 1981.|$|E
50|$|<b>VisiCalc</b> went on {{to become}} the first killer app, an {{application}} that was so compelling, people would buy a particular computer just to use it. <b>VisiCalc</b> was in no small part responsible for the Apple II's success. The program was later ported to a number of other early computers, notably CP/M machines, the Atari 8-bit family and various Commodore platforms. Nevertheless, <b>VisiCalc</b> remains best known as an Apple II program.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, {{along with}} Dan Fylstra, he co-founded the {{corporation}} Personal Software, which became VisiCorp, and {{was involved in}} the creation of <b>VisiCalc,</b> the first spreadsheet program. MicroChess sales helped to finance the development of <b>VisiCalc.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lotus 1-2-3, {{along with}} its {{competitor}} Borland Quattro, soon displaced <b>VisiCalc.</b> Lotus 1-2-3 was released on January 26, 1983, started outselling then-most-popular <b>VisiCalc</b> the very same year, and {{for a number of}} years was the leading spreadsheet for DOS.|$|E
50|$|<b>VisiCalc</b> was an {{enormous}} success, {{so much so that}} a huge number of clones appeared. One of these was written by a former <b>VisiCalc</b> programmer, Mitch Kapor. His version, Lotus 1-2-3, would go on to be an even greater success than <b>VisiCalc,</b> in no small part {{due to the fact that}} it ran on, and was tuned for, the new IBM PC. Lotus 1-2-3 shipped 60,000 copies in the first month, and Lotus was soon one of the largest software companies in the world.|$|E
50|$|<b>VisiCalc</b> {{used the}} A1 {{notation}} in formulas.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, Bricklin and Frankston founded Software Arts, Inc., {{and began}} selling <b>VisiCalc.</b> Along with co-founder Bob Frankston, he started writing {{versions}} of {{the program for the}} Tandy TRS-80, Commodore PET and the Atari 800. Soon after its launch, <b>VisiCalc</b> became a fast seller at $100.|$|E
50|$|Because of Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston's {{implementation}} of <b>VisiCalc</b> on the Apple II in 1979 and the IBM PC in 1981, the spreadsheet concept became widely {{known in the}} late 1970s and early 1980s. <b>VisiCalc</b> was the first spreadsheet that combined all essential features of modern spreadsheet applications (except for forward referencing/natural order recalculation), such as WYSIWYG interactive user interface, automatic recalculation, status and formula lines, range copying with relative and absolute references, formula building by selecting referenced cells. Unaware of LANPAR at the time PC World magazine called <b>VisiCalc</b> the first electronic spreadsheet.|$|E

5000|$|Although it sold {{well from}} the launch, the initial market was to hobbyists, games players and {{computer}} enthusiasts. Sales expanded exponentially {{into the business}} and professional market when the spreadsheet program <b>VisiCalc</b> was launched in mid-1979. <b>VisiCalc</b> is credited as being the defining [...] "killer app" [...] in the microcomputer industry.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, Dan Flystra {{recruited}} Esber to run worldwide {{sales and}} marketing for Person Software (later renamed VisiCorp). While there, he helped manage distribution of the first micro-software program, <b>Visicalc.</b> [...] <b>VisiCalc</b> was credited with sparking the explosive growth of Apple Computer {{and the beginning of}} the Personal Computer Software revolution.|$|E
50|$|When Lotus 1-2-3 was {{launched}} in 1983, taking {{full advantage of the}} expanded memory and screen of the PC, <b>VisiCalc</b> sales practically ended overnight. Sales imploded so rapidly that the company was soon insolvent. Lotus Development purchased the company in 1985, and immediately ended sales of <b>VisiCalc</b> and the company's other products.|$|E
5000|$|<b>VisiCalc</b> {{was unusually}} {{easy to use}} and came with {{excellent}} documentation; Apple's developer documentation cited the software as an example of one with a simple user interface. Observers immediately noticed its power. Ben Rosen speculated in July 1979 that [...] "VisiCalc could someday become the software tail that wags (and sells) the personal computer dog". For the first 12 months it was only available for the Apple II, and became that platform's killer app. Many bought $2000 Apples to run the $100 software, even if they already owned computers. Apple's rival Tandy Corporation used <b>VisiCalc</b> on its own Apple IIs. Other software supported its Data Interchange Format (DIF) to share data. One example was the Microsoft BASIC interpreter supplied with most microcomputers that ran <b>Visicalc.</b> This allowed skilled BASIC programmers to add features such as trigonometric functions that <b>Visicalc</b> itself did not have.|$|E

50|$|There {{were well}} known {{problems}} with <b>VisiCalc,</b> and several competitors appeared {{to address some}} of these issues. One early example was 1980's SuperCalc, which solved the problem of circular references, while a slightly later example was Microsoft Multiplan from 1981, which offered larger sheets and other improvements. In spite of these, and others, <b>VisiCalc</b> continued to outsell them all.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, Dan Bricklin {{was given}} a Grace Murray Hopper Award for <b>VisiCalc.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{a student}} at Harvard Business School, Bricklin co-developed <b>VisiCalc</b> in 1979, making it the first {{electronic}} spreadsheet readily available for home and office use. It ran on an Apple II computer, and was considered a fourth generation software program. <b>VisiCalc</b> is widely credited for fueling {{the rapid growth of}} the personal computer industry. Instead of doing financial projections with manually calculated spreadsheets, and having to recalculate with every single cell in the sheet, <b>VisiCalc</b> allowed the user to change any cell, and have the entire sheet automatically recalculated. This could turn 20 hours of work into 15 minutes and allowed for more creativity.|$|E
5000|$|... 1983: TRS-80 Model 4 Enhanced <b>Visicalc</b> (could use 64 KB banked {{memory in}} an {{expanded}} machine) ...|$|E
5000|$|The large market {{also made}} {{it more likely that}} a {{successful}} worldware package would be integrated into a larger world of hardware and software. For example, when early instructional experiments made use of <b>Visicalc</b> (an early spreadsheet), faculty were not crippled when <b>VisiCalc</b> went out of existence. Lotus 1-2-3 (another spreadsheet) could read the <b>VisiCalc</b> files. And if a faculty member then wanted to shift to Microsoft Excel, those files could be read, too. In contrast, when instructional software disappeared, all the instructor's work of curricular revision and skill development became useless. Worldware could provide a foundation for incremental, cumulative curricular change and instructional improvement, a learning curve far less vulnerable to unexpected technical or business disruptions.|$|E
