25|$|Often the {{greatest}} concern {{with respect to}} <b>varicocele</b> is its effect on male fertility. The relationship between <b>varicocele</b> and infertility is unclear; some men with the condition are fertile, some have sperm that are normal in shape and move normally, but are compromised in function, and some have sperm with abnormal shapes or that do not move well. Theories as to how variocele affects sperm function include damage via excess heat caused by the blood pooling and oxidative stress on sperm (ROS).|$|E
25|$|Tobacco {{smoking and}} {{mutations}} in the gene expressing glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 both put men {{at risk for}} infertility; these factors may also exacerbate the risk that <b>varicocele</b> will affect fertility.|$|E
25|$|Around 15% of {{all adult}} males, up to 35% {{of men who}} are {{evaluated}} for male infertility, and around 80% of men who are infertile due to some other cause, have <b>varicocele.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{discovery}} of the sign of swelling comprising a mass, <b>varicocele</b> can be confirmed with ultrasound, which will show dilation of the vessels of the pampiniform plexus to be greater than greater than 2mm.|$|E
25|$|Among his {{developments}} in urology were his technique to puncture the bladder (cytotomy), various methods of removing urinary calculi, {{external and internal}} urethrotomies, the subcutaneous ligation of <b>varicocele</b> veins using the fisherman's knot, and genital operations.|$|E
25|$|A <b>varicocele</b> is an {{abnormal}} {{enlargement of the}} pampiniform venous plexus in the scrotum. This plexus of veins drains blood from the testicles. The testicular blood vessels originate in the abdomen and course down through the inguinal canal {{as part of the}} spermatic cord {{on their way to the}} testis. Varicoceles occur in around 15% of all men.|$|E
25|$|In men, sports-related {{injuries}} {{are among the}} major causes of testicular trauma. In a small controlled but unblinded study of 52 men, <b>varicocele</b> was significantly more common in equestrians than in non-equestrians. The {{difference between these two}} groups was small, however, compared to differences reported between extreme mountain bike riders and non-riders, and also between mountain bike riders and on-road bicycle riders. Horse-riding injuries to the scrotum (contusions) and testes (blunt trauma) were well known to surgeons in the 19th century and early 20th century. Injuries from collision with the pommel of a saddle are mentioned specifically.|$|E
25|$|Other {{signs and}} symptom may include haematuria; loin pain; {{abdominal}} mass; malaise, {{which is a}} general feeling of unwellness; weight loss and/or loss of appetite; anaemia resulting from depression of erythropoietin; erythrocytosis (increased production of red blood cells) due to increased erythropoietin secretion; <b>varicocele,</b> which is seen in males as an enlargement of the pampiniform plexus of veins draining the testis (more often the left testis) hypertension (high blood pressure) resulting from secretion of renin by the tumour; hypercalcemia, which is elevation of calcium levels in the blood; sleep disturbance or night sweats; recurrent fevers; and chronic fatigue.|$|E
25|$|Examples of MAIS phenotypes include {{isolated}} infertility (oligospermia or azoospermia), mild gynecomastia {{in young}} adulthood, decreased secondary terminal hair, high pitched voice, or minor hypospadias repair in childhood. The external male genitalia (penis, scrotum, and urethra) are otherwise normal in individuals with MAIS. Internal genitalia, including Wolffian structures (the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles) and the prostate, is also normal, although the bitesticular volume of infertile men (both {{with and without}} MAIS) is diminished; male infertility is associated with reduced bitesticular volume, <b>varicocele,</b> retractile testes, low ejaculate volume, male accessory gland infections (MAGI), and mumps orchitis. The incidence of these features in infertile men with MAIS {{is similar to that}} of infertile men without MAIS. MAIS is not associated with MÃ¼llerian remnants.|$|E

2500|$|Whether having [...] variocele {{surgery or}} {{embolization}} improves male fertility is controversial, as good clinical data are lacking. [...] There is tentative evidence that varicoceletomy may improve fertility {{in those with}} obvious findings and abnormal sperm; however, this has a number needed to treat of 7 for varicoceletomy and 17 for embolization. There are also studies showing that the regular surgery has no significant effect on infertility. [...] A 2012 Cochrane review found tentative but unclear evidence of improved fertility among males treated for <b>varicocele.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Gomoiu {{published}} steadily, {{and also}} lectured at the Medical Students' Society and the Surgical Society. Topics included meningoencephalitis, cerebral atrophy, facial nerve paralysis, fibrous tissue neoplasm, lipoma, {{the anatomy of}} the endothelium, corneal transplantation, skin grafting, dental implants, hysterectomy, various types of cysts and [...] "rare tumors", and talus bone expulsion. These works were taken up in Eraclie Sterian's magazine, Spitalul, of which Gomoiu was co-editor, or published as brochures. His doctoral thesis, on facial anaplasia, was awarded a magna cum laude in 1909, and published the same year. It was followed in 1910 by Gomoiu's introduction to inguinal hernia surgery, his reviews of surgery as applied to genital tuberculosis, vaginal hydrocele, urethrocele, and <b>varicocele,</b> and a work on the physiological role of cholesterol. A winner of the Manoah Hillel scholarship, that year and the next also saw his first contributions as a medical bibliographer and librarian, with catalogues of entries for the Bucharest University graduation papers in medicine. For his service in the Romanian Army, Gomoiu was concentrated in Medgidia.|$|E

50|$|Microsurgery {{has been}} used to treat several {{pathologic}} conditions leading to infertility such as tubal obstructions, vas deferens obstructions and <b>varicocele</b> {{which is one of the}} most frequent cause of male infertility. Microsurgical drainages by placing micro vascular bypasses between spermatic and inferior epigastric veins as proposed by Flati et al. have been successfully performed in treating male infertility due to <b>varicocele.</b> Microsurgical treatment has been shown to significantly improve fertility rate also in patients with recurrent <b>varicocele</b> who had previously undergone non microsurgical treatments.|$|E

50|$|Usually, {{the patient}} disrobes {{completely}} and {{puts on a}} gown. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis, scrotum, testicles, vas deferens, spermatic cords, ejaculatory ducts, urethra, urinary bladder, anus and rectum. An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, {{which in turn is}} tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. A physical exam of the scrotum can reveal a <b>varicocele,</b> but the impact of detecting and surgically correct a <b>varicocele</b> on sperm parameters or overall male fertility is debated.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the left}} gonad drains via the left renal vein {{it can also}} result in left {{testicular}} pain in men or left lower quadrant pain in women. Nausea and vomiting can result due to compression of the splanchnic veins. An unusual manifestation of NCS includes <b>varicocele</b> formation and varicose veins in the lower limbs. Another clinical study has shown that nutcracker syndrome is a frequent finding in varicocele-affected patients and possibly, nutcracker syndrome should be routinely excluded as a possible cause of <b>varicocele</b> and pelvic congestion.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Goldstein is a {{specialist}} in male infertility and scrotal disorders and is internationally renowned for his pioneering work on microsurgical management of male infertility such as vasectomy reversals, varicocelectomy, Hydrocele, Inguinal hernia repair and testis-sparing testicular tumor excision. [...] He was the first American surgeon to be trained in, and perform, the Chinese method of no-scalpel vasectomy. [...] Dr. Goldstein's {{research has shown that}} there is a direct link between <b>varicocele</b> and low testosterone and <b>varicocele</b> and loss of fertility in men.

5000|$|In 1930, Howard {{went to a}} {{hospital}} in Temple complaining of a <b>varicocele,</b> gas in the stomach and an abnormally small penis. The working diagnosis at the time was sexual neurasthenia but the symptoms may instead point towards neurotic depressive disorder. The doctor concluded that [...] "We do not think there is anything wrong with Robert. We can find no <b>varicocele</b> of any consequence, and his organs are normally developed and he tests out good in every respect. His trouble, in our judgment, is due to his thinking there is something wrong. After he has dispelled this thought from his mind he will be in fine shape." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{hydrocele}} usually {{occurs on}} one side, {{but can also}} affect both sides. The accumulation can be a marker of physical trauma, infection, tumor or <b>varicocele</b> surgery, but the cause is generally unknown. Indirect inguinal hernia indicates increased risk of hydrocele.|$|E
50|$|In {{a number}} of {{situations}} direct medical or surgical intervention can improve the sperm concentration, examples are use of FSH in men with pituitary hypogonadism, antibiotics in case of infections, or operative corrections of a hydrocele, <b>varicocele,</b> or vas deferens obstruction.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the same}} time, Goldsmith joined guitarist Billy Dolan, {{who had played}} on the Fire Theft album and tour, for a project called <b>Varicocele.</b> The band {{recorded}} about 30 songs, and presented them to Jonathan Poneman at Sub Pop, who declined to release them.|$|E
50|$|The {{causes of}} teratozoospermia are unknown in most cases. However, Hodgkin's disease, coeliac disease, and Crohn's disease may {{contribute}} in some instances.
