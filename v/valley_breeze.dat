5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and <b>valley</b> <b>breezes</b> can dominate local winds.|$|R

50|$|Mountain and valley breezes form {{through a}} process similar to sea and land breezes. During the day, the sun heats up {{mountain}} air rapidly while valley remains relatively cooler.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigated}} organic molecular compositions of summer-time aerosols {{collected at}} the summit of Mt. Fuji (3776 m a. s. l.) in July− August 2009. More than 120 organic species were identified using GC/MS. Concentrations of both primary and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) tracers in whole-day samples were 4 − 20 times higher than those in nighttime samples, suggesting that <b>valley</b> <b>breeze</b> is an efficient mechanism to uplift the aerosols and precursors from the ground surface to mountaintop in daytime. Using a tracer-based method, we estimated the concentrations of secondary organic carbon (SOC) derived from isoprene, α/β-pinene, and β-caryophyllene to be 2. 2 − 51. 2 ngC m− 3 in nighttime and 227 − 1120 ngC m− 3 during whole-day. These biogenic SOCs correspond to 0. 80 − 31. 9 % and 26. 8 − 57. 4 % of aerosol organic carbon in nighttime and whole-day samples, respectively.

The annual average number concentration measured over the two-year period at the NCO-P is 860 cm&minus; 3 . Total concentrations show a strong seasonality with maxima during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons and minima during the dry and monsoon seasons. A diurnal variation is also clearly observed, with maxima between 09 : 00 and 12 : 00 UTC. The aerosol concentration maxima are mainly due to nucleation processes during the post-monsoon season, as witnessed by high nucleation mode integrated number concentrations, and to transport of high levels of pollution from the plains by <b>valley</b> <b>breezes</b> during the pre-monsoon season, as demonstrated by high accumulation mode integrated number concentrations. Night-time number concentration of particles (from 03 : 00 to 08 : 00 NST) are relatively low throughout the year (from 450 cm&minus; 3 during the monsoon season to 675 cm&minus; 3 during the pre-monsoon season), indicating the level of free_tropospheric background, as a result of downslope winds during this part of the day. However, it was found that these background concentrations are strongly influenced by the daytime concentrations, as they show the same seasonal variability. The resulting free troposphere (FT) /residual layer concentrations are found to be two times higher than at other lower altitudes European sites, such as the Jungfraujoch. Night-time measurements were subsequently selected to study the FT composition according to different air masses, and the effect of long range transport to the station...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOver the Mediterranean Pyrenees {{and near}} coastal region {{there is a}} high {{frequency}} of convective storms during summertime. This fact determines a local maximum of precipitation at this season unlike the normal and general minimum over Mediterranean basin.

They usually involves a little distant through at medium levels, very weak pressure gradient at the surface and not significant instability, but a preferred Planetary Boundary Layer low-level convergence zones tied to the orography. As a result of this analysis two different kinds of circulations associated to recurrent convergence zones have been recognized: upvalley/upslope winds and sea breezes.

40|$|We report {{chemical}} composition data for PM 10 and PM 1 from the Nepal Climate Observatory-Pyramid (NCO-P), the world's highest aerosol observatory, located at 5079 m a. s. l. at {{the foothills of}} Mt. Everest. Despite its high altitude, the average PM 10 mass apportioned by the chemical analyses is {{of the order of}} 6 μg m − 3 (i. e., 10 μg/scm), with almost a half of this mass accounted for by organic matter, elemental carbon (EC) and inorganic ions, the rest being mineral dust. Organic matter, in particular, accounted for by 2. 0 μg m − 3 (i. e., 3. 6 μg/scm) on a yearly basis, and it is by far the major PM 10 component beside mineral oxides. Non-negligible concentrations of EC were also observed (0. 36 μg/scm), confirming that light-absorbing aerosol produced from combustion sources can be efficiently transported up the altitudes of Himalayan glaciers. The concentrations of carbonaceous and ionic aerosols follow a common time trend with a maximum in the premonsoon season, a minimum during the monsoon and a slow recovery during the postmonsoon and dry seasons, which is the same phenomenology observed for other Nepalese Himalayan sites in previous studies. Such seasonal cycle {{can be explained by the}} seasonal variations of dry and moist convection and of wet scavenging processes characterizing the climate of north Indian subcontinent. We document the effect of orographic transport of carbonaceous and sulphate particles upslope the Himalayas, showing that the <b>valley</b> <b>breeze</b> circulation, which is almost permanently active during the out-of-monsoon season, greatly impacts the {{chemical composition}} of PM 10 and PM 1 in the high Himalayas and provides an efficient mechanism for bringing anthropogenic aerosols into the Asian upper troposphere (> 5000 m a. s. l.). The concentrations of mineral dust are impacted to a smaller extent by valley breezes and follow a unique seasonal cycle which suggest multiple source areas in central and south-west Asia.

40|$|C 1 -C 4 alkyl nitrates (RONO 2 /were {{measured}} concurrently at {{a mountain}} site, Tai Mo Shan (TMS), and an urban site, Tsuen Wan (TW), {{at the base}} of the same mountain in Hong Kong from September to November 2010. Although the levels of parent hydrocarbons were much lower at TMS (p < 0. 05), similar alkyl nitrate levels were found at both sites regardless of the elevation difference, suggesting various source contributions of alkyl nitrates at the two sites. Prior to using a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, the data at TW were divided into "meso" and "non-meso" scenarios for the investigation of source apportionments with the influence of mesoscale circulation and regional transport, respectively. Secondary formation was the prominent contributor of alkyl nitrates in the meso scenario (60 ± 2 %, 60. 2 ± 1. 2 pptv), followed by biomass burning and oceanic emissions, while biomass burning and secondary formation made comparable contributions to alkyl nitrates in the nonmeso scenario, highlighting the strong emissions of biomass burning in the inland Pearl River delta (PRD) region. In contrast to TW, the alkyl nitrate levels measured at TMS mainly resulted from the photooxidation of the parent hydrocarbons at TW during mesoscale circulation, i. e., <b>valley</b> <b>breezes,</b> corresponding to 52 - 86 % of the alkyl nitrate levels at TMS. Furthermore, regional transport from the inland PRD region made significant contributions to the levels of alkyl nitrates (∼ 58 - 82 %) at TMS in the non-meso scenario, resulting in similar levels of alkyl nitrates observed at the two sites. The simulation of secondary formation pathways using a photochemical box model found that the reaction of alkyl peroxy radicals (RO 2 /with nitric oxide (NO) dominated the formation of RONO 2 at both sites, and the formation of alkyl nitrates contributed negatively to O 3 production, with average reduction rates of 4. 1 and 4. 7 pptv pptv- 1 at TMS and TW, respectively.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the formation and}} growth of charged aerosols clusters at Jungfraujoch, in the Swiss Alps (3580 m a. s. l.), the highest altitude site of the European EUCAARI project intensive campaign. Charged particles and clusters (0. 5 &ndash; 1. 8 nm) were measured from April 2008 to April 2009 and allowed the detection of nucleation events in this very specific environment (presence of free tropospheric air and clouds). We found that the naturally charged aerosol concentrations, which are dominated by the cluster size class, shows a strong diurnal pattern likely linked to <b>valley</b> <b>breezes</b> transporting surface layer ion precursors, presumably radon. Cosmic rays were found {{not to be the}} major ion source at the measurement site. However, at night, when air masses are more representative of free tropospheric conditions, we found that the cluster concentrations are still high. The charged aerosol size distribution and concentration are strongly influenced by the presence of clouds at the station. Clouds should be taken into account when deriving high altitude nucleation statistics. New particle formation occurs on average 17. 5 % of the measurement period and shows a weak seasonality with a minimum of frequency during winter, but this seasonality is enhanced when the data set is screened for periods when the atmospheric station is out of clouds. The role of ions in the nucleation process was investigated and we found that the ion-mediated nucleation explains 22. 3 % of the particle formation. The NPF events frequency is correlated with UV radiation but not with calculated H 2 SO 4 concentrations, suggesting that other compounds such as organic vapors are involved in the nucleation and subsequently growth process. In fact, NPF events frequency also surprisingly increases with the condensational sink (CS), suggesting that at Jungfraujoch, the presence of condensing vapours probably coupled with high CS are driving the occurrence of NPF events. A strong link to the air mass path was also pointed out and events were observed to be frequently occurring in Eastern European air masses, which present the highest condensational sink. In these air masses, pre-existing cluster concentrations are more than three time larger than in other air masses during event days, and no new clusters formation is observed, contrarily to what is happening in other air mass types...|$|R
