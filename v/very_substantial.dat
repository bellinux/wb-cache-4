5|$|The Baroque art was {{developing}} {{to a great}} extent under the patronage of the Catholic Church, which utilized the art to facilitate religious influence, allocating for this purpose the <b>very</b> <b>substantial</b> financial resources at its disposal. The most important in this context art form was architecture, with features rather austere at first, accompanied in due time by progressively more elaborate and lavish facade and interior design concepts.|$|E
5|$|Intentionally {{set at a}} {{low level}} {{at the time the}} {{cemetery}} and railway opened, in later years the fixed fares offered a <b>very</b> <b>substantial</b> saving over main line tickets to Brookwood (in 1902 the 4s LSWR third class fare to Brookwood was twice the cost of the LNC's equivalent). Additional LNC traffic was generated by golfers disguised as mourners travelling to the golf course which had been built on those parts of the land bought by the LNC in 1852 which had not yet been incorporated into the cemetery. The fixed fares prompted complaints from other London funeral firms after the opening of Woking Crematorium in 1885, as rival undertakers were not given access to the LNC's cheap trains and had to pay the LSWR's cargo rate (24shillings in 1885) to ship a coffin to Brookwood or Woking stations for transfer to the crematorium.|$|E

5|$|The {{rational}} nexus test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner. Instead, a modified rational nexus test is used, which requires a court to consider {{whether there is a}} reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law. Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a <b>very</b> <b>substantial</b> scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1).|$|E

50|$|The 1859 Cypress Hall on City Road, {{later called}} Leinster Hall, is a Regency villa built 1858-59, and {{concurrent}} with the Great Hall, {{is the oldest}} building at the University of Sydney. The nucleus of the villa remains highly intact, encapsulated {{within the walls of}} St Michael’s College built in 1929. The villa is only one of a <b>very</b> few <b>substantial</b> Regency buildings from this period that has survived in the inner western area of Sydney and is the only known surviving Regency building in the Darlington area.|$|R

50|$|On {{the basis}} of glottochronological analysis, Georgi Klimov dates the split of the Proto-Kartvelian into Svan and Proto-Karto-Zan to the 19th century BC, and the further {{division}} into Georgian and Zan to the 8th century BC, although with the reservation that such dating is <b>very</b> preliminary and <b>substantial</b> further study is required.|$|R
40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} (EM) {{in combination}} with image analysis is a powerful technique to study protein structure at low- and high resolution. Since electron micrographs of biological objects are <b>very</b> noisy, <b>substantial</b> improvement of image quality {{can be obtained by}} averaging individual projections. Crystallographic and noncrystallographic averaging methods are available and have been applied to study projections of the large protein complexes embedded in photosynthetic membranes from cyanobacteria and higher plants. Results of EM on monomeric and trimeric Photosystem I complexes, on monomeric and dimeric Photosystem II complexes, and on the monomeric cytochrome b 6 /f complex are discussed. ...|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>very</b> <b>substantial</b> taxes on the estate left by Sir James Dunn and Nova Scotia's Izaak Walton Killam who had died the year before in 1955, the {{government}} of Canada was able to create and provide an endowment for the Canada Council for the Arts. Dunn also left a very significant estate to his last wife who fulfilled his wishes and made numerous contributions to charitable, cultural, and educational works.|$|E
50|$|Chromic {{cambisol}} and rendzina {{have developed}} on Cretaceous and Jurassic limestone and on Triassic dolomite. More acidic soils are found only on limestone with chert.

25|$|In {{both the}} tension and shear joint design cases, some level of tension preload in the bolt and {{resulting}} compression preload in the clamped components {{is essential to the}} joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured torque to the bolt, measuring bolt extension, heating to expand the bolt then turning the nut down, torquing the bolt to the yield point, testing ultrasonically, or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components. Each method has a range of uncertainties associated with it, some of which are <b>very</b> <b>substantial.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brazilian Portuguese {{has had its}} own development, mostly {{similar to}} 16th-century Central and Southern dialects of European Portuguese (despite a <b>very</b> <b>substantial</b> number of Portuguese colonial settlers, and more recent immigrants, coming from Northern regions, and in minor degree Portuguese Macaronesia), with a few {{influences}} from the Amerindian and African languages, especially West African and Bantu restricted to the vocabulary only. As a result, the language is somewhat different, mostly in phonology, from the language of Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries (the dialects of the other countries, {{partly because of the}} more recent end of Portuguese colonialism in these regions, have a closer connection to contemporary European Portuguese). These differences are comparable to those between American and British English.|$|E
25|$|Racing cyclists {{often have}} gears {{with a small}} {{relative}} difference of around 7% to 10%; this allows fine adjustment of gear ratios to suit the conditions and maintain a consistent pedalling speed. Mountain bikes and hybrid bikes often have gears with a moderate relative difference of around 15%; this allows for a much larger gear range while having an acceptable step between gears. 3-speed hub gears may have a relative difference of some 33% to 37%; such big steps require a <b>very</b> <b>substantial</b> change in pedalling speed and often feel excessive. A step of 7% corresponds to a 1-tooth change from a 14-tooth sprocket to a 15-tooth sprocket, while a step of 15% corresponds to a 2-tooth change from a 13-tooth sprocket to a 15-tooth sprocket.|$|E

The houses were almost all built of stone, and were of a <b>very</b> massive and <b>substantial,</b> as well as elegant character.|$|R
40|$|Peter Unger has {{challenged}} philosophical objectivism, {{the thesis that}} traditional philosophical problems have definite objective answers. He argues from semantic relativity for philosophical relativity, the thesis that for certain philosophical problems, there is no objective answer. I clarify, formulate and challenge Unger's argument. According to Unger, philosophical relativism explains philosophical idling, the fact that philosophical debates appear endless, philosophical disagreements seem irresolvable, and <b>very</b> little <b>substantial</b> progress seems made towards satisfactory and definite answers to philosophical problems. I argue, however, that the reality of philosophical idling is doubtful and, ironically, undermined by philosophical relativism. I then raise problems for several steps in Unger's argument for philosophical relativity. I conclude by arguing that philosophical relativism can avoid self-defeat only by an ad hoc limitation of its scop...|$|R
25|$|Cavendish's {{electrical}} and chemical experiments, like those on heat, had begun while {{he lived with}} his father in a laboratory in their London house. Lord Charles Cavendish died in 1783, leaving almost all of his <b>very</b> <b>substantial</b> estate to Henry. Like his theory of heat, Cavendish's comprehensive theory of electricity was mathematical in form and was based on precise quantitative experiments. In 1771 he published an early version of his theory, based on an expansive electrical fluid that exerted pressure. He demonstrated that if the intensity of electric force was inversely proportional to distance, then the electric fluid in excess of that needed for electrical neutrality would lie on the outer surface of an electrified sphere; then he confirmed this experimentally. Cavendish continued to work on electricity after this initial paper, but he published no more on the subject.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasonable}} relation test {{applied to}} Article 12(1) by the Privy Council {{has been applied}} {{in a number of}} local and foreign cases. It was reformulated into a three-stage test by the Court of Appeal in Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong (1998). The Court applied {{a modified version of the}} test to situations involving the discriminatory application of neutral laws in Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General (2009), and expressed the view that Article 12(1) would only be infringed in such cases where there was intentional and arbitrary discrimination, or inequalities due to inadvertence or inefficiency on a <b>very</b> <b>substantial</b> scale. The element of arbitrariness was also mentioned by the Court in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988) – it said a law that allows a public authority to exercise arbitrary discretionary power is in violation of Article 12(1).|$|E
25|$|There {{had already}} been a <b>very</b> <b>substantial</b> {{investment}} in the Herald project, such that the management held a meeting to discuss continuation. Handley Page decided to press ahead with the Herald project, {{in an effort to}} recover the investment; announcing a new uprated version powered by the Rolls-Royce Dart. The revised aircraft, now designated the HPR.7 Dart Herald, was powered by 1,910shp Dart 527 engines driving 12ft 6in (3.81m) variable pitch four-blade Dowty Rotol propellers, and the fuselage was lengthened by 20in (51cm), while other improvements included increased fuel capacity. The first prototype was converted to Dart Herald standard, making its maiden flight on 11 March 1958, with the first production aircraft flying on 30 October 1959. The initial Series 100 version of the Dart Herald was certified in April 1958. The basic price in 1960 was around £185,000.|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid and}} at the same time {{extremely}} contradictory development of Russia's reforms in 1992 - 93 accelerated the growth of the share of the private sector, led to the emergence of financially powerful private companies as well as high rates of centralization and concentration of private capital. Before our <b>very</b> eyes, <b>substantial</b> changes are taking place in the organization and conduct of private business that in our view attest to a new relationship between economic forces in the nation, to the advent of important new trends that influence the basic features of the future economy: the structure of property and its ownership, forms of production organization, the degree of competitiveness of the market, the investment propensity of economic agents, and so forth. ...|$|R
