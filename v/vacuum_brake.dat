5|$|The NSR {{coaching}} stock was, even until grouping, predominantly four and six wheeled vehicles. Four-wheeled carriages were the norm {{from the start}} and the last were constructed in the 1880s, although by then they had progressed from the unbraked coaches of the 1840s {{with the introduction of}} the communication cord in 1869 and the simple <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> in 1883. The first bogie coaches were introduced in 1906 for use on the Derby–Llandudno service and these were followed by further examples until 1923. By 1919 all carriages, except 13 four-wheelers used on miners trains, had been fitted with steam heating and a number of vehicles had been fitted with through pipes to allow use in trains equipped with Westinghouse brakes. Most carriages were constructed at Stoke but some were purchased from companies such as the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company.|$|E
5|$|The Met {{opened with}} no stock of its own, with the GWR {{and then the}} GNR {{providing}} services. The GWR used eight-wheeled compartment carriages constructed from teak. By 1864, the Met had taken delivery of its own stock, made by the Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co., based on the GWR design but standard gauge. Lighting was provided by gas— two jets in first class compartments and one in second and third class compartments, and from 1877 a pressurised oil gas system was used. Initially the carriages were braked with wooden blocks operated by hand from the guards' compartments at {{the front and back}} of the train, giving off a distinctive smell. This was replaced in 1869 by a chain that operated brakes on all carriages. The operation of the chain brake could be abrupt, leading to some passenger injuries, and it was replaced by a non-automatic <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> by 1876. In the 1890s, a mechanical 'next station' indicator was tested in some carriages on the circle, triggered by a wooden flap between the tracks. It was considered unreliable and not approved for full installation.|$|E
25|$|ESC uses a {{hydraulic}} modulator {{to assure that}} each wheel receives the correct brake force. A similar modulator is used in ABS. ABS needs to reduce pressure during braking, only. ESC additionally needs to increase pressure in certain situations and an active <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> booster unit may be utilized {{in addition to the}} hydraulic pump to meet these demanding pressure gradients.|$|E
2500|$|The 0-6-4Ts {{were built}} with steam and <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> and steam {{reversing}} gear and weighed [...] The 2-6-2Ts were fitted with <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> only; those built by Beyer weighed [...] and Kitson's [...]|$|R
50|$|Westinghouse air <b>brakes</b> and <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> (or no {{continuous}} brakes at all) {{are usually}} fitted. Dual brakes or piped only can overcome incompatibilities. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are considered to}} be obsolete. Electronically controlled pneumatic brakes (ECP) are starting to be fitted on faster, heavy-duty trains for higher performance, and the two ECP systems are compatible. Air brakes are to be preferred to <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> because of their greater power.|$|R
5|$|When the GWR {{was opened}} no trains in the United Kingdom were fitted with <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes,</b> instead handbrakes were fitted to {{individual}} wagons and trains also conveyed brake vans where a guard had {{control of a}} screw-operated brake. The first goods wagons to be fitted with <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> were those that ran in passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish. Some ballast hoppers were given <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> in December 1903, and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes)</b> still formed {{the majority of the}} fleet in 1948 when the railway was nationalised {{to become a part of}} British Railways.|$|R
25|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with many LMS standard {{features such as}} a self-cleaning smokebox, rocking firegrate, self-emptying ashpan, side window cab and a simplified footplate together with others which followed NCC practice, such as a water top-feed on a parallel boiler (as opposed to the taper boilers {{being used by the}} LMS at the time), Dreadnought type <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> gear, Detroit sight feed cylinder lubricator and a cast number plate.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to the air brake is the <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake,</b> in which a steam-operated ejector is mounted on the engine instead of the air pump, to create a vacuum and release the brakes. A secondary ejector or crosshead vacuum pump is used to maintain the vacuum in the system against the small leaks in the pipe connections between carriages and wagons. Vacuum systems existed on British, Indian, West Australian and South African railway networks.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1935, {{an express}} meat train from Liverpool to London {{was brought to}} a halt at Kings Langley due to a {{defective}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake.</b> Due to a signalman's error a milk train ran into its rear. Wreckage spread across all four lines, {{with the result that}} a few minutes later the Camden to Holyhead freight collided with the debris, followed a few seconds later by the Toton to Willesden coal train. All four lines were blocked for some time and the driver of the milk train was killed. Contemporaneous newsreel footage shows the aftermath of the four-fold accident.|$|E

25|$|European railway {{air brakes}} include the Kunze-Knorr brake (invented by Georg Knorr and {{manufactured}} by Knorr-Bremse) and the Oerlikon. The working principle {{is the same}} as for the Westinghouse air brake. In the steam era, Britain's railways were divided– some using vacuum brakes and some using air brakes– but there was a gradual standardization on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake.</b> Some locomotives, e.g. on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, were dual-fitted so that they could work with either vacuum- or air-braked trains. In the diesel era, the process was reversed and British Railways switched from vacuum-braked to air-braked rolling stock in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Although {{carriage}} {{repair and}} restoration {{is carried out}} {{at a number of}} locations on the railway, the main carriage works is located in the former goods shed at Kidderminster. This building, lying adjacent to the main national railway line, is known as the North Star Carriage Works thus perpetuating a typical GWR name. As well as having a machine shop and fabrication equipment to carry out a full range of body and bogie repairs the carriage works boasts equipment recovered from former BR works to calibrate and adjust dynamo voltage regulators and to thoroughly overhaul and test <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> equipment, a facility that is almost extinct elsewhere. In common with the locomotive works it is not normally open to the public due to health and safety legislation.|$|E
25|$|The 2600s {{shared the}} engines and {{transmission}} of their GNR(I) predecessors, having two , 9.6-litre, six-cylinder, four-stroke engines driving the inner axles {{of the two}} bogies via fluid flywheels and Self-Changing Gears five-speed preselector gearboxes, with cardan shafts driving forward/reverse gearboxes {{on the ends of}} the axles. Multiple working was via 24-core jumper cables. The cars were fitted with two parallel <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> systems—a conventional system and a second high-vacuum, quick-release system, based on reservoirs in which a vacuum was continually maintained, for use on services with frequent stops. Steam heating was originally fitted; even-numbered cars had a boiler in the guard's compartment, capable of supplying steam for up to four cars. Cars used on suburban services were subsequently fitted with a bus-type heating system that utilised the engines' cooling water.|$|E

2500|$|Vehicles with a [...] "f" [...] {{in their}} numbers were {{equipped}} with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake.</b> Non braked vehicles were through piped.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{competitor}} to the {{air brake}} is the <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake,</b> which operates on negative pressure. [...] The <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> is a little simpler than the air brake, with an ejector with no moving parts on steam engines or a mechanical or electrical [...] "exhauster" [...] on a diesel or electric locomotive replacing the air compressor. [...] Disconnection taps {{at the ends of}} cars are not required as the loose hoses are sucked onto a mounting block.|$|E
2500|$|... 15 June 1897 – a {{train of}} empty cattle trucks and horse boxes was being {{reversed}} down the incline when the locomotive's <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> failed. The locomotive and wagons ploughed into {{a line of}} stationary wagons, {{the office of a}} local coal merchant, and stables. One man was injured.|$|E
50|$|In 1870, some {{close-coupled}} rigid-wheelbase four-wheeled carriages {{were made}} by Oldburys. After some derailments in 1887, a new design of 27 ft long rigid-wheelbase four-wheelers known as Jubilee Stock was built by the Cravens Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. for the extension line. Fitted with the pressurised gas lighting system and non-automatic <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> from new, steam heating was added later. More trains followed in 1892, although all had been withdrawn by 1912. By May 1893, following an order by the Board of Trade, automatic <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> had been fitted to all carriages and locomotives. Bogie stock was made by Ashbury in 1898 and by Cravens and the Met's Neasden Works in 1900. This gave a better ride quality, steam heating, automatic <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes,</b> electric lighting and upholstered seating in all classes.|$|R
50|$|Air brakes were {{fitted to}} 10 {{locomotives}} between 1900 and 1923. The same engines received <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> as well, between 1928 and 1931.|$|R
50|$|The class {{featured}} enclosed wheel splashers and cabs from new, but no brakes {{were initially}} fitted; some received steam <b>brakes</b> and others <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|However, {{the maximum}} {{pressure}} {{is limited to}} atmospheric pressure, {{so that all the}} equipment has to be much larger and heavier to compensate. This disadvantage is made worse at high altitude. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> is also considerably slower acting in both applying and releasing the brake; this requires a greater level of skill and anticipation from the driver. Conversely, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> had the advantage of gradual release long before the Westinghouse automatic air brake, which was originally only available in the direct-release form still common in freight service. A primary fault of vacuum brakes is the inability to easily find leaks. [...] In a positive air system, a leak is quickly found due to the escaping pressurized air; discovering a vacuum leak is more difficult, although it is easier to repair when found because a piece of rubber (for example) can just be tied around the leak and will be firmly held there by the vacuum.|$|E

2500|$|... 25 September 1902. A special {{troop train}} from Ballincollig, County Cork to Larne Harbour became divided. The {{detached}} rear portion subsequently collided {{with that in}} front between Greenisland and Trooperslane. Four vehicles were destroyed and many others damaged; three cavalry horses were killed {{but there were no}} other injuries. Major Pringle felt that the locomotive crew had not been sufficiently vigilant in keeping a proper lookout. Furthermore, he censured the Great Southern and Western Railway, the GNR(I) and the BNCR, over whose metals the train had run, for treating it as goods or cattle and marshalling the passenger vehicles behind the non-braked cattle wagons with the result that the <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> was not in operation throughout the train.|$|E
50|$|There {{were six}} {{variants}} of this sub-class, reflecting that locos were boilered and/or <b>vacuum</b> <b>braked</b> and/or dual braked. Boiler fitted locomotives included {{the first five}} (252 AV) and final thirty Class 25/2 (252 DV). Only members of the latter batch were modified for dual brake operation becoming 252 CX {{with the exception of}} 25242 that had had its boiler removed and was designated 252 FX. The non-boilered <b>vacuum</b> <b>braked</b> locos were 252 BV and when dual braked became 252 EX.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{air brakes}} {{can be made}} much more {{effective}} than <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> for a given size of brake cylinder. An air brake compressor is usually capable of generating a pressure of [...] vs only [...] for vacuum. With a vacuum system, the maximum pressure differential is atmospheric pressure ( [...] at sea level, less at altitude). Therefore, an air brake system can use a much smaller brake cylinder than a vacuum system to generate the same braking force. This advantage of air brakes increases at high altitude, e.g. Peru and Switzerland where today <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> are used by secondary railways. The much higher effectiveness of air brakes and {{the demise of the}} steam locomotive have seen the air brake become ubiquitous; however, <b>vacuum</b> <b>braking</b> is still in use in India, in Argentina and in South Africa, but this will be declining in near future.|$|R
50|$|Other detail {{fittings}} included <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> and oval buffers, {{to avoid}} locking of buffer heads when working around tight curves with the engine's long overhang at each end.|$|R
2500|$|Several of {{the systems}} within the Class 24s were {{standard}}. The braking system was the standard BR system, adopted {{as part of the}} Modernisation Plan, of locomotive air and train <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake,</b> both applied by a single handle via a proportional valve. Similarly the connection for multiple working was the standard electro-pneumatic system designated [...] "Blue Star" [...] with each loco bearing a small blue coloured 5-pointed star above each buffer to denote this. Also common was the provision of a door to allow staff to pass between locomotives, or between a locomotive and adjacent coach. In practice these were rarely used and were sealed shut at overhaul during the 1970s to reduce draughts in the cab.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> hoses {{have been}} used in <b>Vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> systems ever since the {{technology}} was invented in the mid-1860s ...|$|E
50|$|When new, the {{locomotive}} had Westinghouse air brakes, and dual air and vacuum brakes were {{provided for the}} train. For operations in the Netherlands, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> equipment was disconnected. When returned to Britain, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> was restored but the air brake for the train was removed.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} itself used air brakes, but it {{was equipped}} to operate trains with air or <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes.</b> While hauling a <b>vacuum</b> <b>braked</b> train, the locomotive's air brake system would be disabled and the train would be controlled by using the train brakes alone {{to slow down and}} stop. While hauling an air braked train, on the other hand, the locomotive brakes would engage along with the train brakes. While working either type of train downgrade, the locomotive's regenerative braking system would also work in conjunction with the train brakes.|$|R
50|$|Significant {{consequences}} of the accident were the adoption of improved <b>vacuum</b> <b>braking</b> systems on locomotives and passenger rolling stock, {{and the introduction of}} Automatic Train Control (ATC) in 1908.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{have been}} {{superseded}} by air brakes in modern trains, which use pumps, as diesel and electric locomotives {{no longer have}} a suitable working fluid for vacuum ejectors.|$|R
