40|$|As {{technology}} dependent {{health care}} of Japanese terminally ill home patients increases,a better understanding is needed regarding the professional relationship between physicians and <b>visiting</b> <b>nurses</b> {{responsible for the}} care of these patients. The {{purpose of this study is}} to research into a new collaborative relationship between physician and <b>visiting</b> <b>nurse</b> in home care medicine. At first,researchers interviewed 19 <b>visiting</b> <b>nurses</b> in Y prefecture to know the present situation of home care medicine. The researchers then analyzed the case of a <b>visiting</b> <b>nurse</b> who cared for a terminally ill home patient with advanced lung cancer. The results suggest that various situations prevent the <b>visiting</b> <b>nurse</b> from receiving sufficient instructions from the physician at the time of change in condition of the patient. In order to resolve these difficulties in home care medicine,it may be necessary to review the way a physician instructs a <b>visiting</b> <b>nurse</b> and the legal system as it pertains to home care medicine,while <b>visiting</b> <b>nurses</b> should enhance even more their professional capabilities...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify from their {{narratives}} how <b>visiting</b> <b>nurses</b> cope with stress, as part of basic information exploring the ways that <b>visiting</b> <b>nurses</b> who practice home hospice care deal with stress. The subjects were 10 <b>visiting</b> <b>nurses</b> with at least 3 years' experience as <b>visiting</b> <b>nurses</b> and with experience in home hospice care. Data was collected by individual interviews using semi-structured questionnaires. Inductive qualitative analysis was applied to the content obtained from the interviews. The results showed that stress felt by <b>visiting</b> <b>nurses</b> doing home hospice care were "distress at being unable to support the decision-making at the final moments", "pressure from the attending family", "poor cooperation with medical professionals" and "lack of confidence in their own judgment and ability", while they dealt with it by "finding a change of pace", "having an opportunity to reflect on nursing", "close cooperation" and "sense of accomplishment after caregiving". These results suggest that to reduce stress in <b>visiting</b> <b>nurses</b> and improve their coping ability and quality of care, it is necessary to establish a training system whereby high expertise as a <b>visiting</b> <b>nurse</b> can be acquired, to develop and enhance a workplace environment withopportunities to receive advice from professionals, and to enhance the system of cooperation between healthcare workers...|$|R

50|$|From {{first grade}} on many {{times of the}} year(for some grades almost everyday) there are {{opportunities}} for community service. Students raise money for charities, give gifts to those less fortunate, and many other things. The older the students get the more responsibility they have. Eighth graders have a group known as E.G.O.(Eighth Grade Organization) which controls a lot (but not all) of which community service activity the school does and when certain fundraisers are. E.G.O. however doesn't control certain activities because certain activities or fundraisers are annual (such as the Layette program or the Ronald McDonald House Collection) and are not changed. Also, E.G.O. doesn't head every project either. For example, the first grade heads a fundraiser {{to raise money for}} Guatemala schools. A.C.T.S.(Association of Catholic Teen Services) is a program that eighth graders can join (but don't have to) which travels around the community doing acts of community service by <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> homes, tutoring under privileged kids, and many other things.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout her career, Sadie Heath Cabaniss {{was heavily}} {{devoted to the}} cause of public health and laid the {{foundation}} for professional nursing in Virginia. [...] In 1893, Cabaniss first started working as a night supervisor at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Two years later she became the supervisor of the operating room at the Old Dominion Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, which was connected to the Medical College of Virginia (MCV). While there, the faculty asked her to develop a training school for nurses. Cabaniss accepted the offer and ran the school on the Nightingale method of nursing education from 1895 until April 1901. [...] The Nightingale method involves training in a civil hospital by way of an apprenticeship. [...] The school exists to this day and is now known as the School of Nursing at Virginia Commonwealth University. [...] In 1900, she and several students from the Old Dominion nursing school organized the Nurses Settlement of Richmond in response to the sick. This organization provided home services for the ill. [...] This established the first rural <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> service in Virginia in Hanover County. [...] Cabaniss also developed Virginia Nurses Association in 1901. This organization was made up of alumni from existing training schools in Virginia. As president of the organization, she assisted in drafting a measure that ultimately regulated the practice of nursing in the Commonwealth. [...] Her continued devotion to public health led Cabaniss to develop a nurses’ settlement in St. Augustine, Florida as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{arrival of}} the aged society, the changes of disease {{structure}} and social conditions stimulate a transition to home nursing care from facilities for nursing care. The {{purpose of this study}} was to clarify the factors related to a self-evaluation scale about <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care. The research design was a cross-sectional mailed survey with a self-administered questionnaire. The sample was 574 visiting nurses in 287 <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care stations in Osaka Prefecture. The response rate was 39. 9 %. In this study, we newly developed measurements for the work-site environment, communication skills, and a self-evaluation scale about <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care. Expert reviews confirmed the face validity of the measurements and reliability analysis (Cronbach's α) confirmed the reliability (internal consistency) for the measurements. In addition, we analyzed the structure of sub-scale in each measurement by using the principal component analysis with Varimax rotation. The dependent variable was the self-evaluation about <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care. The independent variables were basic attribute, job training system, work-site environments, communication skills, and psychological situation (Maslack's Burnout Inventory). As a result of the principal component analysis of the self-evaluation scale about <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care, we identified 5 subscales: support for daily activities, assessments of physical condition, support for continuing home care, medical treatment, and terminal care. Cronbach's α of the self-evaluation scale of <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care was over 0. 8, and it had internal consistency. From the results of the multiple regression analysis, the following were indicated as relation factors: the 5 sub-scales on nursing care and 2 factors of communication skills: listening, acceptance, and empathic attitude, and informed consent. In order to improve the quality of <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care, it is necessary to clarify the peculiar communication skills required in <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care, and to provide on-the-job training program in communication skills...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} Home <b>Visiting</b> <b>Nursing</b> Service Need Assessment Form (HVNS-NAF) to {{standardize}} {{the decision about}} the need for home <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> service. Methods: The sample consisted of older adults who had received coordinated services by care managers. We defined the need for home <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> service by elderly individuals as the decision of the need by a care manager so that the elderly can continue to live independently. Explanatory variables included demographic factors, medical procedure, severity of illness, and caregiver variables. Multiple logistic regression was carried out after univariate analyses to decide the variables to include and the weight of each variable in the HVNS-NAF. We then calculated the sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off value, and defined the score with the highest sensitivityand specificity as the cut-off value. Results: Nineteen items were included in the final HVNS-NAF. When the cut-off value was 2 points, the sensitivity was 77. 0 %, specificity 68. 5 %, and positive predictive value 56. 8 %. Conclusions: HVNS-NAF is the first validated standard based on characteristics of elderly clients who required home <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> service. Using the HVNS-NAF may result in reducing the unmet need for home <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> service and preventing hospitalization. </p...|$|E
