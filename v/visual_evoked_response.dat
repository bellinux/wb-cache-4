Participation of individual generators is stochastically modelled in a physiologically realistic manner that captures the inherent variability in latencies and amplitudes associated with the component phases of the response.

40|$|Abnormalities in {{visually}} <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> {{have been}} used to demonstrate abnormal optic nerve fibre projections in human albinos, who have anomalous nystagmoid movements. Using visually evoked potentials we tested the hypothesis that patients with dissociated vertical deviation (another group with anomalous nystagmoid movements) may have abnormal <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> similar to those of albinos. Patients with dissociated vertical deviation (both unilateral and alternating), patients with congenital esotropia without dissociated vertical deviation, and normal subjects were investigated. The results showed a very high incidence of abnormal <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> in patients with dissociated vertical deviation, while recordings from the other groups were normal. As well as suggesting the possibility of abnormalities of optic nerve fibre projections, the <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> showed a marked increase in latency in all patients with dissociated vertical deviation. These results occurred regardless of the visual acuity or amblyopia of the eyes tested.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} work {{was to investigate the}} development of the S-cone colour-opponent pathway in human infants aged 4 weeks to 6 months. This was achieved by recording transient <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> to pattern-onset stimuli along a tritanopic confusion axis (tritan stimuli) at and around the adult isoluminant match. For comparison, <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> to red-green and luminance-modulated stimuli were recorded from the same infants at the same ages. <b>Evoked</b> <b>responses</b> were also recorded from colour-normal adults for comparison with those of the infants. The transient VEP allowed observation of response morphology as luminance differences were introduced to the chromatic stimuli. In this way, an estimate of isoluminance was possible in infants. Estimated isoluminant points for a group of six infants aged 6 to 10 weeks closely approximated the adult isoluminant match. This finding has implications for the use of photometric isoluminance in infant work, and suggests that photopic spectral sensitivity is similar in infants and adults. Abnormalities of the <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> to tritan, red-green and luminance-modulated stimuli in an infant with cystic fibrosis are reported. The results suggest abnormal function of the retino-striate visual pathway in this infant, and it is argued that these may be secondary to his illness, although data from more infants with cystic fibrosis are needed to clarify this further. A group of nine healthy infants demonstrated <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> to tritan stimuli by 4 to 10 weeks and to red-green stimuli by 6 to 11 weeks post-term age. Responses to luminance-modulated stimuli were present in all nine infants at the earliest age tested, namely 4 weeks post-term. The slightly earlier age of onset of <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> to tritan stimuli than for red-green may be explained by the relatively lower cone contrast afforded by red-green stimuli. Latency of the <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> to both types of chromatic stimuli and to luminance-modulated stimuli decreased with age at a similar rate, suggesting that the visual pathways transmitting luminance and chromatic information mature at similar rates in young infants...|$|R
40|$|A cross {{sectional}} study of {{aspects of their}} neurology was carried out on 77 chloralkali workers previously exposed to mercury (Hg) vapour and compared with 53 age matched referents. The chloralkali workers had been exposed {{for an average of}} 7. 9 years at a concentration of 59 micrograms Hg/m 3 in the working atmosphere. The individual mean urinary concentration of Hg for each year of exposure was 531 nmol Hg/ 1. On average the exposure had ceased 12. 3 years before the examinations. Both the median sensory nerve conduction velocity and the amplitude of the sural nerve were associated with measures of cumulative exposure to Hg. An association was also found between years since first exposure to Hg and aspects of the <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response.</b> Previously exposed subjects with postural tremor or impaired coordination also had alterations in <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response.</b> These results may indicate an effect of previous exposure to mercury vapour on the nervous system, possibly in the visual pathway, cerebellum, and the peripheral sensory nerves...|$|E
40|$|Systems {{analysis}} {{techniques were}} developed and demonstrated for modeling the electroencephalographic (EEG) steady state <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> (ssVER), {{for use in}} EEG data compression and {{as an indicator of}} mental workload. The study focused on steady state frequency domain stimulation and response analysis, implemented with a sum-of-sines (SOS) stimulus generator and an off-line describing function response analyzer. Three major tasks were conducted: (1) VER related systems identification material was reviewed; (2) Software for experiment control and data analysis was developed and implemented; and (3) ssVER identification and modeling was demonstrated, via a mental loading experiment. It was found that a systems approach to ssVER functional modeling can {{serve as the basis for}} eventual development of a mental workload indicator. The review showed how transient <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> (tVER) and ssVER research are related at the functional level, the software development showed how systems techniques can be used for ssVER characterization, and the pilot experiment showed how a simple model can be used to capture the basic dynamic response of the ssVER, under varying loads...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the vasoreactivity of the posterior circulation by assessing <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> in {{posterior cerebral artery}} (PCA) by means of functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD) in 50 patients with relaps-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), divided into two subgroups (nonRBN – subgroup of patients {{who did not have}} retrobulbar nuritis and RBN – subgroup of patients who had a retrobulbar neuritis) and compared it with 30 healthy subjects. Mean blood flow velocities (MBFV) and mean reaction time (time to peak velocities) (MRT) in each PCA were measured, in a dark (closed eyes) and during a white light stimulation (opened eyes, looking at the electric bulb), during three consecutive repetitive periods of 1 minute each. The results of our study testing the neuronal activity of the occipital cortex in RRMS patients by means of fTCD showed a possible compensatory cortical adaptive response and altered vasoreactivity of the posterior cerebral circulation in RRMS patients as compared to healthy, as a possible result of the insufficient cortical inhibition caused by demyelinisation and axonal damage.

40|$|A {{new system}} has been {{designed}} to deliver a comprehensive analysis of the visual sensory system and oculomotor responses to different types of visual and vestibular stimulation. The instrument, called a Computerized Electro-Oculograph (CEOG), is an integrated computer-controlled system which performs a series of important diagnostic tests. It can generate and control the stimulus, as well as record patient responses, testing both the visual and oculomotor systems, and also provide a regular pattern applicable to both clinical and research purposes. <b>Visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> and eye movement data is processed by computer for quantitative analysis and “strip chart” data is then displayed on a scrolling T. V. screen. Hard copy of the output is also available. The system can analyze visual evoked responses to both stroboscopic flashing lights and intermittent patterned stimulation. Other programs study the main features of the wave form and details of speed, frequency, and latency, as well as the symmetry of spontaneous, visual, and vestibular evoked eye movements. A major advantage of the system is its rapid, automatic, and quantitative operation with no risk to the current status of the visual and oculomotor pathways as it performs EOG (electro-oculograph), VER (<b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response),</b> ERG (electronetinograph), and caloric tests.
