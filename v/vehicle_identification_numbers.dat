2500|$|In 1954, {{after his}} first arrest, Gaggi was charged with running an {{international}} auto theft ring. Operating out of a used car lot in Brooklyn, the ring was backed by Scalise, now the Gambino boss. For two years, Gaggi and two associates fabricated false vehicle registrations for nonexistent Cadillacs. The gang stole cars that matched the phony vehicle descriptions and replaced their original <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Numbers</b> with new fake numbers. They also gave the vehicles new license plates that matched the falsified registrations. The ring then sold the stolen vehicles in Florida, Georgia, Texas and Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{intervening}} years, Shelby {{had a series}} of ventures start and stop relating to production of [...] "completion" [...] Cobras— cars that were allegedly built using [...] "left over" [...] parts and frames. In the 1960s, the FIA required entrants (Shelby, Ford, Ferrari, etc.) to produce at least 100 cars for homologated classes of racing. Shelby simply ordered an insufficient number of cars and skipped a large block of <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Numbers,</b> to create the illusion the company had imported large numbers of cars. Decades later in the 1990s, Carroll alleged that he had found the [...] "left over" [...] frames, and began selling cars which were supposedly finally [...] "completed". After it was discovered the cars were built from scratch in collaboration with McCluskey, Ltd., they were re-termed [...] "continuation" [...] Cobras. The cars are still built to this day, known as the current CSX4000 series of Cobras.|$|E
