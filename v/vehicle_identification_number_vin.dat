More than 200 components were designed {{especially for the}} car. Most components, including the engine, drivetrain, are modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>VIN)</b> is unchanged from the Enzo from which it was derived. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on August 18, 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elégance and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September.|$|E

25|$|The SC/Rambler {{has become}} a popular muscle car to {{replicate}} because of the ease of installing a powerful AMC V8 drivetrain {{into one of the}} large number of inexpensive 1966 through 1969 Rambler Americans. To identify a true SC/Rambler, it must be a hardtop and the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>VIN)</b> must have the letter M in the third digit and the engine code of X as the seventh digit.|$|E

25|$|The <b>vehicle</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (<b>VIN)</b> plate, {{a unique}} serial number used to {{identify}} individual motor vehicles, {{had been removed from}} the car's dashboard and the door VIN sticker, but police retrieved the VIN from the bottom of its engine block. The investigators traced the SUV's last registered owner, and the female college student who sold the suspect the Pathfinder. Law enforcement officials recovered the suspect's pre-paid disposable cell phone's number from the cell phone of the seller, and ran it through a number of databases. They determined that the disposable phone had been used for calls to and from a Pakistani telephone number which they knew to be associated with Faisal Shahzad. The phone had also been used to call a fireworks store in rural Pennsylvania. They collected his e-mail address from an email which he sent to the seller’s computer.|$|E
500|$|On April 14, 1995, McVeigh {{paid for}} a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas. The {{following}} day he rented a 1993 Ford F-700 truck from Ryder under the name Robert D. Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, and because {{it reminded him of}} the Klingon warriors of Star Trek. On April16, 1995, he drove to Oklahoma City with fellow conspirator Terry Nichols where he parked a getaway car several blocks away from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols' blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16. After removing the license plate from the car, he left a note covering the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>VIN)</b> plate that read, [...] "Not abandoned. Please do not tow. Will move by April 23. (Needs battery & cable)." [...] Both men then returned to Kansas.|$|E

5000|$|John Searle criticises Penrose's {{appeal to}} Gödel as {{resting on the}} fallacy that all {{computational}} algorithms must be capable of mathematical description. As a counter-example, Searle cites the assignment of license plate numbers (LPN) to specific <b>vehicle</b> <b>identification</b> <b>numbers</b> (<b>VIN),</b> to register a vehicle. According to Searle, no mathematical function {{can be used to}} connect a known VIN with its LPN, but the process of assignment is quite simple—namely, [...] "first come, first served"—and can be performed entirely by a computer.|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{there are}} vehicle history {{services}} {{that can help}} a prospective used car buyer by providing a [...] "history report" [...] based on the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (<b>VIN).</b> These reports will indicate items of public record, such as vehicle title branding, lemon law buybacks and recalls. They may indicate minor/moderate collision damage or improper vehicle maintenance.

40|$|International audienceDynamic IPv 6 {{addressing}} and routing configuration in vehicular networks is {{an important}} challenge that has attracted {{a fair amount of}} attention recently. Early proposals adapted fixed-infrastructure and MANET models and thus inherited their latency and overhead. Later, researchers relaxed some of the often restrictive assumptions (e. g., Router Advertisement TTL extension) but still focused on certain limited scenarios. Very recently, {{in the wake of the}} emerging concept of Future Internet, a general questioning arose on whether one naming and addressing model suits every network topology. Along this line of research, the present article poses the terms of this problem in the IP-based vehicular communications area and aims at giving one solution space instance based on the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Numbers</b> (<b>VIN)</b> namespace. This article advances the state-of-the-art as follows: (1) It presents a comprehensive and detailed tutorial of the main dynamic IPv 6 auto-configuration approaches. (2) It gives the specifics of Future Internet paradigm as applied to vehicular networking and presents a novel approach for group and infrastructure communications based on VIN namespace. (3) It offers a comprehensive feature and analytical comparison to evaluate the proposals that fit best our communication paradigm...|$|R

Since this was common practice at the GM and Chrysler plants it is much easier to verify that the exact engine in the car is actually the factory original unit. Each AMC vehicle was inspected to confirm that the engine displacement (identified by numbers cast on the block under the engine mounts) corresponded to its corresponding engine code in the <b>vehicle</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (<b>VIN).</b> A tag screwed to the valve cover provides an engine's build date, and that date code always preceded a specific car's production sequence.
