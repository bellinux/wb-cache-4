40|$|Progressive Optimization (POP) is a {{technique}} to make query plans robust, and minimize need for DBA intervention, by repeatedly re-optimizing a query during runtime if the cardinalities estimated during optimization prove to be significantly incorrect. POP works by carefully calculating <b>validity</b> <b>ranges</b> for each plan operator under which the overall plan can be optimal. POP then instruments the query plan with checkpoints that validate at runtime that cardinalities do lie within <b>validity</b> <b>ranges,</b> and reoptimizes the query otherwise. In this demonstration we showcase POP implemented for a research prototype version of IBM's DB 2 DBMS, using a mix of real-world and synthetic benchmark databases and workloads.

40|$|<b>Validity</b> <b>ranges</b> of Lie {{canonical}} {{perturbation theory}} (LCPT) are investigated {{in terms of}} non-blow-up regions. We investigate how the <b>validity</b> <b>ranges</b> depend on the perturbation order in two systems, {{one of which is}} a simple Hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom and the other is a HCN molecule. Our analysis of the former system indicates that non-blow-up regions become reduced in size as the perturbation order increases. In case of LCPT by Dragt and Finn and that by Deprit, the non-blow-up regions enclose the region inside the separatrix of the Hamiltonian, {{but it may not be}} the case for LCPT by Hori. We also analyze how well the actions constructed by these LCPTs approximate the true action of the Hamiltonian in the non-blow-up regions and find that the conventional truncated LCPT does not work over the whole region inside the separatrix, whereas LCPT by Dragt and Finn without truncation does. Our analysis of the latter system indicates that non-blow-up regions do not necessarily cover the whole regions inside the HCN well. We propose a new perturbation method to improve non-blow-up regions and <b>validity</b> <b>ranges</b> inside them. Our method is free from blowing up and retains the same normal form as the conventional LCPT. We demonstrate our method in the two systems and show that the actions constructed by our method have larger <b>validity</b> <b>ranges</b> than those by the conventional and our previous methods proposed in Teramoto and Komatsuzaki (J Chem Phys 129 : 094302, 2008; Phys Rev E 78 : 017202, 2008).

5000|$|Psychiatrists August Piper and Harold Merskey have {{challenged}} the trauma hypothesis, arguing that correlation {{does not imply}} causation—the fact that people with DID report childhood trauma does not mean trauma causes DID—and point to the rareness of the diagnosis before 1980 {{as well as a}} failure to find DID as an outcome in longitudinal studies of traumatized children. They assert that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed because of vague and unclear diagnostic criteria in the DSM and undefined concepts such as [...] "personality state" [...] and [...] "identities", and question the evidence for childhood abuse beyond self-reports, the lack of definition of what would indicate a threshold of abuse sufficient to induce DID and the extremely small number of cases of children diagnosed with DID despite an average age of appearance of the first alter of three years. Psychiatrist Colin Ross disagrees with Piper and Merskey's conclusion that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed, pointing to internal consistency between different structured dissociative disorder interviews (including the Dissociative Experiences Scale, Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule and Structured Clinical Interview for Dissociative Disorders) that are in the internal <b>validity</b> <b>range</b> of widely accepted mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. In his opinion, Piper and Merskey are setting the standard of proof higher than they are for other diagnoses. He also asserts that Piper and Merskey have cherry-picked data and not incorporated all relevant scientific literature available, such as independent corroborating evidence of trauma.|$|E

40|$|Background: Primary care is {{an ideal}} setting for {{physical}} activity interventions to prevent and manage common long-term conditions. To identify those who can benefit from such interventions and to deliver tailored support, primary care professionals (e. g. general practitioners, practice nurses, physiotherapists, healthcare assistants) need reliable and valid tools to assess physical activity. However, there is uncertainty about the best performing tool. Objective: To identify the tools used in the literature to assess the physical activity in primary care and describe their psychometric properties. Method: A systematic review of published and unpublished literature was undertaken up to 1 st December 2016). Papers detailing physical activity measures, tools or approaches used in primary care consultations were included. A synthesis of the frequency and context of their use, and their psychometric properties, was undertaken. Studies were appraised using the Downs and Black critical appraisal tool and the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) initiative checklist. Results: Fourteen papers reported 10 physical activity assessment tools. The General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ) was most frequently reported. None of the assessment tools identified showed high reliability and <b>validity.</b> Intra-rater reliability <b>ranged</b> from Kappa: 0. 53 (Brief Physical Activity Assessment Tool (BPAAT)) to 0. 67 (GPPAQ).

Findings Men (N= 389) and women (N= 430) were recruited from a tumor registry, oncology clinics, and an internet panel. The PROMIS SexFS, International Index of Erectile Function, and Female Sexual Function Index were used to collect participants’ self-reported sexual function. The domains shared among the measures include desire/interest in sexual activity, lubrication and vaginal discomfort/pain (women), erectile function (men), orgasm, and satisfaction. We examined correlations among different domains within the same instrument (discriminant validity) and correlations among similar domains measured by different instruments (convergent validity). Correlations demonstrating discriminant <b>validity</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 38 to 0. 73 for men and 0. 48 to 0. 74 for women, while correlations demonstrating convergent <b>validity</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 62 to 0. 83 for men and 0. 71 to 0. 92 for women.

To increase literacy outcomes {{for students who}} are deaf and hard of hearing, professionals need to provide high quality instruction that is informed by accurate and valid assessment data. This study compared {{the reliability and validity of}} student scores from paper-pencil and e-based assessments, “Maze” and “Slash. ” Forty (N= 40) students, who were deaf or hard of hearing and read between the second and fifth grade reading level, participated. Twenty-one teachers of students who are deaf and hard of hearing also participated. For Maze, alternate form reliability coefficients obtained from correct scores and correct scores adjusted for guessing ranged from. 61 to. 84 (ps <. 01); criterion-related <b>validity</b> <b>ranged</b> from. 33 to. 67 (majority of ps <. 01). These findings are generally consistent with findings from previous research.

The extent to which testing modifications delivered in an electronic-based (e-based) format influenced student scores was also examined. Differences between paper-pencil and e-based conditions were generally non-significant for Maze; significant differences between conditions for Slash favored the paper-pencil condition. Overall, findings suggest that Maze holds promise for use with students who are deaf and hard of hearing in both conditions, with inconclusive results for Slash.

40|$|There {{is a lack}} {{of sound}} {{instruments}} for measuring patient satisfaction with stroke care. One self-report instrument comprising two subscales, satisfaction with inpatient care and satisfaction with care after discharge, has been validated, but only in the United Kingdom. In later studies, items have been added without further validation. Therefore, we tested this extended questionnaire (Satisfaction with Stroke Care questionnaire; SASC- 19) for feasibility, reliability (homogeneity and test-retest agreement), and construct validity (convergent and divergent validity and factor analysis) in the Netherlands in 166 prospectively collected stroke patients living at home 6 months after discharge. To determine the testretest reliability, 51 patients completed the SASC- 19 again two weeks after they first completed it. The response rate was 90 %; the mean time needed to complete the SASC- 19 was less than 10 minutes. Six items were omitted by more than 10 % of the patients. Both subscales showed good homogeneity and almost perfect test-retest reliability (Cronbas alpha's > 0. 80; Intraclass Correlation Coefficients > 0. 80).
