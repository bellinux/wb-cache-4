40|$|This study {{focussed}} on extending {{and applying}} techniques to measure hydrodynamic characteristics in treatment units at sewage works. Use {{was made of}} tracer dye studies and a spreadsheet based analysis tool. The resulting infonnation about residence time, tank conguration and pathological behaviour was linked to other infonnation from respirometry and flow and load studies. Characterising the wastewater process will become increasingly important as the economic and compliance drivers {{in the operation of}} wastewater treatment facilities become increasingly pronounced. Case studies at Royton WWTW, Chorley WWTW, Preston WWTW and Montebello WWTW were used to develop, improve and apply the methodology. Tests at Royton and Chorley were used to develop the practical side of conducting tracer studies. The Preston case study was used to improve the diagnostic methodology. It was demonstrated that consent failures as a result of events are usually a result of a number of (linked) factors, in the case of Preston influenced by the tank conguration. The response of a pulse of dye was measured at Preston in <b>vessel</b> <b>outlet</b> throughout the works. The tracer dyeresponse was used to predict the response to a discharge of high ammoniacal leachate liquor and compared to measured data. This type of calibration experiment facilitated the simulation of different discharge event scenarios. The tracer and modelling techniques were incorporated in a general diagnostic methodology, which caters for a phased approach in diagnostic studies. A series of diagnostic tables take the user through cause - effect hypotheses and possible measurement techniques to use in the diagnostic investigation. Although the diagnostic methodology proved to be a versatile asset optimisation tool, which required considerable less effort than deterministic models, implementation in United Utilities' AMP 3 Capital Investment Programme was problematic. The size of the programme and lack of resources forced the company to implement standard rather than tailor-made solutions. However, the diagnostic methodology can easily be applied elsewhere in the wastewater industry...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAbstract — The {{removal of}} mercury from {{entering}} process {{area is the}} key to safeguard aluminum brazed heat exchanger and other critical equipment in the ethylene production plant from Liquid Metal Embrittlement (LME) and amalgam corrosion. Sulphur Impregnated Activated Carbon (SIAC) is the proven technology for mercury removal. However, currently there is no specific study conducted at fluctuating ethane feedstock to monitor its functionality and performance. This study is conducted at a large scale of aging ethylene plant without Ethylene Buffer Storage Tank (EBST) which results in fluctuating feedstock upstream of mercury removal vessel. Number of experiments and data gathering were done by observing current mercury level at various process stream to determine its performance before and after installation. Analysis performed at mercury removal <b>vessel's</b> <b>outlet</b> indicates consistent decrease in adsorption capacity with an increase of temperature. The fluctuation of ethane feedstock from 35, 000 kg/hr to 71, 000 kg/hr also results in less adsorption efficiency of SIAC...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes strain-based {{acceptance}} criteria for assessing plastic instability {{of the safety}} class 1 nuclear components made of ferritic steel during level D service loads. The strain-based criteria were proposed with two approaches: (1) a section average approach and (2) a critical location approach. Both approaches {{were based on the}} damage initiation point corresponding to the maximum load-carrying capability point instead of the fracture point via tensile tests and finite element analysis (FEA) for the notched specimen under uni-axial tensile loading. The two proposed criteria were reviewed from the viewpoint of design practice and philosophy to select a more appropriate criterion. As a result of the review, {{it was found that the}} section average approach is more appropriate than the critical location approach from the viewpoint of design practice and philosophy. Finally, the criterion based on the section average approach was applied to a simplified reactor pressure <b>vessel</b> (RPV) <b>outlet</b> nozzle subject to SSE loads. The application shows that the strain-based {{acceptance criteria}} can consider cumulative damages caused by the sequential loads unlike the stress-based acceptance criteria and can reduce the overconservatism of the stress-based acceptance criteria, which often occurs for level D service loads...|$|R

The registries in Sweden and France obtained data through reporting from various sources; in California, medical records were reviewed. As expected, definitions and ascertained conditions differed among each of the registries. The total rates for severe defects were similar (1. 43 per 1, 000), but differed for specific defects. Clear differences in epidemiological characteristics existed for specific defects; for example, severe cardiac defects sex ratios were significantly high for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, d-transposition of great <b>vessels,</b> double <b>outlet</b> right ventricle, total anoralous pulmonary venous return, tetralogy of Fallot, and significantly low for pulmonary atresia without ventricular septal defect and endocardial cushion defect.

In the steady state regime, several calculations were performed for various number of the reactor coolant system (RCS) loops connected to the reactor and {{the results have been}} used to analyse the effect of the RCS configuration to the coolant flow at the reactor outlet and under the reactor vessel head. General flow patterns are described in the outlet part of the reactor and under the reactor vessel head and, also, the influence of a lower flow rate through the reactor on thermal homogeneity of coolant under the vessel head. Simultaneously, we discuss the influence of the coolant flow rate at the core outlet on the heat transfer from the under-head space. Unsteady calculation was also done for a reactor cool-down in the regime of natural circulation. The calculation conditions correspond with the data obtained from the experiments led in the frame of the cool-down process of VVER 440 reactor at Mochovce nuclear power plant in 2003.

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple and economical process and apparatus for concentrating hydrogen peroxide from aqueous solution {{at the point}} of use have been invented. The heart of the apparatus is a vessel comprising an outer shell containing tubular membranes made of a polymer that is significantly more permeable by water than by hydrogen peroxide. The aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide to be concentrated is fed through the interstitial spaces between the tubular membranes. An initially dry sweep gas is pumped through the interiors of the tubular membranes. Water diffuses through the membranes and is carried away as water vapor mixed into the sweep gas. Because of the removal of water, the hydrogen peroxide solution flowing from the <b>vessel</b> at the <b>outlet</b> end is more concentrated than that fed into the vessel at the inlet end. The sweep gas can be air, nitrogen, or any other gas that can be conveniently supplied in dry form and does not react chemically with hydrogen peroxide...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to analyse the course of pregnancy and modes of labour in patients with {{congenital heart disease}}s, as well as the incidence of congenital heart diseases in their children. Results: Fifty-four percent of the studied group had undergone cardiac surgery due to simple shunt defects, while the rest had presented with complex CHD. Spontaneous labour was achieved in 57 % pregnancies, in 38 % it was completed by Caesarean section, in 5 % natural abortion was observed. Multiple gestations took place in 27 % of followed-up patients. Cardiac complications occurred in 15 women, most often left ventricular outflow tract surgery. In this group, there was one death at 27 th week of pregnancy during urgent prosthesis replacement. Hypertension was observed in women after correction of the coarctation of the aorta, decreased physical capacity in patients after surgery due to transposition of the great <b>vessels,</b> double <b>outlet</b> right ventricle, physiologically single ventricle (after Fontan surgery).

Conclusions: In the majority of women with CHD, pregnancy and delivery are not essentially disturbed, but should be carefully monitored by experienced cardiologists and obstetricians with appropriate expertise. Patients with a significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction form the highest risk group. CHD are transferred in 10. 1 % of cases...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} overcomes {{the drawbacks}} {{inherent in the}} prior art and solves the problems inherent in conventional Joule-heated vitrification melters, where the melter preferably comprises a vessel having a refractory liner and an opening for receiving material which is converted into molten vitreous material in the vessel. The <b>vessel</b> has an <b>outlet</b> port for removing molten vitreous material from the vessel. A plurality of electrodes is disposed in the vessel and electrical energy is passed between electrode pairs through feed material and molten vitreous material in the vessel. Typically, the electrodes erode and wear in time, and this invention seeks to monitor and evaluate the length and condition of the electrodes. The present invention uses time domain reflectometry (TDR) methods to accurately measure the length of an electrode that is subject to wear and electrolytic decomposition due to the extreme conditions in which the electrode is required to operate. Specifically, TDR would be used to measure the length and effects of erosion of molybdenum electrodes used in Joule-heated vitrification melter. Of course, the inventive concept should not be limited to this preferred environment...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{modeling}} has {{the capability}} to provide valuable information allowing clinicians to better classify patients and aid in surgical planning. Modeling is advantageous for being non-invasive, and also allows for quantification of values not easily obtained from physical measurements. Hemodynamics are heavily dependent on vessel geometry, which varies greatly from patient to patient. For this reason, clinically relevant approaches must perform these simulations on patient-specific geometry. Geometry is acquired from various imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and ultrasound. The typical approach for generating a computational model requires construction of a triangulated surface mesh for use with finite volume or finite element solvers. Surface mesh construction {{can result in a}} loss of anatomical features and often requires a skilled user to execute manual steps in 3 rd party software. An alternative to this method is to use a Cartesian grid solver to conduct the fluid simulation. Cartesian grid solvers do not require a surface mesh. They can use the implicit geometry representation created during the image segmentation process, but they are constrained to a cuboidal domain. Since patient-specific geometry usually deviate from the orthogonal directions of a cuboidal domain, flow extensions are often implemented. Flow extensions are created via a skilled user and 3 rd party software, rendering the Cartesian grid solver approach no more clinically useful than the triangulated surface mesh approach. This work presents an alternative to flow extensions by developing a method of applying <b>vessel</b> inlet and <b>outlet</b> boundary conditions to regions inside the Cartesian domain...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years, the {{performance}} {{potential of the}} conventional simulated moving bed (SMB) process [1], typically based on four distinct zones, has been enhanced by dynamically varying otherwise constant operating conditions during the separation, leading {{to a number of}} derived processes like VariCol [2] or ModiCon [3]. Recently, a novel operating mode was presented that utilizes a combination of fractionation and internal feed-back to increase process performance [4]. This fractionation and Feed-back SMB mode is based on sub-dividing each switching time into distinct phases for one outlet and the feed inlet. Within the production phase, purity requirements are met in both outlet streams and they are collected as product fractions. For the remainder of the switching time, the recycle phase, product collection is stopped for one of the two streams, as a given purity threshold is crossed, and this fraction is collected in a buffer <b>vessel.</b> The second <b>outlet</b> stream, yielding the desired product quality over the complete cycle, is collected permanently. This approach allows for more productive operating conditions, as the purity requirements only have to be met within the production phase, while still meeting purity requirements. Similarly, two phases can be defined at the feed inlet: during the feed-back phase, the content of the buffer vessel fed into the SMB system, while {{for the remainder of the}} cycle time, the initial feed mixture is used. This set-up effectively minimizes the loss of product that would occur if only a fractionation was implemented. In this poster, two alternative implementation forms of this process, extract or raffinate fractionation and recycle, will be compared regarding their potential to solve a given separation problem. For evaluation of performance, an adapted form of the well-known m II -m III -diagram as well as a Pareto analysis will be used. The latter is based on two goal functions, which reflect the need for separation processes that are productive and at the same time avoid losing valuable products, while yielding a given purity. This comparison will be conducted by means of an extensive simulation study for both linear and non-linear isotherms. [1] D. B. Broughton, C. G.
