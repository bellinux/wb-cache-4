The study had the following objectives, namely (1) to investigate the prevalence of <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> on construction projects; (2) to determine the cost impact of variation orders; (3) to examine to what extent <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> added value to construction projects; (4) to determine whether the activities associated with <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> may be regarded as waste; (5) to identify the predominant origin agent as well as the causes of variation orders; and (6) to establish {{the nature and extent of}} the impact of <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> on overall project performance. Literature relative to the research area was extensively reviewed. The data gathering approaches included an exploratory study on costs of <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> on two construction projects, interviews with three top management personnel in construction contracting companies, the audit of site instructions with regard to waste and their value-addedness and self-administered questionnaires. A purposive sampling method was followed to identify participants into the study. The audit of site instructions revealed that most <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> were beneficial. However, 14 % of site instructions had waste associated with them. It was possible to quantify apparent waste associated with <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> by means of an ‘origin-cause matrix’ designed for that purpose. Problematic situations arising from the occurrence of <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> included discrepancies between the claimed and certified amounts. <b>Variation</b> <b>orders</b> impacted project performance with regard to cost and time overruns and disputes between parties to the contract. Most <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> involved additional works. The complexity of works was the most predominant factor influencing the occurrence of <b>variation</b> <b>orders.</b> The reduction of the occurrence of <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> was traced back to the pre-contract stage given that the most predominant origin agent of <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> was the client and then due to an unclear brief of works to be executed. Suggestions regarding the reduction of <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> include (1) adequate planning in advance is required by all involved parties before works start on site, (2) consultants should do a thorough concluding design and working drawings and contract documents should be complete at tender stage, (3) clients should provide clear brief, (4) enhance communication and all parties should be proactive at all times, (5) works should be supervised with an experienced and dedicated supervisor and (6) consultant should ensure that the design/specifications fall within the approved budget and the budget team should be appointed and participate during the design phase. The study suggests further investigation regarding the development of a more equitable basis of valuation of cost recovery which was beyond the scope of this research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The complexity, uncertainty, long-duration and the {{involvement}} of the sequential tasks and relationships of participants in/of the construction projects render this category of projects prone to variations along their progress. Variations create extra work, time, and money for the construction projects and they vary from one project to another. This paper investigates the impacts of <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> on public sector projects in South Africa. To achieve the objectives of the study, a critical review of literature was done coupled with questionnaire survey to collect information on possible impacts of variations on the public projects in SA. Through the review of literature 7 major possible impacts of <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> were identified which provided the basis for the formulation of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to professionals who work for companies that undertake public construction projects in South Africa. Targeted number of respondents was 50; however a total number of 70 questionnaires were sent out {{to make up for the}} cases were respondents did not return questionnaires. Overall, 50 questionnaires were returned and after a careful examination of the received questionnaires only 39 were usable. These formed the basis of the analysis for the study, since it accounts for 78 % of the initial sample. Findings revealed that <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> have major impact on i) time overruns, ii) cost overruns, iii) quality standard enhanced, iv) disputes amongst parties to the contract, and v) productivity degradation, iv) complaints of one or more parties to the contract. It was further noted from the results that <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> rarely affected health and safety aspect of the public construction projects since all the factors relating to health and safety were the lowest ranked; health and safety degradation, additional health and safety officials, additional health and safety equipment. However, this results are in disagreement with the results on the critical determinants of <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> on SA public sector construction projects because health and safety conditions was ranked the highest reason for <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> under other related reasons for <b>variation</b> <b>orders.</b> What these findings mean is that safety considerations may be the reason to cause <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> but <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> do not affect health and safety on the construction project...|$|R

Aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of procurement related factors of procurement selection criteria, tendering methods and <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> on project performance. Purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of procurement related factors on project performance. Snowballing sampling technique was used in selecting forty (40) construction organizations in Lagos metropolitan city that participated in the study and thirty-one (31) responses were secured from Architects, Builders, Engineers and Quantity Surveyors. Results of the study indicate that procurement selection criteria of cost, time, quality, project characteristics and external environmental factors have effects on project performance. Competitive, open and selective tendering methods have high impacts on project performance. No significant difference was found between the impacts of tendering methods on project performance. <b>Variation</b> <b>orders</b> impact project performance with time, cost overruns and disputes and it have effects on project performance. Conclusions are that procurement selection criteria, tendering methods and <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> have impacts on project performance. Cost, time, quality related factors, tendering methods and <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> strongly affect project performance. Recommendations to clients, stakeholders, practitioners and consultants are on the onset to consider tendering methods, use selective, open and competitive tendering approaches and discourage excessive <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> during construction. Policy makers in government, clients, and private developers into housing projects should give adequate attention for selecting appropriate procurement and tendering methods for better management of future projects in Nigeria and other developing countries...|$|R

Hence the <b>variations</b> <b>orders</b> right from inception to completion is assumed great importance in the construction industry. Further, in many instances, it is most cost effective to complete the project within minimum number of <b>variation</b> <b>orders.</b> Most of road construction projects in Sri Lanka experienced large number of <b>variation</b> <b>orders.</b> The client has to spent more than what he planned in most of times. Sometimes, disputes, unnecessary delays occur due to variations. This study attempt to reveal the Trends of Causes for Variation Ordersin Road Construction Projects in Sri Lanka, and how <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> are managed. The emphasis here was limited to study the Road Construction Professionals’ point of view. The main concern of this study to find the causes and rank them using number of occurrence method and percentage vary method, for <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> in road construction projects in selected case studies. The other focusing areas were find the causes for <b>variation</b> <b>orders</b> and rank them using a questionnaire survey and international study in order to compare the trends of causes from each method of ranking. The preliminary data were collected through a literature review, case study analysis which focused 11 road construction projects which were completed by Asian Development Bank Division, RDA and questionnaire survey targeted the Road Construction Professionals in Sri Lanka. The study found that the trends of causes in local context is differ than international context. According to the questionnaire survey, Poor Estimation was the most significant factor of trends of cause. The rank of Unforeseen Site Conditions, Political pressure during construction stage, Poor Investigation and Client-Initiated Variations have got the rank 3 to 5 respectively. According to the number of occurrence of the case study survey Poor Estimation is the most significant factor.

The decision to increase the length of the coaches to 26 m from the 23 m of the Mark 4 was dictated by reduced maintenance costs following British Rail studies which indicated that such a length was feasible within the UK loading gauge. Indeed, during 1987 British Rail had considered increasing the length of the Mark 4 to 25.5 m (with 18.13m bogie centres) but the in-service date of 1989 and complexity of changing the design to suit caused the <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> to be shelved.|$|E

Malaysia as a developing country is overgrown with various type of construction project here and there and the occurence of <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> in each of this project is inevitable. So, the objective of this thesis is to identify the causes of <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> in construction project, to investigate the impact of variation orders and to determine the proactive measure regarding the existence of the <b>variation</b> <b>order.</b> The scope of the study is on any ongoing construction projects in Kuantan area to identify the <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> that may occurs in each and every projects. In order to achieved the objective stated, a questionnaire is distributed to three parties involve in the construction area; the client, consultant and contractor. Questionnaire is given according to how many projects that is still progressing handled by them. The questionnaire consists of demographic, causes of <b>variation</b> <b>order,</b> effects of <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> and the possible solution on how to avoid <b>variation</b> <b>order.</b> After 100 questionnaire is distributed and the result is tabulated, it is known that the main cause of <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> is the change of plan or scope is the main reason why <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> occurs in those construction project. It is known that the main effect of the occurence of <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> is the increase in the project cost. There will be an overrun in the cost of the project.

It is relatively difficult to deliver a project without any variation orders, which are most likely to occur at the design stage. Variation orders are complex in nature, as they involve the key stakeholders, together with a lot of information that needs to be requested, sent, checked, corrected, approved, clarified, transmitted or submitted, among many other processe. This research aims to develop a model that better manages variation orders in Saudi public construction projects in the design stage by engaging the stakeholders effectively in the process of the <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> management, to save the management time for the variation, improve the communication and relationships among stakeholders and avoid disputes and conflicts. The methodology used to achieve the research aim, influenced by the pragmatic views of the researcher, combined several methods. A series of exploratory interviews investigated the current practice of <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> management in Saudi public construction projects, with its strengths and weaknesses. Then, a questionnaire survey measured the level of power and interest of the different stakeholders in order to develop a model for best practice. Finally, focus group sessions validated the performance and concept of the developed model. The findings indicate that there are currently no formalised approaches to the management of variation orders at the design stage. In addition, there is a general lack of knowledge about managing variation orders. However, the conceptual model of common practice, based on these responses, can be divided into six main stages: identifying the <b>variation</b> <b>order,</b> analysing and evaluating variation orders, estimation, approval, implementation and documentation. Furthermore, the findings reveal a need to develop an appropriate <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> management system in the Saudi construction industry, due to the present lack of stakeholder engagement.

40|$|In this {{complicated}} industry, variation {{orders are}} {{part and parcel}} in construction contract. It is likely impossible not to have changes in completing the project either to the plans or the construction process itself. Due to its complexity in nature, these changes are inevitable in any construction project. Most construction contracts commonly include variations clauses to enable the employer’s design team to vary the design and specification, including in the Lump Sum type of contract. The main criticism of the traditional Lump Sum Contract has been that, it invites a confrontational approach over disputes arising out of contract variations. Furthermore, changes in Lump Sum Contract are difficult to quantify and the owner might reject the change order request. Thus, variation issues often give rise to argument, debate and litigation. Hence, {{the objective of this}} study is to identify the issues regarding <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> in Lump Sum Contract. The scope of the study is from the legal cases reported in Lexis Malaysia in relation to variations and Lump Sum Contract. The cases were analysed in order to achieve the objective of this project report. From the cases, few legal issues of ‘variation orders in Lump Sum Contract’ were found. The cases then be categorized under the issues discovered earlier in the literature review. From the analysis, it can be summarized that, the most common issue contended in court is on the validity of variation claims. The second is on the establishment of the very fact of a variation itself, while the third are, on the status of “cardinal” changes, and, “the contractual” and “common law position”. Last but not least, the issues on the measurement of varied work and valuation of variation orders, have also been identified in one case each respectively. Therefore, by conducting this research, the judgment made by the court on issues pertaining to <b>variation</b> <b>order</b> can be used as a reference to establish a guideline for the people in the industry so that the same problem will not be repeated in future project in Lump Sum Contract.
