In a study, women rated the scent of T-shirts, worn over two nights by men, as more pleasant when smelling those of MHC-dissimilar men. It has also been found that women were reminded more of current or prior partners when smelling odors from men whose MHC was dissimilar to that of the smeller. A study of married couples found that MHC haplotypes differed between spouses more than chance expectations.

50|$|In {{electrospray}} ionization, {{a liquid}} is pushed {{through a very}} small, charged and usually metal, capillary. This liquid contains the substance to be studied, the analyte, dissolved in {{a large amount of}} solvent, which is usually much more volatile than the analyte. <b>Volatile</b> <b>acids,</b> bases or buffers are often added to this solution too. The analyte exists as an ion in solution either in its anion or cation form. Because like charges repel, the liquid pushes itself out of the capillary and forms an aerosol, a mist of small droplets about 10 &mu;m across. The aerosol is at least partially produced by a process involving the formation of a Taylor cone and a jet from the tip of this cone. An uncharged carrier gas such as nitrogen is sometimes used to help nebulize the liquid and to help evaporate the neutral solvent in the droplets. As the solvent evaporates, the analyte molecules are forced closer together, repel each other and break up the droplets. This process is called Coulombic fission because it is driven by repulsive Coulombic forces between charged molecules. The process repeats until the analyte is free of solvent and is a bare ion. The ions observed are created by the addition of a proton (a hydrogen ion) and denoted {M}+H+, or of another cation such as sodium ion, {M}+Na+, or the removal of a proton, {M}-H^-. Multiply charged ions such as {M}+2H^2+ are often observed. For large macromolecules, there can be many charge states, occurring with different frequencies; the charge can be as great as {M}+25H^{25+}, for example.|$|E

The individual enzymes of the dihydrolase system were all demonstrated in extracts of cells, spores, and germinated spores. There was no liberation of urea from l-arginine, so no functional arginase enzyme is present, but there was some transamidinase activity in cell extracts. l-Ornithine was degraded at a significant rate by cells grown in an l-ornithine-supplemented medium; it was partially decarboxylated to putrescine and partially fermented to NH 3, CO 2, <b>volatile</b> <b>acids,</b> and δ-aminovaleric acid. Results from the fermentation of l-ornithine-C 14, - 1 -C 14, and - 2 -C 14 demonstrated that essentially all of the CO 2 was derived from carbon 1, and <b>volatile</b> <b>acids</b> from carbons 2 to 5.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{volatile}} fatty acids are among the chief non-gaseous products of bacterial breakdown of carbohydrate in the rumen; however, {{in spite of the fact}} that the ruminant apparently subsists to a large extent upon the carbohydrates which are so broken down, investigators have been loath to admit the value of these to the animal. Instead, therefore, of following up the subsequent fate of the <b>volatile</b> <b>acids</b> they have concentrated more upon searching for unsuspected bacterial products which might make possible an explanation of ruminant carbohydrate metabolism more in line with the better known processes of absorption of sugars in non-ruminant animals. Observations of the fate of the <b>volatile</b> <b>acids</b> have been few. Wilsing (1885) calculated, on the basis of in vitro experiments, that 157 g. of <b>volatile</b> <b>acids</b> would be produced by rumen fermentation from 1 - 5 kg. of hay which he fed to a goat. Of this only 2 - 5 g. was excreted in the urine and faeces.

They suggested that absorption of the acids in question from the rumen must occur. It has now been possible to show that <b>volatile</b> <b>acids</b> are jn fact absorbed into the blood coming from the rumen, that this organ, together with the reticulum, omasum and caecum are the only parts of the alimentary tract from which any considerable absorption occurs and that the amount of volatile acid absorbed is sufficient to supply an appreciable part of the energy require-ments of the animal...|$|E

This inhibitory concentration was attained when the animals were ca. 19 days of age. When mixtures of <b>volatile</b> fatty <b>acids</b> were prepared at concentrations equal to those present in the ceca of hamsters, there was a direct correlation between the in vitro inhibitory activity of the <b>volatile</b> fatty <b>acids</b> and the susceptibility of hamsters 4 days of age or older to C. difficile intestinal colonization.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} demand {{for the production of}} biodiesel and, consequently, there will be an increasing need to treat wastewaters resulting from the production process of this biofuel. The main objective of this work was, therefore, to investigate the effect of applied volumetric organic load (AVOL) on the efficiency, stability, and methane production of an anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor applied to the treatment of effluent from biodiesel production. As inert support, polyurethane foam cubes were used in the reactor and mixing was accomplished by recirculating the liquid phase. Increase in AVOL resulted in a drop in organic matter removal efficiency and increase in total <b>volatile</b> <b>acids</b> in the effluent. AVOLs of 1. 5, 3. 0, 4. 5 and 6. 0 g COD L(- 1) day(- 1) resulted in removal efficiencies of 92 %, 81 %, 67 %, and 50 %, for effluent filtered samples, and 91 %, 80 %, 63 %, and 47 %, for non-filtered samples, respectively, whereas total <b>volatile</b> <b>acids</b> concentrations in the effluent amounted to 42, 145, 386 and 729 mg HAc L(- 1), respectively. Moreover, on increasing AVOL from 1. 5 to 4. 5 g COD L(- 1) day(- 1) methane production increased from 29. 5 to 55. 5 N mL CH(4) g COD(- 1). However, this production dropped to 36. 0 N mL CH(4) g COD(- 1) when AVOL was increased to 6. 0 g COD L(- 1) day(- 1), likely due to the higher concentration of <b>volatile</b> <b>acids</b> in the reactor. Despite the higher concentration of <b>volatile</b> <b>acids</b> at the highest AVOL, alkalinity supplementation to the influent, in the form of sodium bicarbonate, at a ratio of 0. 5 - 1. 3 g NaHCO(3) g COD (fed) (- 1), was sufficient to maintain the pH near neutral and guarantee process stability during reactor operation.

Microbial ecological relationships were deduced by enumerating coliforms, total bacteria other than anaerobes [Tryptone Glucose Extract (TGE) agar], methane formers such as Methanobacterium formicicum, sulfate reducers, purple sulfur bacteria, and algae. Finally, two strains of purple sulfur bacteria were characterized. Two populations, purple sulfur bacteria and total bacteria (TGE agar), reached maximal concentrations in the warmest part of the 1967 summer. Purple sulfur bacteria reached maximal numbers as concentrations of sulfide and <b>volatile</b> <b>acids</b> were depleted, whereas carbohydrates and alkalinity remained unchanged.

The increase of algae in the late summer of 1967 may have been related to the low organic content of the lagoon during this period. Although lagoon pH (7. 7 to 8. 2) was favorable for purple sulfur bacterial growth, temperatures and sulfides were not optimal in the lagoon for these organisms.
