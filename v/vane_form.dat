Based on the spacing of the six preserved knobs in this specimen, the authors suggested that Velociraptor bore 14 secondaries (wing feathers stemming from the forearm), compared with 12 or more in Archaeopteryx, 18 in Microraptor, and 10 in Rahonavis. This type of variation in the number of wing feathers between closely related species, the authors asserted, is to be expected, given similar variation among modern birds.|$|R
50|$|The vane cell {{feed system}} mainly {{consists}} of a rigid pump housing with attached side plate that is fixed to the pivoting hopper, and a removable rotor with pump vanes and cam. Depending on the machine size there are various different sizes of vane cell feed systems with parts with appropriate dimensions. The hopper can be swivelled to clean and dismantle surfaces and parts that {{come into contact with}} filling product. The driven rotor with an appropriate number of slots is located in the pump housing, in which pump <b>vanes</b> <b>form</b> cells with defined volumes when the machine is closed, supported by the cam. Induced by the rotor movement when the machine is started, the cells move {{in the direction of the}} vane cell feed system outlet and therefore ensure that a defined product flow is achieved. The weight accuracy of a feed system is partially dependent upon the production precision of the parts and their degree of wear.|$|R
50|$|On larger diesel {{generators}} {{found in}} large shore installations and especially on ships, a pneumatic starting gear is used. The air motor is normally powered by compressed air at pressures of 10-30 bar. The air motor {{is made up}} of a center drum {{about the size of a}} soup can with four or more slots cut into it to allow for the vanes to be placed radially on the drum to form chambers around the drum. The drum is offset inside a round casing so that the inlet air for starting is admitted at the area where the drum and <b>vanes</b> <b>form</b> a small chamber compared to the others. The compressed air can only expand by rotating the drum, which allows the small chamber to become larger and puts another one of the cambers in the air inlet. The air motor spins much too fast to be used directly on the flywheel of the engine; instead a large gearing reduction, such as a planetary gear, is used to lower the output speed. A Bendix gear is used to engage the flywheel.|$|R
50|$|To rotate, a light mill {{does not}} have to be coated with {{different}} colors across each vane. In 2009, researchers at the University of Texas, Austin created a monocolored light mill which has four curved vanes; each <b>vane</b> <b>forms</b> a convex and a concave surface. The light mill is uniformly coated by gold nanocrystals, which are a strong light absorber. Upon exposure, due to geometric effect, the convex side of the vane receives more photon energy than the concave side does, and subsequently the gas molecules receive more heat from the convex side than from the concave side. At rough vacuum, this asymmetric heating effect generates a net gas movement across each vane, from the concave side to the convex side, as shown by the researchers' Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) modeling. The gas movement causes the light mill to rotate with the concave side moving forward, due to Newton's Third Law.This monocolored design promotes the fabrication of micrometer- or nanometer- scaled light mills, as it is difficult to pattern materials of distinct optical properties within a very narrow, three-dimensional space.|$|R

40|$|The growing global {{call for}} reduced {{emissions}} and fuel consumption {{together with the}} market call for engines with higher power density and application-oriented torque curves can be met using turbochargers with variable geometry turbines (VGT). The second generation of VGT turbochargers is currently being developed and is starting {{to appear on the}} market. The most common solution is using of pivoted <b>vanes</b> <b>forming</b> a variable nozzle turbine (VNT). The adaptation of VGT turbochargers imposes new and different demands {{when it comes to the}} adaptation to the engine system as compared with conventional turbochargers. A conventional turbocharger has a fixed operating point at every combination of speed and load. The operating line is then given by the system into which the turbocharger is incorporated. In the case of a VNT, the operating line can be determined within certain limits by different guide vane openings. Using a VNT unit, it is possible to control the air to fuel ratio and turbocharger pressure conditions for a fixed operation point within certain limits. When integrated with the engine fuel control system, the new technology offers new opportunities to improve starting capabilities, steady state torque, transient response and change the soot/NOx relation over the load range. There is also a real potential to reduce the specific fuel consumption. In this work a VNT system was tested under both steady state and transient conditions. The transient test includes load acceptance and acceleration in an engine test cell. The latter follows the propeller law and includes acceleration from idling and from low cruising load. A test in a marine craft was performed as well. The aim of this test was to evaluate and improve the electronic control system for the turbocharger during transient operation. The influence of vane clearance and the position of the vanes on turbine performance under different conditions are evaluated. The main aim and purpose of the work is to provide a comprehensive study of the interaction between the engine and the improved charging system in order to visualise and summarise the benefits of the VNT system. Another aim is to gain a deeper understanding of VNT-engine interaction for the purpose of developing a control system...|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} a new {{design of the}} primary pump to run in powerful units (more than 1 GW) of power plants. The new construction has some advantages such as compactness, theoretical lack of radial and axial forces, and high efficiency {{in a wide range}} of flow. The abovementioned advantages can be possible owing to applying an innovative shape of the pump flow path. An impeller with the guide <b>vanes</b> <b>forms</b> the three-row single stage in the each row axial double entry blade system. The inlet and outlet parts have a shape of the involute that can ensure (according to calculated data) the efficiency and stability {{in a wide range of}} flow because of a lack of the spiral parts. The results of numerical calculations of the pump working flow theoretically confirm that demanding parameters of the pump (H= 286 m; Q= 1, 15 m 3 /s) can be obtained with competitive efficiency. To verify the proposed advantages of the construction, there was decision made to conduct the real physical experiment. For this purpose the small model of a real pump was designed with parameters H= 14 m, Q= 13 l/s. Construction of the pump model has a cartridge conception. In addition, there is a possibility for quick replacement of the some parts of the blade system in case of operational development of the pump. In order to obtain hydraulic characteristics of the pump to say nothing of the electromotor the torque gauge coupling is used. Numerical calculations for the pump model were also performed which confirm the operability. For manufacturing of the blade system the new perspective technology is applied. The main hydraulic components (impellers and guide vanes) are made of ABS plastic by using 3 D-printer. According to this technology parts are made layer by layer by means of welded plastic filament. Using this method the satisfactory tolerance (approximately ± 0, 3 mm) of the parts was obtained. At that moment, it is possible to create the parts with the maximum size no higher than 150 mm. Immersing finished parts in acetone vapor enable us to increase the surface strength and reduce roughness. At this stage of the work some plastic parts are ready for assembling operation. Now manufacturing of other plastic parts of the blade system is under way along with pre-production of the rotor and stator components...|$|R

40|$|The {{self-priming}} {{process of}} self-priming pump is gas-liquid two-phase flow process with complex internal transient flow. The effect of gas-liquid mixing and separating performances {{will play a}} crucial role during self-priming process. In order to study the self-priming process and improve the self-priming performance, the model named JETST- 100 was selected. Based on Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase flow model, transient numerical simulation of the gas-liquid mixing and separating phenomena on the pump chamber was carried out by using CFX software. The distributions of velocity vector, contours of gas volume fraction and liquid velocity of the pump or jet aerator, and the change of the gas volume fraction by monitoring points on the jet aerator were obtained. Test and simulation results show that the gas-liquid two-phase flow from the guide <b>vane</b> will <b>form</b> a larger velocity circulation, so that the gas-liquid separation is not sufficient. And the volume fraction of liquid inside pump chamber decrease with a large amount of water enters the outlet pipe. It is found that adding the baffle plate can prevent the generation of circulation on guide vane back, the gas-phase volume fraction of jet aerator inlet and nozzle outlet decreases, improve the self-priming performance of the pump...|$|R

Manipulation of vorticity concentrations and advection are exploited in order to modify and optimize the available mechanical energy within the induced flow field and, therefore, the extractable power. Finally, anchored vortices are formed in the natural environment within a scaled field prototype of the flow enclosure using only insolation as the source of buoyancy.

Mr. Henson's scheme (which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science,) was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane, started from an eminence by an extrinsic force, applied and continued by the revolution of impinging <b>vanes,</b> in <b>form</b> and number resembling the vanes of a windmill. But, in all the experiments made with models at the Adelaide Gallery, {{it was found that the}} operation of these fans not only did not propel the machine, but actually impeded its flight. The only propelling force it ever exhibited, was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane; and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest, than when they were in motion--a fact which sufficiently demonstrates their inutility; and in the absence of the propelling, which was also the sustaining power, the whole fabric would necessarily descend. This consideration led Sir George Cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of support--in a word, to a balloon; the idea, however, being novel, or original, with Sir George, only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice. He exhibited a model of his invention at the Polytechnic Institution. The propelling principle, or power, was here, also, applied to interrupted surfaces, or vanes, put in revolution. These vanes were four in number, but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon, or in aiding its ascending power. The whole project was thus a complete failure.|$|R
