500|$|The {{detected}} <b>voltage</b> <b>signal</b> {{output of}} the Schottky barrier diodes typically used in microwave detectors have a square law relationship to the power being measured and meters are calibrated accordingly. [...] However, as the power increases, the diode deviates significantly from a square law and remains accurate up to an output voltage of only around [...] [...] This can be improved a little by adding a load resistor to the detector output, but this also has the undesirable effect of decreasing sensitivity. [...] Another technique {{is to reduce the}} range of power being measured (so that it is brought within the square law range of the detector) by measuring at a point other than a maximum. [...] The maximum is then calculated from the known mathematical shape of the standing wave pattern. [...] This has the objection that it adds significantly to the labour required to make the measurements, as does the technique of precisely calibrating the detector and adjusting the readings on the meter according to a calibration chart.|$|E

2500|$|The {{voltage pulse}} {{produced}} by the detector (or by the photomultiplier in a scintillation counter) is shaped by a multichannel analyzer (MCA). The multichannel analyzer takes the very small <b>voltage</b> <b>signal</b> {{produced by the}} detector, reshapes it into a Gaussian or trapezoidal shape, and converts that signal into a digital signal. In some systems, the analog-to-digital conversion is performed before the peak is reshaped. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) also sorts the pulses by their height. ADCs have specific numbers of [...] "bins" [...] into which the pulses can be sorted; these bins represent the channels in the spectrum. The number of channels can be changed in most modern gamma spectroscopy systems by modifying software or hardware settings. The number of channels is typically a power of two; common values include 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, or 16384 channels. The choice of number of channels depends on {{the resolution of the}} system and the energy range being studied.|$|E

40|$|A new two-phase, {{independent}} control strategy for three-phase three-wire static inverters to reduce unbalance in output voltage is proposed. The three-phase <b>voltage</b> and current <b>signals</b> are processed by the ideal Clarke transform block to yield two single-phase signals, which contain information regarding unbalance and harmonics {{which may be}} present in the three-phase signals. If the two single-phase <b>voltage</b> <b>signals</b> could be controlled so that they become equal in magnitude with a phase shift of 90 ° (ideal alpha beta signals), then the corresponding terminal three-phase <b>voltage</b> <b>signals</b> would become balanced. Singlephase observers are employed to control the fundamental components in the two identical d-q frames created. Simultaneously, when the harmonics are eliminated in the two single-phase channels, the corresponding three-phase <b>voltage</b> <b>signals</b> would become distortion free. Feed-forward compensation can be carried out using the equivalent series-impedance parameters, estimated on-line using a simple identification algorithm. This procedure is not sensitive to frequency and can take care of the voltage drop in the distribution transformer.
