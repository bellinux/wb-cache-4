40|$|PURPOSE: Femoral {{osteotomy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely performed reconstructive operations in pediatric orthopedic surgery. Many implants for fixation have been used, but so far there is no literature about the application and outcome of the LCP 140 ° Pediatric Hip Plate for proximal femoral <b>valgisation</b> in children. METHODS: Data of patients with a <b>valgisation</b> of the proximal femur using the LCP 140 ° Pediatric Hip Plate between February 2011 and July 2012 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: We included 10 patients (11 hips) with a mean follow-up of 15. 3  ±  6. 3  months (range 5. 6 - 23  months). The mean age was 9. 6  ±  1. 2  years (range 7. 3 - 11. 8  years) with a mean hospital stay of 5. 2  ±  1. 7  days (range 3 - 9  days). Callus formation was observed in all cases at 6  weeks postoperative control and consolidation was shown after a mean time of 14. 1  ±  2. 3  weeks (range 12. 1 - 19. 1  weeks). There was no delayed union or any case of non-union in our series. The stability of the operative reduction including the corrected neck-shaft angle (mean 19 ° ±  7. 9 °; range 10. 5 °- 38. 5 °) was maintained during the follow-up period. No cases of recurrence (varisation) or complications requiring further treatment or revision were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the 140 ° LCP Pediatric Hip Plate was shown to be safe and applicable in the clinical setting with good results. We therefore consider this device to be valuable for the correction of pathologic varus conditions of the proximal femur in children...|$|E
30|$|Progressive hip {{subluxation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common orthopaedic problems in patients with cerebral palsy (CP) [1]. The incidence ranges from 2.6 % to 75  % [2], and the risk of hip displacement is directly related to patient functional status [1]. Hip dislocation is caused by muscle imbalance, including spasticity of hip adductors and flexors and weakness of hip extensors and abductors, leading to osseous deformity with increased femoral anteversion, femoral neck <b>valgisation,</b> acetabular dysplasia and pelvic obliquity. Spastic hip displacement may be associated with complications such as difficulty with perineal care, poor sitting tolerance, and pain [3, 4]. Botulinum toxin injections and soft-tissue lengthening can be used in young patients in order to delay operative bony procedures [3, 4]. In older patients, one-stage reconstruction procedures associating femoral varus derotation and shortening osteotomy (VDRSO) and pelvic osteotomy are considered to be the most appropriate treatment [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In addition, some authors have advocated associating open reduction and capsulorrhaphy in case of hip dislocation [2, 3, 4, 5] despite the risk of femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{proximal}} femoral osteotomies (PFO) {{in children}} is to restore normal anatomy and optimal joint congruency to prevent medium and long-terms degenerative {{deterioration of the}} hip. They {{play an important role}} in the treatment of neurological subluxations or dislocations of the hip. Advances in modern imaging and surgical techniques have improved understanding of the anatomical factors associated with a number of disorders of the growing hip and their sequelae. The indications for isolated PFO or associated with other intra- or extraarticular procedures have become more rational and better adapted to the various architectural defects and the femoroacetabular impingements. Two types of osteotomies are described: intertrochanteric osteotomies (varus and valgus correction, <b>valgisation,</b> flexion, extension), and osteotomies of the greater trochanter, either simple or double with lengthening of the femoral neck. Primary stability of the osteosynthesis is the major problem, as it is often affected by osteopenia. The development of new implants (LCP plate) avoids this inconvenience, resulting in geometrically precise osteotomies and a more stable fixation. Even when it is correctly performed, articular congruence is not always managed by PFO alone, it is sometimes necessary to associate acetabular procedures. PublishedN/...|$|E
