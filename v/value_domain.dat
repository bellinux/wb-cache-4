5000|$|The {{different}} possible {{representations of}} a data element concept are then described {{with the use}} of one or more data elements. Differences in representation may be a result of the use of synonyms or different value domains in different data sets in a data holding. A <b>value</b> <b>domain</b> is the permitted range of values for a characteristic of an object class. An example of a <b>value</b> <b>domain</b> for [...] "sex of person" [...] is [...] "M = Male, F = Female, U = Unknown". The letters M, F and U are then the permitted values of sex of person in a particular data set.|$|E
30|$|Although the {{findings}} of this study help to assure extensive evidence on the relationship between universalism <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> and cognitive/affective aspects of subjective well-being, the insignificant relationship between other personal values with subjective well-being in this study has to be taken into consideration. However, according to Bobowik et al. (2011), values deserve special attention and consideration in research into well-being, because personal growth-related values can indeed make us happier. Thus, Bobowik and colleagues have suggested that in order to examine the relationship in more detail, it may be advisable to include measurements of eudemonic well-being. The eudemonic perspective of well-being may be more strongly associated with <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> (Bobowik et al. 2011). Future research should examine this issue in order to shed more light on the relationship between personal <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> and subjective well-being in international education.|$|R

50|$|A {{representation}} term is a word, or {{a combination}} of words, that semantically represent the data type (<b>value</b> <b>domain)</b> of a data element. A representation term is commonly referred to as a class word by those familiar with data dictionaries. ISO/IEC 11179-5:2005 defines representation term as a designation of an instance of a representation class As used in ISO/IEC 11179, the representation term is that part of a data element name that provides a semantic pointer to the underlying data type. A Representation class is a class of representations. This representation class provides a way to classify or group data elements.|$|E

This allows researchers to see where an individual’s personal interests and values lie.

40|$|Medical {{forms are}} very heterogeneous: on a European scale there are {{thousands}} of data items in several hundred different systems. To enable data exchange for clinical care and research purposes {{there is a need to}} develop interoperable documentation systems with harmonized forms for data capture. A prerequisite in this harmonization process is comparison of forms. So far – to our knowledge – an automated method for comparison of medical forms is not available. A form contains a list of data items with corresponding medical concepts. An automatic comparison needs data types, item names and especially item with these unique concept codes from medical terminologies. The scope of the proposed method is a comparison of these items by comparing their concept codes (coded in UMLS). Each data item is represented by item name, concept code and <b>value</b> <b>domain.</b> Two items are called identical, if item name, concept code and <b>value</b> <b>domain</b> are the same. Two items are called matching, if only concept code and <b>value</b> <b>domain</b> are the same. Two items are called similar, if their concept codes are the same, but the value domains are different. Based on these definitions an open-source implementation for automated comparison of medical forms in ODM format with UMLS-based semantic annotations was developed.
