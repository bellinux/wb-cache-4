40|$|The South African Revenue Service {{has since}} 2009 {{introduced}} “reference pricing” {{as a tool}} to detect undervaluation of customs values of imported clothing and textiles. The term “reference pricing” is not defined in the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 which is the legislation that governs the importation of goods into the Republic of South Africa. The mandate of the South African Revenue Service, amongst others, is to facilitate legitimate trade. By applying the reference pricing guidelines the South African Revenue Service will target all importers who declare customs values which are less than the reference price for a targeted tariff heading associated with an item of clothing or textile. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 is clear in that the transaction value which is the price paid or payable for the imported goods shall be the <b>value</b> used <b>for</b> customs <b>duty</b> <b>purposes.</b> The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 also requires that the interpretation of the sections 65, 66 and 67 of the said Act shall be subject to the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Valuation Agreement). Part I of the Valuation Agreement deals with the rules for customs valuation. Article 17 of part 1 allows for customs administrations to satisfy themselves as to the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented for customs valuation purposes. The Technical Committee on Customs Valuation of the World Trade Organisation decided the following in so far as Article 17 of the aforesaid agreement is concerned: “ 1. When a declaration has been presented and where the customs administration has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of the particulars or of documents produced in support of this declaration, the customs administration may ask the importer to provide further explanation, including documents or other evidence, that the declared value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods, [...] ” It would appear that the South African Revenue Service is using reference prices {{as a tool to}} support its reason for doubting the truth or accuracy of the declared customs values. The indiscriminate use of reference pricing, it is submitted, affects legitimate trade adversely. This treatise provides an understanding of how the customs value should be determined in terms of the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 and the Valuation Agreement. It then provides a background to reference pricing and how reference pricing will be used to detect undervalued imports of clothing and textiles, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using reference pricing and a comparative analysis of the approach adopted by the Mexican Tax Administration Service in so far as the use of reference pricing is concerned. It was established that the reference price cannot replace the customs value of an imported clothing item as the customs value is based on the price actually paid or payable for it and not on some arbitrary or fictitious value. The reference price can only be used as a tool to identify importers that are possibly undervaluing the customs values. The disadvantages far outweigh the advantages of using reference pricing. The treatise further provides a background to the use of a valuation database as a risk assessment tool and compares this to the use of reference pricing. The use of reference pricing and its impact on trade facilitation is then discussed as well as whether the use of reference pricing is consistent with the risk management principles as discussed in the World Customs Organisation Risk Management Guide. It was established that the South African Revenue Service has not disclosed the basis of arriving at the reference price per tariff heading that it targets and the use of reference pricing is not sanctioned by any international guideline or agreement. It was also established that the use of reference pricing targets compliant importers unnecessarily and this practice goes against the principles of trade facilitation. The use of reference pricing can be used as a tool to detect undervalued imports of clothing but should not be used as a basis to stop every consignment of clothing simply because the customs value declared is less than the reference price. It should not be used as a stand-alone tool but rather enhanced further with the recommendations provided. In the final analysis, recommendations are provided which seek to enhance the reference pricing mechanism and to further identify and exclude compliant importers and limit the use of reference pricing to target non-compliant importers who undervalue the customs value of imported clothing and textile items...|$|R

40|$|The {{critical}} principle from Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Murry is that goodwill, as one indivisible item {{of personal}} property in a business, is separate from other property of that business, including property {{that may be}} its sources. However, goodwill is inseparable from the business itself; it cannot be dealt with independently of that business. While the House of Lords saw goodwill as having elements, the High Court of Australia took the view, more precisely, that goodwill has sources rather than elements. The sources of goodwill are those qualities of a business that generate the goodwill. Issues have arisen regarding the relationship between goodwill and land where revenue offices have endeavored to include the value of goodwill {{in the value of}} land on the sale of businesses for the purpose of assessing stamp duty. Since the decision in Murry, the courts have generally held that the value of site goodwill should not be included in land <b>for</b> <b>duty</b> <b>purposes,</b> consistent with the view of goodwill from that case. Other issues discussed are capital expenditure and goodwill, the CGT small business concessions, goodwill and the consolidation regime, goodwill as an active foreign business asset, and goodwill and GST. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary. [...] The {{basis for}} {{designing}} parachutes of R. & M. 862 * {{did not appear}} to be correct for parachutes with cords over the canopy. Moreover, the presence of these cords was essential in a practical design <b>for</b> heavy <b>duty</b> <b>purposes</b> and it was obvious from appearance that their presence produced a stress distribution considerably different from that of the earlier theory. This report investigates the distribution of stress in a parachute with cords over the canopy, particularly when the cords are kept shorter than the length of the fabric gore which is permitted to bulge out between the cords under the excess pressure of the air inside the parachute. An approximate theory of shape and of the distribution of stress is developed by making certain assumptions, particularly that the tension in the fabric in any axial section can be reduced to a negligible amount, and that the pressure difference all over the parachute can be regarded as uniform. On the basis of this theory a method of calculating the shape of a gore is developed and an example given. A brief statement is made on the degree to which a parachute so designed departs from the shape and maximum stress calculated. 1. Introduction. [...] A basis for designing parachutes is given in R. & M. 8623 but it is assumed that the canopy is a surface of revolution. The direct consequence of this assumption is that the cords over the canopy must be slack and cannot serve any useful purpose; in fact, the riggin...|$|R

However, in many applications the DC generated electricity by a PVG need to be converted to AC. Traditionally DC to AC inverters {{have been widely used}} for this purpose. In this paper, a different system is proposed in which a self excited induction generator (SEIG) driven by a permanent magnet DC motor (DCM) and powered from a PVG through a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) are used. A step-up chopper is utilized as an MPPT unit. The proposed system is modelled in time domain, and a detailed transient and steady-state analysis are presented.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{treatment}} of life insurance policies in deceased estates {{and the effect}} thereof on marriages in community of property {{is the cause of}} various problems for executors. In terms of section 3 (3) of the Estate Duty Act 45 of 1955 life insurance policies are deemed to be assets of the deceased. Consequently life insurance policies are reflected in the estate duty addendum of the deceased estate. Life insurance policies however are not always reflected in the liquidation account of the deceased estate as assets, notwithstanding the fact that life insurance policies are deemed to be assets <b>for</b> estate <b>duty</b> <b>purposes.</b> In this regard a distinction should be made between two situations: firstly where life insurance policies are reflected in the liquidation account of the insured estate and secondly where life insurance policies are not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured. For spouses married in community of property this creates a problem especially when you keep in mind that life insurance policies are in many instances a person's biggest monetary asset. When life insurance policies are reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has a claim on half of the policy proceeds. When life insurance policies are not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has no claim on the policy proceeds. The problem that arises in this regard {{is that there is no}} certainty as to what extent life insurance policies should be included in the calculation of estate duty, and how these policies must be reflected in the estate of the deceased. This uncertainty has been perpetuated by courts. This research will illustrate how the courts came to different conclusions where the facts were more or less similar. Master...|$|R
