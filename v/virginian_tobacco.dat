5000|$|Clara Brown {{was born}} into slavery near Fredericksburg, Virginia on January 1, 1800. [...] At a young age Clara and her mother were sold to Ambrose Smith, a <b>Virginian</b> <b>tobacco</b> farmer, {{and worked in the}} fields. She was then moved with the Smith family to Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|The Action at Osborne's (sometimes spelled Osburn's or Osborns), Virginia {{was a minor}} naval-land {{engagement}} on April 27, 1781, in the James River {{during the}} American Revolutionary War. The battle resulted in the near-complete destruction of the Virginia State Navy {{as well as a}} large stockpile of <b>Virginian</b> <b>tobacco</b> (in use as a currency at the time).|$|E
50|$|By the 1670s Glasgow was {{the main}} outlet for <b>Virginian</b> <b>tobacco,</b> in open {{defiance}} of English restrictions on colonial trade; in return the colony received Scottish manufactured goods, immigrants and ideas. In the 1670s and 1680s Presbyterian Dissenters fled persecution by the Royalist privy council in Edinburgh to settle in South Carolina and New Jersey, where they maintained their distinctive religious culture.|$|E
5|$|Virginia has a mixed health record, and {{is ranked}} as the 26th overall healthiest state {{according}} to the 2013 United Health Foundation's Health Rankings. Virginia also ranks 21st among {{the states in the}} rate of premature deaths, 6,816 per 100,000. In 2008, Virginia reached its lowest ever rate of infant mortality, at 6.7 deaths per1,000. There are however racial and social health disparities, in 2010 African Americans experienced 28% more premature deaths than whites, while 13% of Virginians lack any health insurance. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2009 survey, 26% of Virginians are obese and another 35% are overweight. 78% of residents claim to have exercised at least once in the past three months. About 30% of Virginia's 10- to 17-year-olds are overweight or obese. Virginia banned smoking in bars and restaurants in January 2010. 19% of <b>Virginians</b> smoke <b>tobacco.</b> Residents of Virginia's 8th congressional district share the longest average life expectancy rate in the nation, over 83 years.|$|R
5000|$|Speculation is {{that most}} of the <b>Virginian</b> <b>tobacco</b> {{plantations}} had used up their fertile soil and were unable to make money on the crop. (crop rotation hadn't been initiated yet). Subsequently, they started breeding their chattel - and White slave owners looked upon their slaves as nothing more than chattel. Mary would be desirable for her [...] "breeding capabilities." [...] Black slaves, and children of slaves, were then sold to the labour-intensive states of Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana, to work the cotton fields.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{not unusual}} for millionaires {{of the day to}} arrange marriages for their children, so James Mink offered a {{substantial}} dowry for his daughter's hand. Some research reports that he offered a $10,000 dowry, which would have bought a city block in 1852! A man named William Johnson married their daughter and their wedding certificate is on record in Methodist Church archives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. After taking the dowry, Johnson took Minnie on a honeymoon to the United States where he then sold her into slavery to a <b>Virginian</b> <b>tobacco</b> plantation owner. Why Virginia? ...|$|E
50|$|The {{first and}} most {{significant}} effect on the local economy was the impact the inspection act had on prices. From 1720 to 1747 tobacco prices stagnated, however, prices rose dramatically after 1747, closing the gap on the price for <b>Virginian</b> <b>tobacco.</b> Another significant effect the law had was to diversify the local economy. Because the act set a minimum level of quality for tobacco, growers who could not meet this minimum quality level were driven to other crops, namely the production of foodstuffs such as grains and livestock. This led to a consolidation of tobacco farmers into a specialized group of producers, decreasing distribution costs in the tobacco trade.|$|E
50|$|Earlier {{attempts}} of Maryland's Government to stimulate stagnating prices for Maryland Tobacco {{came in the}} form of legislated reduction in output. By reducing the output of tobacco produced, the equilibrium price for tobacco would be driven up, counteracting the otherwise stagnating prices. These policies, however, turned out to be so unpopular that the government of Maryland had trouble enforcing them After a similar inspection law in Virginia in the 1730s, however, Maryland witnessed the benefits of such a policy. Maryland tobacco farmers were able to observe the rising revenues for <b>Virginian</b> <b>tobacco</b> farmers, which had a devastating effect on the Maryland tobacco industry. Also, because tobacco notes were used so widely as commodity money, it was necessary to ensure the quality of the tobacco to validate the reliability of the notes.|$|E
5000|$|The Treaty of Westminster (1654) {{ended the}} impasse. The Dutch failed {{to have the}} Act {{repealed}} or amended, {{but it seems to}} have had relatively little influence on their trade. The Act offered England only limited solace. It could not limit the deterioration of England's overseas trading position, except in the cases where England herself was the principal consumer, such as the Canaries wine trade and the trade in Puglian olive oil. In the trade with the West Indies, the Dutch kept up a flourishing [...] "smuggling" [...] trade, thanks to the preference of English planters for Dutch import goods and the better deal the Dutch offered in the sugar trade. The Dutch colony of New Netherlands offered a loophole (through intercolonial trade) wide enough to drive a shipload of <b>Virginian</b> <b>tobacco</b> through.|$|E
5000|$|Morton {{fell out}} with Wollaston after he {{discovered}} that Wollaston had been selling indentured servants into slavery on the <b>Virginian</b> <b>tobacco</b> plantations. Powerless to prevent him, he encouraged the remaining servants to rebel against his harsh rule and organise themselves into a free community. Wollaston fled with his supporters to Virginia in 1626, leaving Morton in sole command of the colony, or its [...] "host" [...] as he preferred to be called, which was renamed Mount Ma-re (a play on [...] "merry" [...] and [...] "the sea") or simply Merrymount. Under Morton's [...] "hostship", an almost utopian project was embarked upon, in which the colonists were declared free men or [...] "consociates", and {{a certain degree of}} integration into the local Algonquian culture was attempted. However, it was Morton's long-term plan to [...] "further civilize" [...] the native population by converting them to his liberal form of Christianity, and by providing them with free salt for food preservation, thus enabling them to give up hunting and settle permanently. He also considered himself a [...] "loyal subject" [...] of the British monarchy throughout this period, and his agenda remained a colonial one, referring to book three of his New English Canaan memoirs as a manual on [...] "how not to colonize" [...] - [...] in reference to the Puritans.|$|E
