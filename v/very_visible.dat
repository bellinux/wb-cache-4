5|$|Denver's {{early years}} as a major train hub of the west are still <b>very</b> <b>visible</b> today. Trains stop in Denver at {{historic}} Union Station, where travelers can access RTD's 16th Street Free MallRide or use light rail to tour the city. Union Station will also serve as the main juncture for rail travel in the metro area, {{at the completion of}} FasTracks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the war, {{large numbers of}} public memorials were erected {{around the country in}} memory of Belgian soldiers who had died fighting for the Allied cause during the conflict. There are numerous monuments and streets dedicated to Allied politicians and generals, including Franklin Roosevelt and Bernard Montgomery in Brussels. The large numbers of British and American cemeteries and memorials, particularly in the Ardennes region associated with the Battle of the Bulge, meant that the legacy of the war was <b>very</b> <b>visible.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the January 2003 general {{election}}, the LPF shrank to 5.7% {{support and}} eight seats. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 {{in the government}} coalition, and would {{find it hard to}} maintain support in opposition. Besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not <b>very</b> <b>visible,</b> while party leader Herben had enough work just keeping the party from further infighting. The party also went into financial straits, and as the new coalition continued most of the former coalition's policies, it was hard for the LPF to oppose the government.|$|E

50|$|With the {{exception}} of bare, polished metals, {{the appearance of a}} surface to the eye is not a good guide to emissivities near room temperature. Thus white paint absorbs <b>very</b> little <b>visible</b> light. However, at an infrared wavelength of 10x10−6 meters, paint absorbs light very well, and has a high emissivity. Similarly, pure water absorbs <b>very</b> little <b>visible</b> light, but water is nonetheless a strong infrared absorber and has a correspondingly high emissivity.|$|R
5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became <b>very</b> <b>visible</b> in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E

25|$|When MIT {{replaced}} older mercury-vapor lamps with high-efficiency LED lamps {{to illuminate}} the Great Dome, hackers started changing {{the color of the}} lights to reflect various occasions — Earth Day, the Fourth of July, etc. Although reprogramming the lights is technically straightforward, these Great Dome lighting hacks are <b>very</b> <b>visible</b> from Boston's Back Bay district, across the Charles River.|$|E

25|$|During a test fire-up in 1993 {{to assess}} the car’s condition, {{disaster}} struck when a blocked oil way in the engine caused it to seize and ‘throw a rod’. For several years after that, the car was {{on display in the}} museum with a <b>very</b> <b>visible</b> hole in its engine where the piston and con-rod had exited.|$|E
25|$|A {{memorial}} to the 256 victims at the crash site overlooks Gander Lake, and another memorial was erected at Fort Campbell. There is also a Memorial Park in Hopkinsville, KY, just north of Fort Campbell. As of 2017, the scar from the crash is still <b>very</b> <b>visible,</b> and {{can be seen on}} the ground and in satellite pictures.|$|E
25|$|Transformative {{products}} are exciting, but robo-pets {{are even more}} exciting. We were interested in making the technology <b>very</b> <b>visible,</b> but also playing with translucency and transparency, soft boundaries. The irony of the digital age is that, as technology gets more invisible, people {{are more interested in}} being able to see it again, as in Apple Computer's iMac, with its translucent blues and milky plastics that simultaneously tease and reveal.|$|E

50|$|This coral has <b>very</b> large, <b>visible</b> polyps. They develop on a large, {{branching}} coralite skeleton, each polyp sporting unusually large, long tendrils, and a large, fleshy oral disc. It {{can come}} in several colours: fluorescent green, lime green, and brown.|$|R
25|$|Culp's Hill {{became a}} prime tourist {{attraction}} after the battle. It {{was close to}} the town and, unlike most battles in open fields, it was heavily wooded and the extreme firepower took a <b>very</b> <b>visible</b> toll on the trees, some of which were completely sheared off. Geary's division alone on July 3 reported that they expended 227,000 rounds. It took over twenty years before the scars of battle faded and nature reclaimed the breastworks.|$|E
25|$|Breckinridge's {{previous}} stage experience convinced Wood to {{cast him}} as the alien ruler who oversees an attempt {{to take over the}} Earth using an army of reanimated corpses. Indeed, his background {{made him one of the}} few truly experienced actors in the entire cast. Dressed in a pajama-like outfit which is curiously less ornate than those worn by his underlings, he sports <b>very</b> <b>visible</b> mascara and lipstick, and constantly rolls his eyes and mugs for the camera.|$|E
25|$|During {{construction}} of the Midland main line in the 1860s, a branch was laid from near How Wood to the Midland route to carry building materials. Never used by passenger services, Ordnance Survey maps indicate it closed between 1883 and 1898 although the embankment and some bridge abutments remain <b>very</b> <b>visible.</b> As part of a cost-cutting plan in the 1980s, British Rail examined reopening this, {{with the aim of}} diverting the branch to the City station and selling off the valuable Abbey station site.|$|E

25|$|Venomous fish {{carry their}} venom in venom glands and use various {{delivery}} systems, such as spines or sharp fins, barbs or spikes, and fangs. Venomous fish {{tend to be}} either <b>very</b> <b>visible,</b> using flamboyant colours to warn enemies, or skilfully camouflaged and maybe buried in the sand. Apart from the defence or hunting value, venom might have value for bottom dwelling fish by killing the bacteria that try to invade their skin. Few of these venoms have been studied. They are a yet to be tapped resource for bioprospecting to find drugs with medical uses.|$|E
25|$|When {{seen from}} above, a sexually mature female hamster has a trim tail line; a male's tail line bulges on both sides. This {{might not be}} <b>very</b> <b>visible</b> in all species. Male hamsters {{typically}} have very large testes {{in relation to their}} body size. Before sexual maturity occurs, it is more difficult to determine a young hamster's sex. When examined, female hamsters have their anal and genital openings close together, whereas males have these two holes farther apart (the penis is usually withdrawn into the coat and thus appears as a hole or pink pimple).|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{airborne}} FACs was a timely one. The other four TACPs of the 620th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron had joined its original two parties in ground forward air control as the U.S. military scrambled to form TACPs. Their utility was limited because the FAC had {{to remain with}} his MRC108 radio jeep while ordering air strikes, making a <b>very</b> <b>visible</b> target for enemy shellfire. The radios were fragile, and they were easily damaged by jolting and vibration. By 11 July 1950, {{only three of the}} radio jeeps were still working.|$|E

25|$|By 1960 Tan Son Nhut Air Base was growing, {{with more}} and more VNAF {{aircraft}} arriving from the United States, aircraft such as North American T-6 Texans, Douglas A-1 Skyraiders, Cessna L-19 (O-1) Bird Dogs, and Sikorsky H-19 Helicopters. The build-up of the VNAF caused air units to become <b>very</b> <b>visible</b> on the base. On 4 January 1964, the VNAF 3311th Wing was organized at Tan Son Nhut, and the number of air units grew rapidly. By the mid-1960s, Tan Son Nhut Airport was reported as the busiest airport in the world, with a mix of air traffic that approached chaotic proportions.|$|E
25|$|Head {{and neck}} markers are <b>very</b> <b>visible,</b> {{and may be}} used in species where the legs are not {{normally}} visible (such as ducks and geese). Nasal discs and nasal saddles can be attached to the culmen with a pin looped through the nostrils in birds with perforate nostrils. They should not be used if they obstruct breathing. They should not be used on birds that live in icy climates, as accumulation of ice on a nasal saddle can plug the nostrils. Neck collars made of expandable, non-heat-conducting plastic are very useful for larger birds such as geese.|$|E
25|$|Prostitution {{is legal}} {{in parts of}} Nevada in {{licensed}} brothels, but only counties with populations under 400,000 {{have the option to}} legalize it. Although prostitution is not {{a major part of the}} Nevada economy, employing roughly 300 women as independent contractors, it is a <b>very</b> <b>visible</b> endeavor. Of the 14 counties permitted to legalize prostitution under state law, 8 have chosen to legalize brothels. State law prohibits prostitution in Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), and Washoe County (which contains Reno). However, prostitution is legal in Storey County, which is part of the Reno–Sparks metropolitan area.|$|E
