25|$|The {{plunge depth}} {{is defined as}} the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. <b>Variable</b> <b>load</b> welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} problem of piston {{striking}} cylinder and pumping insufficiency, an optimization method of concrete open-loop pumping displacement control is derived and presented. In order to control piston stroke effectively, the optimization model of concrete open-loop pumping displacement control parameters is built based on considering the system’s open-loop characteristics. Satisfying the physical constraint of preventing piston striking cylinder and maximizing piston’s effective stroke are taking as the evaluation criterion during the modeling process. Using this method, simulation and experimental research has been proceeded in a type of concrete pump. The result shows that concrete pumping piston can not only meet the noninterference physical constraint, but also increase the pumping efficiency significantly under <b>variable</b> <b>loads.</b> The optimization model provides a new method {{that can be used in}} engineering practice for solving the design problem of concrete pumping open-loop control system under <b>variable</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R
