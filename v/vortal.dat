The descent follows a forest track into {{the valley of the}} Little Kinzig and past the former abbey of Wittichen. In <b>Vortal</b> it crosses the Little Kinzig. The ascent from here to the Sattellege is very steep. On the last few kilometres the prath runs above the Kinzig to Alpirsbach.|$|E

In this thesis we investigate {{the development of}} vertical web portals (<b>vortals)</b> that fulfill targeted organizational mission needs. This specific type of portal provides narrow-scoped data, information and services while affording the user accessibility over a public network, such as the Internet. As part of the investigation, we present a methodology for architecting such portals with explicit consideration of security policy. The methodology, along with some preliminary guidelines, is intended {{to serve as a}} first approximation of a framework for both the development of vertical portals and the definition of doctrine on the application of <b>vortals.</b> We illustrate this methodology with an application to a Navy ship.

40|$|Page ranking is a {{fundamental}} step towards the construction of ef-fective search engines for both generic (horizontal) and focused (vertical) search. Ranking schemes for horizontal search like the PageRank algorithm used by Google operate on the topology of the graph, regardless of the page content. On the other hand, the recent development of vertical portals (<b>vortals)</b> makes it useful to adopt scoring systems focussed on the topic and taking the page content into account. In this paper, we propose a general framework for Web Page Scoring Systems (WPSS) which incorporates and extends many of the relevant models proposed in the literature. Finally, experimen-tal results are given to assess {{the features of the}} proposed scoring systems with special emphasis on vertical search...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION To {{cope with}} the {{information}} overload stemming from {{with the growth of}} the Internet and intranets, domainspecific portals such as vertical portals (<b>Vortals)</b> and enterprise information portals (EIP) are becoming increasingly important. Yahoo-likeWeb directories are still popular as an interface for organizing selected Web pages. Compared to robot-based search engines, directories have a small numbers of irrelevant documents and are provide an easy user interface. As determined by Yahoo Web surfers and the thousands of volunteers working on the Open Directory Project (ODP), however, most directories are maintained manually, and at a very high cost. 2. AUTOMATED METADATA CREATION To reduce the maintenance const, we have been doing researches on automated metadata creation especially for semi-automated Web directories [1, 2]. Web contains varieties of information in various page types. Link-based popularity information such as Google's PageRank is also useful to eli...|$|R
50|$|In 1994, Gill Holman, who {{was based}} in Norwich, {{realising}} {{the potential of the}} newly available web, created a <b>vortal</b> site for booksellers, called ARCbooks, and in February 1996 Robert Temple began listing on it. At that point they did not have direct access to the web, and listings were made by sending floppy discs containing standard catalogue entries to ARCbooks, by post, which Gill herself converted into HTML format and displayed. Orders were placed with the firm, through her, by telephone. Very few booksellers were on the web then, and Robert Temple found their experiment so successful that they bought a computer capable of accessing the web, and began exchanging data files with Gill very much in the modern way. Gill had to give up her business in 1998, for personal reasons, just as it was taking off, but Bibliofind had started up by then, and Robert Temple began listing on that instead. Late in 1999 they issued their last printed catalogue, and since then have traded as a web-only bookseller. They are members of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association which they joined in 2006.|$|E

This paper identifies the commonalities between Vortals in various application domains, i. e. application-independent patterns of orchestrating Grid services employed by a typical <b>Vortal.</b> These patterns can be captured as façades—a software layer between the <b>Vortal</b> business logic and generic Grid services that promotes a horizontal integration. The façades are reusable and considerably simplify the development of new Vortals. Furthermore, the façades foster interactions between different Vortals, an...|$|E

It also attempts to disseminate such information among the various personnel involved in research work and make a good coordinating point (Web Portal) to share their newly acquired information for their advantage. / Currently, there is no coordinating point for handling Biotechnological activities in Sri Lanka. Various institutes use their own methods and practices for information management. This has been a major issue because they are not aware of others* work and standards. This is a waste of money, time and human resources. / This project addresses the need to integrate various Biotechnology communities into an online application where information is shared among users in Biotechnology communities as well as other authorized personnel in the community in a secure and accurate manner. / 1 started this project w it a study of similar domains. The next step was the pilot study and tried to land up stakeholders clearly. In this stage I used the National Biosafety, Biotechnology database compiled by Professor Athula Per era and drafted a questionnaire. The next step started with a finalized questionnaire and a properly selected data sample. Requirements gathered during extended discussions with stakeholders included those from the Government, Semi-government and the Private sector organizations. In this task, a series of interviews were conducted and questionnaires were used to gather requirements/comments. Then the study was done to find out more, with respect to history, various types, features of Web portals and future trends. <b>Vortals</b> are also introduced. At the design stage, the client side, the server-side and the database design were finalized. All the design stage decisions, tools and technology selections were justified.
