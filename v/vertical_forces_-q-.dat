40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> for effective torque control of maxillary incisors during retraction in the lingual technique using a three-dimensional (3 D) finite-element method. These horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> were analyzed and compared. Subjects and Methods: A 3 D finite-element model of the maxilla and maxillary incisors and molars was made. The maxillary incisors were subjected to horizontal retractive <b>force</b> and the <b>vertical</b> intrusive <b>force</b> was calculated such that the resultant of the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> passed through the center of resistance of the maxillary incisors to maintain torque and simulate bodily retraction in labial and lingual mechanics. Results: For equal magnitude of horizontal retractive force (100 g) the calculated <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> vector (Fv) was 129 g and the resultant force was 163 g in labial mechanics, while in lingual mechanics, the <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> vector was 222. 66 g and the resultant force was 244 g. Conclusion: In lingual orthodontics, it is more appropriate to reduce the magnitude of horizontal retractive forc and keep the <b>vertical</b> intrusive <b>force</b> within biological limits, thus maintaining torque and achieve bodily retraction of incisors...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} of SRM obtains {{less attention}} for in-wheel motor applications {{according to the}} present research works. In this paper, the vertical component of SRM unbalanced radial force, which is named as SRM <b>vertical</b> <b>force,</b> is {{taken into account in}} suspension performance for in-wheel motor driven electric vehicles (IWM-EV). The analysis results suggest that SRM <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> has a great effect on suspension performance. The direct cause for this phenomenon is that SRM <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> is directly exerted on the wheel, which will result in great variation in tyre dynamic load and the tyre will easily jump off the ground. Furthermore, the frequency of SRM <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> is broad which covers the suspension resonance frequencies. So it is easy to arouse suspension resonance and greatly damage suspension performance. Aiming at the new problem, FxLMS (filtered-X least mean square) controller is proposed to improve suspension performance. The FxLMS controller is based on active suspension system which can generate the controllable force to suppress the vibration caused by SRM <b>vertical</b> <b>force.</b> The conclusion shows that it is effective to take advantage of active suspensions to reduce the effect of SRM <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> on suspension performance...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the study was to {{establish}} the link between the saddle <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> and its determinants in order to establish the strategies that could trigger the sit–stand transition. We hypothesized that the minimum saddle <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> would be a critical parameter influencing the sit–stand transition during cycling. Twenty-five non-cyclists were asked to pedal at six different power outputs from 20 % (1. 6 ± 0. 3 W kg− 1) to 120 % (9. 6 ± 1. 6 W kg− 1) of their spontaneous sit–stand transition power obtained at 90 rpm. Five 6 -component sensors (saddle tube, pedals and handlebars) and a full-body kinematic reconstruction were used to provide the saddle <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> and other force components (trunk inertial force, hips and shoulders reaction forces, and trunk weight) linked to the saddle <b>vertical</b> <b>force.</b> Minimum saddle <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> linearly decreased with power output by 87 % from a static position on the bicycle (5. 30 ± 0. 50 N kg− 1) to power output= 120 % of the sit–stand transition power (0. 68 ± 0. 49 N kg− 1). This decrease was mainly explained by the increase in instantaneous pedal forces from 2. 84 ± 0. 58 N kg− 1 to 6. 57 ± 1. 02 N kg− 1 from 20 % to 120 % of the power output corresponding to the sit–stand transition, causing an increase in hip <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> from − 0. 17 N kg− 1 to 3. 29 N kg− 1. The emergence of strategies aiming at counteracting the elevation of the trunk (handlebars and pedals pulling) coincided with the spontaneous sit–stand transition power. The present data suggest that the large decrease in minimum saddle <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> observed at high pedal reaction forces might trigger the sit–stand transition in cycling...|$|R

40|$|Aerodynamic force {{generation}} and mechanical power {{requirements of a}} dragonfly (Aeschna juncea) in hovering flight are studied. The method of numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations in moving overset grids is used. There are two large <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> peaks in one flapping cycle. One is {{in the first half}} of the cycle, which is mainly due to the hindwings in their downstroke; the other is in the second half of the cycle, which is mainly due to the forewings in their downstroke. Hovering with a large stroke plane angle, the dragonfly uses drag as a major source for its weight supporting force (approximately 65 % of the total <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> is contributed by the drag and 35 % by the lift of the wings). The <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> coefficient of a wing is twice as large as the quasi-steady value. The interaction between the fore- and hindwings is not very strong and is detrimental to the <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> generation. Compared with the case of a single wing in the same motion, the interaction effect reduces the <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> on the fore- and hindwings by 14 % and 16 % of that of the corresponding single wing, respectively. The large <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> is due to the unsteady flow effects. The mechanism of the unsteady force is that in each downstroke of the hindwing or the forewing, a new vortex ring containing downward momentum is generated, giving an upward force.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify gait kinetics in foals {{during the first half}} year of life, taking into account their osteochondrosis status. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, cohort study performed at a single stud farm. METHODS: Pressure plate measurements at walk and trot from eleven Dutch Warmblood foals during the first 24 weeks of life were used to determine body mass normalised peak <b>vertical</b> <b>force,</b> normalised <b>vertical</b> impulse and stance duration. Coefficients of variation of peak <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> and stance duration were used as measures for gait maturity. Radiographs of tarsocrural and femoropatellar joints were taken at four to six weeks and after six months to check for osteochondrosis. A linear mixed model was used {{to determine the effects of}} age, limb, presence of osteochondrosis and speed on gait parameters. RESULTS: Mean walking and trotting velocity increased over time as did stance duration and normalised vertical impulse, normalised peak <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> values however remained relatively constant. During the first weeks of their life only the coefficient of variation of stance duration decreased significantly, while the coefficient of variation of peak <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> did not. None of the foals was visibly lame, but the presence of osteochondrosis resulted in a temporarily but significantly reduced normalised peak <b>vertical</b> <b>force.</b> MAIN LIMITATIONS: This study is a relatively small sample size of one breed from a single stud farm, A stand-alone pressure plate was used and body mass was estimated rather than measured. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being precocious, foals need time to mature their gait. During growth, velocity at walk and trot increases, but normalised peak <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> remains relatively constant. Although not visibly lame, a temporary reduction in normalised peak <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> was detected in osteochondrosis positive foals using a pressure plate.

40|$|Although {{horizontal}} {{ground forces}} are only ~ 15 % of <b>vertical</b> <b>forces,</b> {{they account for}} 47 % and 33 % of the metabolic cost in walking and running. To explain these disproportionately high metabolic costs we hypothesized that low horizontal ground forces generate relatively high torques on body segments during locomotion and this is mediated by long moment arms. We compared external force moment arms and discreet torques applied to the body segments by horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> during walking and running. Sixteen subjects (21. 9 ± 1. 9 years) walked at 1. 5 m/s and 10 subjects (23. 2 ± 2. 0 years) ran at 3. 83 m/s. Segmental torques in the sagittal plane were partitioned into components due to horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> and quantified by their angular impulses. The mean (±S. E.) ratios of horizontal to <b>vertical</b> ground <b>forces</b> (GF ratio) and angular impulses (AI ratio) in walking were 0. 131 (± 0. 003, 95 % C. I. 0. 124 to 0. 137) and 0. 530 (± 0. 018, C. I. 0. 497 to 0. 569). Results were similar in running. In both gaits the AI ratios were significantly greater than the GF ratios because the respective C. I. s did not overlap. The horizontal forces produced 53 % and 41 % as much angular impulse on the body segments as did the <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> in walking and running despite being only 13 % as large. In the two movements the moment arms for the horizontal forces averaged across foot, leg, thigh, and trunk body segments were 3. 8 fold larger than those for the <b>vertical</b> <b>forces.</b> The data supported the hypothesis and suggest that the relatively low horizontal vs <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> accounted for a disproportionately higher percentage of the angular impulses placed on the body segments and this effect was due to relatively long moment arms for horizontal forces. These results partially explain the relatively large metabolic cost of generating relatively low horizontal forces. Originally published Journal of Biomechanics, Vol. 41, No. 8, 200...|$|R
