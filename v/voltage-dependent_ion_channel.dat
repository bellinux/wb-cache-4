50|$|The <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> plays a {{key role}} in {{regulating}} metabolic and energetic flux across the outer mitochondrial membrane. It is involved in the transport of ATP, ADP, pyruvate, malate, and other metabolites, and thus communicates extensively with enzymes from metabolic pathways. The ATP-dependent cytosolic enzymes hexokinase, glucokinase, and glycerol kinase, as well as the mitochondrial enzyme creatine kinase, have all been found to bind to VDAC. This binding puts them in close proximity to ATP released from the mitochondria. In particular, the binding of hexokinase is presumed to play a key role in coupling glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, VDAC is an important regulator of Ca2+ transport in and out of the mitochondria. Because Ca2+ is a cofactor for metabolic enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, energetic production and homeostasis are both affected by VDAC’s permeability to Ca2+.|$|E

40|$|Erythrocytes {{infected}} with malaria parasites exhibit marked increases in permeability to organic and inorganic solutes. The plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC), an unusual <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> induced on the host membrane after infection, {{may play a}} central role in these permeability changes. Here, we identified a functional PSAC mutant through in vitro selection with blasticidin S. Resistance to blasticidin S was generated during culture and correlated with significant reductions in permeability to multiple solutes, consistent with uptake via a common pathway. Single channel recordings revealed marked changes in PSAC gating with the addition of a subconductance state not present in wild-type channels. The channel's selectivity profile and pharmacology also were significantly altered. Eventual loss of the mutant phenotype upon removal of selective pressure and slower growth of mutant parasites suggest that PSAC serves an important role in intracellular parasite survival. These findings provide solid evidence for the uptake of diverse solutes via PSAC and implicate one or more parasite genes in expression of this channel...|$|E
40|$|AbstractElectrical {{signaling}} in {{the nervous}} system relies on action potential generation, propagation and transmission. Such processes are dynamic in nature and rely on precisely timed events associated with <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> conformational transitions between their primary open, closed and inactivated states and clustering at unique membrane sites. In voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channels, fast inactivation and clustering processes rely on entropic clock chains as described by ‘ball and chain’ mechanisms, suggesting important roles for such chains in electrical signaling. Here, we consider evidence supporting the proposed ‘ball and chain’ mechanisms for Kv channel fast inactivation and clustering associated with intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal regions of the protein, respectively. Based on this comparison, we delineate the requirements that argue for such a process and establish the thermodynamic signature of a ‘ball and chain’ mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate how ‘chain’-level alternative splicing of the Kv channel gene modulates the entropic clock-based ‘ball and chain’ inactivation and clustering channel functions underlying changes in electrical signaling. As such, the Kv channel model system exemplifies how linkage between alternative splicing and intrinsic disorder enables functional diversity...|$|E

Mutations in the encoding DYSF gene cause {{a number of}} myopathies, e. g. limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2 B (LGMD 2 B). Besides skeletal muscle degenerative processes, dysferlin deficiency is also associated with cardiac complications. Thus, both LGMD 2 B patients and dysferlin-deficient mice develop a dilated cardiomyopathy. We and others have recently reported that dystrophin-deficient ventricular cardiomyocytes from mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy show significant abnormalities in <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channels,</b> which {{may contribute to the}} pathophysiology in dystrophic cardiomyopathy. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if dysferlin, like dystrophin, is a regulator of cardiac <b>ion</b> <b>channels.</b> Methods and Results: By using the whole cell patch-clamp technique, we compared the properties of voltage-dependent calcium and sodium channels, as well as action potentials in ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from the hearts of normal and dysferlin-deficient (dysf) mice. In contrast to dystrophin deficiency, the lack of dysferlin did not impair the <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> properties and left action potential parameters unaltered. In connection with normal ECGs in dysf mice these results suggest that dysferlin deficiency does not perturb cardiac electrophysiology.

40|$|<b>Voltage-dependent</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> {{are thought}} to consist of a highly conserved {{repeated}} core of six transmem-brane segments, flanked by more variable cytoplasmic domains. Significant functional differences exist among related types of K+ channels. These differences {{have been attributed to}} the variable domains, most promi-nently the N- and C-termini. We have therefore inves-tigated the functional importance of both termini for the delayed rectifier K+ channel from rat brain encoded by the drk 7 gene. This channel has an unusually long C-ter-minus. Deletions in either terminus affected both activa-tion and inactivation, in some cases profoundly. Un-expectedly, more extensive deletions in both termini restored gating.

Spermatocytes separate from an anuclear cytoplasmic core and undergo two sequential divisions. During the second division, intracellular organelles segregate specifically to spermatids as they bud from an anuclear residual body. We have applied patch-clamp techniques {{in order to}} investigate membrane protein distribution during these asymmetric divisions. We show that membrane components, as assayed by <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> activity, follow a specific distribution pattern during sperm development. Several voltage-sensitive ion channel activities are observed in spermatocytes and residual bodies, but only a single-channel type can be detected in spermatids, indicating that other channel activities are excluded from or inactivated within these cells as they form. The channel that is observed in spermatids is an inward-rectifying chloride channel (Clir), as indicated by its sensitivity to chloride channel inhibitors and Cl-dependent shifts in its conductance. Treatment of spermatids with Cl channel blockers induce their differentiation into spermatozoa, suggesting that Clir plays a role during this developmental step.

40|$|PURPOSE. Transplantation of retinal {{stem cells}} (RSCs) is a {{potential}} therapy for retinal degeneration. However, success critically depends on whether RSCs can differentiate into fully functional daughter cells. METHODS. Whole-cell patch clamp techniques were used to characterize the postinduction developmental profile of membrane potentials and ionic currents in RSCs cultured from embryonic day 17 Long Evans rats. These results were compared to recordings obtained from cultured cells obtained from postnatal day 1 rat pups. RESULTS. Outward rectifying potassium currents (I K�) were observed in approximately 15 % of cells at day 3 and in all cells by day 7. Voltage-dependent sodium currents took longer to emerge (day 7), and TTX-sensitive channels were not fully mature until day 15. Broad excitatory potentials, characteristic of immature action potentials, could be reliably stimulated by day 10, and spontaneous action potentials were recorded at day 25, which were indistinguishable, in terms of width and amplitude, from the comparison group of developing retinal neurons.

Chelation of extracellular free Ca 2 + abolished [Cai] increase induced by erythropoietin. In addition, the levels of inositol- 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate did not increase in erythropoietin-treated erythroblasts. These results indicate that in erythropoietin-stimulated cells, Ca 2 + influx rather than intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization was responsible for [Cai] rise. Both Ni 2 + and moderately high doses of nifedipine blocked [Cai] increase, suggesting involvement of ion channels.

40|$|Almost {{ten years}} have passed since the first amino acid {{sequence}} of a <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channel,</b> the Na+ channel, was deduced [1]. During this period, extraordinary progress has occurred, primarily as a result of two methodologies, recombinant DNA and patch clamp electrophysiology, and mainly in the field of ion channel structure-function. Today many laboratories are involved in elegant experiments combining mutagenesis of ion channel genes and expression of the mutant channels in heterologous expression systems, allowing detailed functional investigation of permeation and gating [2]. Besides recombinant DNA and patch clamp electrophysiology, dilferent approaches, such as in vitro protein expression, reconstitution into lipid bilayers [3] and site-directed antibodies [4], have also played crucial roles. The major impact of the mutagenesis patch-clamp approach lies in the ability to localize function to a restricted area of a single protein molecule.

40|$|AbstractKramers’ {{diffusion}} theory of reaction {{rates in the}} condensed phase is considered {{as an alternative to}} the traditional discrete-state Markov (DSM) model in describing ion channel gating current kinetics. Diffusion theory can be expected to be particularly relevant in describing high-frequency (> 100 kHz) events in channel activation. The generalized voltage sensor of a <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> is treated as a Brownian motion particle undergoing spatial diffusion along a one-dimensional energy landscape. Two classes of energy landscapes are considered. The first class contains large barriers, which give rise to gating currents with two distinct time scales: the usual low-frequency decay, which can modeled with a DSM scheme, and a high-frequency component arising from intrastate relaxation. Large depolarizations reduce potential barriers to such a degree that activation rates are diffusion limited, causing the two time scales to merge. Landscapes of the second class are either featureless or contain barriers that are small compared to kT; these are termed “drift landscapes. ” These landscapes require a larger friction coefficient to generate slow gating kinetics. The high-frequency component that appears with barrier models is not present in pure drift motion. The presence of a high-frequency component can be tested experimentally with large-bandwidth recordings of gating currents. Topics such as frequency domain analysis, spatial dependence of the friction coefficient, methods for determining the adequacy of a DSM model, and the development of physical models of gating are explored...|$|E
40|$|Mammals {{have ten}} voltage-dependent sodium (Nav) channel genes. Nav {{channels}} {{are expressed in}} different cell types with different subcellular distributions and are critical for many aspects of neuronal processing. The last common ancestor of teleosts and tetrapods had four Nav channel genes, presumably on four different chromosomes. In the lineage leading to mammals, a series of tandem duplications on two of these chromosomes more than doubled the number of Nav channel genes. It is unknown when these duplications occurred and whether they occurred {{against a backdrop of}} duplication of flanking genes on their chromosomes or as an expansion of ion channel genes in general. We estimated key dates of the Nav channel gene family expansion by phylogenetic analysis using teleost, elasmobranch, lungfish, amphibian, avian, lizard, and mammalian Nav channel sequences, as well as chromosomal synteny for tetrapod genes. We tested, and exclude, the null hypothesis that Nav channel genes reside in regions of chromosomes prone to duplication by demonstrating the lack of duplication or duplicate retention of surrounding genes. We also find no comparable expansion in other <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> gene families of tetrapods following the teleost–tetrapod divergence. We posit a specific expansion of the Nav channel gene family in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods when tetrapods evolved, diversified, and invaded the terrestrial habitat. During this time, the amniote forebrain evolved greater anatomical complexity and novel tactile sensory receptors appeared. The duplication of Nav channel genes allowed for greater regional specialization in Nav channel expression, variation in subcellular localization, and enhanced processing of somatosensory input...|$|E

A slowly activating, <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> was identified in the SPV membrane. Mean channel conductance was 26 pS when 100 mM KCl was on both sides of the membrane, and reversal potential measurements indicated that most of the current was carried by K+. Treatment of protoplasts with GA 3 increased whole-vacuole current density compared to SPV isolated from ABA- or CaCl 2 -treated cells. The opening of the SV channel was sensitive to cytosolic free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) between 600 nM and 100 [mu]M, with higher [Ca 2 +]i resulting in a greater probability of channel opening. SV channel activity was reduced greater than 90 % by the calmodulin (CaM) inhibitors W 7 and trifluoperazine, suggesting that Ca 2 + activates endogenous CaM tightly associated with the membrane. Exogenous CaM partially reversed the inhibitory effects of W 7 on SV channel opening. CaM also sensitized the SV channel to Ca 2 +. In the presence of ~ 3. 5 [mu]M CaM, specific current increased by approximately threefold at 2. 5 [mu]M Ca 2 + and by more than 13 -fold at 10 [mu]M Ca 2 +.
