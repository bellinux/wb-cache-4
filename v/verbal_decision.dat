This method belongs to the family of <b>Verbal</b> <b>Decision</b> Analysis methods and gives a more efficient means of problem solution. The method is based on psychologically valid op-erations for information elicitation from a decision maker: comparisons of two distances between the evaluations on the ordinal scales of two criteria. The information received from a decision maker is used {{for the construction}} of a binary relation between a pair of alternatives which yields preference, indifference and incomparability relations. The notion of a method decisive power is introduced. The illustrative example is given.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The ZAPROS method {{belongs to}} the <b>Verbal</b> <b>Decision</b> Analysis framework, and it aims at solving {{decision-making}} problems in a more realistic way from the decision maker’s point of view. Quan-titative methods can lead to loss of information when attempting to assign accurate measurements to verbal values. However, the feature exposed can cause {{a decrease in the}} comparison power of the method, making the incomparability cases between the alternatives unavoidable and leading to an unsatisfactory result of the problem, thus leading to an unsatisfactory outcome of the problem. Considering the limitation exposed, this work presents a methodological approach structured on the ZAPROS method to assist in decision-making in the <b>Verbal</b> <b>Decision</b> Analysis. The aim is to produce a complete result which is satisfactory to the decision maker, through the reduction of the cases of incomparability between alternatives. The modifi-cations were mainly applied to the comparison of alternatives process and did not change the computational complexity of the method...|$|E

40|$|The {{relevance}} of codes and modalities in a multiple-resource {{model to the}} prediction of task interference was investigated in an experiment in which either <b>verbal</b> or spatial <b>decision</b> tasks, responded to with either voice or key press, were time-shared with second-order tracking. Results indicate the importance of the dichotomy between verbal and spatial processing codes in accounting for task interference. Interference with tracking was consistently greater, and difficulty/performance trade-offs were stronger, when the spatial decision task was performed and the manual response was used. A review of the literature on the interference between a continuous visual task and a discrete task whose modality is either auditory or visual suggests that scanning produces a dominant cost to intramodal configurations when visual channels are separated in space. In absence of visual separation, the differences between cross-modal and intramodal performance may be best accounted for by a mechanism of preemption...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{difficult}} problems in construction is to take objective decision, especially for selection of technology and material solutions. Decision making process is very complicated and time consuming (due to the complex nature of construction projects). Many experts, with extensive knowledge of Construction Industry, take subjective <b>decisions,</b> related to <b>verbal</b> methods of <b>decision</b> making. Difficulties are related mostly to the creation of relevant criteria set, answering the decision maker questions. Set of proper criteria and mathematical tools could significantly improve objective decision making. Assessment of different types of investments and their complexity is particularly difficult and the most common issue in engineering practices. Authors present case study – selection of the best materials variant for building structural walls – detailed calculations of AHP method. Mathematical and thus objective methods that support the decision-making process in construction are undoubtedly helpful in everyday work of a construction manager. The AHP method allows for selection of an optimum solution among the defined alternatives (evaluation problem) or identification of the preferred alternative among the potentially infinite, suggested set of alternatives, defined {{from the perspective of the}} set of restrictions (design problem). The support of decision-making processes provides many advantages which are described in the paper...|$|R

However, little is known if another function of the cerebellum, semantic decision, is also related to reading ability. Moreover, since Chinese is logographic and more semantically based while English is alphabetic and more phonologically-based, we investigated if the semantic and cerebellar measures were more related to the processing of Chinese than to the processing of English. Sixty Chinese undergraduates participated in various Chinese and English reading and spelling tests. Measures in semantic association, verbal fluency, semantic fluency and postural stability were taken. Contrary to our expectation, there were more significant correlations among the cerebellar and English measures than among the cerebellar and Chinese measures. Semantic decision significantly predicted Chinese exam, reading and spelling scores. Semantic decision and semantic fluency predicted English exam, spelling and reading (including irregular word reading).

Participants performed 30 putts using TA at either Level 2, Level 3, or no verbalization condition. Although Level 3 verbalization produced a higher volume of verbal data than Level 2, TA at either level 2 or 3 did not impair putting performance compared to no verbalization.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine if such effective teaching behaviors as enthusiasm and <b>verbal</b> clarity impact <b>decisions</b> by administrators when they are faced with assigning teachers to high and low track classes. An experiment was conducted where subjects were presented two fictitious job descriptions (one low track and one high track) and asked to assign a fictitious teacher to one of the two positions. Nine fictitious teachers were created for the experiment. Two hundred and ninety-eight subjects were selected and within present position were randomly assigned to treatment conditions. The sample was stratified according to present position held (practicing administrator; teacher; administrative trainee, and teacher trainee), allowing a 3 x 3 x 4 x 2 (enthusiasm x verbal clarity x position x track assignment) completely crossed design. Dependent measures in addition to assignment to track were predicted teacher effectiveness in a low track position and predicted teacher effectiveness in a high track position. Methods of analysis employed included logic modeling, analysis of variance, and multiple regression. The major findings of this study indicated that the enthusiasm of a teacher affected the assignment of that teacher. The nature of this effect was characterized by a tendency to assign teachers exhibiting higher levels of enthusiasm to low track positions. This effect is in the opposite direction of what which would account for the previously reported imbalance of student perceptions of teacher enthusiasm observed between student tracks. Teacher verbal clarity and the position of the decision-maker did not effect the decision-maker's subsequent assignment of the teacher. While both teacher enthusiasm and verbal clarity were found to affect the predicted effectiveness of a teacher in a low track position, neither were found to affect the predicted effectiveness of a teacher in a high track position. Position of the decision-maker did not affect the predicted effectiveness of the teacher in either track.

We show how this kind of decision making can be aided through a multi-stage <b>verbal</b> <b>decision</b> making process, including both formal and informal aspects, supported by an information system which can provide descriptions in both text and audio-visual form of the alternative under consideration at each stage of the process.

Thus we describe the provision of a generic preference structure of aspects on which the decision-maker can identify verbally expressed levels at which all the potential alternatives have been pre-classified. Since this generic structure is unlikely to contain classification information on all the aspects that an individual decision-maker may consider in the particular context, the system gives the decision maker the opportunity to explore particular alternatives (in multimedia where appropriate) to develop verbal descriptions of the levels on criteria which are personally relevant in deciding among alternatives...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{problems}} that {{emerge in the}} process of project management can be presented as multi-criteria issues and solved with the help of appropriate methods. The contracting authority, selecting one tender out of many available tenders, assesses them, taking into account various criteria, e. g. price, expected execution time and the contractor's experience. The owner of a company intending to purchase the fixed assets requisite for the realization of the project behaves similarly, i. e. the most advantageous model of the device is chosen, taking into account not only its price but also production capacity, energy intensity, noise emission, service availability, etc. From among many concepts, the investor has to choose a solution which frequently constitutes a compromise between price, functional properties, durability and aesthetics of performance, as well as safety of the utilization and impact on the environment. The choice of an investment location depends not only on the market, financial and supply factors, but also on so called soft factors such as the perceived quality of institutions and the attitude of local communities. All such situations can be described in the same way: taking into account preferences of the decision maker, the best possible choice must be made out of a finite set of alternatives evaluated according to a finite set of criteria. There are many different methods {{that can be used to}} aid a decision maker in this choice, including, but not limited to, techniques based on the outranking relation, <b>verbal</b> <b>decision</b> analysis and the MACBETH method.
