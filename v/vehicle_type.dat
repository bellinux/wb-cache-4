3000|$|This paper further {{explores the}} effect of area {{occupancy}} (ρ [...] a [...]) of road {{on the amount of}} interaction between heavy and light <b>vehicle</b> <b>types.</b> Simulations were carried out at different area occupancies keeping vehicular proportion equal for different <b>vehicle</b> <b>types,</b> and interaction rates were measured for LMVs and other <b>vehicle</b> <b>types.</b> Similarly, interaction rates were also measured between HMVs and other <b>vehicle</b> <b>types.</b> It was found that for all vehicle pairs the interaction rate had a parabolic relationship with the area occupancy, as shown in Figs.  15 and 16. Here the interaction rate between two <b>vehicle</b> <b>types</b> was measured as the number of <b>vehicles</b> of <b>type</b> A found to be interacting (following or overtaking) with type B for every 1, 000 simulated <b>vehicles</b> of <b>type</b> A found in measurement area. For example, interaction rate for LMV–HMV would mean the number of LMVs found following or overtaking HMVs out of 1, 000 LMVs observed in measurement area.|$|R

25|$|The most {{commonly}} seen type of emergency ambulance. This <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> permits increased treatment space {{and also the}} ability to store significantly larger amounts of medical equipment. Such vehicles will typically respond independently to emergency calls, providing some level of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Requirements are {{specified}} {{for categories}} of road ambulances based in increasing {{order of the}} level of treatment that can be carried out. The standard includes both <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> and also engine type and performance characteristics, including vehicle dimensions, acceleration rate, braking capacity, traction control, fire safety, and heating/cooling.|$|E
25|$|Tolls: a fee {{charged to}} travel via a road, bridge, tunnel, canal, {{waterway}} or other transportation facilities. Historically tolls {{have been used}} to pay for public bridge, road and tunnel projects. They have also been used in privately constructed transport links. The toll {{is likely to be a}} fixed charge, possibly graduated for <b>vehicle</b> <b>type,</b> or for distance on long routes.|$|E

25|$|Taxicab {{service in}} the city is {{provided}} by private companies regulated by the Metropolitan Taxicab Commission. Rates vary by <b>vehicle</b> <b>type,</b> size, passengers and distance, and by regulation all taxicab fares must be calculated using a taximeter and be payable in cash or credit card. Solicitation by a driver is prohibited, although a taxicab may be hailed {{on the street or}} at a stand.|$|E
25|$|Roads are {{designed}} {{in conjunction with}} design guidelines and standards. These are adopted by national and sub-national authorities (e.g., states, provinces, territories and municipalities). Design guidelines take into account speed, <b>vehicle</b> <b>type,</b> road grade (slope), view obstructions, and stopping distance. With proper application of guidelines, along with good engineering judgement, an engineer can design a roadway that is comfortable, safe, and appealing to the eye.|$|E

25|$|Oversized houses {{facilitated}} {{other forms}} of conspicuous consumption, such as an oversized garage for the family's oversized motor vehicles; buying more clothing to fill larger clothes closets; et cetera; hence, conspicuous consumption becomes a self-generating cycle of spending money {{for the sake of}} social prestige. Analogous to the consumer trend for oversized houses is the trend towards buying oversized light-trucks, specifically the off-road sport-utility <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> (cf. station wagon and estate car), as a form of psychologically comforting conspicuous consumption, because such big motor-vehicles usually are bought by people who reside in a city, an urban nuclear family.|$|E

This benefit allowed the 1986 designers to quickly devise a derived <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> for nuclear disaster recovery work. On July 15, two rovers, called STR-1, were delivered to the Chernobyl accident zone and proved useful for clearing debris, earning awards for the designers. Due to extremely high radiation levels, all rovers eventually failed, and human workers (later named liquidators) were called in.|$|E
25|$|The current {{standard}} for Malaysian number plates were originally derivatives of pre-1932 number plate formats in the United Kingdom, first issued after {{the introduction of}} motorised vehicles in the 1900s during British rule. Number plates are typically issued and are formatted similarly for any motorised vehicle that runs on rubber tyres, including most road-legal private, commercial and industrial vehicles, motorcycles, emergency vehicles, and selected heavy equipment (such as agricultural tractors, truck-mounted cranes and backhoe loaders). With the exception of those issued for taxis, vehicle dealers and diplomats, all vehicle number plates in Malaysia have white characters on black background for both front and rear plates, regardless of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, purchasers of new-construction ICE {{motorized}} bicycles {{must meet}} {{a host of}} regulatory requirements and pass inspections from the DVLA and MSVA in order to register such machines for operation on public roadways.

ICE motorized bicycles that are amateur-built and meet MSVA safety and regulatory standards, and which meet the definition of low powered mopeds (engines of proven output of less than 1kW (1.34hp) and capable of 25km/h (16mph) or less) face considerably fewer regulatory requirements.|$|E

500|$|Each chapter {{begins with}} an aerial battle, {{consisting}} of a five-minute on rails shooter segment, with Pit being guided along a predetermined path. During these stages, the player moves Pit with the Circle Pad, aims with either the 3DS' stylus or face buttons, and fires with the L button. Not firing for a time allows the player to fire a powerful Charge Shot, which kills several enemies at once. Once on the ground, players have more control over Pit as he traverses through the level: Pit can either shoot enemies from a distance or attack them up close with melee attacks, while also performing various moves to dodge enemy attacks. These areas also featured more open spaces, and hidden areas unlocked when playing on certain difficulties. The main controls are carried over from aerial segments, but their assigned actions alter slightly. When an enemy strikes Pit, his health bar is depleted. This can be replenished with items scattered throughout levels. If sufficiently damaged, the health bar vanishes and Crisis Mode is activated: this will either end naturally or can be ended by fully replenishing health with a [...] "Drink of the Gods" [...] item. If Pit is defeated, the player is given the option of continuing, but an amount of Hearts are lost from the Fiend's Cauldron and the difficulty is lowered. Completing a level without dying grants additional rewards. In ground-based levels, Pit can also take control of various vehicles for short stretches, gaining special attacks unique to each <b>vehicle</b> <b>type.</b> Each stage ends in a ground-based boss battle. Pit {{has the ability to}} sprint during ground-based gameplay, but sprinting for too long uses up his stamina and leaves him vulnerable to attack.|$|E
