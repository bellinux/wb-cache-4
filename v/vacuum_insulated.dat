25|$|This {{trade-off}} {{does not}} apply to <b>vacuum</b> <b>insulated</b> glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing, as heat loss due to convection is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and conduction through the edge seal. These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete vacuum. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit having a reduced melting point. Such a glass seal is rigid, and will experience increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may prevent vacuum glazing from being used when the temperature differential is too great. One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35°C.|$|E

40|$|A {{cooldown}} of {{the inner}} vessel of the Central Calorimeter cryostat to 77 K was performed {{during the week of}} October 12 in order to 'cold shock' it, i. e., to check for <b>insulating</b> <b>vacuum</b> integrity with the inner vessel cold. The conclusion from our test results is that the vessel withstood the cold shock, and the <b>insulating</b> <b>vacuum</b> remained good. Cooldown was analyzed by J. D. Fuerst in D 0 note 3740. 000 -EN- 107, dated August 19. Warmup was analyzed by T. Peterson and B. Fitzpatrick in D 0 Engineering Note 3740. 214 -EN- 110, dated September 29. Both cooldown and warmup times were in accordance with predictions. An initial pumpdown of the <b>insulating</b> <b>vacuum</b> space was done with the vessel warm on October 9. The results of that pumpdown are shown in Figure 1 superimposed on a predicted pumpdown curve generated by Brian Fitzpatrick before the test began. After 24 hours the <b>insulating</b> <b>vacuum</b> was 7 microns. After 48 and 72 hours it was 2 - 3 microns. At this point (October 12) valving the pumps off resulted in a rise of 6 microns in 3 hours and 20 minutes, or 1. 8 microns per hour. Before beginning cooldown, the pumps were valved off and the <b>insulating</b> <b>vacuum</b> was 15 microns. Cooldown and fill began at 0900 on Tuesday, October 13. At 1650, about 8 hours later, LN{sub 2 } flow to the cryostat was shut off. A total of 2600 gallons was consumed during this period based on my readings of the trailer liquid level gauge and chart. An additional 500 gallons was used (according to the same liquid level gauge) in the final blowdown of pressure in the trailer, bringing the total to 3100 gallons. Based on weight in and weight out, 21980 pounds of LN{sub 2 } was used, or 3273 gallons of liquid. This is good enough agreement with my readings of the gauge that I will use the 2600 gallon number as our usage in the cryostat; therefore, the average flow rate for 8 hours was 325 gallons per hour or 5. 42 gallons per minute. At the end we had 1600 gallons of stored liquid in the cryostat, so 1000 gallons were consumed in cooling it down. At this time with the pumps still valved off the <b>insulating</b> <b>vacuum</b> was 13 microns. The vacuum had improved slightly while the pumps had been valved out for the entire time; no cold leakage was observed. Over the next 64 hours while draining and warmup were completed the pumps remained valved out and the vacuum rose to 170 microns, a rate of 2. 5 microns per hour, not significantly different from the 1. 8 microns per hour before the cooldown test. Except for the period of time when the drain was plugged with ice, the rate of warmup agreed very well with predicted rate. Figure 2 shows the warmup of 4 resistors in the gas space and one on the top {{of the inner}} vessel in the <b>vacuum</b> space. The <b>insulating</b> <b>vacuum</b> remained good during the cold shock, and the rate of rise after cold shock was similar to that before. The rate of warmup was in good agreement with predictions, indicating that predicted heat transfer coefficents inside the vessel were reasonably accurate (within 50 % of actual) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThere is {{currently}} a growing interest in nano-structured silica based materials due to their remarkable thermal properties. These materials are notably used in <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Insulating</b> Panels (VIP). Their exceptional insulating performances have been demonstrated experimentally for a relatively long time. But the heat transfer mechanisms occurring {{in this kind of}} materials remain relatively badly known due to the nanometric dimensions and to the complexity of the porous structure. Therefore, the present study aims to develop a numerical model for estimating the magnitude of conductive heat transfer inside nano-structured silicas using a realistic representation of their complex porous structure. The model takes into account the special porous morphology of the materials at both the nanometric and microscopic scale. Moreover, the conduction heat transfer at the nanometric scale is treated using a numerical resolution of the Boltzmann equation since the validity of the macroscopic laws is then questionable. The computations are conducted using phonon properties of silica obtained in the literature. A parametric study allows us to analyse the influence of structural characteristics and thermo-physical properties on the insulating performances and thus to highlight the most important parameters...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} design {{concept for}} aerogel vacuum thermal-insulation panels calls {{for multiple layers}} of aerogel sandwiched between layers of aluminized Mylar (or equivalent) poly(ethylene terephthalate), as depicted in the figure. This concept is applicable to both the rigid (brick) form and the flexible (blanket) form of aerogel vacuum thermal-insulation panels. Heretofore, the fabrication of a typical aerogel <b>vacuum</b> <b>insulating</b> panel has involved encapsulation of a single layer of aerogel in poly(ethylene terephthalate) and pumping of gases out of the aerogel-filled volume. A multilayer panel according to the improved design concept is fabricated in basically the same way: Multiple alternating layers of aerogel and aluminized poly(ethylene terephthalate) are assembled, then encapsulated in an outer layer of poly(ethylene terephthalate), and then the volume containing the multilayer structure is evacuated as in the single-layer case. The multilayer concept {{makes it possible to}} reduce effective thermal conductivity of a panel below that of a comparable single-layer panel, without adding weight or incurring other performance penalties. Implementation of the multilayer concept is simple and relatively inexpensive, involving only a few additional fabrication steps to assemble the multiple layers prior to evacuation.
