40|$|Preoperative {{information}} concerning the severity and etiology of MR {{is very important for}} selecting the most appropriate surgical strategy. Ruptured chordae tendineae (RCT) {{are one of the most}} important preoperative findings. We compared the diagnostic power of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to detect RCT in patients with MR. We studied 61 patients with MR (30 men, 31 women; mean age, 61 ± 12 years) who underwent mitral valve repair or replacement. Both TTE and TEE were performed before the operations, and the sensitivity and specificity of TTE and TEE to detect RCT were determined. In addition, other factors that influenced the detection of RCT by these two methods were investigated. At the time of an operation, RCT was confirmed in 39 of 61 cases. Transesophageal echocardiography had a higher sensitivity than TTE (74 % versus 44 %; P = 0. 006) to detect RCT, although the specificity was not significantly different. In patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 22 (P = 0. 023) or MR grade 4 (P = 0. 026), TEE had a significantly higher diagnostic sensitivity than TTE, although there was no significant difference in patients with BMI < 22 or MR grade ≤ 3. In the lateral and medial segments of the mitral <b>valve,</b> <b>TEE</b> had a significantly higher diagnostic sensitivity to detect RCT than TTE (P = 0. 0012), although there was no significant difference in the middle segments. There was no significant difference between TTE and TEE with respect to the sensitivity to detect RCT in myxomatous mitral valves. Although the sensitivity of TEE was higher than that of TTE to detect RCT, it was affected by BMI, MR grade, the RCT-presenting segments, and the etiology of MR...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{compare the}} {{accuracy}} of multidetector computed tomographic (CT) measurements of the aortic valve area (AVA) with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and cine magnetic resonance (MR) measurements of this area for preoperative examination of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After giving informed consent for the institutional review board-approved study protocol, 48 patients (33 men, 15 women; mean age, 62 years+/- 13 [standard deviation]) with (n= 27) or without (n= 21) aortic stenosis underwent multidetector CT, cine MR, TTE, and TEE before undergoing cardiac surgery. AVAs derived with manual planimetry by using cine short-axis multidetector CT, MR, and TEE images obtained through the aortic valve were compared among {{each other and with}} AVAs measured by using continuity equation TTE at regression and Bland-Altman analyses. The diagnostic accuracy of multidetector CT for detection of aortic stenosis was compared with that of TTE by using kappa statistics and receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: Multidetector CT-derived AVA correlated highly with MR-derived (r= 0. 98, P. 99) or TEE planimetery (2. 5 cm 2 +/- 1. 7, P=. 21) AVAs, but they were significantly larger than TTE-derived AVAs (2. 0 cm 2 +/- 1. 5, P or= 1. 2 cm 2 and or= 0. 8 cm 2 and < 1. 2 cm 2), and 10 of 11 severely stenotic (AVA< 0. 8 cm 2) valves.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether planimetry of the aortic valve opening using multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is accurate, 46 consecutive patients (pts) suffering from calcific aortic stenosis (AS) {{were enrolled in}} a prospective study. All the pts, 26 M, 20 F, aged 67 ± 11 yrs (43 to 81) had a transthoracic (TTE) and a multiplane TEE using a 5 MHz annular mechanical probe (Vingmed, Norway), within 24 hours before catheterization (cath.). At TTE, aortic valve area (AVA) was calculated by the continuity equation (CE). At TEE, AVA was measured by planimetry of the orifice in a short axis view, obtained with a 40 to 70 ° rotation of the imaging plane from the initial plane, with thorough searching of the smallest orifice as possible in early systole.

40|$|Background: Echocardiography {{has been}} a popular {{modality}} used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) with the modified Duke criteria. We evaluated the necessity between the uses of either a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in patients with a body mass index (BMI) {{greater than or equal to}} 25 kg/m 2 and less than 25 kg/m 2. Methods: A single-centered, retrospective study of 198 patients between 2005 and 2012 diagnosed with IE based on modified Duke criteria. Patients, required to be above age 18, had undergone an echocardiogram study and had blood cultures to be included in the study. Results: Among 198 patients, two echocardiographic groups were evaluated as 158 patients obtained a TTE, 143 obtained a TEE, and 103 overlapped with TEE and TTE. Out of these patients, 167 patients were included in the study as 109 (65 %) were discovered to have native <b>valve</b> vegetations on <b>TEE</b> and 58 (35 %) with TTE. TTE findings were compared with TEE results for true negatives and positives to isolate valvular vegetations. Overall sensitivity of TTE was calculated to be 67 % with a specificity of 93 %. Patients were further divided into two groups with the first group having a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 and the subsequent group with a BMI < 25 kg/m 2. Patients with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 who underwent a TTE study had a sensitivity and specificity of 54 and 92 %, respectively. On the contrary, patients with a BMI < 25 kg/m 2 had a TTE sensitivity and specificity of 78 and 95 %, respectively. Conclusions: Patients with a BMI < 25 kg/m 2 and a negative TTE should refrain from further diagnostic studies, with TEE strong clinical judgment is warranted. Patients with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 may proceed directly to TEE as the initial study, possibly avoiding an additional study with a TTE...|$|R
40|$|This report calculates {{the effect}} of the conductances of the pumping lines on the pumping speeds of the vacuum pumps being used to pump the inner vessel, and annular space, vacuum tight during the CC Cryostat testing. Effective pumping speeds were {{calculated}} for various values of pressure via the above stated formulas (see calculations). Conductances of <b>valves,</b> elbows, and <b>tees</b> were calculated with the help of ref. 1, and the volumes of the inner vessel and annular space were calculated wtth the aid of ref. 2. The major results of these calculations follow. The attached graphs show the effective pumping speed vs. pressure, as well as the pressure vs. pumpdown time for both the inner vessel pumpdown and the annular space pumpdown. Many intervals of pressure were chosen in order to give a complete picture of the effects on the pumping speed, and pumpdown time. An important rule of thumb is that the effective pumping speed be close to the intrinsic pump speed in the region of interest for the best efficiency. With an infinite conductance, these quantities become equal. In the case of the annular space pumpdown. the effective pumping speed is within approximately 15 % of the intrinsic pump speed for pressures down to 6000 {mu}, and at that point, the conductance effects slow the system down and provide a 49 % difference at 1000 {mu}. To Improve these numbers, the line length must be shortened, or even better, the line diameter increased. As far as pumpdown time is concerned, the actual pumpdown was completed in a reasonable amount of time, and would have been even better if the pumping system did not lag due to a leaK and its repair time. The inner vessel pumpdown shows a pumpdown time near 1 hour to reach 100 {mu} pressure. The effective pumping speed matches to within 10 % of the intrinsic pump speed to 6000 {mu}, and then the conductance effects become more important and provide a 41 % difference at 1000 {mu}. The actual pumpdown was completed in a reasonable amount of time which demonstrates that the pump used was in fact adequate for this application...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{summarize}} the surgical experience gained from robotic mitral valve replacement (MVR), and demonstrate the long-term clinical follow-up results. Methods From Jan. 2007 to Jan. 2015, more than 700 patients underwent {{various types of}} robotic cardiac surgery in the Department the authors served in, and of them 43 patients underwent robotic MVR with da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, USA). Among the 43 patients, the average age was 47 ± 11 years (ranged 19 - 65 years), and sex ratio (female to male) was 0. 8 : 1. Six patients were with heart function of NYHA class Ⅰ, 30 patients were of NYHA class Ⅱ and 7 patients were of NYHA class Ⅲ. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were 54 %- 78 % (64. 0 %± 7. 1 %), and 20 patients had atrial fibrillation on admission, and 35 patients were with rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS). Atrial septal defect (0. 7 cm in size) co-existed in 1 case and 1 patient had mild aortic regurgitation. Mechanical or bioprosthetic mitral valve was replaced via left atriotomy by using da Vinci robotic surgical system after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) set-up. Radiopaque titan clips was employed by Cor-Knot knot-tying device (LSI Solutions, Inc, Victor, NY) to anchor the prosthetic <b>valve.</b> Trans-esophageal echocardiography (<b>TEE)</b> was performed before and after surgery. The operative data were collected and patients were followed up at outpatient clinic regularly up to 6 years. Results All cases were performed successfully with the same surgery. No conversion to median sternotomy or operative mortality occurred. The average operation time was 292 ± 62 minutes (ranged 140 - 450 minutes) with CPB time of 124 ± 26 minutes and aortic occlusion time of 88 ± 21 minutes. The postoperative mechanical ventilation support time was continued for 15 ± 6 hours, and the average staying length in critical care unit was 4 ± 1 days. No myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia or excessive bleeding was complicated. All patients were successfully followed up for a median of 3. 5 years (ranged 1 month to 6 years). In the follow-up period, no incidence of death, stroke, re-operation due to prosthetic endocarditis or prosthetic failure was reported. However, 39. 5 % (n= 17) patients still had atrial fibrillation after surgery. Conclusion Robotic MVR is a safe and effective procedure with excellent long term surgical outcome.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the impact of changes in flow on aortic valve area (AVA) as measured by the Gorlin formula and transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) planimetry. Background. The meaning of flow-related changes in AVA calculations using the Gorlin formula in patients with aortic stenosis remains controversial. It has been suggested that flow dependence of the calculated area could be due to a true widening of the orifice as flow increases or to a disproportionate flow dependence of the formula itself. Alternatively, anatomic AVA can be measured by direct planimetry of the <b>valve</b> orifice with <b>TEE.</b> Methods. Simultaneous measurement of the planimetered and Gorlin valve area was performed intraoperatively under different hemodynamic conditions in 11 patients. Left ventricular and ascending aortic pressures were measured simultaneously after transventricular and aortic punctures. Changes in flow were induced by dobutamine infusion. Using multiplane TEE, AVA was planimetered at the level of the leaflet tips in the short-axis view. Results. Overall, cardiac output, stroke volume and transvalvular volume flow rate ranged from 2. 5 to 7. 3 liters/min, from 43 to 86 ml and from 102 to 306 ml/min, respectively. During dobutamine infusion, cardiac output increased by 42 % and mean aortic valve gradient by 54 %. When minimal flow was compared with maximal flow, the Gorlin area varied from (mean ± SD) 0. 44 ± 0. 12 to 0. 60 ± 0. 14 cm 2 (p < 0. 005). The mean change in Gorlin area under different flow rates was 36 ± 32 %. Despite these changes, there was no significant change in the planimetered area when minimal flow was compared with maximal flow. The mean difference in planimetered area under different flow rates was 0. 002 ± 0. 01 cm 2 (p = 0. 86). Conclusions. By simultaneous determination of Gorlin formula and <b>TEE</b> planimetry <b>valve</b> areas, we showed that acute changes in transvalvular volume flow substantially altered valve area calculated by the Gorlin formula but did not result in significant alterations of the anatomic valve area in aortic stenosis. These results suggest that the flow-related variation in the Gorlin AVA is due to a disproportionate flow dependence of the formula itself and not a true change in valve area.
