5|$|As {{the state}} religion, Saivism enjoyed all the prerogatives of the {{establishment}} {{during the period of}} the Jaffna kingdom. The Aryacakravarti dynasty was <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> its duties as a patron towards Saivism because of the patronage given by its ancestors to the Rameswaram temple, a well-known pilgrimage center of Indian Hinduism. As noted, one of the titles assumed by the kings was Setukavalan or protector of Setu another name for Rameswaram. Setu was used in their coins as well as in inscriptions as marker of the dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Turkish Prime-Minister İsmet İnönü was <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> {{foreign policy}} issues. During {{the second half}} of the 1930s, Atatürk tried to form a closer {{relationship}} with Britain. The risks of this policy change put the two men at odds. The Hatay issue and the Lyon agreement were two important developments in foreign policy that played a significant role in the severing of relations between Atatürk and İnönü.|$|E
25|$|It further {{indicates}} that Braham was <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> his market, {{more so than}} he was for the purity of his art. In this {{of course he was}} no different from his many Gentile colleagues, and Mount Edgcumbe deplores him for his betrayal of art, not for his origins. However similar arguments against other musicians of Jewish origin were however also later to be given specific anti-Jewish spins in continental Europe.|$|E

50|$|The {{subtleties}} of harmony and counterpoint in Gesualdo’s musical language, the expressive dissonances and chromaticisms, the <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> use <b>of</b> word painting and of symbolic numbers in his religious pieces, “Such {{a collection of}} codes … paves {{the way for a}} more intensive examination of the Passion message” halfway between liturgy and multimedia.|$|R
60|$|Surprise overspread Gonzaga's face. He {{seemed about}} to speak, and checked, {{and his eyes were}} very searchingly bent upon Galeotto's face, which {{remained}} inscrutable as stone. Then the Governor looked at me, and from me back again at Galeotto. At last he smiled, whilst I bowed before him, but <b>very</b> vaguely <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> what might impend.|$|R
25|$|Similarly, The Queen v Epifania Suluape (2002) NZCA 6, {{deals with}} a wife who pleaded {{provocation}} after she killed her husband with an axe when he proposed to leave her for another woman. There was some evidence of neglect, humiliation, and abuse but the court concluded that this was exaggerated. On appeal, the court was <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> the Samoan culture in New Zealand in restricting {{the power of the}} wife to act independently of her husband and reduced her sentence for manslaughter to five years.|$|E
25|$|He also is {{the only}} Baldrick to confront Blackadder after being hit; he does so on one occasion, and is <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> class divisions. While this briefly attracts him to the ideals of Bolshevism, he is just as willing to marry General Melchett if it allows him to escape his lower-class status. His family seem to worship Lord Flashheart, declaring that they all took up smoking to collect {{cigarette}} cards bearing his image and that his grandmother smoked herself to death so they could afford the album.|$|E
25|$|During {{inquiries}} into {{natural gas}} exports in the 1950s, the ERCB recommended {{the creation of}} a province-wide natural gas gathering system. The thinking behind this idea was twofold: first, it would be more efficient to develop a single gathering system than to let gathering systems evolve piecemeal. Second, such a system would eliminate the possibility of federal regulation of gas within the province. Alberta was jealous of its hard-won control over natural resources and saw gas transportation within the province as an aspect of resource management. The province was also <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> the potential of natural gas and its products for provincial industrial development.|$|E

5000|$|The Arthurian {{hypothesis}} {{can perhaps}} be countered by strong {{indications that the}} author has delivered a <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> melding <b>of</b> various other medieval folkloric and more formal story telling themes, characters and plot devices. The proto Arthurian characters are rather a [...] "pre-working" [...] of the later romance and still distinct from that tale. Similarly the Ska are repeatedly described as pre-Viking, and indeed pre-Neanderthal, giving them a far richer presence than “cruel Viking raiders”.|$|R
60|$|With {{difficulty}} I obeyed him. Presently I stood {{within that}} clean, bright kitchen--on the <b>very</b> hearth--trembling, sickening; <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> an aspect {{in the last}} degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. The two ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at me.|$|R
25|$|Many of the {{problems}} encountered will benefit from special attention, as problems are often related more to “input and output” issues than to intellectual impairment. Problems with eye movement control {{make it difficult for}} people with A-T to read, yet most fully understand the meaning and nuances of text that is read to them. Delays in speech initiation and lack of facial expression make it seem that they do not know the answers to questions. Reduction of the skilled effort needed to answer questions, and an increase of the time available to respond, is often rewarded by real accomplishment. It {{is important to recognize that}} intellectual disability is not regularly a part of the clinical picture of A-T although school performance may be suboptimal because of the many difficulties in reading, writing, and speech. Children with A-T are often <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> their appearance, and strive to appear normal to their peers and teachers. Life within the ataxic body can be tiring. The enhanced effort needed to maintain appearances and increased energy expended in abnormal tone and extra movements all contribute to physical and mental fatigue. As a consequence, for some a shortened school day yields real benefits.|$|E
500|$|Wilcke {{had been}} nicknamed [...] "Fürst" [...] (prince) by his comrades {{on account of}} his {{attitude}} towards his men and paternal sense of responsibility. He had also been <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> his style and appearance and wore a very expensive and custom tailored leather coat, a trade which also added to his perception and fostered the nickname. His funeral ceremony was held at the airfield in München-Gladbach. Among others, the funeral ceremony was attended by his stepfather. Wilcke was buried in the honor section of the cemetery in Mönchengladbach-Holt.|$|E
500|$|In {{academic}} works, {{the diversity}} of the Spectrum personnel in terms of both race and gender has been viewed highly. Bould praises the series for its [...] "beautiful, multiethnic, female Angel fighter pilots" [...] and [...] "secondary roles played by capable women." [...] In an interview conducted in 2003, Anderson confirmed that a conscious effort was made to feature ethnic minorities: [...] "...I think people who make television programmes have a responsibility, particularly when children are watching avidly and you know their minds can be affected almost irreversibly as they grow up.We were <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> introducing different ethnic backgrounds." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{orthodontic}} treatment of Class III malocclusion with a maxillary deficiency is often treated with maxillary protraction either {{with or without}} maxillary expansion. The routine procedure for rapid maxillary expansion includes banding on first premolars/first deciduous molars and the permanent first molars. However in some patients who are esthetically <b>very</b> <b>conscious,</b> banding <b>of</b> the first premolar {{would not be a}} good esthetic option. So for such circumstances we have designed a modified hyrax splint, which does not need the first premolars to be banded...|$|R

50|$|The couple {{met when}} Nero was only 17, and their {{reportedly}} emotional, passionate relationship lasted {{at least three}} years. Nero expressed the desire to marry Acte and had a genealogy fabricated linking her royalty; he even bribed ex-consuls to prepare to swear to her royal birthright, a move that enraged his mother Agrippina, who was <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> and proud <b>of</b> her own, well-established patrician ancestry.|$|R
500|$|When {{running along}} Blackpool's beach, at 7 am, {{no matter the}} weather, Matthews wore shoes that {{contained}} lead, {{so that when he}} changed into his football boots, his feet felt light, giving himself the impression that he could run faster. Having trained to a level of fitness few other players would reach, by the mid-1950s he was able to cut back on his intense training as his level of fitness was by then ingrained in his body. He never smoked; instead, he was <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> every item of food and drink he consumed, and he maintained a rigid daily training regime from childhood up until his old age. In an interview with the FA he said, [...] "I had some very good advice and started to eat more salads and fruit, and every Monday I had no food. Just one day, on a Monday, but I felt better." [...] The only time he knowingly consumed alcohol was when drinking champagne out of the FA Cup in 1953.|$|E
500|$|A {{month before}} {{she made her}} debut on-screen, Toyah was {{described}} as being Janice's (Vicky Entwistle) fourteen-year-old illegitimate daughter, who would become [...] "the scourge of every Weatherfield Comprehensive teacher". During {{an interview with the}} Daily Record's Polly Graham, Taylor stated [...] "Toyah's gobby and cocky and makes her parents' life a misery. But it's brilliant playing her, it's more fun than playing somebody nice." [...] Graham explained that both Toyah and her stepsister, Leanne (Jane Danson) were well known to the police for under-age drinking and burglary. Taylor said that she hated her character's clothes, as they were too revealing for her. She explained [...] "In the beginning, the clothes that Toyah wore were terrible. I was <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> my bum hanging out from these tiny mini-skirts. There are a lot of girls who wear those tarty skirts, but I never felt comfortable in that sort of thing." [...] Taylor also disliked Toyah's make-up, which was initially bright pink lipstick, a lot of black eyeliner and no foundation.|$|E
500|$|A special {{interview}} with Ohkawa and Kiichiro Sugawara, Clamp's editor from the Weekly Shōnen Magazines Editorial Department, took {{place after the}} story of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle had progressed past the arc from Ōto Country. Ohkawa has stated that the group is <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> the fact that Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle is the title in Shōnen Magazine with the youngest readership {{and that it is}} their very first foray into the shōnen demographic. Thus, the members of Clamp ensure that they employ a drawing style and dialogue appropriate for young male audiences; the manga incorporates furigana that makes reading Japanese easier. To aid in this effort, the group holds conferences with Sugawara where they discuss the plot. Ohkawa stated during the interview that the only time the story significantly changed was during Country of Jade arc; It went from a [...] "horror story with vampires" [...] to a [...] "detective mystery". Following the story in the Piffle Country, Clamp aimed to make the series darker and more complex, resulting in it receiving elements previously seen in other of their series. The Shura Country's story was written to introduce the idea that a dead person cannot be revived even if somebody travels back to the past and changes history. This theme would be further explored later in the story.|$|E
50|$|William III rewarded Presbyterian {{support against}} James II (James VII of Scotland) with an {{increase}} in the regium donum. From the 1690s, Presbyterian congregations, now organised in the Synod of Ulster, enjoyed practical freedom of religion, confirmed by the Toleration Act of 1719. However, their members remained <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> both <b>of</b> continuing legal disabilities under the penal laws and of economic hardship as many were tenant farmers and objected to the payment of tithes to support the Church of Ireland. Throughout the eighteenth century, many Presbyterians were involved in movements for reform, which culminated with their prominent involvement in the United Irishmen.|$|R
5000|$|His {{second album}} for Studio One, Rocking Time {{featured}} bass guitarist Leroy Sibbles and drummer Leroy [...] "Horsemouth" [...] Wallace.

2500|$|Fashion {{is widely}} {{considered}} {{to be part of}} the goth subculture, however in Toronto, [...] "goth" [...] was an outgrowth of what was already a <b>very</b> fashion <b>conscious</b> subsection <b>of</b> the [...] "freak" [...] subculture (see History), and since then, fashion predominantly tended to define [...] "goth" [...] in Toronto. The Toronto mainstream culture media reported that fashion was the most appealing facet of the goth scene.|$|R
500|$|Brisco {{was criticized}} early {{on for the}} {{violence}} it portrayed; meant to be comical, a scene in the pilot in which four villains accidentally kill {{each other in a}} crossfire troubled critics instead. Cuse insisted that the show was still appropriate for children, saying, [...] "I think we're <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> violence and I think we've made an effort to avoid violence in the pilot and in the future episodes". Halfway through the season, U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan singled out Brisco as the most violent show on television based on a study at Minnesota's Concordia University, in which students watched 132 hours of network and cable programming, during the week of September 28 to October 4, 1993. The students tallied each act of violence, and found that Brisco had 117 violent acts per hour. The study deemed Brisco more violent than the film Beverly Hills Cop, which was also viewed for the study. Cuse called the criticism [...] "patently ridiculous", noting that only one episode of the show was viewed, in which a boxing match takes place. Each punch and jab was counted as an act of violence. Cuse spoke out against legislation to curb television violence, saying that politicians were [...] "chasing a false objective". He said it was the job of a show's producer to control the moral content of a television program and the parents' duty to monitor what their children watch.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Moore and Black quit {{their old}} band, the Starlite Wranglers, {{to play with}} Presley regularly, and DJ and {{promoter}} Bob Neal became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club and returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions, and Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, [...] "His movement was a natural thing, {{but he was also}} <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick." [...] Presley made what would be his only appearance on Nashville's Grand Ole Opry on October 2; after a polite audience response, Opry manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was [...] "not bad" [...] but did not suit the program. Two weeks later, Presley was booked on Louisiana Hayride, the Oprys chief, and more adventurous, rival. The Shreveport-based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. Presley had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response. House drummer D. J. Fontana brought a new element, complementing Presley's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs. Soon after the show, the Hayride engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), he purchased a Martin instrument for $175, and his trio began playing in new locales including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Anthony Kaufman, Panahi said: [...] "I was <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> not trying to play with people's emotions; we were not trying to create tear-jerking scenes. So it engages people's intellectual side. But this is with assistance from the emotional aspect and {{a combination of the}} two." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} her quite distinctly at this time. The light that slanted through the oriel of St. Dives choir was wont to fall very tenderly on her beautiful head with its stacked masses of deerskin-colored hair, {{on the low}} black arches of her brows, and to deepen the pretty fringes that shaded her eyes of Genoa velvet. Very pleasant it was to watch the opening and shutting of that small straight mouth, with its quick revelation of little white teeth, {{and to see the}} foolish blood faintly deepen her satin cheek as you watched. For Mrs. Tretherick was <b>very</b> sweetly <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> admiration, and, like most pretty women, gathered herself under your eye like a racer under the spur.|$|R
5000|$|Billboard was {{enthusiastic}} in its {{description of}} the album. [...] "Johnny Mathis's return to the Columbia label purrs with the rich, romantic tones that suspend the <b>very</b> sensation <b>of</b> <b>conscious</b> listening." [...] A few tracks in particular stood out for them. [...] "'Up, Up and Away', 'Misty Roses', and 'I Won't Cry Anymore' are soothed and coated with Mathis's seamless style - music running together like prefabricated daydreams padded {{with a feeling of}} luxury.|$|R
40|$|Una perspectiva narratológica, abierta a otros puntos de vista cuando parecen fructíferos, nos ha servido para acercarnos a Dafnis y Cloe de Longo, para interrogar al texto acerca, precisamente, de los permanentes desdobles de su autor en cuanto enunciador y narrador. El objetivo que guía nuestro trabajo es aportar elementos para sostener que las claves de lectura no están en la verosimilitud erótica de la trama o en la verdad de la naturaleza que hace de escenario, sino en la muy consciente función de un escritor que se desdobla en una polifonía oculta tras la monocorde voz del narrador extradiegético. A {{narrative}} perspective, open {{to other}} {{points of view}} when they seem fruitful, has served us to approach Longus' Daphnis and Chloe to interrogate the text about, precisely, the permanent splittings of its author into enunciator and narrator.

2500|$|But he {{was always}} <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> the {{insecurity}} of his social position and this may explain the extreme personal and professional recklessness which he displayed throughout his life. [...] Whether jumping into the River Mersey to rescue the drowning man, entering the Egyptian soldiers' camp or leading {{the assault on the}} walls of Zhenjiang, the impression left was that he was potentially willing to risk or even honorably sacrifice his life if the opportunity arose in order to demonstrate that he was as good as, or better, than his legitimate contemporaries.|$|E
2500|$|Selma {{had both}} {{moderate}} and hardline segregationists in its white power structure. [...] The newly elected Mayor Joseph Smitherman was a moderate who hoped to attract Northern business investment, {{and he was}} <b>very</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> the city's image. Smitherman appointed veteran lawman Wilson Baker to head the city's 30-man police force. Baker believed that the most effective method of undermining civil rights protests was to de-escalate them and deny them publicity, as Police Chief Laurie Pritchett had done against the Albany Movement in Georgia. He earned what {{was described as a}} grudging respect from activists.|$|E
6000|$|But Thoroughbung rode home high in spirits, <b>very</b> proud, and <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> {{having done}} good work.

Harry Annesley was {{on one side of}} him, and on the other rode Mr. Florin, the banker. [...] "He's an abominable liar!" [...] said Thoroughbung, [...] "a wicked, wretched liar!" [...] He was alluding to the Hitchiner's whip, whom in his wrath he had nearly sent to another world. [...] "He says that one of his hounds got into the covert, but I was there and saw it all. Not a nose was over the little bank which runs between the field and the covert." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was like}} dreaming of the {{sunshine}} and awaking in the moonlight. Adam had seen Dinah several times, but {{always at the}} Hall Farm, where he was not <b>very</b> vividly <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> any woman's presence except Hetty's, and he had {{only in the last}} day or two begun to suspect that Seth was in love with her, so that his attention had not hitherto been drawn towards her for his brother's sake. But now her slim figure, her plain black gown, and her pale serene face impressed him with all the force that belongs to a reality contrasted with a preoccupying fancy. For the first moment or two he made no answer, but looked at her with the concentrated, examining glance which a man gives to an object in which he has suddenly begun to be interested. Dinah, {{for the first time in}} her life, felt a painful self-consciousness; there was something in the dark penetrating glance of this strong man so different from the mildness and timidity of his brother Seth. A faint blush came, which deepened as she wondered at it. This blush recalled Adam from his forgetfulness.|$|R
40|$|Psychology was {{originally}} formulated as {{the science of}} the psyche, i. e. the subjective side of the mind / brain barrier. However time and again it has been diverted from this objective in the supposed interest of scientific rigor. The Behaviorists proposed to transform psychology to a science of behavior, and today the Neuroreductionists propose to transform it to a science of neurophysiology. In the process they attempt to deny the <b>very</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>conscious</b> experience as valid object of scientific scrutiny. However the subjective conscious experience is a primary source of evidence for {{the nature of the}} representation in the brain. I propose a quantitative phenomenolgy to express the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>conscious</b> experience in information theoretic terms. This approach leads to interesting observations of the properties of phenomenal perspective, that clearly reveal the phenomenal world as an internal rather than external entity...|$|R
