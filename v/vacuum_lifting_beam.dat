40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{document}} {{the results of the}} 150 % rated capacity load test performed by DynCorp Hoisting and Rigging on the CASTOR GSF special cask <b>lifting</b> <b>beams.</b> The two <b>lifting</b> <b>beams</b> were originally rated and tested at 20, 000 kg (44, 000 lb) by the cask manufacturer in Germany. The testing performed by DynCorp rated and tested the <b>lifting</b> <b>beams</b> to 30, 000 kg (66, 000 lb) + 0 %, - 5 %, for Hanford Site use. The CASTOR GSF cask, used to transport isotopic Heat Sources (canisters), must be lifted with its own designed <b>lifting</b> <b>beam</b> system (Figures 1, 2, and 3). As designed, the beam material is RSt 37 - 2 (equivalent to American Society for Testing and Materials [ASTM] A- 570), the eye plate is St 52 - 2 (equivalent to ASTM A- 516), and the lifting pin is St 50 (equivalent to ASTM A- 515). The beam has two opposing 58 mm (2. 3 in.) diameter by 120 mm(4. 7 in.) length, high grade steel pins that engage the cask for lifting. The pins have a manual locking mechanism to prevent disengagement from the casks. The static, gross weight (loaded) of the cask 18, 640 kg (41, 000 lb) on the pins prevents movement of the pins during lifting. This is due to the frictional force of the cask on the pins when lifting begins...|$|R

40|$|Title of the paper: Investigation on {{occupational}} behaviour {{of female}} and castrated male fattening pigs In four rounds 144 fattening pigs {{of both sexes}} were brought in four pens (two of them were littered, two without any litter). Their occupational behaviour was recorded {{at the time of}} bringing the pigs into the pen, at the beginning, at the middle {{and at the end of}} the fattening period using an infrared-video-technology and a time lapse video recorder. In every pen three occupational tools (pendular beam, cross of chains and <b>lifting</b> <b>beam)</b> were offered to the pigs. At the 1 st recording the behaviour of all pigs was analysed, at the other fattening periods the behaviour of six focal pigs of both sexes per pen was analysed always over 24 h. At the time the pigs were brought into the pens no significant differences between the two sexes could be observed concerning the latency until the pigs had the first contact to the different occupational tools, whereas both sexes needed longest for their first contact to the cross of chains. During the other fattening periods the duration of occupation with the cross of chains (♂= 0. 06 %; ♀= 0. 08 %, p< 0. 086) and the pendular beam (♂= 0. 15 %; ♀= 0. 2 %, p< 0. 087) by the female pigs tended to be longer than the one shown by the castrated male pigs. Thereby both sexes used the cross of chains longer for occupation than the pendular <b>beam</b> and the <b>lifting</b> <b>beam.</b> The female pigs occupied themselves significantly longer with the straw in the littered pens, the floor in the pens without straw, the pen’s equipment and the pen mates than the castrated male pigs did.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>lift,</b> solar powered water pump is discussed. The basic design consists of an expanding gaseous piston confined inside a chamber which is located in series with, and between an inlet and an outlet check value.

The volatile fluid is not expended in the pumping process. The pumps constructed on this project have a capacity of approximately 6 liters/minute when pumped to a height of 2 meters.

An additional safety feature is a mechanical vacuum monitoring device that is set to emit a shrill tone if the system vacuum falls below 24 in. Hg.

A self-administered questionnaire on musculoskeletal complaints was used. The introduction of a hydraulic clamp or <b>vacuum</b> <b>lift</b> to assist roadmakers while laying a brick-paved road reduced the team's work time in a kneeling/squatting position with 43 - 52 % and frequency of lifting loads of 5 - 15 kg and above 15 kg with 46 - 59 % and 84 - 88 %, respectively. The introduction of a mixing machine with a pump system during pouring of sand-cement floors reduced the frequency of lifting loads with 66 % for 5 - 15 kg and 15 % for over 15 kg, but had no discernable effect oil awkward back postures. The use of a silo/truck with automated pump system also reduced the frequency of lifting with 32 % and 38 %, respectively, but increased the duration in awkward back postures with 13 %, primarily due to the hodman partly working as floor layer. Floor layers and hodmen using the mechanical equipment reported a lower prevalence of low back pain in the past 6 months and also less associated sick leave.
