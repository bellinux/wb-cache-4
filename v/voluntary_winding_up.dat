25|$|An {{accounting}} period ends {{and a new}} one begins with the commencement of a <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> For this purpose a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company, or on the presentation of a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose {{in the case of}} a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986.|$|R

2500|$|Businesses, and {{the banks}} who had {{previously}} enjoyed uncompromised priority for their security, increasingly looked for ways to circumvent {{the effect of the}} insolvency legislation's scheme of priorities. A floating charge, in order for its value to be ascertained, must have [...] "crystallised" [...] into a fixed charge on some particular date, usually set by agreement. Before the date of crystallisation (given the charge merely [...] "floats" [...] over no particular property) there is the possibility that a company could both charge out property to creditors with priority, or that other creditors could set-off claims against property subject to the (uncrystallised) floating charge. Furthermore, other security interests (such as a contractual lien) will take priority to a crystallised floating charge if it arises before in time. But after crystallisation, assets received by the company can be caught by the charge. One way for companies to gain priority with floating charges originally was to stipulate in the charge agreement that the charge would convert from [...] "floating" [...] to [...] "fixed" [...] automatically on some event before the date of insolvency. According to the default rules at common law, floating charges impliedly crystallise when a receiver is appointed, if a business ceases or is sold, if a company is would up, or if {{under the terms of the}} debenture provision is made for crystallisation on reasonable notice from the charge holder. However an automatic crystallisation clause would mean that at the time of insolvency - when preferential creditors' claims are determined - there would be no floating charge above which preferential creditors could be elevated. The courts held that it was legitimate for security agreements to have this effect. In Re Brightlife Ltd Brightlife Ltd had contracted with its bank, Norandex, to allow a floating charge to be converted to a fixed charge on notice, and this was done one week before a <b>voluntary</b> <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> resolution. Against the argument that public policy should restrict the events allowing for crystallisation, Hoffmann J held that in his view it was not [...] "open to the courts to restrict the contractual freedom of parties to a floating charge on such grounds." [...] Parliament, however, intervened to state in the Insolvency Act 1986 section 251 that if a charge was created as a floating charge, it would deem to remain a floating charge at the point of insolvency, regardless of whether it had crystallised.|$|E
2500|$|Liquidation is the final, most frequent, {{and most}} basic {{insolvency}} procedure. Since registered companies became {{available to the}} investing public, the Joint Stock Companies Winding-Up Act 1844 and all its successors contained a route for a company's life {{to be brought to}} an end. The basic purpose of liquidation is to conclude a company's activities and to sell off assets (i.e. [...] "liquidate", turn goods into [...] "liquid assets" [...] or money) to pay creditors, or shareholders if any value remains. Either the company (its shareholders or directors) can initiate the process through a [...] "voluntary liquidation", or the creditors can force it through a [...] "compulsory liquidation". In urgent circumstances, a provisional liquidation order can also be granted if there is a serious threat to dissipation of a company's assets: in this case, a company may not be notified. By contrast, a voluntary liquidation begins if the company's members vote to liquidate with a 75 per cent special resolution. If the directors can make a statutory declaration that the company is solvent, the directors or shareholders remain in control, but if the company is insolvent, the creditors will control the <b>voluntary</b> <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> Otherwise, a [...] "compulsory liquidation" [...] may be initiated by either the directors, the company, some shareholders or creditors bringing a petition for winding up to the court. In principle, almost any member (this is usually shareholders, but can also be anyone registered on the company's member list) can bring a petition for liquidation to begin, so long as they have held shares for over six months, or there is only one shareholder. In Re Peveril Gold Mines Ltd Lord Lindley MR held that a company could not obstruct a member's right to bring a petition by requiring that two directors consented or the shareholder had over 20 per cent of share capital. A member's right to bring a petition cannot be changed by a company constitution. However, in Re Rica Gold Washing Co the Court of Appeal invented an extra-statutory requirement that a member must have a sufficient amount of money (£75 was insufficient) invested before bringing a petition. For creditors to bring a petition, there must simply be proof that the creditor is owed a debt that is due. In Mann v Goldstein the incorporated hairdressing and wig business, with shops in Pinner and Haverstock Hill, of two married couples broke down in acrimony. Goldstein and his company petitioned for winding up, claiming unpaid directors fees and payment for a wig delivery, but Mann argued that Goldstein had received the fees through ad hoc payments and another company owed money for the wigs. Ungoed Thomas J held the winding-up petition was not the place to decide the debt actually existed, and it would be an abuse of process to continue.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues arising in {{cross-border}} or international insolvency is the local recognition and effect of concurrent foreign insolvency proceedings.
