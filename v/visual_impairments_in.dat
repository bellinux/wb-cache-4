The study addressed three objectives including {{the extent to which}} the implementation of PEDP has improved the enrolment of children with hearing and <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> the inclusive primary schools in Tanzania. The other objectives were; to examine challenges facing the teaching and learning materials for pupils with hearing and <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> inclusive schools after the introduction of PEDP and finally assessing the adequacy and relevance of the teaching and learning materials for pupils with hearing and <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> inclusive schools. The major findings revealed that the effectiveness of PEDP had little impact on the enrolment rates of the children with <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> the inclusive classrooms in Tanzania. The teaching and learning for Children with Disability (CWD) in inclusive classrooms was facing challenges associated with lack of trained teachers for inclusive schools, poor school buildings design and lack of teaching and learning materials for CWDs. Also PEDP did very little to promote the teaching and learning resources for inclusive classrooms in terms of both adequate and relevance. The study recommends that the government and other partners to join their efforts in increasing enrolment rates for the CWDs.

40|$|At colleges or {{universities}} {{students with}} visual impairments have to be mainstreamed. Therefore, each year quite a lot of {{students with visual}} impairments can be found in classes scattered over the different colleges and universities in every country. However, most teachers have not been instructed how to teach students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> a mainstream classroom. Thus, they worry about changes in the syllabus, availability of suitable textbooks, and how to teach all students together in an effective way. Obtaining necessary information about the students’ problems and sources for help are paramount for the successful integration of {{students with visual impairments}} into the mainstream classroom. This paper, therefore, aims to provide information for teachers with little or no background knowledge in special education. Several of the problems discussed in this paper are of concern for teachers of students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> general, but some aspects are of special interest for foreign language teachers and are not normally found in guidelines provided to teachers of students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> mainstream classes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} the way general teachers teach students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> inclusive classrooms {{and the challenges}} facing them. The intention was specifically {{to find out the}} ways general teachers adapt their teaching to make sure that inclusion {{of students with visual impairments}} is appreciated and realized. Furthermore, it intended to uncover the challenges these general teachers face when teaching students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> inclusive classrooms. This study was conducted at one of the secondary school located in southern part of the country. It employed qualitative case study design using four (4) general teachers teaching in classes having students with visual impairments. Data collection was done using semi-structured interviews and participant- observation methods. The findings revealed that general teachers have little knowledge about inclusive education and how it should be practiced not only for students with visual impairments but for all students with special needs. The knowledge about inclusion and teaching in inclusive classrooms is highly needed among general teachers to practice inclusive teaching for students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> a professional manner. Preparation of teaching resources,like audio and tactile materials, reading braille writings, and instructing students with visual impairments the proper ways of using their visual devices, is said to be the role of a special needs teacher. However, it is also advisable for a general teacher to have some of this knowledge in order to counteract the challenges associated with teaching students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> inclusive classrooms. Furthermore, findings showed that, general teachers were not using the little knowledge of teaching in inclusive classrooms they have, due to many challenges surrounding the whole inclusive teaching in secondary schools like scarcity of both general and special needs teachers and lack of commitment among them, scarcity of resource and rigid curriculum. Building from the findings, it is recommended that, the Government should improve the situation of inclusive teaching, such as training teachers in the area of special education to help them conduct their teaching properly. The government should also allocate enough funds to inclusive schools to ensure availability of teaching and learning facilities that will help facilitate teaching students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> inclusive classrooms. Finally, due to the fact that, there are few studies conducted on the area the current study has ventured on, it is recommended that, further studies should be carried out...|$|E
