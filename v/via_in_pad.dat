COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) AAP packaging technologies in high reliability versions with 1. 27 mm pitch are now being considered {{for use in a}} number of NASA systems including Space Shuttle and Mars Rovers. NASA functional system designs are requiring more and more dense AAP packages and board space, which makes board microvia technology very attractive for effectively routing a large number of package inputs/outputs. However, the reliability of the fine feature microvias including <b>via</b> <b>in</b> <b>pads</b> is unknown for space applications. Understanding process and QA (quality assurance) indicators for reliability are important for low risk insertion of these newly available packages and PWBs. This paper presents literature search as well as test results for a high density board subjected to various thermal cycle and reflow profiles representative of tin-lead and lead-free solder reflow. Microvias sizes ranged from two to six mil with and without filling. Daisy chain microvias monitored during the test and PWBs were cross-sectioned to determine failure and locations.

40|$|One {{method to}} {{increase}} density in integrated circuits (IC) is to stack die {{to create a}} 3 -D multichip module (MCM). In the past, special post wafer processing was done to bring interconnects out {{to the edge of}} the die. The die were sawed, glued, and stacked. Special processing was done to create interconnects on the edge to provide for interconnects to each of the die. These processes require an IC type fabrication facility (fab) and special processing equipment. In contrast, we have developed packaging assembly methods to created vertical through <b>vias</b> <b>in</b> bond <b>pads</b> of active silicon die, isolate these vias, and metal fill these vias without the use of a special IC fab. These die with through vias can then be joined and stacked to create a 3 -D MCM. Vertical through <b>vias</b> <b>in</b> active die are created by laser micromachining using a Nd:YAG laser. Besides the fundamental 1064 nm (infra-red) laser wavelength of a Nd:YAG laser, modifications to our Nd:YAG laser allowed us to generate the second harmonic 532 nm (green) laser wavelength and fourth harmonic 266 nm (ultra violet) laser wavelength in laser micromachining for these vias. Experiments were conducted to determine the best laser wavelengths to use for laser micromachining of vertical through <b>vias</b> <b>in</b> order to minimize damage to the active die. Via isolation experiments were done in order to determine the best method in isolating the bond pads of the die. Die thinning techniques were developed to allow for die thickness as thin as 50 {mu}m.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Anatomy and PhysiologyThomas J. BarstowPeripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) is {{a manifestation}} of the systemic disease of atherosclerosis that results in arterial stenoses of the lower extremities. Patients with PAD demonstrate slowed dynamics of pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO 2 kinetics) following the onset of exercise and a profound reduction in peak oxygen uptake and work capacity. However, whereas the primary pathophysiology of PAD results from the lower extremity hemodynamic limitation, there are abnormalities distal to the arterial stenoses in PAD-affected skeletal muscle that may also contribute to the impaired exercise responses. Thus, the potential contributions of abnormal muscle metabolism versus local circulatory defects <b>in</b> the <b>PAD</b> exercise impairment remains unclear. In this context, the purpose of the dissertation was to advance our understanding of the abnormal pulmonary VO 2 kinetics <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> and characterize the local muscle deoxygenation responses during the rest-exercise transition exercise <b>in</b> health and <b>PAD.</b> The present series of investigations were designed to: 1. localize the abnormal pulmonary VO 2 kinetics <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> to the affected lower extremities, 2. characterize the kinetics of calf muscle deoxygenation during walking <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> and healthy subjects, 3. describe muscle deoxygenation kinetics in relation to exercise work rate and blood flow <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> and health, and 4. evaluate the effect of arterial revascularization on pulmonary VO 2 kinetics <b>in</b> <b>PAD.</b> These investigations revealed a persistent abnormality in muscle oxygen utilization in PAD-affected skeletal muscle that was not associated with the severity of hemodynamic compromise. In particular, we observed slowed pulmonary VO 2 kinetics <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> only during exercise of the PAD-affected skeletal muscles. Moreover, muscle deoxygenation kinetics following the onset of walking and lower intensity calf exercise were prolonged <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> subjects while leg blood flow responses were normal. However, at higher work rates, PAD muscle deoxygenation kinetics accelerated, demonstrating a work rate and presumably blood flow dependence. Lastly, arterial revascularization tended to improve, but not consistently normalize, pulmonary VO 2 kinetics <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> subjects.

Similar or identical etiopathogenetic mechanisms and risk factors are involved in various atherosclerotic diseases, and {{the positive effects of}} preventive measures on atherogenesis {{in different parts of the}} arterial system were shown.

The pad 2 - 1 mutation is localized in the GLUTAMATE-CYSTEINE LIGASE (GCL) gene encoding the first enzyme of glutathione biosynthesis. While pad 2 - 1 glutathione deficiency is not caused by a decrease in GCL transcripts, analysis of GCL protein level revealed that pad 2 - 1 plants contained only 48 % of the wild-type protein amount. In contrast to the wild type, the oxidized form of GCL was dominant <b>in</b> <b>pad</b> 2 - 1, suggesting a distinct redox environment. This finding was corroborated by the expression of GRX 1 -roGFP 2, showing that the cytosolic glutathione redox potential was significantly less negative <b>in</b> <b>pad</b> 2 - 1.

40|$|Mohammed Al-OmranDepartment of Surgery, King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaBackground: Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) is {{a marker}} of advanced atherosclerosis with an elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Although intensive risk reduction therapy is critical in reducing the adverse cardiovascular outcomes <b>in</b> patients with <b>PAD,</b> the awareness of this information among all physicians is felt to be low. Given the role of family physicians (FP), general internists (GI), cardiologists (C), and vascular surgeons (VS) in treating patients with PAD, we sought to determine their perceptions and knowledge of risk reduction therapy in these patients. Methods and results: We conducted a cross-sectional self-administered survey of 84 physicians who work at a major teaching hospital. FP, GI, C, and VS represent 39 %, 33 %, 16 %, and 12 % of the surveyed physicians, respectively. The recommended targets of LDL-cholesterol, blood glucose and blood pressure <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> patients were known to 37. 3 %, 94. 1 % and 35. 3 % of physicians, respectively. The majority of physicians reported to screen for risk factors <b>in</b> <b>PAD.</b> Although 86. 3 % of physicians would recommend antiplatelets therapy <b>in</b> <b>PAD,</b> only 17. 6 % would recommend angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; 25. 5 % would recommend nicotine replacement therapy for smokers and 62. 7 % would recommend statins. Compared to other specialties, cardiologists had the lowest threshold, whereas GI had the highest threshold for initiating antiplatelets and statins for patients with PAD. Conclusion: The perceptions towards risk reduction <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> identify glaring knowledge and action gaps. Effective strategies to encourage health professionals to use risk reduction therapy are needed. Keywords: peripheral arterial disease, risk reduction, atherosclerosi...|$|R

40|$|Surgical and {{endovascular}} revascularization of ischemic legs {{in patients}} with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can damage the arterial wall (endothelial and smooth muscle cells). Hemostatic factors released during endothelial dysfunction can lead to restenosis. 1. Determination of selected endothelial hemostatic factors <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> patients and a reference group. 2. Prospective observation of new restenosis appearance <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> patients after endovascular revascularization. 3. Comparison of selected endothelial hemostatic factors between non-restenotic and restenotic PAD patients. 150 PAD patients after endovascular revascularization – 90 men and 60 women, aged 44 - 88 (mean 65. 5) years – were examined. During one-year observation after the revascularization procedures <b>in</b> 38 <b>PAD</b> patients restenosis occurred, when blood samples were also collected. The reference group consisted of 53 healthy persons – 44 men and 9 women, aged 20 - 56 years. Blood was drawn in the morning into 3. 2 % sodium citrate {{at a ratio of}} 9 : 1. Tissue factor (TF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), thrombomodulin (TM), von Willebrand factor (vWF) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) were measured in plasma with commercial tests using the enzyme immunoassay. In the plasma of PAD patients after revascularization, the concentrations of TF and vWF were significantly higher, TM lower, TFPI and t-PA similar compared to the reference group. Six months after revascularization the level of TF had increased and vWF had significantly decreased. The endothelial hemostatic factors before and after restenosis did not significantly differ except TF, which after restenosis was higher. Increased TF and vWF levels <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> patients indicate arterial endothelial cell damage, by atherosclerotic and revascularization processes. <b>In</b> <b>PAD</b> patients with restenosis compared to these patients before restenosis the determined endothelial hemostatic factors, except TF level, did not significantly differ.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Biomarkers are a {{promising}} {{tool for the}} management of patients with atherosclerosis, but their variation is largely unknown. We assessed within-subject and between-subject biological variation of biomarkers in peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients and healthy controls, and defined which biomarkers have a favorable variation profile for future studies. METHODS: Prospective, parallel-group cohort study, including 62 patients with stable PAD (79 % men, 65 ± 7 years) and 18 healthy control subjects (44 % men, 57 ± 7 years). Blood samples were taken at baseline, and after 3 -, 6 -, and 12 -months. We calculated within-subject (CVI) and between-subject (CVG) coefficients of variation and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Mean levels of D-dimer, hs-CRP, IL- 6, IL- 8, MMP- 9, MMP- 3, S 100 A 8 /A 9, PAI- 1, sICAM- 1, and sP-selectin levels were higher <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> patients than <b>in</b> healthy controls (P≤. 05 for all). CVI and CVG of the different biomarkers varied considerably in both groups. An ICC≥ 0. 5 (indicating moderate-to-good reliability) was found for hs-CRP, D-Dimer, E-selectin, IL- 10, MCP- 1, MMP- 3, oxLDL, sICAM- 1 and sP-selectin in both groups, for sVCAM in healthy controls and for MMP- 9, PAI- 1 and sCD 40 L <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> patients. CONCLUSIONS: Single biomarker measurements are of limited utility due to large within-subject variation, both <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> patients and healthy subjects. D-dimer, hs-CRP, MMP- 9, MMP- 3, PAI- 1, sP-selectin and sICAM- 1 are biomarkers with both higher mean levels <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> patients and a favorable variation profile making them most suitable for future studies...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundIn {{peripheral}} arterial disease (PAD), {{activation of}} the hemostatic system may contribute to atherosclerosis progression and atherothrombotic events. ObjectiveThis case–control study assesses the overall coagulation status <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> patients by evaluating coagulation markers in combination with thrombin generation potential, whole blood (WB) clot formation, and fibrinolysis. MethodsIn blood from 40 PAD patients (n[*]=[*] 20 with cardiovascular event within 1 [*]year after initial diagnosis, n[*]=[*] 20 without) and 40 apparently healthy controls, thrombin generation was determined in WB and platelet-poor plasma. Whole blood rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) measurements were triggered with tissue factor with/without tissue plasminogen activator. ResultsWe observed increased levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocytes, eosinophil granulocytes, vWF antigen, fibrinogen, and D-dimer <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> patients (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Markers of thrombin generation potential showed no difference between patients and healthy controls. <b>In</b> <b>PAD</b> patients with event compared to patients without, WB-thrombin generation showed a lower thrombin potential when triggered with 0 and 2. 5 [*]pM tissue factor. The ROTEM clotting assay showed significantly faster clot formation and increased clot firmness <b>in</b> <b>PAD</b> patients compared to controls. No {{significant differences were found}} for parameters of clot degradation. ConclusionThere are {{no significant differences between the}} thrombin generation profiles of PAD patients and healthy controls. Between PAD patients with and without cardiovascular event, the WB thrombin generation appears to differ. Mechanistically, PAD patients show an increased ability to form a stable clot in WB in comparison to healthy controls. This is most likely due to the increased fibrinogen levels related to the inflammation in atherosclerosis, confirming the importance of the inflammation-coagulation axis...|$|R
