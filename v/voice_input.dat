5|$|The F-22 has a {{glass cockpit}} with all-digital flight instruments. The {{monochrome}} head-up display offers a wide {{field of view}} {{and serves as a}} primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The USAF initially wanted to implement direct <b>voice</b> <b>input</b> (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned. The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140inches long, 45inches wide, and 27inches tall (355cm x 115cm x 69cm) and weighs 360 pounds.|$|E

Cortana is implemented as a universal search box located alongside the Start and Task View buttons, which can be hidden or condensed to a single button.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while <b>voice</b> <b>input</b> and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E

25|$|The Typhoon Direct <b>Voice</b> <b>Input</b> (DVI) {{system uses}} a speech {{recognition}} module (SRM), developed by Smiths Aerospace (now GE Aviation Systems) and Computing Devices (now General Dynamics UK). It {{was the first}} production DVI system used in a military cockpit. DVI provides the pilot with an additional natural mode of command and control over approximately 26 non-critical cockpit functions, to reduce pilot workload, improve aircraft safety, and expand mission capabilities. An important step {{in the development of}} the DVI occurred in 1987 when Texas Instruments completed the TMS-320-C30, a digital signal-processor, enabling reductions in the size and system complexity required. The project was given the go-ahead in July 1997, with development and pilot assessment carried out on the Eurofighter Active Cockpit Simulator at BAE Systems Warton.|$|E

40|$|Research Objectives: {{within an}} IAC framework, voice {{recognition}} and face recognition may usefully {{be viewed as}} parallel pathways. The demonstration of cross-modality priming of voices by faces and vice versa would add weight to such a view. Design: repetition priming of celebrity individuals was examined under within-modality and cross-modality conditions. Method: sixty participants completed a 2 -stage method involving semantic decisions to celebrities at study, and speeded familiarity decisions to primed and unprimed celebrities at test. Results: expected within-modality priming effects emerged: Faces primed subsequent face recognition, and voices primed subsequent voice recognition. Additionally, voices successfully primed face recognition, however, faces did not prime subsequent voice recognition. Conclusions: the emergence of cross-modality priming adds support to the integration of voice recognition within a person perception model such as IAC. Results are discussed {{with respect to the}} relative strength of face and <b>voice</b> <b>inputs</b> in these two parallel pathways<br/...|$|R

25|$|The Typhoon {{features}} a glass cockpit without any conventional instruments. It incorporates three full colour multi-function head-down displays (MHDDs) (the formats on which are manipulated {{by means of}} softkeys, XY cursor, and voice (Direct <b>Voice</b> <b>Input</b> or DVI) command), a wide angle head-up display (HUD) with forward-looking infrared (FLIR), a voice and hands-on throttle and stick (Voice+HOTAS), a Helmet Mounted Symbology System (HMSS), a Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), a manual data-entry facility (MDEF) located on the left glareshield and a fully integrated aircraft warning system with a dedicated warnings panel (DWP). Reversionary flying instruments, lit by LEDs, are located under a hinged right glareshield. Access to the cockpit is normally via either a telescopic integral ladder or an external version. The integral ladder is stowed in the port side of the fuselage, below the cockpit.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the first}} [...] "day attack" [...] AV-8B Harrier IIs were {{upgraded}} to Night Attack Harrier or Harrier II Plus standards, with the remainder being withdrawn from service. The AV-8B cockpit was also used for the early trialing of Direct <b>Voice</b> <b>Input</b> (DVI), which allows the pilot to use voice commands to issue instructions to the aircraft, using a system developed by Smiths Industries. The main attack avionics system in original aircraft was the nose-mounted Hughes AN/ASB-19 angle-rate bombing system. The system combined a TV imager and laser tracker to provide a highly accurate targeting capability. Defensive equipment include several AN/ALE-39 chaff-flare dispensers, an AN/ALR-67 radar warning receiver, and an AN/ALQ-126C jammer pod.|$|E

This paper discusses an airborne unit which acquires the information from up to 8 dual-redundant buses, and formats the data for telemetry, recording or real-time analysis according to the requirements of IRIG- 106 - 86, Chapter 8. The ALBUS- 1553 acquires all or selected 1553 messages which are formatted into IRIG-compatible serial data stream outputs. Data is time tagged to microsecond resolution. The unit selectively transmits entire or partial 1553 messages under program control. This results in reduced transmission bandwidth if prior knowledge of 1553 traffic is known. The ALBUS also encodes analog <b>voice</b> <b>inputs,</b> discrete userword inputs and multiplexed analog (overhead) inputs.
