500|$|The Source engine {{itself was}} updated with new {{features}} to accommodate Dota 2, such as high-end cloth modeling and improved global lighting. The game features Steam integration, which provides its social component and cloud storage for personal settings. An in-game fantasy sports and digital trading card system also exists, which is modeled after traditional sports and feature professional Dota 2 players. In November 2013, Valve introduced a coaching system, which allows experienced players to tutor players with special in-game tools. As with previous Valve multiplayer titles, players {{are able to}} spectate live matches of Dota 2 played by others, and local area network (LAN) multiplayer support allows for local competitions. Some of these events may be spectated via the purchase of tickets from the [...] "Dota Store", which give players in-game access to matches.

500|$|Martin Gaston of GameSpot complimented Valve for {{the artistic}} design and {{delivery}} of Dota 2, citing {{the execution of the}} user interface design, voice acting, and characterization as exceeding those of the game's competitors. Phill Cameron of IGN and James Kozanitis of Hardcore Gamer both praised Dota 2 for its free-to-play business model that was not affected by cosmetic items, with Kozanitis stating that Dota 2 was [...] "the only game to do free-to-play right". Nick Kolan of IGN also agreed, comparing the game's business model to Valve's Team Fortress 2, which uses a nearly identical system. Post-release additions to the game were also praised, such as the addition of <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> (<b>VR)</b> support in 2016. Ben Kuchera of Polygon thought that spectating games in VR was [...] "amazing", comparing it to being able to watch an American football game on television with the ability to jump onto the field at any time to see the quarterback's point of view.

500|$|Steam's [...] "Big Picture" [...] mode was {{announced}} in 2011; public betas started in September 2012 and were integrated into the software in December 2012. Big Picture mode is a 10-foot user interface, which optimizes the Steam display to work on high-definition televisions, allowing the user to control Steam with a gamepad or with a keyboard and mouse. Newell stated that Big Picture mode was a step towards a dedicated Steam entertainment hardware unit. SteamVR, a <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> (<b>VR)</b> Big Picture interface, was introduced in beta in January 2014. The SteamVR mode enables the user to operate the Big Picture mode and play any game in their Steam library with a virtual theater displayed through the VR headset, the equivalent of looking at a 225-inch television screen, according to Valve. The mode was first introduced in beta for the Oculus Rift headset and later expanded in March 2015 to support the HTC Vive, a VR unit developed jointly with Valve, with the feature to be publicly released shortly after the Vive's public launch in April 2016. In-Home Streaming was introduced in May 2014; this allows users to stream games installed on one computer to anotherregardless of platformon the same home network.|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of Dota 2 led Valve to produce apparel, accessories, posters, {{and a number}} of other products featuring the heroes and other elements from the game. In addition, Valve secured licensing contracts with third-party producers; the first of these deals concerned a Dota 2 themed SteelSeries mousepad, which was announced at Gamescom 2011. In September 2012, Weta Workshop, the prop studio that creates the [...] "Aegis of Champions" [...] trophy for winners of The International, announced a product line that would include statues, weapons, and armor based on Dota 2 characters and items. In February 2013, the National Entertainment Collectibles Association announced a new toy line featuring hero-themed action figures at the American International Toy Fair. At Gamescom 2015, an HTC Vive <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> (<b>VR)</b> tech demo based around the shopkeeper of the game's item shop was showcased, allowing participants to interact with various items and objects from the game in VR. The demo, known as Secret Shop, was later included on The Lab, Valve's virtual reality compilation game, the following year. After the conclusion of The International 2015, Valve awarded the Collector's Aegis of Champions, which was a 1/5th scale brass replica of the Aegis of Champions trophy, to those with compendiums of 1,000 levels or more. Valve awarded the Collector's Aegis again the following year for The International 2016, as well as selling a limited edition Dota 2 themed HTC Vive virtual reality headset during the event. In July 2017, an 18-track official soundtrack was released by Ipecac Recordings, including a version on vinyl. A collectible card game based on elements from Dota 2, titled Artifact, will be released in 2018.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Resident Evil 6, Capcom {{conducted}} internal discussions regarding {{the direction of the}} next installment. A preliminary version of the game, developed in 2013, featured a more action-oriented gameplay, similar to that of Resident Evil 6. Taking inspiration from the 1981 film The Evil Dead, the developers figured scaling back the game to one location and using a first-person perspective to immerse players would {{be the best way to}} return the series to its roots of survival horror. Development began around February 2014. The game is built on a new engine, named RE Engine, which includes <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> (<b>VR)</b> development tools. The decision to make the game first-person was made well before VR was considered; VR development started in October 2015, for which a separate team was created. The introduction of VR demanded that textures be more detailed, discarding flat textures and inaccurate object sizes that had previously been used. A year before the game's announcement, Capcom presented to attendants of E3 2015 a first-person horror-themed VR demo called KITCHEN, which ran on the same engine. While Resident Evil 7 had been in development long before KITCHEN, the latter was seen as an opportunity to evaluate how the RE Engine and its VR capabilities would be received by the public. As a hint to the demo's relation to, at the time unannounced, Resident Evil 7, the logo of KITCHEN had the letter [...] "T" [...] designed so that it resembled a [...] "7", but it went largely unnoticed. In the company's Integrated Report of 2015, the Resident Evil development division of Capcom was stated to focus on creating experiences for the VR market, which included the new VR engine and games for the eighth generation of consoles.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>reality</b> (<b>VR)</b> is a {{technology}} which allows a user {{to interact with}} a computer-simulated environment. Most current virtual reality environments are primarily visual experiences, displayed either {{on a computer screen}} or through special or stereoscopic displays, but some simulations include additional sensory information, such as sound through speakers or headphones. In 1968, Ivan Sutherland, {{with the help of his}} student Bob Sproull, invented what is widely considered to be the first virtual reality and augmented reality (AR) head mounted display (HMD) system. It was primitive both in terms of user interface and realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy it had to be suspended from the ceiling, and the graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple wireframe model rooms. In 1989, Jaron Lanier, the founder of VPL Research popularized the concept of virtual reality with his [...] "google n' gloves" [...] system.|$|E

The purpose of this work has been to explore the possibilities of developing a basic prototype for simulation of real traffic situations. During the process a framework of useful features for creating and controlling autonomous actors in a virtual environment has been established. Possible models of communication between such actors and their ability to interact in real traffic situations have also been explored. These ideas have been implemented on an already existing simulation platform and applied to a purpose-designed model. Evaluation of the result has been conducted in form of interviews with representatives from a hypothetical target audience. Their thoughts and opinions have provided valuable information about future augmentation and improvement of the concept.

As a representation for emotions, visualizations of biosignals, such as breathing rhythm, are used. In the preoccupation with the subject of virtual emotions, one is confronted with unusual perspectives concerning communications and cognitive sciences.
