40|$|Realised {{volatility}} and variance: options via swaps Peter Carr and Roger Lee present {{explicit and}} readily applicable formulas for valuing options on realised variance and volatility. They use variance and volatility swaps – or alternatively <b>vanilla</b> <b>options</b> – as pricing benchmarks and hedging instruments. They also cover Vix options In this article, we develop strategies for pricing and hedging options on realised variance and volatility. Our strategies have the following features. n Readily available inputs. We can use <b>vanilla</b> <b>options</b> as pricing benchmarks and as hedging instruments. If variance or volatility swaps are available, then we {{use them as}} well. We do not need other inputs (such as parameters of the instantaneous volatility dynamics). n Comprehensive and readily computable outputs.

Specifically, we price and hedge realised variance and volatility options using variance and volatility swaps.

40|$|We study optimal hedging of barrier options using a {{combination}} of a static position in <b>vanilla</b> <b>options</b> and dynamic trading of the underlying asset.

Using the well-known duality between expo-nential utility and relative entropy, we provide a new characterization of the indifference price in terms of the minimal entropy measure, and give conditions guaranteeing differen-tiability and strict convexity in the hedging quantity, and hence a unique solution to the hedging problem. We discuss computational approaches within the context of Markovian stochastic volatility models...|$|R
50|$|In the Black-Scholes model, the {{theoretical}} {{value of a}} <b>vanilla</b> <b>option</b> is a monotonic increasing function of the volatility of the underlying asset. This means it is usually possible to compute a unique implied volatility from a given market price for an option. This implied volatility is best regarded as a rescaling of option prices which makes comparisons between different strikes, expirations, and underlyings easier and more intuitive.|$|E
50|$|For {{instance}} Black Scholes theory claims <b>vanilla</b> <b>option</b> pricing can {{be achieved}} {{through the use of}} stock and zero-coupon bond. A simple example would be if you went to a bank and purchased a synthetic ETF for the purpose of replication. That fund may represent a certain group of stocks in Apple. However, the synthetic ETF is in no way physically attached to Apples stock. The bank you purchased the fund from would largely mirror Apples stock performance 100% through the use of derivatives and swaps in the process of replication and would charge you a fee for it. This is an extremely simple example but does describe the base process of synthetic replication.|$|E
50|$|For a <b>vanilla</b> <b>option,</b> delta will be {{a number}} between 0.0 and 1.0 for a long call (or a short put) and 0.0 and −1.0 for a long put (or a short call); {{depending}} on price, a call option behaves as if one owns 1 share of the underlying stock (if deep in the money), or owns nothing (if far out of the money), or something in between, and conversely for a put option. The difference between the delta of a call and the delta of a put at the same strike is close to but not in general equal to one, but instead {{is equal to the}} inverse of the discount factor. By put-call parity, long a call and short a put equals a forward F, which is linear in the spot S, with factor the inverse of the discount factor, so the derivative dF/dS is this factor.|$|E

Then we show a stability result, i. e. when more and more <b>Vanilla</b> <b>options</b> are given, the optimization problem converges to an optimal Skorokhod embedding problem, which constitutes the basis of the numerical computation in practice.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{frequent}} claim that the implied tree prices exotic options consistently with the market is untrue if the local volatilities {{are subject to change}} and the market is arbitrage-free. In the process, we analyse [...] in the most general context [...] the impact of stochastic variables on the P&L of a hedged portfolio, and we conclude that no model can a priori be expected to price all exotics in line with the <b>vanilla</b> <b>options</b> market. Calibration of an assumed underlying process from <b>vanilla</b> <b>options</b> alone must not be overly restrictive, yet still unique, and relevant to all exotic options of interest. For the implied tree we {{show that the}} calibration to real-world prices allows us to only price <b>vanilla</b> <b>options</b> themselves correctly. This is usually attributed to the incompleteness of the market under traditional stochastic (local) volatility models. We show that some `weakly' stochastic volatility models without quadratic variation of the volatilities avoid the incompleteness problems, but they introduce arbitrage. More generally, we find that any stochastic tradable either has quadratic variation [...] and therefore a -like P&L on instruments with non-linear exposure to that asset [...] or it introduces arbitrage opportunities. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{show how}} several complex barrier options can be hedged using a {{portfolio}} of standard European options. These hedging strategies only involve trading at a few times during the option's life. Since rolling, ratchet, and lookback options can be decomposed into {{a portfolio of}} barrier options, our hedging results also apply to them. Hedging Complex Barrier Options 1 Introduction Barrier options have become increasingly popular in many over-the-counter markets 1. This popularity {{is due to the}} additional flexibility which barrier options confer upon their holders. In general, barrier options allow investors to revise their <b>vanilla</b> <b>option</b> positions costlessly at the first time one or more critical price levels are reached. For example, an out-option with a constant rebate allows an investor to effectively sell the <b>vanilla</b> <b>option</b> at a fixed price at the first hitting time of the barrier. Similarly, an in-option allows an investor to effectively buy a <b>vanilla</b> <b>option</b> at the first hittin [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Many exotic options {{involve a}} payoff which {{occurs at the}} first passage time to a {{constant}} barrier. Although the amount to be paid is known, the time at which it is paid is not.

50|$|Any {{volatility}} smile model which prices <b>vanilla</b> <b>options</b> {{can therefore be}} used to price the variance swap.

40|$|Every maturity-dependent {{derivative}} contract entails a term structure. For example, when {{the value of}} the portfolio consisting of a long position in a stock and a short position in a <b>vanilla</b> <b>option</b> is expressed in units of its instantaneous exercise value, the resulting quantity defines a discount function. Thus, the derivative of the discount function with respect to the time left until maturity defines a term structure density function, and the "hazard rate" associated with the discount function determines the forward rates for the <b>vanilla</b> <b>option</b> portfolio. The dynamics associated with these quantities are obtained in the complete market setting. In particular, one can model vanilla options based on the associated forward rates. The formulation based on forward rates for options extends the approach based on modeling the implied volatility process. As an illustrative example, the initial term structure of the Black–Scholes model is considered. It is shown in this example that the implied volatility smile has the effect of making the option forward rates homogeneous across different strikes.

40|$|Mathematical {{models for}} {{financial}} asset prices which include, for example, stochastic volatility or jumps are incomplete in that derivative securities {{are generally not}} replicable by trading in the underlying. In earlier work (2004) the first author provided a geometric condition under which trading in the underlying and {{a finite number of}} <b>vanilla</b> <b>options</b> completes the market. We complement this result in several ways. First, we show that the geometric condition is not necessary and a weaker, necessary and sufficient, condition is presented. While this condition is generally not directly verifiable, we show that it simplifies to matrix non-degeneracy in a single point when the pricing functions are real analytic functions. In particular, any stochastic volatility model is then completed with an arbitrary European type option. Further, we show that adding path-dependent options such as a variance swap to the set of primary assets, instead of plain <b>vanilla</b> <b>options,</b> also completes the market. ...|$|R
