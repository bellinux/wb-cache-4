5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b> In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed {{that it was possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness.|$|E
40|$|The present article {{refers to}} the {{implementation}} of a new technology of rotary vane <b>vacuums</b> <b>pumps</b> in a filling machine of beer. The reason why the vacuum is applied to the bottle is to remove the oxygen in its interior and thereby sustain the allowed values of TPO Total Packing Oxygen, preventing oxidation of the product and lose their organoleptic characteristics. This is a process that until now was performed with liquid ring <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> using water as a liquid sealant and that after 10 years of continuous work have lost their capacity to generate the vacuum required by the system and must be replaced necessarily. Presenting two alternatives, maintaining the same technology for the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps,</b> or change to rotary vane <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps.</b> I first analyzed the performance curves of existing <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> for comparison with the rotary vane and certify that can generate the same levels of vacuum and then compared in a matrix of all parameters involved decision to finally decide for the rotary vane <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> and proceed with the selection of power, tank and other accessories needed to completed the system. The result is a new technology of a rotary distributor pumps to generate the required vacuum with less power and also avoids the waste of water as a measure of commitment to the environment...|$|R

5|$|The French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille {{first described}} the constellation in French as la Machine Pneumatique (the Pneumatic Machine) in 1751–52, commemorating the air pump invented by the French physicist Denis Papin. De Lacaille had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year {{stay at the}} Cape of Good Hope, devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. He named all but one in honour of instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Lacaille depicted Antlia as a single-cylinder <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> used in Papin's initial experiments, while German astronomer Johann Bode chose the more advanced double-cylinder version. Lacaille Latinised the name to Antlia pneumatica on his 1763 chart. English astronomer John Herschel proposed shrinking the name to one word in 1844, noting that Lacaille himself had abbreviated his constellations thus on occasion. This was universally adopted. The International Astronomical Union adopted {{it as one of}} the 88 modern constellations in 1922.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumping</b> on the dose {{response}} of the MAGAS polymer gel dosimeter has been investigated. A delay of several days post-manufacture before irradiation was previously necessary due to the slow oxygen scavenging of ascorbic acid. The MAGAS polymer gel dosimeter was <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumped</b> before gelation to remove dissolved oxygen. The MAGAS polymer gel dosimeter was poured into glass screw-top vials, which were irradiated at various times, post-manufacture {{to a range of}} doses. Magnetic resonance imaging techniques were used to determine the R₂-dose response and R₂-dose sensitivity of the MAGAS polymer gel. The results were compared with a control batch of MAGAS polymer gel that was not <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumped.</b> It was shown that <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumping</b> on the MAGAS polymer gel solution immediately prior to sealing in glass screw-top vials initially increases the R₂-dose response and R₂-dose sensitivity of the dosimeter. An increase in the R₂-dose response and R₂-dose sensitivity was observed with increasing time between manufacture and irradiation. Over the range of post-manufacture irradiation times investigated, the greatest R₂-dose response and R₂-dose sensitivity occurred at 96 hours. 6 page(s...|$|R
25|$|The low {{pressure}} in the evaporator is maintained by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> that also removes the dissolved non-condensable gases from the evaporator.

It expands in a special low pressure turbine.|$|E

The first such device was made by Otto von Guericke in 1654. It consisted of a piston and an air gun cylinder with flaps that could suck the air from any vessel that it was connected to. In 1657, he pumped the air out of two conjoined hemispheres and demonstrated that a team of sixteen horses were incapable of pulling it apart. The air pump construction was greatly improved by Robert Hooke in 1658.|$|E
