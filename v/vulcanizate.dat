40|$|ABSTRACT: Bamboo fibres were {{carbonized}} at 600 0 C {{and used}} as particulate filler in natural rubber <b>vulcanizates.</b> Carbon black {{was used as the}} reference filler, while maleic anhydride-grafted-polyisoprene was used as a compatibilizer. The natural rubber <b>vulcanizates</b> were compounded on a two-roll mill, and test samples were prepared by compression moulding. The cure characteristics and physico-mechanical properties of the natural rubber <b>vulcanizates</b> were studied at filler loadings of 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 15 phr (parts per hundred parts rubber). The carbonized bamboo fibre was characterized for filler properties and sieved to 0. 08 µm and 0. 35 µm particle sizes.

However, at any given loading of carbonized bamboo fibre, these properties increased with a reduction in particle size of the filler.

Visual examination of the ash indicated that a reduction of the particle size may be necessary. Therefore the ash was ball milled for 8 hrs.

The behavior of these <b>vulcanizates</b> during pure thermal devulcanization depends on the EPDM third monomer and the crosslinker used. Peroxide <b>vulcanizates</b> of ENB-EPDM devulcanize only to a small extent and predominantly by random scission, whereas peroxide <b>vulcanizates</b> of HD-EPDM devulcanize by crosslink scission. In contrast, sulfur <b>vulcanizates</b> of ENB-EPDM, devulcanize mainly by crosslink scission. During devulcanization of sulfur-cured HD-EPDM, scission of both crosslinks and main chains occurs. Sulfur-cured DCPD-EPDM cannot be devulcanized but shows further crosslinking instead. In those cases, where purely thermal devulcanization is already effective to a certain extent, diphenyldisulfide as devulcanization agent increases the effectivity during thermochemical devulcanization. Hexadecylamine as an alternative devulcanization agent is effective for ENB-EPDM but does not contribute to thermochemical devulcanization of HD-EPDM.

The curing characteristic of double filler <b>vulcanizates</b> was higher than those with single filler. Solvent uptake for double filler present in between to those with HAF or SRF. All of <b>vulcanizates</b> indicate the anomalous mass tranfer, with n> 0, 5 and constant k showed the same trend. The intrinsic diffusivity (D*), sorption and permeation coefficient showed similar trend and the maximum was obtained by the ratio HAF/SRF 0 / 70...|$|R
40|$|Mechanochemically {{partially}} devulcanized ground {{rubber tire}} (GRT) was revulcanized in composition with virgin {{styrene butadiene rubber}} (SBR). Reclaiming of GRT {{was carried out by}} tetra methyl thiuram disulfide (TMTD) in presence of spindle oil. The cure characteristics and tensile properties of SBR compounds were investigated. Results indicate that the minimum torque and Mooney viscosity of the SBR compounds increase with increasing reclaim rubber (RR) loading whereas the scorch time remain unaltered but optimum cure time exhibit a decreasing trend. Increasing RR loading also gives SBR compounds better resistance towards swelling but the 100 % modulus, 200 % modulus tensile strength, and the elongation at break increases. Thermogravimetric analysis of SBR/RR <b>vulcanizates</b> was carried out in order to get thermal stability of the <b>vulcanizates.</b> Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies further indicate the coherency and homogeneity in the SBR/RR <b>vulcanizates...</b>|$|R
