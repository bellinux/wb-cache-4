30|$|Pigs (n= 16) were anesthetized, tracheotomized and {{received}} MV. Catheters were placed aseptically. Cefuroxime 750 mg was given IV q 6 h. Unilateral PC was induced by a 10 kg weight dropped from 1.85 m height on a predefined {{location of the}} right chest. Chest tubes were inserted on both sides. Conditions comparable to an ICU were established. At 90 min after PC (post-PC) pigs were randomized to 24 hours of MV using ARDSnet (n= 8) or OLC (n= 8). Pressure controlled MV in the OLC group involved: an initial recruitment maneuver (50 cmH 2 O, 10 breaths), respiratory rate 80 /min, I/E 2 : 1, TV< 6 ml/kgBW, positive inspiratory pressure (PIP) ≤ 30 cmH 2 O. Total PEEP of approx. 19 cmH 2 O resulted from development of intrinsic PEEP on top of external PEEP of 10 cmH 2 O. Cardiorespiratory, gas exchange and extra-vascular lung water (EVLW, single-indicator transpulmonary thermodilution) parameters were measured. Electrical impedance tomography {{was used to assess}} changes in lung ventilation (<b>Vent).</b> <b>Vent</b> was calculated as the number of pixels showing an impedance change of > 15 % of the global impedance change and expressed as % of baseline. Data are given as median and interquartile (25 th- 75 th) range. Mann-Whitney-tests and General Linear Model statistics were used.|$|E

It is similar to G. kempi in having an anterior position of the vent, and similar to G. lissorynchus in having a distinct submarginal band on the dorsal fin. Garra arupi differs from G. kempi in having 35 - 36 (vs. 40 - 42) lateral line scales, 11 - 12 (vs. 13 - 14) predorsal scales, 16 (vs. 12) circumpeduncular scales, the presence of a distinct submarginal band on the dorsal fin (vs. absence), the presence of a transverse band of tubercles on the snout tip (vs. absence), and the presence of 7 - 8 thin stripes on the caudal peduncle (vs. absence).

40|$|H 2 O was {{supplied}} to the Noachian atmosphere by eruptions, or {{in association with}} large impacts. Most water outgassed into an extremely cold atmosphere, and condensate deposits were inevitable. High heat flow could lead to subglacial melting only if ice thicknesses were greater than 500 - 1000 m, which is extremely unlikely. Subareal melting and flow is contingent upon temperatures periodically exceeding 273 K, and retarding evaporative loss of the flow. In still air, evaporation into a dry atmosphere is in the free convection regime, and a stream with 2 cu m/s discharge, flowing 1 m/s could persist for hundreds of days and cover distances greater than any valley reach. The zero-wind-shear condition is considered implausible however. We investigate the possibility that evaporation rates were suppressed because the atmosphere was regionally charged with H 2 O as it moved over snow/ice fields. Our initial concern is precipitation from volcanic plumes. A Kilauea-style eruption on the martian surface would cover a 10 km circular deposit with 10 cm of H 2 O, if all H 2 O could be precipitated near the vent. The characteristics of the eruption at the <b>vent,</b> (<b>vent</b> size, temperature, H 2 O content, etc.) are independent of the environmental conditions. The subsequent behavior of the plume, including precipitation of ash and H 2 O condensate depends strongly on the environment. Hence, the proximal fate of volcanic H 2 O is amenable to treatment in a model. A simple bulk thermodynamic model {{of the rise of}} an H 2 O plume through a stably stratified CO 2 atmosphere, with only adiabatic cooling, produces runaway plume rise. A more complex treatment includes the effects of latent heat release, wind shear along the plume, divergence of ash and H 2 O, and will yield more realistic estimates of H 2 O transport in eruptive plumes. Results of these simulations will be presented...|$|E
