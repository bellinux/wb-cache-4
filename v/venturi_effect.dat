5|$|Another {{commonly}} held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew {{and several other}} people take shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by. However, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado, and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the <b>Venturi</b> <b>effect,</b> tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass. Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and {{at each of the}} three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.|$|E

This often act to 'flush out' the air pollutants and increase the air quality inside the street canyon.But in instances where air pollutant sources are present upwind, channeling winds could transport pollutants to downwind locations far from the source and contribute to bad quality at the downwind locations.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{understanding}} how the aerodynamic {{performance of a}} hovering microrotor is affected by horizontal and vertical wall proximity. Toward that end, experiments are performed to extract aerodynamic loads and velocity flow fields from strain gauges and high-definition stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements, respectively. The results show that horizontal wall boundary conditions contribute to enhancing aerodynamic performance, whereas vertical boundary conditions have a negligible impact. Enhancement of aerodynamic performance arises from distinct flow physics, such as rotor wake expansion or <b>Venturi</b> <b>effects,</b> that depend on the configuration considered. These results open the path toward the development of micro air vehicles dedicated to the exploration of highly confined environments...|$|R

As part of this programme, {{in this study we}} examine with a Doppler Sodar (FAS 64) several echo and wind pattern characteristics associated with different meteorological phenomena, which are related to the complexity of the terrain. To test the validity of different flow fields connected with Sodar patterns, such as slope drainage winds, cool-air accumulation in low-lying regions, channelling flows created by terrain constrictions (<b>Venturi</b> <b>effects)</b> and sea breeze flows, numerical simulation with the MM 5 model was performed. The results show relatively good agreement between thermal structures and wind field given by the Doppler Sodar and numerical models...|$|R
25|$|The {{flow speed}} of a fluid can be {{measured}} using a device such as a Venturi meter or an orifice plate, which can be placed into a pipeline to reduce {{the diameter of the}} flow. For a horizontal device, the continuity equation shows that for an incompressible fluid, the reduction in diameter will cause an increase in the fluid flow speed. Subsequently, Bernoulli's principle then shows that there must be a decrease in the pressure in the reduced diameter region. This phenomenon is known as the <b>Venturi</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} types of pump mechanisms. Piston pumps draw a piston through a {{cylinder}} to create suction. These are generally considered top-of-the-line units. They have characteristics of low speed, high reliability, low noise, and long life. [...] Rotary vane pumps use a cam with retractable vanes to create suction. These rotary vane pumps are not widely used anymore. Fast diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, with thousands of cycles per minute. They operate at higher speed and are usually noisier. Slow diaphragm pumps use a large diaphragm operated by a cam or lever to generate suction with each stroke. [...] Pumps have also been designed that use <b>venturi</b> <b>effects</b> powered by a faucet or water stream, wall suction in hospitals, or pumps powered by oral suctioning.|$|R
50|$|Winds at Chicama are {{consistently}} offshore, but the swell is notoriously inconsistent. It needs a good swell to break properly, and days above head high are relatively rare. As a guide, wave sizes {{at the main}} point are around {{half the size of}} open ocean swell charts, and waves less than about 4 feet on the point (i.e. 8 feet on the swell charts) tend to be quite weak and slow. Best surfing is from around Easter Week (Semana Santa) and through the winter months in the southern hemisphere to about September when great storms in the Roaring Forties direct their wave energy toward Peru. The water is cool (17-22 °C), like much of Peru, due to cold currents from the south. Climate is warm and springlike (15-28 °C), however wind chill is a factor, created by the <b>venturi</b> <b>effects</b> from the headland. A 2-3 mm wetsuit is recommended as well as booties for walking up the beach.|$|R
40|$|Progress in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods allows {{advance in}} natural {{resource}} assessment for {{wind energy production}} in complex urban terrain by modeling wind circulation around different urban obstacles. Compared to rural open spaces, the geometry in urban areas is more complex and has intricate influence on wind flow on micro-meteorological scale. The effects of the buildings on wind flow, such as vortices {{at the feet of}} the towers, <b>Venturi</b> <b>effects</b> or Wise effects, make the modeling of urban flows considerably more difficult. We simulate these effects with UrbaWind CFD model by solving the equations of Fluid Mechanics with a specific method which allows representation of the turbulence and the wakes around buildings.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. This paper {{describes}} a MEng thesis project for a MEng in Renewable Energy Systems {{program at the}} Centre for Renewable Energy Studies at the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa. The aim {{of this paper was}} to offer to SAB (South African Breweries), in Cape Town, a feasibility study for the possibilities of the usage of wind energy on site. The small scale wind power technology has a long history and has been in South Africa for {{more than a hundred years}} in the form of water pump wind mills. All wind mills have an absolute maximum power output defined by the Betz limit. The choice of a wind turbine depends not only on this, but also on the wind speed distribution, the power curve, the location and financing. The small scale turbines have many different design which are predominantly grouped in horizontal axis (HAWT) and vertical axis (VAWT) machines. The choice of turbine for SAB depends on the available wind energy, the available budget, the available space and the application. The aim of the measurements on site was threefold; find a correlation with existing weather stations in the area like at Cape Town International Airport, propose a turbine for SAB’s budget and research the possibility for installing the turbine on one of the buildings. This is also known as building integrated wind turbines. Wind speeds can increase over buildings due to <b>venturi</b> <b>effects</b> and it could therefore be viable to locate these acceleration zones and install a turbine there. The data analysis shows that the wind above the brewery is very well correlated with the wind at the airport. We can therefore use the average speed values of this station to predict average power production. This leads to the proposal of a 1 kW or 3 kW turbine from a South African manufacturer: Kestrel. Building integration is however not a good idea. The wind is too turbulent and can therefore not be used. This is mainly caused by the fact that the surroundings of the brewery are too high and irregularly shaped. This makes it difficult for the wind to “lower” in between the buildings and accelerate. The wind turbine for SAB is proposed to be installed on the highest point of the roof and based on the neighbouring average wind speed values. The wind turbine should be connected directly to the brewery’s grid with an inverter and would then solely function as an energy saver. Another important aspect is the promotional value in the energy efficiency strategy of SAB. Centre for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Studie...|$|R
40|$|This is capitalism: you’ve got to sell {{to survive}} — you need buyers to sell — you’ve got to attract {{attention}} to get buy¬ers. Ever since the reunification of Ger¬many, the Hanover Trade Fair’s man¬agement have not spared efforts and funds to beat the new competition from the eastern lands. Hanover has a handy asset {{in the form of}} the World Expo to be held here at the turn of the millenni¬ums. A lot can be done under such an emblem. All sorts of workshops and task groups are being organised on themes like "Industrial Construction and Ecology” or "Art and Design”. Great names have been invited to represent new schemes from the onset. Albert Speer came from Frankfurt to devise the master plan. Herzog + Part¬ner Architekten BDA were commis¬sioned to assess the project in terms of its implementation. The assignment con¬cerned 969, 500 sqm of the trade fair area, including 470, 000 sqm of exhibi¬tion halls. The requirements included: clear zoning, highlighting the entrances, roofing over open areas, domination of daylight, and natural materials. A short glance is sufficient to notice that they are best met in Hall 26. The design is based on the large space of the exhibi-tion hall (210 x 113 m) and six inde¬pendent narrow auxiliary buildings along the walls. Today in Germany, you just cannot build a house which would not be “eco¬logical” in one way or another. The same aspirations made EXPO 2000 pick the motto “Man, Technology, Nature”. Herzog fits in well with this slogan, which is actually partly derived from his entry in the 1986 University of Kassel competition. Along with his two collabo¬rators, Reiner Witenbom and Nikolas Lang, he experimented with “intelligent” facades to regulate lighting and ventila¬tion. The secret is above your head, which you are bound to notice getting into Hall 26. As in other projects, the roof received special attention. Design-ing three proud curves, Herzog killed several birds with one stone. As op¬posed to other halls, his does not need to be lit until sunset. At the same time, the sharp sun rays do not enter directly, but they are softly reflected by the curvilin¬ear arches finished partly with metal bands. The same goes for the artificial light after dark. The roof is also a key element of the air-conditioning system. Trapezoid glass ducts with nozzles pump air streams down to create a sort of air canopy above the visitors' heads. Then the air which is additionally heated by people and devices inside the hall goes up naturally. The converging roof¬ing space acts as a nozzle at whose top mobile horizontal wings use <b>Venturi’s</b> <b>effect</b> to regulate the circulation depend¬ing on the suction power and direction of wind, and all of the above is moni¬tored by a computer. And here we have an intelligent building that Herzog talked about. Large halls are usually a boring ar¬chitectural task, there is however something exceptional about this one. The high-tech stylistics of glass and metal was complemented with another material: wood. Herzog treated it as one of the dogmatic tenets of his mani¬festos and projects ever since the eighties. The transversal division of the roof facilitates zoning and orienta¬tion, not to mention the impression of hospitality it creates. The whole shows much care for detail, yet the final ef¬fect is not excessively technological, which I understand was the archi¬tect’s intention. Herzog is known to have said that “architecture should be thought about as an instrument which in the end will be played by the user anyway...|$|R
40|$|The {{slotted plate}} flow meter {{has been widely}} tested as an {{obstruction}} flow meter {{during the past several}} years. It has been tested for both single-phase flows as well as for two-phase flows. Previous studies have revealed that the slotted plate flow meter is always better in performance and accuracy than the standard orifice plate flow meter. This study is primarily based on how a slotted plate responds to horizontal two-phase flow with air and water being used as the working fluids. The plates under consideration are those with beta ratios of 0. 43 and 0. 467. Experiments have been performed with six different configurations of the slotted plate test sections. The performances of the slotted plate flow meters will be compared to that of a standard orifice plate flow meter and then with a <b>venturi.</b> The <b>effects</b> of varying the upstream quality of the two-phase flow on the differential pressure and the coefficient of discharge of the slotted plates, the standard orifice plate and the venturi will be evaluated. Response characteristics at low differential pressures will be investigated. Tests for repeatability will be performed by studying the effects of the gas Reynolds number and the upstream quality on the differential pressure. The differential pressures across the slotted plates, the standard orifice plate and the venturi will be compared. Reproducibility will be evaluated by comparing the data obtained from all six different configurations. One of the main objectives {{of this study is to}} arrive at the best suitable procedure for accurately measuring the flow rate of two-phase flow using the slotted plate flow meter...|$|R
