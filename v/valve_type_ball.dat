40|$|Prior to {{the recent}} work {{performed}} by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) relative to nuclear industry check valve performance, no information was readily available regarding the failure characteristics of check valves based on <b>valve</b> <b>type</b> (e. g., swing check, lift check). Although it had been recognized by component experts that the two most significant factors in determining check valve performance were valve design (i. e., type) and operating conditions, no industry data was available relative to the former. In cooperation with the Nuclear Industry Check Valve Group (NIC), ORNL has reviewed and analyzed check valve failures from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations` (INPOs`) Nuclear Plant Reliability Database System (NPRDS) according to several parameters,including <b>valve</b> <b>type.</b> Since the <b>valve</b> <b>type</b> identification is not inherently included within the NPRDS engineering record for each component, ORNL had to rely upon input from NIC, valve manufacturers, and catalogs to supply the missing information. As {{a result of this}} effort, approximately 77 % of the check valve failures occurring during the 1991 - 1996 study period and nearly 62 % of the overall installed population were identified according to type. This data provided the basis to perform previously unavailable cross-correlations between parameters such as <b>valve</b> <b>type</b> versus failure mode and failure cause. Design characteristics and service applications differ markedly among check <b>valve</b> <b>types,</b> resulting in discernible differences in performance. This paper focuses on the performance characteristics of swing and lift <b>type</b> check <b>valves</b> since failure and population distributions have shown these to be the two most common types employed {{in a wide range of}} nuclear plant applications...|$|R
40|$|Patient {{background}} {{mortality and}} excess mortality related to aortic valve disease {{may play a}} greater role than implanted <b>valve</b> <b>type</b> in explaining the observed survival differences after aortic valve replacement. This study attempts to identify {{the differences between the}} performance of selected biological valves, given similar patient characteristics and excess mortality. Four biological <b>valve</b> <b>types,</b> the Carpentier-Edwards pericardial and supra-annular valve, Medtronic Freestyle valve and allografts were used for this analysis. Primary data calculated observed patient-survival and median time to structural valvular deterioration. We then used a microsimulation model to calculate age-specific patient survival and reoperation- and event-free life expectancies. The model incorporated the US population mortality and a uniform excess mortality, while the hazards of valve-related events after implantation of the four <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> were estimated from corresponding meta-analysis and primary data. Observed 10 -year survival (60 - 69) -year age group survival and median time to SVD for the different <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> did not differ. Microsimulation calculated, for a 65 -year-old male for example, a 10 -year survival of 51 %, 51 %, 53 % and 56 % for Carpentier-Edwards pericardial and Supra-annular valve, Freestyle and allografts, respectively. Patient life expectancy was 10. 8, 10. 8, 11. 0 and 11. 4 years, respectively. Assuming uniform patient characteristics and excess mortality, the observed difference in performance between the four biological <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> is less marked. Patient selection and the timing of operation may explain most of the observed differences in prognosis after aortic valve replacement with biological prostheses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMore than 300 {{epicardial}} Doppler color flow mapping {{studies on}} 23 {{different types of}} clinical and preclinical valves were performed after implantation in the mitral position in sheep. The transducers were placed directly on the heart to obtain the greatest possible resolution. Studies were performed in each animal under different hemodynamic conditions by varying heart rate and cardiac output. Eighty-six valves were studied late (20 to 52 weeks), whereas the remainder were studied early (0 to 10 days) after operation. The <b>valves</b> included 3 <b>types</b> of <b>ball</b> and cage <b>valves,</b> 3 <b>types</b> of disc and cage <b>valves,</b> 7 <b>types</b> of tilting disc <b>valves,</b> 1 <b>type</b> of bileaflet hemidisc mechanical <b>valve,</b> 13 <b>types</b> of porcine aortic <b>valves</b> and 5 <b>types</b> of bovine pericardial valves. The results of these studies were compared with those obtained in 40 studies of 20 native mitral valves. Doppler color velocity/flow profiles were imaged in real time with simultaneous electrocardiographic gating; the aortic flow was also displayed for the timing of velocity/flow events. Native normal mitral valves had no in-orifice flow disturbances and laminar low velocity/flow directed toward the left ventricular apex. Ball and cage and disc and cage valves had high velocity peripheral jets and vortices of velocity/flow reversals distal to the occluders. Tilting disc valves had differing velocity/flow patterns determined by their orientation in the mitral anulus. Bileaflet hemidisc valves had three jets, which decayed 1. 5 cm downstream. Porcine aortic and bovine pericardial bioprosthetic valves had high velocity, turbulent, nonaxisymmetric jets (more severe for the latter). These observations are similar and complementary to those obtained by in vitro flow visualization techniques and those obtained by laser Doppler anemometry. As such, they provide an important interface between the in vitro assessment of prosthetic valve function and the clinical utility of Doppler color velocity flow imaging technology...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} the flow-resistance of five commercially available 10 cm H 2 O expiratory positive-pressure (EPP) valves (n = five per <b>valve</b> <b>type)</b> at bias flows of between 0 and 2, 000 ml/s. We found that individual <b>valves</b> of each <b>type</b> and manufacturer functioned similarly. Different <b>valve</b> <b>types,</b> however, functioned differently: with one type, system pressure {{was higher than}} rated (p < 0. 05), and with another type, system pressure was significantly flow-dependent (p < 0. 01). The remaining <b>types</b> of <b>valves</b> had no flow-resistive properties and maintained a system pressure of 10 cm H 2 O. We conclude that system pressure is not similar in all continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) systems using bias flow and EPP valves. The work of breathing imposed by CPAP circuits will be increased in systems whose EPP valves have flow-dependent properties...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn a Veterans Administration Cooperative Study {{involving}} 13 medical centers, 575 patients undergoing {{single valve}} replacement were prospectively randomized to receive either the standard Björk-Shiley prosthesis or the Hancock porcine heterograft (with a modified orifice for sizes 23 and smaller). The hemodynamic {{data in the}} 268 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization an average of 6 months (range 3 to 12) postoperatively are reported. Statistical analyses were performed on valve sizes 23, 25 and 27 in the aortic position, and 29, 31 and 33 in the mitral position. A wide variation was observed in mean pressure gradient and calculated orifice area in both <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> within all sizes in both the aortic and the mitral positions. In the aortic position, the Björk-Shiley prosthesis tended to have a lower pressure gradient and larger calculated orifice area than the Hancock heterograft, but the differences in gradient between the two <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> were significant only in the larger-sized valves. The difference in calculated area between the two <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> was not significant within each valve size. In the mitral position, {{there were no differences}} in gradient and calculated orifice area between the two types of prostheses. The postoperative cardiac index, regurgitant volume, pulmonary artery systolic and mean pressures, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index did not differ in patients receiving the Björk-Shiley prosthesis from values in patients receiving the Hancock heterograft. Hence, the overall hemodynamic performance of both <b>types</b> of <b>valves</b> is remarkably similar. The choice between these two prostheses should, therefore, be governed not by the hemodynamic performance, but by other factors such as valve durability, risk of anticoagulation and incidence of valve-related complications...|$|R
