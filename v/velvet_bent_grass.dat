This grass was used in Europe for estate lawns and golf courses because it could be cut so short. <b>Velvet</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> requires similar upkeep and maintenance to creeping bent. Velvet bent has recently had a resurgence in the UK due to the high demands on greens from inclement weather and speed expectations. This species also has a lighter color than the two previous species.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades the amount of weeds in our fields have noticeably decreased. The easily annihilated and {{susceptible}} species were almost eradicated by means of herbicides and agrotechnical operations. Their place was taken by more resistant species, which are a huge problem for the farmers. For this purpose I decided to make an experiment under the working circumstances. I observed the occurrence of the weeds in certain localities. Especially I concentrated on the silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti), on its occurrence, regulation, extension and susceptibility or resistance to certain herbicides. The effect of the tested herbicide combinations was statistically significant for silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> {{as well as for}} the other weeds (P 0. 05). The coach grass was the only exception, where the effect of these preparations was not proved, as well as Vicia cracca, Lamium purpurem, Galium aparine, Geranium pusillum (P > 0. 05). However the coach grass appeared among these inconclusively responsive weeds more frequently. (P > 0. 05). As the results of experiment showed, the most effective combinations for elimination of the silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti) were Sumimax + Glean, Cugar Forte + Glean + Dural a Cugar Forte + Logran. All these combinations were proved to be 100 % effective against the silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti). The other combinations were not 100 % effective. These comprised Rapsan + Command+ Grounded with 89 % effectivity, Sumimax + Logran 91 % effectivity a Butisan+ Clomate+ Grounded 67 % effectivity. The results show that the silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti) is more susceptible to some herbicide combinations and in the fields it can be successfully reduced. On the contrary the silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti) is resilient to some other agents. From this point of view the right choice of the herbicides is crucial in next year...|$|R

40|$|EpichloÃ« typhina, a clavicipitaceous {{systemic}} phytopathogen, {{was isolated}} from two varieties and three hybrids of tall fescue (Festuca arundinaceae). The morphology of the fescue isolates was compared with E. typhina isolated from <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Agrostis perennans). In all isolates, conidia were identical and were typical of E. typhina. In fescue grasses the endophyte {{failed to produce}} stromata, but on <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> the fungus seasonally produced stromata, typical of the genus. Cattle grazing the fescue grasses showed signs of the fescue toxicity syndrome, the E. typhina was found in frequencies of 100 %; in grasses from pastures in which cattle {{showed no signs of}} the syndrome, frequencies were 0 to 50 %. Nutritional factors in vitro were more complex for the isolates from fescue than for the isolate from <b>bent</b> <b>grass.</b> These studies suggested that E. typhina includes biotypes that might be involved in the toxicity syndrome. The fescue biotypes grew poorly on media, and yields were inadequate for toxicity studies. However, the <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> isolate grew well on three media, and extracts from two of these were toxic to chicken embryos. All isolates produced in vitro the nontoxic fungal steroid tetraenone [ergosta- 4, 6, 8 (14), 22 -tetraen- 3 -one], which has been isolated from toxic fescue grasses...|$|R

5000|$|The {{grass of}} the putting green (more {{commonly}} just [...] "green") is cut very short {{so that a}} ball can roll for a long distance. The most common types of greens for cold winter, but warmer summer regions (i.e., not extremely warm, as in the Southern and Southwestern United States) are <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> greens. A green may consist of a thin carpet so that bad weather {{is not allowed to}} become a serious factor in maintaining the course. These are considered the best greens because they may be cut to an extremely low height, and because they may be grown from seed. <b>Bent</b> <b>grass</b> does not have grain, which makes it superior as a putting surface. However, <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> may become infested with poa annua, a costly and time-consuming weed. Augusta National is one of many golf courses to use this type of green. The original design of Augusta National did not include <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> greens, but in the 1980s the controversial decision was made to convert the greens from Bermuda to <b>bent</b> <b>grass.</b> This has affected the speed and playing of Augusta National. [...] Many other golf courses subsequently made the decision to change from Bermuda to <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> when they observed increased business at courses that had already changed over. Another type of grass common for greens is TifDwarf Hybrid Bermuda (other variants exist, but TifDwarf {{is one of the most}} common), or simply Bermuda grass. Bermuda is more common in regions that have very warm summers and mild winters, such as the Southern and Southwestern United States. Red Bridge Golf Course was the first course in North Carolina to utilize a special Bermuda called Mini Verde. A green is generally established from sod which has had the soil washed off of it (to avoid soil compatibility problems) and which is then laid tightly over the green, then rolled and topdressed with fine sand. Another common and more economical approach for establishing a putting green is to introduce hybrid Bermuda spriggs (the stolon of the grass which are raked out at the sod farm), which are laid out on the green. The best greens are always established vegetatively and never from seed.|$|R
