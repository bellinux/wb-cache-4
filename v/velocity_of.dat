5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of the distance and proper motion of this system {{can be used to}} compute the transverse <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> IK Pegasi as 16.9 km/s. The third component, the heliocentric radial velocity, can be measured by the average red-shift (or blue-shift) of the stellar spectrum. The General Catalogue of Stellar Radial Velocities lists a radial <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> -11.4 km/s for this system. The {{combination of}} these two motions gives a space <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> 20.4 km/s relative to the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> an object; drag, which decreases the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no accelation of that body as the forces balance one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids.|$|E
40|$|In this study, burning <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen-carbon {{monoxide}} (H 2 -CO) mixtures, {{which are}} primary constituents of syngas fuels, are measured. The effect of different burner systems, H 2 concentration, and different measurement techniques on the burning <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> H 2 -CO mixtures is also discussed. The burning <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> H 2 -CO mixtures increase {{with the increase}} in H 2 content in the mixture. When compared with different burner systems using different methods, the burning velocity data almost coincide in the lean condition, but at rich condition the data stray away from each other. The burning <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> actual syngas compositions (based on different sources of coal) are then measured and analyzed {{to determine the effects of}} diluents on the burning <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> syngas mixtures. As diluents, carbon dioxide (CO 2) plays a dominating role on the burning velocity when compared to nitrogen (N 2). Finally, the burning <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> H 2 -methane (CH 4) mixtures are measured to determine the effect H 2 on the burning <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> H 2 -CH 4 mixtures. ...|$|R

5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually {{and that the}} new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> money.|$|E

5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> the contact line. If the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> a contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid.
