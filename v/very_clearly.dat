5|$|The above {{geometric}} proof shows <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> {{where the}} additional force arises from {{to make the}} orbit revolve {{with respect to the}} static orbit.|$|E
5|$|This crucial {{matter was}} also {{emphasised}} by Beck and defined in <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> expressed terms {{on the website}} of the artist, Peter Layne Arguimbau.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav's {{appearance}} {{has been}} described <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> by Leo the Deacon, who himself attended the meeting of Sviatoslav with John I Tzimiskes. Following Deacon's memories, Sviatoslav was a blue-eyed male of average height but of stalwart build, much more sturdy than Tzimiskes. He shaved his blond head and his beard but wore a bushy mustache and a sidelock {{as a sign of}} his nobility. He preferred to dress in white, and it was noted that his garments were much cleaner than those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors. He wore a single large gold earring bearing a carbuncle and two pearls.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, <b>clearly</b> <b>very</b> anxious upon this {{question}} of fact.|$|R
50|$|He is {{a mysterious}} figure, closely {{associated}} with Rembrandt, with <b>very</b> few paintings <b>clearly</b> attributable to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the more}} the merrier," [...] {{answered}} the oldest brother. [...] "I like it better than going to college." [...] But as he spoke his face became <b>very</b> thoughtful. <b>Clearly</b> Dick had something on his mind. He {{was not nearly as}} talkative as usual, Sam soon noticed that and so did Tom.|$|R
5|$|When finally {{faced with}} the loss of speech, the {{characters}} readily express what they feel. Buffy and Riley, after a series of eyebrow movements and simply mouthed questions, are able to kiss spontaneously. Xander's actions are <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> directed toward protecting Anya and punishing Spike for harming her, and likewise, within a matter of moments Anya's doubts about how Xander feels about her have disappeared and she becomes instantly affectionate towards him again. Tara, who was overcome with shyness while speaking during the Wicca meeting, easily expresses courage when touching Willow, and Willow realizes she has finally found someone who understands and shares what she is seeking.|$|E
5|$|NASA's Kepler spacecraft, {{which was}} {{launched}} in March 2009, collected photometric data continuously over a four-month period in a small area of sky, using a 0.95m Schmidt telescope. When the data collected during this period was analyzed, 1235 planetary candidates were identified amongst the observed 150,000 stars; all of these planetary candidates were suspected of transiting their host stars, in which the planetary body periodically crosses in front of and slightly dims its host star. Because the data collected on the transits of KOI-98 (later known as Kepler-14b) seemed <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> to indicate a planet, Kepler identified KOI-98 early on in its mission. Data on the object of interest was forwarded to the Kepler Follow-up Program for a follow-up investigation.|$|E
25|$|Although c-Raf is <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> {{capable of}} mutating into an {{oncogene}} in experimental settings, {{and even in}} a few human tumors, its brethren kinase B-Raf is the true major player in carcinogenesis in humans.|$|E
30|$|The speedup {{obtained}} {{in all three}} cases is <b>very</b> satisfactory, <b>clearly</b> showing the feasibility of the proposed scheme, {{as well as its}} flexibility and scalability. If more than 16 processors are going to be used, this task pipeline can be combined with image partitioning, having a full pipeline consisting of 16 stages per subimage.|$|R
50|$|The Secret History of the Mongols, {{written for}} that <b>very</b> dynasty, <b>clearly</b> distinguishes Khagan and Khan: only Genghis Khan and his ruling {{descendants}} are called Khagan, while other rulers {{are referred to}} as Khan. Khagan or Khaan refers to Emperor or King in the Mongolian language, however, Yekhe Khagan means Great Khagan or Grand Emperor.|$|R
5000|$|Sanghol {{also known}} as Uchha Pind is a famous village in the area. There are some mythical stories about the {{destruction}} of this village. The main village sits <b>very</b> high <b>clearly</b> visible from the surrounding towns. It is also linked to the Kissa [...] "Roop Basant" [...] stories as well. Some people from surrounding villages say that its ancient name was Sangla-deep.|$|R
25|$|The Steen {{above is}} <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> an exemplum, and though {{each of the}} {{individual}} components of it is realistically depicted, the overall scene is not a plausible depiction of a real moment; typically of genre painting, it is {{a situation that is}} depicted, and satirized.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as giving}} rise to The Goodies team, ISIRTA shows {{the roots of the}} Monty Python team <b>very</b> <b>clearly,</b> with Cleese, Chapman and Eric Idle all regular script contributors. The show's creator Humphrey Barclay went on to create the TV show Do Not Adjust Your Set, {{featuring}} the rest of the Python team.|$|E
25|$|Similar to his predecessors, Herodotus {{also made}} mistakes. He {{accepted}} {{a clear distinction}} between the civilized Greeks in the centre of the earth and the barbarians on the world's edges. In his Histories we can see <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> that he believed that the world became stranger and stranger when one traveled away from Greece, until one reached the ends of the earth, where humans behaved as savages.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1872, {{within a year}} of the {{founding}} of St Cyprian’s, Fr Crisp in Bloemfontein reported that “this New Rush Church has a surpliced choir accompanied by a harmonium. The singing is really <b>very</b> good.” <b>Clearly</b> intent upon consolidating a choral tradition here, St Cyprian’s soon replaced the harmonium with an organ, purchased from Grahamstown’s Commemoration Church in 1874 for the sum of £125.|$|R
50|$|Jack is <b>clearly</b> <b>very</b> {{attracted}} to Kamala but she keeps him at arm's length and {{insists that he}} maintain a sense of decorum - i.e. refusing {{to come to his}} room unless he is properly attired.|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} analysis, {{with the help}} of a {{traveling}} magnetic field, a periodically reversed flow can be obtained by optimizing the modulation frequency for a certain rectangular ingot. However, from a practical point of view, the cylindrical geometry of the ingot is <b>very</b> popular, <b>clearly,</b> and more complex three-dimensional periodical flow behaviors need to be clarified at least in the azimuthal and the axial directions, which will be introduced in the next section.|$|R
25|$|The {{painting}} is <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> {{divided into two}} zones; above, heaven is evoked by swirling icy clouds, semiabstract in their shape, and the saints are tall and phantomlike; below, all is normal in the scale and proportions of the figures. The upper and lower zones are brought together compositionally (e.g., by the standing figures, by their varied participation in the earthly and heavenly event, by the torches, cross etc.).|$|E
25|$|The Marines succeeded, recapturing {{the whole}} region and even {{fighting}} insurgents {{all the way to}} the Syrian border, where they were forced to stop (Syrian residents living near the border heard the American bombs <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> during the operation). The vast majority of these armed and trained insurgents quickly dispersed before the U.S. could bring the full force of its firepower on them, as it did in Fallujah.|$|E
25|$|For 54 {{years there}} was no {{definitive}} answer {{as to whether he}} had been brought down by friendly fire or the Japanese bomber's nose gunner. In 1997 the publication of the primary source for this article, Fateful Rendezvous: The Life of Butch O'Hare, by Steve Ewing and John B. Lundstrom (see References below) shed new light. Ewing and Lundstrom <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> state, more than once, that Japanese guns, and not Kernan's, killed Butch O'Hare.|$|E
60|$|Geoffrey {{listened with}} some amusement. So {{this was the}} weak old man's sore point--money. He was <b>clearly</b> <b>very</b> strong about that--as strong as Lady Honoria indeed, but with more excuse. Elizabeth also listened with evident approval, but Beatrice looked pained.|$|R
5000|$|According to Dan McTeague, the {{parliamentary}} {{secretary for the}} Canadian Foreign Affairs, who {{played a role in}} the Canadian government efforts to secure his release: [...] "He's in <b>very</b> good spirits, <b>clearly</b> delighted with the fact that he has been released," ...|$|R
5000|$|In February 2012, Union was {{identified}} as a suspicious person by airport security and was subjected to a [...] "hair patdown". She tweeted about the experience. [...] "Hopefully my weave doesn't cause turbulence," [...] Union joked. [...] "It's <b>clearly</b> <b>very</b> powerful." ...|$|R
25|$|Each {{plant is}} <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> {{described}} in a page of text followed by a few interesting paragraphs on its most outstanding features and how to tell it apart from its closest relatives. There follows a full plate of the most superb drawings, far better, more beautiful and comprehensive than the F.A., a distribution map (needless to say, ten times better than F.A.) and outstanding colour plates showing, separately, habit and habitat and a close-up of the flowers.|$|E
25|$|The Burial of the Count of Orgaz (Spanish: El Entierro del Conde de Orgaz) is a {{painting}} by El Greco, a Greek painter, sculptor, and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. Widely considered among his finest works, it illustrates a popular local legend of his time. An exceptionally large painting, it is <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> divided into two sections, heavenly above and terrestrial below, but it gives little impression of duality. The {{upper and lower sections}} are brought together compositionally.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the idea}} {{does not appear}} quite {{definitely}} expressed in Darwin's discussion {{of the development of}} mental powers, it seems quite clear that his main object has been to express his conviction that the mental faculties developed essentially without a purposive end, but they originated as variations, and were continued by natural selection. This idea was also brought out <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of man might very well have developed without an actual application of reasoning.|$|E
50|$|Australis' {{style is}} {{characterized}} by very rich instrumentation present even in his most simplistic pieces: <b>very</b> melodic and <b>clearly</b> defined leads built over solid tonal bases (consisting of deep evolving pads or full orchestral arrangements), along with engaging rhythms, often ethnically influenced.|$|R
6000|$|Lord Martindale hastened up at {{the same}} moment, and Violet recovering, in a few words, spoken <b>very</b> low, but <b>clearly,</b> told of his condition, adding, 'He has been {{watching}} for you all this time, he heard you come, and wants you directly, but don't let him speak.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Greg M. Bailey, who has {{published}} a scholarly review and translation into English of the first portion (...) of the Ganesha Purana, notes that {{there are hundreds of}} manuscripts for this Purana in libraries in India, and that it was <b>clearly</b> <b>very</b> popular from the 17th to 19th centuries.|$|R
25|$|After Giotto, Fra Angelico {{and others}} {{systematically}} developed uncluttered images {{that focused on}} the depiction of Jesus with an ideal human beauty, in works like Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper, arguably the first High Renaissance painting. Images of Jesus now drew on classical sculpture, at least in some of their poses. However Michelangelo was considered to have gone much too far in his beardless Christ in his The Last Judgment fresco in the Sistine Chapel, which <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> adapted classical sculptures of Apollo, and this path was rarely followed by other artists.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by Wren's work at Hampton Court, the American Vanderbilt family modeled their estate {{known as}} Florham, in Madison, New Jersey, after Hampton Court's English-baroque style. Florham was {{commissioned}} by Florence Adele Vanderbilt and Hamilton McKown Twombly from the McKim, Mead & White firm, which also built the Old Penn Station and the Rhode Island State House among many other monuments, in 1893. Hampton Court can be seen <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> in Florham's classical columns, and mix of stone and red brick. Now home to Fairleigh Dickinson University, Florham, at 110 rooms, remains the 8th largest house in the United States.|$|E
25|$|A small core of men, {{mostly in}} Companies A and E, were {{veterans}} of General N. B. Pearce's Brigade of Arkansas State Troops and had fought at Wilson's Creek in 1861, mostly in Captain Larkin Bunch's {{company of the}} 4th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops. These men were mostly pro-Southern in attitude; but by far {{the majority of the}} men conscripted into the other companies in the regiment were either pro-Union or decidedly neutral and wanted {{absolutely nothing to do with}} the war. They were conscripted to fight for a cause they did not believe in. This attitude is expressed <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> in the autobiography of Pleasant Houston Spears.|$|E
60|$|More to {{give myself}} time {{than for any}} other reason I called to Miss Hope, who had just emerged from the sacred {{enclosure}} with Stephen, and put the riddle to her, speaking <b>very</b> slowly and <b>clearly,</b> so that she might understand me. To my surprise she answered at once.|$|R
40|$|Designed {{for people}} {{with little or no}} {{knowledge}} of economics, this is a clear and up-to-date commentary on the Australian economy. It makes economics interesting, understandable and <b>very</b> readable, and <b>clearly</b> explains the information a reader will require to be able to discuss government policy, international trade, et...|$|R
50|$|The {{stratigraphy}} of the deposits is <b>very</b> {{distinct and}} <b>clearly</b> visible and is documented {{in terms of}} sets of broadly contemporary layers (members), individual layers (units) and parts of layers (sub-units). The members recognised in the Boomplaas sequence are described as follows, from the top to the bottom.|$|R
