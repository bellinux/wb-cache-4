50|$|Unlike most plastics, it {{does not}} produce {{significant}} outgassing even at high temperatures, which makes it useful for lightweight heat shields and crucible support. It also performs well in vacuum applications, down to extremely low cryogenic temperatures. However, <b>Vespel</b> tends to absorb {{a small amount of}} water, resulting in longer pump time while placed in a vacuum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vespel</b> is {{commonly}} used as a thermal conductivity reference material for testing thermal insulators, because of high reproducibility and consistency of its thermophysical properties. For example, it can withstand repeated heating up to 300 °C without altering its thermal and mechanical properties. Extensive tables of measured thermal diffusivity, specific heat capacity, and derived density, all as functions of temperature, have been published.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vespel</b> can be {{processed}} by direct forming (DF) and isostatic molding (basic shapes - plates, rods and tubes). For prototype quantities, basic shapes are typically used for cost efficiency since tooling is quite expensive for DF parts.

50|$|Polyimide powder {{can be used}} {{to produce}} parts and shapes by {{sintering}} technologies (hot compression molding, direct forming, and isostatic pressing). Because of their high mechanical stability even at elevated temperatures they are used as bushings, bearings, sockets or constructive parts in demanding applications. To improve tribological properties compounds with solid lubricants like graphite, PTFE or molybdenum sulfide are common. Polyimide parts and shapes include P84 NT, VTEC PI, Meldin, <b>Vespel</b> and Plavis.|$|E

The rotors are made from a number of different materials such as ceramics e.g. zirconia, silicon nitride or polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyoxymethylene (POM). The cylindrical rotors are axially symmetric about the axis of rotation. Samples are packed into the rotors and these are then sealed with a single or double end cap. These caps are made from number of different materials e.g. Kel-F, <b>Vespel,</b> zirconia or boron nitride depending on the application required.|$|E

40|$|A repetitively pulsed copper vapor laser (510 and 578 nm) is used {{to machine}} an opaque polymer (polyimide‐Vespel) and a {{transparent}} polymer (polymethylmethacrylate‐Lucite). Lucite is machinable by coating the surface with an ink which is semi‐opaque to the green and yellow laser light. The repetition rate of the laser was 10 kHz with approximately 0. 35 mJ/pulse and 3. 5 W average power at the copper vapor laser wavelengths for a pulse width of 40 ns. The copper vapor laser thermally loads the target, generating thermal waves and sound waves in the gas which are investigated using HeNe laser beam deflection. The gas adjacent to the target is heated to steady state {{on the order of}} 100 – 400 s.

40|$|During routine {{inspections}} of the Space Shuttle's Main Propulsion System (MPS) Liquid Oxygen (LO 2) pre-valve, the mechanism provided {{to maintain the}} valve {{in the open position}} was found cracked. The mechanism is a <b>Vespel</b> roller held against the valve visor by a stack of Belleville springs. The roller has been found cracked 3 times. All three instances were in the same valve in the same location. There are 6 pre-valves on each orbiter, and only one has exhibited this problem. Every-flight inspections were instituted and the rollers were found to be cracked after only one flight. Engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center worked together to determine a solution. There were several possible contributors to the failure: a mis-aligned visor, an out of specification edge with a sharp radius, an out of specification tolerance stack up of a Belleville spring stack that caused un-predicted loads on the <b>Vespel</b> SP- 21 roller, and a dimple machined {{into the side of the}} roller to indicate LO 2 compatibility that created a stress riser.

40|$|Abstract: Several {{research}} {{projects have been}} completed {{as part of an}} ongoing programme of work into solid-lubricated bearings for high-temperature space operation. Testing of bearings indicated that MoS 2 lubrication is effective at high temperature, but high-lighted a potential problem with the commonly used material PGM-HT – that it can shrink permanently during initial heating, leading to loss of clearances and high torques. This effect was subsequently measured quantitatively – components have been shown to contract by ∼ 1. 5 per cent on heating to 250 ◦C. A thermal conditioning regime was devised to avoid the problems of shrinkage. A number of alternatives to conventional cages were also designed, manufactured, and tested. Hybrid cages, with a metal body and inserts made of self-lubricating materials – PGM-HT and SINTIMID 15 M-HT, were identified to be an effective option, which avoids problems with conven-tional cage designs.

40|$|Particle impact {{ignition}} {{has been}} {{the primary cause of}} numerous fires in oxygen systems. This ignition phenomenon is known to occur where particles are present in high-velocity gas, and where impact occurs on a flammable material. The particle impact ignition behavior of many metals has been widely studied, but the particle impact ignition behavior of polymeric materials is relatively unknown. Particle impact ignition in polymeric materials is a concern as these materials are commonly used in component seat and seal applications, where high-velocity particle impacts can occur. This study evaluates several polymeric materials and compares the minimum temperature required for ignition (threshold temperature) of these materials: Kel-F 81 (CTFE), Teflon (PTFE), PEEK, <b>Vespel</b> SP- 21, and Nylon 6 / 6. The materials were configured as targets in the White Sands Test Facility high-velocity particle impact test system.

40|$|The Europa {{mission and}} {{spacecraft}} design presented unique challenges for selection of valve seat materials that met the fluid compatibility requirements, and combined fluid compatibility and high radiation exposure level requirements. The Europa spacecraft pressurization system valves {{will be exposed}} to fully saturated propellant vapor {{for the duration of}} the mission. The effects of Nitrogen Tetroxide (NTO) and Monomethylhydrazine (MMH) propellant vapors on heritage valve seat materials, such as <b>Vespel</b> SP- 1 and Polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE), were evaluated to determine if an alternate material is required. In liquid system applications, Teflon is the only available compatible valve seat material. Radiation exposure data for Teflon in an air or vacuum environment has been previously documented. Radiation exposure data for Teflon in an oxidizer environment such as NTO, was not available, and it was unknown whether the effects would be similar to those on air-exposed samples. Material testing was conducted by Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) to determine the effects of propellant vapor on heritage seat materials for pressurization valve applications, and the effects of combined radiation and NTO propellant exposure on Teflon. The results indicated that changes in heritage pressurization valve seat materials' properties rendered them unsuitable for the Europa application. The combined radiation and NTO exposure testing of Teflon produced results equivalent to combined radiation and air exposure results...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{properties}} –thermal conductivity, specific heat, thermal diffusivity, thermal effusivity- of rubber, elastomers, {{and other}} materials are very important parameters for their practical applications. The most widely used for thermal conductivity measurements of insulation materials is the Heat Flow Meter Method (ASTM C 518, ISO 8301, EN 1946 - 3, etc.). It has been modified and significantly improved by LaserComp, Inc. {{to be used to}} test materials of moderate thermal conductivity such as rubber and elastomers. Using special Two-Thickness procedure a much higher accuracy of thermal conductivity measurements has been achieved due to total exclusion of the distorting effect of thermal contact resistance. In computerized instruments such as LaserComp’s FOX 50 the heat flow meters’ signals are recorded versus time which gives information about volumetric specific heat of the sample. The calculation is derived from amount of the heat flow per square area absorbed by sample after switching instrument’s plates ’ temperature set points from one (after reaching thermal equilibrium condition) to another (until reaching new thermal equilibrium condition). Accurate experimental corrections for heat absorbed by the heat flow meters and for edge heat losses are applied to get the best accuracy. Thermal diffusivity and thermal effusivity are calculated using the measured values of thermal conductivity and volumetric specific heat. Density of the samples is a very easy parameter to measure- after that the mass specific heat also can be calculated. Experimental checks using several materials with known thermal properties-Pyrex 7740, <b>Vespel</b> SP 1, Pyroceram 9606, and Perspex were done, as well as rubber samples.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{engineering}} mechanisms exhibit ball-to-flat surface contacts which are periodically closed for several (thousands of) times. The impact during closing can eventually degrade the mechanism's surface layers {{whether they are}} natural oxides, chemical conversion films or even metallic coatings. This can dramatically increase the tendency of these contacting surfaces to cold-welding. A specially designed laboratory apparatus- called the "impact facility", has been fabricated at the Austrian Research Centre (ARC) and used to investigate {{the influence of the}} two main parameters likely to cause "cold-welding ". These are: 1 the impact energy, and 2) the static load, which determine whether the surfaces under test will "cold-weld " together. The adhesion force, i. e. the force required to re-open the "cold-welded" contact, was measured after each contact cycle. Experiments with stainless steel (type 17 - 7 PH) in contact with itself under vacuum will be presented. It was found that the adhesion force increased directly with an increase in static load. Under impact conditions, with energies greater than the Hertzian limit, no significant relationship was found between impact energy and adhesion force. Further "cold-welding" experiments were conducted on various pairs of metals. These have enhanced our knowledge of the behaviour of coatings, such as TiC or MoS 2 -film on stainless steel. Additional results will compare the ability of MoS 2 to lower the adhesion force between materials when it is present either as a surface film, or present within the microstructure of the composite materials Ag 15 MoS 2 and <b>Vespel</b> SP 3. A final model will be demonstrated in order to show how results from the ARC equipment can be compared to those laboratory results generated by a different test equipment that was independently fabricated by the company CSEM. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{mainstay}} pump for tritium systems, the Normetex scroll pump, {{is currently}} unavailable because the Normetex company {{went out of}} business. This pump was an all-metal scroll pump that served tritium processing facilities very well. Current tritium system operators are evaluating replacement pumps for the Normetex pump and for general used in tritium service. An all-metal equivalent alternative to the Normetex pump {{has not yet been}} identified. 1. The ideal replacement tritium pump would be hermetically sealed and contain no polymer components or oils. Polymers and oils degrade over time when they contact ionizing radiation. 2. Halogenated polymers (containing fluorine, chlorine, or both) and oils are commonly found in pumps. These materials have many properties that surpass those of hydrocarbon-based polymers and oils, including thermal stability (higher operating temperature) and better chemical resistance. Unfortunately, they are less resistant to degradation from ionizing radiation than hydrocarbon-based materials (in general). 3. Polymers and oils can form gaseous, condensable (HF, TF), liquid, and solid species when exposed to ionizing radiation. For example, halogenated polymers form HF and HCl, which are extremely corrosive upon reaction with water. If a pump containing polymers or oils must be used in a tritium system, the system must be designed to be able to process the unwanted by-products. Design features to mitigate degradation products include filters and chemical or physical traps (eg. cold traps, oil traps). 4. Polymer components can work in tritium systems, but must be replaced regularly. Polymer components performance should be monitored or be regularly tested, and regular replacement of components should be viewed as an expected normal event. A radioactive waste stream must be established to dispose of used polymer components and oil with an approved disposal plan developed based on the facility location and its regulators. Polymers have varying resistances to ionizing radiation - aromatic polymers such as polyimide <b>Vespel</b> (TM) and the elastomer EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) {{have been found to be}} more resistant to degradation in tritium than other polymers. This report presents information to help select replacement pumps for Normetex pumps in tritium systems. Several pumps being considered as Normetex replacement pumps are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction A {{new high}} current (up to 50 kW) solid target {{irradiation}} system is being built. While retaining the same beam power {{capability of the}} previous target generation, the system is a totally new design with many improvements, simplified constriction, more reliable operation and a novel approach to target handling, beam collimation and beam diagnostic. Unlike the previous, three-part soldered target, the new target is fabricated from {{a single piece of}} metal. Material and Methods The target (or rather the target-material holder) is a single metal plate (usually copper or silver) incorporating the seals and the cooling channels (FIG. 1). The target is placed in the beam at 7 °. Depending on target material and coolant flow the target can handle beam powers up to 50 kW (FIG. 2). Target transfer (utilizing a special shuttle) is pneumatic. Part of the transfer pipe is shown above the target station. Except the target o-rings (a part of each target) there are no elastomer seals in the system; all is of soldered/welded construction and metal seals. Sectional view (FIG. 3.) shows that target in place in the chamber. The target and the chamber are electrically insulated {{from the rest of the}} system, thus forming a Faraday cup for accurate current measurement. The collimator is formed of a two part silver casting. It is designed to handle up to 10 kW of beam power. Four-sector silver mask in front of the collimator allows precise beam cantering. The collimator parts were cast using 3 D printed wax patterns. This allowed to create a complex pattern of cooling channels that are difficult to produce by machining (FIG. 4.) All the actions of target shuttle landing and the target placing are performed by three air cylinders. All three are fitted with <b>Vespel</b> SP 22 (Du Pond) seals. Unlike previous systems that used mechanical grabbers to manipulate the target, low vacuum is employed to hold the target during removal from the shuttle and placing in the irradiation chamber. This greatly simplifies the operation and is more reliable. The pneumatic transfer system is using two vacuum producer to transfer the target shuttle between the target station and the hotcell. Both landing terminals in the target station and hotcell, as well as the transfer line itself, are under negative pressure preventing any spread of contamination. The hotcell landing terminal incorporates a fully automatic target-material dissolution system. After landing, the target is removed from the shuttle and the active face pressed against a reaction vessel where the dissolution takes place (FIG. 5.) All the functions of target transfer, placing and manipulations are controlled by a simple PLC (FMD 88 - 10 PLC, Triangle Research) Results and Conclusion While intended mostly for cladding with metallic target materials, a special version of the target was designed to handle salts or oxides that can be fused and retained in grooves on the target face (FIG. 6.) Despite the poor thermal conduc-tivity of most of those materials, this target can handle high beam currents. FIGURE 7 shows a thermal modelling of the cen-tral 10 × 25 mm segment of the target (highest heat flux region under a Gaussian beam). Copper target with rubidium chloride fused in 0. 8 mm wide and 1. 7 mm deep grooves and spaced by 0. 5 mm (60 % coverage). Beam of 70 MeV energy and 400 μA intensity is collimated 20 % (320 μA on target). Cooling-water flow is set to 25 l/min. Cladding the target face with a thin metallic layer can help containing the target material. This process is currently under development. Most aspects of the system operation and con-striction were successfully used in the previous “generations” of targets in the last 30 years. The new system will provide improved performance with a simpler and more reliable design, lower maintenance and lower consumables cost. FIGURE 8 shows the “ 4 th generation” system and target (2005). Dozens variants of this design are in use all over the world...|$|E
