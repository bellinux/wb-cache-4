40|$|The {{influence}} of temperature, carrier density, and electric field on hopping transport in disordered organic semiconductors is discussed, and an accurate mobility model {{that accounts for}} all those effects in a single analytical expression is derived. The model {{is based on the}} concept of percolation in a <b>variable</b> <b>range</b> hopping <b>system,</b> and the calculations are worked out by exploiting the effective temperature approach. At room temperature, the dependence on carrier density plays a major role, whereas at low temperatures or high fields, the {{influence of}} electric field becomes relevant. Neglecting only one of them leads to an evident underestimation of hopping mobility. The model accurately reproduces experiments and numerical simulations and provides, by means of a single mathematical expression, a clear picture of several physical effects as the Poole–Frenkel dependence of the mobility on the electric field or the Arrhenius behavior on temperature...|$|R

40|$|Single-photon {{detectors}} play a {{key role}} in many research fields such as biology, chemistry, medicine, and space technology, and in recent years, single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) have become a valid alternative to photo multiplier tubes (PMTs). Moreover, scientific research has recently focused on single-photon detector arrays, pushed by a growing demand for multichannel systems. In this scenario, we developed a compact 32 -channel system for time-resolved single-photon counting applications. The system is divided into two independent modules: a photon detection head including a 32 $times$ 1 SPAD array built in custom technology, featuring high time resolution, high photon detection efficiency (44 % at 550 nm), and low dark count rate (mean value $ 400 cps at $- 10 ^{circ}hbox{C}$) at 6 -V excess bias voltage and a 32 -channel acquisition system able to perform time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) measurements. The TCSPC module includes eight four-channel time-to-amplitude converter (TAC) arrays, built-in 0. 35 -$mu$m Si-Ge BiCMOS technology, characterized by low differential non-linearity (rms value lower than 0. 15 % of the time bin width) and <b>variable</b> full-scale <b>range.</b> The <b>system</b> response function of this TCSPC instrumentation achieves a mean time resolution of 63 $hbox{ps}_{rm FWHM}$, considering a mean count rate of 1 Mcps...|$|R
