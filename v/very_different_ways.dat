5|$|The {{two sides}} commemorated their dead in <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> Various mostly {{unofficial}} memorials {{were set up}} on the western side by people seeking to commemorate victims of the border. West Germans such as Michael Gartenschläger and Kurt Lichtenstein were commemorated with signs and memorials, some of which were supported by the government. The death of East German Heinz-Josef Große in 1982 was commemorated annually by demonstrations on the Western side of the border. After the policy of détente was initiated in the 1970s, this became politically inconvenient and state support for border memorials largely ceased.|$|E

25|$|An {{archaeology}} of the senses, including archaeological optics, {{emphasizes that}} the past was inhabited by living people whose experiences were inherently partial and subjective. Indeed, this subjectivity might have lent both meaning and mystery to events occurring within ancient structures. This acknowledges that the senses were {{likely to have been}} used and understood in <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> by people through time.|$|E
25|$|The {{demolition}} {{of a house}} for military purposes is often undertaken in <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> to conventional civilian demolitions. In peacetime situations, demolition is merely the first stage {{in a process that}} is usually intended to clear the ground for subsequent re-use (for instance, replacing an old building with a newer one or decommissioning an old industrial building). It is undertaken with extensive preparations, such as stripping the property of items of value, removing hazardous materials such as glass and asbestos insulation, and preparing the structure by removing features that might impede the demolition (such as internal partitions).|$|E
50|$|Ovaries of {{some kind}} {{are found in the}} female {{reproductive}} system of many animals that employ sexual reproduction, including invertebrates. However, they develop in a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> in most invertebrates than they do in vertebrates, and are not truly homologous.|$|R

50|$|Research {{shows that}} animals {{sensitive}} {{to more than}} three color channels are likely {{to see the world}} in a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> from humans. These animals are likely to experience different and more numerous unique hues, along with additional ways of mixing them.|$|R
25|$|Other animals {{also have}} receptors {{to sense the}} world around them, with degrees of {{capability}} varying greatly between species. Humans have a comparatively weak sense of smell and a stronger sense of sight relative to many other mammals while some animals may lack {{one or more of}} the traditional five senses. Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory stimuli in <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans cannot, with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic fields, and detect water pressure and currents.|$|E
25|$|A schema (pl. schemata) is {{the mental}} {{framework}} that is created as children {{interact with their}} physical and social environments. For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because it comes {{up in the morning}} and goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events in <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.|$|E
25|$|Responding to its sentimental public, Argentine film {{at times}} returns to {{subjects}} of the heart. David Lipszyc's grainy portrait of depression-era Argentina, El astillero ("The Shipyard", 2000) was a hit with critics, Paula Hernandez's touching ode to immigrants, Inheritance (2001), {{has become something of}} a sleeper, Adolfo Aristarain's Common Places (2002) follows an elderly professor into retirement, Cleopatra (2003), Eduardo Mignona's tale of an unlikely friendship, received numerous awards, as did Carlos Sorín's touching El perro ("The Dog", 2004). Emotional negativity, a staple for filmmakers anywhere, was explored in Mario Sabato's India Pravile (2003), Francisco D'Intino's La esperanza (2005) and Ariel Rotter's El otro ("The Other", 2007) each deals with mid-life crises in <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> The pronounced sentimentality of the average Argentine was also the subject of Robert Duvall's 2002 Assassination Tango, a deceptively simple crime drama that shows that still waters do, indeed, run deep.|$|E
50|$|DRBD bears a {{superficial}} similarity to RAID-1 {{in that it}} involves a copy of data on two storage devices, such that if one fails, the data on the other can be used. However, it operates in a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> from RAID and even network RAID.|$|R

25|$|In {{a number}} of cases, Mackworth was closely {{involved}} in moves to move aside opponents of the régime, who came from diverse standpoints and were treated in often <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> On 8 March {{he was one of}} a committee of three deputed to examine the case of the Levellers' leader John Lilburne, detained by the government the previous year, although acquitted of all charges. Eight days later they recommended he be sent to Mount Orgueil Castle on Jersey. On 23 March he was put on a committee to investigate the dispute between Elizabeth, Countess Dirletoun, and a group of improvers concerned {{in the construction of the}} River Wey Navigation, headed by James Pitson. Lady Elizabeth was the widow of William Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Hamilton, who was killed at the Battle of Worcester. She had refused the compensation offered by the developers for building on her land and had been breaking down the banks of the river, finally demolishing a building that had been in use as a government powder magazine, claiming that she feared for the lives of her family. As the scheme had been approved by Parliament and was clearly in the interests of trade, there was little chance that objectors would prevail, but the committee's recommendations were moderate. Pitson was granted an order protecting his investment and requesting the county authorities take more care to keep the peace. However, as Lady Dirlestoun would not accept £200, he was to pay her £10 10s. a year and then buy the land off her heirs. More generally, Mackworth was deputed to {{a number of}} committees dealing with censorship.|$|E

500|$|The {{concepts}} used in {{the videos}} were wide ranging and included {{a number of different}} ideas to interpret the lyrical meaning of the song. The final three entries selected, portrayed a fifties-style production referring to the thematic content of the song. The song's narration [...] about [...] "True Love" [...] formed the basis {{of the rest of the}} semi-finalist videos but was used in <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> The videos were choreographed featuring heterosexual romance, though no particular male or female protagonist was singled out. Some even adopted a kind of literal montage technique rather than structuring the video around a narrative line.|$|E

50|$|Egan's main {{influence}} {{comes from}} the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky. The idea of applying theory of recapitulation to education came from 19th century philosopher Herbert Spencer, although Egan uses it in a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>way.</b> Egan also uses educational ideas from William Wordsworth and expresses regret that Wordworth's ideas, because they were expressed in poetry, are rarely considered today.|$|R
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Eric Goldman {{praised the}} performances of John Slattery and Peyton List, and said the episode [...] "took three of the show's best characters and rocked their worlds in <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways,</b> telling three separate stories that were all utterly involving and moving, and delivering one of the show's best episodes ever in the process. This show continues to operate on a level few other series could dream of...". Roger Friedman of Forbes called the LSD sequences with Jane and Roger to be [...] "so well-written {{they were kind of}} transcendent". Salon writer Nellie Engoron acclaimed the episode, while pointing out that [...] "with this episode’s tilt of the seesaw back to the older generation from the flailing youngsters, we’re reminded that while the 1960s saw a cultural shift towards youth, like a drunk, no historical change walks a straight line. For all the claims that Don and others have made that the “kids” increasingly hold the cards, the real truth (if we’re telling it) is that older white guys like Bert and Roger never truly lost power, even if they began to hide behind the scenes while fresh young faces took the public glory." ...|$|E
