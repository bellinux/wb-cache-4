40|$|The Light-Weight Radioisotope Heater Unit (LWRHU) is a [sup 238]PuO[sub 2] fueled {{heat source}} {{designed}} to provide one thermal watt in each of various locations on a spacecraft. The heat sources are required to maintain the temperature of specific components within normal operating ranges. The heat source consists of a hot- pressed [sup 238]PuO[sub 2] fuel pellet, a Pt- 3 ORh <b>vented</b> <b>capsule,</b> a pyrolytic graphite insulator, and a woven graphite aeroshell assembly. Los Alamos National Laboratory has fabricated 180 heat sources, 157 {{of which will be}} used on the Cassini mission...|$|E
40|$|The {{light-weight}} radioisotope {{heater unit}} (LWRHU) is a {sup 238 }PuO{sub 2 }-fueled heat source {{designed to provide}} one thermal watt in each of various locations on a spacecraft. Los Alamos National Laboratory designed, fabricated, and safety tested the LWRHU. The heat source consists of a hot-pressed {sup 238 }PuO{sub 2 } fuel pellet, a Pt- 30 Rh <b>vented</b> <b>capsule,</b> a pyrolytic graphite insulator, and a fineweave-pierced fabric graphite aeroshell assembly. A series of sequential impacts tests using simulant-fueled LWRHU capsules was recently conducted to determine a failure threshold. Sequential impacting, in both end-on and side-on orientations, resulted in increased damage with each subsequent impact. Although the tests were conducted until the aeroshells were sufficiently distorted {{to be out of}} dimensional specification, the simulant-fueled capsules used in these tests were not severely deformed. Sequential impacting of the LWRHU appears to result in slightly greater damage than a single impact at the final impact velocity of 50 m/s. Postimpact examination revealed that the sequentially impacted capsules were slightly more deformed and were outside of dimensional specifications...|$|E

To compare {{the performance of the}} LWRHUs fabricated for the Cassini mission with the performance of those fabricated for the Galileo mission, and to determine a failure threshold, two types of impact tests were conducted. A post-reentry impact test was performed on one of 180 flight-quality units produced for the Cassini mission and a series of sequential impact tests using simulant-fueled LWRHU capsules were conducted respectively. The results showed that deformation and fuel containment of the impacted Cassini LWRHU was similar to that of a previously tested Galileo LWRHU. Both units sustained minimal deformation of the aeroshell and fueled capsule; the fuel was entirely contained by the platinum capsule. Sequential impacting, in both end-on and side-on orientations, resulted in increased damage with each subsequent impact.

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{characteristics}} of gas explosion in coal mines, the medium-scale gas explosion integrated testing system is developed. The integrated testing system is comprised of shock tube, testing section, explosion <b>venting</b> <b>capsule,</b> measuring instruments system, and other auxiliary equipments. The measuring instruments system can detect parameters of explosions and flow fields by the study of coupling relation between explosion and flow field. The synchronous control mechanism is employed to ensure parameters being simultaneously detected. The testing section can be adjusted to matching different testing requirements. Results of testing are useful to the prevention of gas explosion, emergency response and accident investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{glenohumeral}} joint is the articulation between the glenoid of the scapula {{and the head}} of the humerus; its high mobility requires a combination of active and passive stabilisers to maintain a functional joint. The aim of this thesis was to establish the mechanical properties of the glenohumeral capsule and model its contribution to stability of the joint. A six degree of freedom cadaveric testing apparatus was constructed and instrumented to facilitate laxity experiments of glenohumeral specimens in any physiological position. A pilot study examining rotational laxity of the specimens in different positions was performed to determine the optimum position for preconditioning, which was found to be 30 Â° glenohumeral abduction with a minimum axial rotation moment of 0. 5 Nm. The second stage of cadaveric testing investigated the effect of negative intra-articular pressure on joint laxity and established the envelope of translational laxity for varying levels of abduction, flexion and axial rotation. <b>Venting</b> the joint <b>capsule</b> was found to significantly increase translation in certain positions, whilst the role of the long head of biceps tendon was also studied and found to significantly reduce translations when placed under tension. Pathology of the superior glenoid labrum was simulated, repaired and tested, and a clinical test for these lesions was also replicated using the testing apparatus. However, little mechanical effect was observed in the pathology simulation experiments. The ultimate strength of the lesion repairs was also tested and found that the primary cause of failure was tendon mid-substance rupture. The data from cadaveric testing was used to evaluate a computational model of the glenohumeral ligaments and modify the parameters to improve the accuracy of the simulations. A musculoskeletal model of the upper limb, capable of predicting the muscle forces at the shoulder, was modified to accept additional inputs due to the ligament forces. The sensitivity of the ligament model and the musculoskeletal model to the ligament parameters was also analysed. Through these techniques, the ligament forces were found to increase predicted {{glenohumeral joint}} force and shoulder muscle activation at higher levels of abduction and forward flexion. The results of this work can be used to improve surgical techniques and rehabilitation for a range of different shoulder pathologies. Future study should focus on improving geometrical wrapping techniques and model assumptions not covered in this work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
