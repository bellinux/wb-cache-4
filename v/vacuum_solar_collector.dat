40|$|Vacuum {{flat plate}} solar thermal {{collectors}} offer several advantages over other collectors namely the excellent optical and thermal characteristics they exhibit {{due to a}} combination of their wide surface area and high vacuum thermal insulation. These characteristics can offer a variety of applications for industrial process heat as well as for building integration as they are much thinner than conventional collectors making installation possible in limited spaces. However, many technical challenges which need to be addressed to enable wide scale adoption of the technology still remain. This paper will discuss the challenges, expectations and requirements for the flat-plate <b>vacuum</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> development. In addition, it will provide an overview of work undertaken in Ulster University, Loughborough University, and the University of Warwick on flat-plate vacuum solar thermal collectors.

With a view to using the facility during the summer and preventing overheating-induced deterioration of the <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> in that season of the year, an absorption chiller was fitted to the system to produce solar-powered air conditioning. The facility operated in solar space heating mode in the winter of 2008 – 2009 and in cooling mode during the summer of 2008. The design was based on a new type of flat plate <b>vacuum</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> that delivered higher efficiency than conventional panels. This type of collectors can reach temperatures of up to 110 °C in the summer and up to 70 °C on the coldest winter days. The solar facility comprised a 48 -m 2 (with a net area of 42 m 2) <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> field, a 25 -kW plate heat exchanger, a 1500 -l storage tank, a 4. 5 -kW (Rotartica) air-cooled absorption chiller and several fan coils.

40|$|Abstract. In Latvia {{because of}} its {{geographical}} and climatic conditions there are some features in use of the solar energy. There is a long path of the sun at summer, but frequently large nebulosity, which enlarges the necessity to receive the energy from all sides. Therefore, conditional flat plate <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> are not efficient enough, but new constructions of <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> are required. One of such new constructions can be a semi-spherical <b>solar</b> <b>collector,</b> capable to receive the solar energy from all sides. Such semi-spherical <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> with radius 0. 56 m that corresponds to the base area 1 m 2 has been made, and measurements of water heating {{have been carried out}} at summer 2009. Theoretical calculations of the energy gain from such collector have been performed and verified by comparison of the calculated daily energy sums with the measured ones, and good coincidence has been obtained. The results obtained from these calculations show, that the energy gain from the semi-spherical <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> with the base area 1 m 2 {{is similar to that of}} tracking to the sun flat collector of 1 m 2 area. The tracking to the sun <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> is complicated, expensive and not durable, but the semi-spherical <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> is simpler, durable against the impact of wind and with good appearance.

40|$|The sun is {{an endless}} energy source {{and the heat}} it {{produces}} {{can be used to}} heatup our homes. This technology is relatively old and was introduced in the late 70 -s. There are two kinds of <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> that are most frequently used todayand these are plain <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> and <b>vacuum</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors.</b> The plain solarcollectors are the once that are used the most but the <b>vacuum</b> <b>solar</b> collectorshave increased more as a percentage the last couple of years. The biggest question asked regarding an investment in solar heating is if theplant is economically profitable. This question has no direct answer because itis dependent on a couple of prerequisites. These prerequisites are for examplewhich the existing heating system is used for the house, the accumulator tankbeing used and the houses orientation to mention a few. An investment in solar heating can be considered if the existing heating systemis either oil heating or direct electrical heating. The ground for this is that theprices for these fuels have increased a great deal {{in the last couple of}} years andbecause of that solar heating can be competitive. On the contrary, if you havean existing system that is either wood heating, pellets or long-distance heatingthe investment in <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> would not in most cases be profitable. Otherreasons could be current here like the environmental winnings. The sun is aclean and “free” heating method and this has been the reason why some peoplehave decided to invest in it. The energy that is produced by the solar collectorsis free and the economical calculation is based on the investment cost, whichoften is expensive, spread over the life-span of the system. There have been state funds to apply for over the years. These have caused theinvestment cost to sink for the plants ant the interest to increase. There are acouple of state funds to apply for and these can not be combined. The one mostcommonly used is SFS 2000 : 287 – förordning om statligt bidrag tillinvesteringar I solvärme that was introduced in the year 2000 and concernedsolar heating. This is a contribution that is bound to the yearly heat exchangethe plant can produce and it can, at most, give 7 500 Swedish crowns in funds. This regulation was replaced in the year 2008 by the regulation SFS 2008 : 1247 – Förordning om stöd för investeringar I solvärme that is a similar edict wherethe difference lies in the calculation process for the amount of the funds that aregiven for the plant. As in the earlier regulation the maximum amount of thecontribution is 7 500 Swedish crowns per household.

40|$|Cooling {{down the}} indoor air {{can be done}} in several ways. One way is desiccantcooling which will be used at the Stockholm Arena. This method is used in airhandling units that use {{temperature}} changes and moisture fluctuations in the air. Oneof the steps is to add heat during the cooling process {{in order to reduce the}} relativehumidity of the exhaust air. The air passes thru an adsorptions rotor which thenabsorbs moisture from the supply air. This results in the closing stages that the supplyair temperature drops when hydrating and the result is a cooler indoor temperaturethan the outdoor. This report is a result of a diploma work in building construction at UppsalaUniversity and is written as a guide for the Stockholm Arena to reduce theconsumption of purchased thermal energy, with the aim of producing its own energy. This is reported from a technical perspective, focusing at the design of a propersystem. Heat energy is today planned to be brought from district heating. It couldthou be replaced by other alternatives such as solar panels. To determine this, itinvestigates whether and to what degree solar panels can replace the district heat atthe cooling process of the indoor air from a technical perspective. This has beenimplemented with literature studies and interviews and further on calculations ofenergy but also financially by the annuity method. The case is focused on the summer conditions when the sorptive refrigeration willbe used. According to that calculations and assumptions have been made for probableenergy consumption and production. There after the investment costs weredetermined. The results gave that flat glazed <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> had a lower cost based on theenergy production but it required a much larger area than the vacuum solarcollectors. Based on the investment cost, <b>vacuum</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> would be lesseconomi-cally significant. Further analysis showed that the solar panels took up almost the same amount ofarea whether of choosing them to stand free or be placed right on the roof. Theinvestigations of the operating temperature of the heating coil gained 60 degreesCelsius to optimize the performance. The size of the storage tank should not exceed 3 cubic meters to obtain adequate energy changes. Solar energy is added to the tankat an external heat exchanger. At times when the heat input from the solar panels islower than required the district heat is the most appropriate kind to provide externalheat. This heat is given to the hot water slope leaving the tanks so it won’t disrupt theenergy output from the solar panels. In converted case where the production of heatis greater than required the heat energy can be used for hot water production...|$|R

30|$|The risers are {{generally}} connected {{at right angles}} to the manifold, thus forming a tee joint at each connection which leads to local disturbances. A varying local pressure drop for a flow through such a manifold results in an uneven flow distribution through the whole collector. Wang and Yu[5] developed a numerical model to calculate the isothermal flow distribution using mass and momentum equations at each branch of the header system. Wang and Wu[6] proposed a discrete numerical model and demonstrated the flow and temperature distribution in a flat-plate <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> for U- and Z-configurations by taking into account the effects of buoyancy and longitudinal heat conduction. Jones and Lior[7] developed a discrete hydrodynamic model, and the resulting nonlinear algebraic equations were solved numerically. For negligible buoyancy effects, they investigated the effects of geometrical parameters of the collector such as the ratio of riser to manifold diameter, number of risers, and length of risers on the flow nonuniformity. Fan et al.[4] carried out CFD calculations to estimate the flow and temperature distribution in a flat-plate <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> consisting of 16 risers connected in U-configuration, having a tilt of 40 °. The influences of flow rate, fluid properties, collector tilt, and collector inlet fluid temperature were investigated. Later, for the same collector, Fan and Furbo[8] studied the buoyancy effects on fluid and temperature distribution by means of CFD calculations. They found that at a certain low flow rate, buoyancy effects are of the same order as the pressure drop in the risers or even larger, which results in a more nonuniform flow distribution. The pattern of flow distribution reverses as compared to the case of high flow rate (25 l/min) with negligible buoyancy effects. Glembin et al.[2] experimentally investigated the flow distribution in a horizontally placed coaxial <b>vacuum</b> tube <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> consisting of 60 parallel vacuum tubes connected in U-configuration.

40|$|Full-scale {{traditional}} metal <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> and <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> specimens fabricated from {{polymeric materials}} were investigated {{in the present}} study. A polymeric collector is 67. 8 % lighter than a traditional metal <b>solar</b> <b>collector,</b> and a metal <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> with transparent plastic covering is 40. 3 % lighter than a traditional metal <b>solar</b> <b>collector.</b> Honeycomb multichannel plates made from polycarbonate were chosen to create a polymeric <b>solar</b> <b>collector.</b> A test rig for the natural circulation of the working fluid in a <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> was built for a comparative experimental investigation of various <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> operating at ambient conditions. It was shown experimentally that the efficiency of a polymeric collector is 8 – 15 % lower than the efficiency of a traditional collector...|$|R
40|$|Methanol {{reforming}} is {{a well-known}} method of producing hydrogen for hydrogen-based fuel cells. Since methanol reforming is an endothermic process, requiring an energy input, {{it is possible to}} use this reaction as a way to store primary energy. In this paper, we propose that this reaction can be driven with a <b>vacuum</b> packaged, nonimaging <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> which has high overall efficiency. The linear compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) collector was designed with a half angle of 27. 4 deg and a concentration ratio between 1. 5 and 1. 75 over this entire cone angle. Furthermore, due to its small size (90 mm x 72. 6 mm x 80 mm), the design is portable. Selective surfaces, black chrome and TiNOX, are analyzed for the receiver to absorb solar (short wavelength) radiation while minimizing emission of thermal (long wavelength) radiation. Importantly, this design uses a vacuum layer between the receiver and the frame to minimize the convective heat loss. A ray-tracing optical analysis shows an optical efficiency of 75 - 80 % over the entire half incident angle range. Stagnation tests show that under vacuum conditions, temperature up to 338 °C is achievable. Overall, the proposed design can achieve high temperatures (up to 250 °C) without tracking-which reduces overall cost, operational limitations, and enables a portable design...|$|R
40|$|The Hydrogen Systems Laboratory in {{a unique}} {{partnership}} between Purdue University's main campus in West Lafayette and the Calumet campus was established and its capabilities were enhanced towards technology demonstrators. The laboratory engaged in basic research in hydrogen production and storage and initiated engineering systems research with performance goals established as per the USDOE Hydrogen, Fuel Cells, and Infrastructure Technologies Program. In the chemical storage and recycling part of the project, we worked towards maximum recycling yield via novel chemical selection and novel recycling pathways. With the basic potential of a large hydrogen yield from AB, we used it as an example chemical but have also discovered its limitations. Further, we discovered alternate storage chemicals that appear to have advantages over AB. We improved the slurry hydrolysis approach by using advanced slurry/solution mixing techniques. We demonstrated vehicle scale aqueous and non-aqueous slurry reactors to address various engineering issues in on-board chemical hydrogen storage systems. We measured the thermal properties of raw and spent AB. Further, we conducted experiments to determine reaction mechanisms and kinetics of hydrothermolysis in hydride-rich solutions and slurries. We also developed a continuous flow reactor and a laboratory scale fuel cell power generation system. The biological hydrogen production work summarized as Task 4. 0 below, included investigating optimal hydrogen production cultures for different substrates, reducing the water content in the substrate, and integrating results from <b>vacuum</b> tube <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> based pre and post processing tests into an enhanced energy system model. An automated testing device was used to finalize optimal hydrogen production conditions using statistical procedures. A 3 L commercial fermentor (New Brunswick, BioFlo 115) was used to finalize testing of larger samples and to consider issues related to scale up. Efforts continued to explore existing catalytic methods involving nano catalysts for capture of CO 2 from the fermentation process...|$|R
