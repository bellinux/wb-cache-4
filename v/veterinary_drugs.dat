25|$|Chopra is an Indo-Canadian Hindu {{born and}} raised in the Punjab, where he {{received}} in 1957 a B.VSc. from Punjab Veterinary College. He then worked at the Biologics Production and Quality Control Research Department at the Punjab Veterinary College. He immigrated to Canada around 1964, where he then received his PhD in Microbiology from McGill University in Montreal. After obtaining his PhD at McGill, he moved to England to work for Miles Laboratories. In 1969 Chopra moved back to Canada and began his career with Health Canada as a drug evaluator for the Bureau of Human Prescription Drugs at Health Canada, a Canadian government agency. In 1987, he applied and was selected to work at the Bureau of <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Drugs,</b> another of Health's Canada bureaus where he worked until being fired in June 2004.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the problem}} of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> {{residues}} in animal derived food has drawn wide attention in the world. It is imperative to develop rapid, simple, highly sensitive, and high-throughput analytical methods for <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residues. A comprehensive review was presented here on the sample pretreatment and determination methods of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residues. The principles, operation procedures, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} various analytical technologies were analyzed and compared．Possible future directions in the analytical methods used for <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residues were also outlined...|$|R

Addi-tionally, the detection methods of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residues in raw aquatic products, ready-to-eat meat, dairy products and the differences of maximum residue limits between china and other countries were overviewed.

2500|$|As a {{developing}} nation, China has relatively low sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards for its agricultural goods. Corruption in the government, {{such as the}} bribery of {{the former head of}} the State Food and Drug Administration Zheng Xiaoyu, has also complicated China's regulation difficulties. Excessive pesticide residues, low food hygiene, unsafe additives, contamination with heavy metals and other contaminants, and misuse of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> have all led to trade restrictions with developed nations such as Japan, the United States, and the European Union. These problems have also led to public outcry, such as in the melamine-tainted dog food scare and the carcinogenic-tainted seafood import restriction, leading to measures such as the [...] "China-free" [...] label.|$|E
2500|$|Prevention of {{heartworm}} infection can {{be obtained}} {{through a number of}} <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs.</b> The drugs approved for use in the US are ivermectin (sold under the brand names Heartgard, Iverhart, and several other generic versions), milbemycin (Interceptor Flavor Tabs and Sentinel Flavor Tabs) and moxidectin (ProHeart) administered as pills or chewable tablets. Moxidectin is also available in both a six-month and 12-month, sustained-release injection, ProHeart 6 or ProHeart 12, administered by veterinarians. [...] The injectable form of moxidectin was taken off the market in the United States due to safety concerns in 2004, but the FDA returned a newly formulated ProHeart 6 to the market in 2008. ProHeart 6 remains on the market in many other countries, including Canada and Japan. Its sister product, ProHeart 12, is used extensively in Australia and Asia as a 12-month injectable preventive. [...] Topical treatments are available, as well. [...] Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + moxidectin) Topical Solution, uses moxidectin for control and prevention of roundworms, hookworms, heartworms, and whipworms, as well as imidacloprid to kill adult fleas. [...] Selamectin (Revolution) is a topical preventive likewise administered monthly; it also controls fleas, ticks, and mites.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 and 1999, Chopra, {{along with}} two co-workers, Drs. Margaret Haydon and Gerard Lambert, testified to the Canadian Senate Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry that they were {{pressured}} by senior supervisors to approve multiple drugs of questionable safety, including Bovine Growth Hormone (rBST) and Baytril, which {{in the words of}} Chopra, [...] "is even more controversial. It's a critical antibiotic, one that produces cross-resistance against a critical antibiotic necessary for human use called ciprofloxacin. It's from the same class of drugs. When it is used in poultry, beef, turkeys, pigs, or whatever, then it causes cross-resistance in the intestines of those animals. Then those bacteria, like salmonella, campylobacter, or E. coli, get transferred to people and cause disease and death of immense order." [...] Prior to the mad cow disease crisis in Canada, Chopra warned the government that the current handling of feed to cows was inadequate. [...] Following this, Chopra, Haydon, Lambert and colleague Chris Bassude complained to the Public Service Integrity Officer (PSIO) office, a federal investigative body {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Treasury Board of Canada, indicating again that they were pressured by their seniors to pass a number of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs,</b> including Tylosin, Revalor H, Synergistin Injectable Suspension, Baytril, rBST, Carbodex and Eugenol, without proof of human safety. The PSIO case was initially dismissed in 2003, but the ruling was appealed to the Federal Court of Canada.|$|E

40|$|Hormone and <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> {{screening}} and forensics {{can benefit from}} the recent developments in desorption electrospray ionisation (DESI) mass spectrometry (MS). In this work the feasibility of DESI application has been studied.

Preliminary data are presented for the rapid screening of (pro) hormone supplement samples, an illegal steroid cocktail and forensic samples from <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> investigations. The potential of this DESI approach is clearly demonstrated since compounds observed could be independently confirmed by liquid chromatography/TOFMS with accurate mass measurement, and/or proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Specific concerns related to false-positive and false-negative findings due to limitations in quantification and memory-effects are briefly discussed.
