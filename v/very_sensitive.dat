5|$|Banksia verticillata {{is seldom}} seen in cultivation. The natural growing {{conditions}} {{point to a}} sunny aspect and good drainage as being important in cultivation. It is good for coastal situations and erosion control. <b>Very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to dieback, B. verticillata (like most other western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are diurnal and {{arboreal}} quadrupeds, often observed leaping {{through the}} upper canopy of the seasonal tropical rainforests in eastern Madagascar. They {{are also the}} most frugivorous of the Malagasy lemurs, and they are <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to habitat disturbance. Ruffed lemurs live in multi-male/multi-female groups and have a complex and flexible social structure, described as fission-fusion. They are highly vocal, and have loud, raucous calls.|$|E
5|$|Seeds of B.sessilis are short-lived, {{and must}} {{germinate}} {{in the winter}} following their release, or they die. They are also <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to heating, and thus killed by bushfire; in one study, just 30 seconds in boiling water reduced the germination rate from 85% to 22%, {{and not a single}} seed survived one minute of boiling.|$|E
25|$|All three lakes are <b>very</b> acid <b>sensitive</b> and {{therefore}} vulnerable to afforestation within their catchment areas.|$|R

5|$|Aberdaron {{is noted}} for {{low levels of}} air pollution. The Gwynedd State of the Environment Report in 2004 found levels of sulfur dioxide, {{nitrogen}} dioxide and carbon monoxide very low, and particulates to be low. It {{is one of the}} few sites in the United Kingdom for golden hair lichen, a striking bright orange lichen that is <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to air pollution. The climate is relatively mild and, because of the Gulf Stream, frosts are rare in winter.|$|E
5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E
5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is <b>very</b> <b>sensitive.</b> Without regular mud baths {{to protect it}} from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{like with}} many of the New Trade Theory models, the results of the Brander Spencer model and the policy {{prescriptions}} it generates are <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to the underlying assumptions {{on the nature of the}} industry in question, the information available to the national government, its ability to credibly commit to an action and the likely response of foreign governments. Some of these criticisms were already noted by Brander and Spencer in their paper, where they advised caution.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium {{normally}} has six allotropes {{and forms}} a seventh (zeta, ζ) at high temperature within a limited pressure range. These allotropes, which are different structural modifications or forms of an element, have very similar internal energies but significantly varying densities and crystal structures. This makes plutonium <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> {{to changes in}} temperature, pressure, or chemistry, and allows for dramatic volume changes following phase transitions from one allotropic form to another. The densities of the different allotropes vary from 16.00g/cm3 to 19.86g/cm3.|$|E
5|$|Poor and fatherless, Garfield was mocked by {{his fellow}} boys, and {{throughout}} his life was <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to slights. He escaped through reading, devouring all the books he could find. He left home at age 16 in 1847. Rejected by the only ship in port in Cleveland, Garfield instead found work on a canal boat, responsible for managing the mules that pulled it. This labor {{would be used to}} good effect by Horatio Alger, who penned Garfield's campaign biography in 1880.|$|E

30|$|From Table  1 and Table  2, it {{is clear}} that for a total {{asymptotically}} nonexpansive mapping, modified Mann iteration (1.1) is <b>very</b> much <b>sensitive</b> about the choice of initial point and control condition α_n, whereas the behavior of proposed iteration (1.3) is consistent.|$|R
5|$|Porpoises are <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to {{anthropogenic}} disturbances, and are keystone species, {{which can}} indicate the overall {{health of the}} marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution {{is a serious problem}} for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{complete}} set of observable traits {{that make up the}} structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and are <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to sunburn.|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} is <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to human {{activity}} when rearing its young. No institution, for example, has successfully raised giant otter cubs unless parents were provided sufficient privacy measures; the stress caused by human visual and acoustic interference {{can lead to}} neglect, abuse and infanticide, as well as decreased lactation. In the wild, it has been suggested, although not systematically confirmed, that tourists cause similar stresses: disrupted lactation and denning, reduced hunting, and habitat abandonment are all risks. This sensitivity is matched by a strong protectiveness towards the young. All group members may aggressively charge intruders, including boats with humans in them.|$|E
50|$|Dispersions {{prepared}} with such stabilizers typically exhibit excellent colloidal stability (for example, dry powders may be mixed into the dispersion without causing coagulation). However, they often result in {{products that are}} <b>very</b> water <b>sensitive</b> due {{to the presence of}} the water-soluble polymer.|$|R
50|$|The main {{threat to}} the species is over-grazing and {{trampling}} of shrub-lands and tussock grasslands by feral herbivores and domestic stock. Habitat clearing, fragmentation, landscape degradation, and fires which occur too frequently and extensively, are also threats to the stripe-faced dunnarts habitat. Predation by feral cats and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) also directly impacts the species population. Removal of fallen timber also threatens the species as it relies on it for shelter form the heat and predator, as well forages for invertebrates that may live in or under woody debris. The dunnarts are <b>very</b> <b>sensitives</b> to the organophosphorus pesticide fenitrothion which at sub-lethal intoxication can cause lethargy and temporary immobilisation, increasing the risk of predation. The pesticide is used by local landholders to control locusts.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} primates, {{one of the}} {{principal}} threats to both ruffed lemur species is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, and mining. Both species appear to be <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to logging, and are thought to be the most vulnerable of rainforest lemurs. The hardwoods that are favored for construction materials and selectively logged are also preferred by ruffed lemurs for their fruits and potentially affect their travel routes through the canopy. Deforestation, on the other hand, {{is a result of the}} need to provide firewood and to support subsistence agriculture and cash crops. For red ruffed lemurs, Slash-and-burn agriculture, known locally as tavy, is practiced seasonally on the Masoala peninsula between October and December, and its practice is expanding. Additionally, cattle are sometimes allowed to free-range over these former agricultural clearings, preventing forest re-growth.|$|E
5|$|For many {{practical}} purposes, {{light and}} other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant space probes, {{it can take}} minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing {{the study of the}} history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the theoretical maximum speed of computers, since information must be sent within the computer from chip to chip. The speed of light can be used with time of flight measurements to measure large distances to high precision.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{can take}} decades of {{studying}} climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil {{will be in the}} more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this may not seem like a large change, bees are <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.|$|E

30|$|At times, it was {{difficult}} to determine the dyes used on some of the samples from the detected components because some dyes (e.g. safflower, soluble redwood) are <b>very</b> light <b>sensitive</b> and had faded significantly. There was also probable contamination of dyes from adjacent threads in the tightly packed weave structure of the velvets.|$|R
40|$|AbstractResistors {{based on}} {{parallel}} suspended polycrystalline silicon nanowires are fabricated using the classical top down CMOS silicon technologies. Results show potential use as sensitive units of silicon nanowires for charged chemical species (ammonia) detection.

5|$|Some {{species may}} be in risk of {{extinction}} even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which are <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations {{may be able to}} persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural disasters and disease outbreaks (epizootics). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis, which is spread by feral cats, and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E
5|$|Yuri, {{also known}} as , has a {{determined}} personality but is secretly <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> and protective. She invites Otonashi to join the SSS, an organization she founded and leads which fights against God. She is smart and decisive when making operations and decisions. She carries a silver Beretta 92. Not only is she skilled with a gun, but she is also capable in close range hand-to-hand combat, which is shown when she fends off Angel's hand sonic with a combat knife. She vowed to fight against God after her three younger siblings were murdered by burglars looking for valuables and never forgave herself for failing to prevent their deaths. She is an effective leader, but does not think so. She regrets even fighting with Kanade later in the story, because she feels {{she could have been}} great friends with her. She disappears after the graduation ceremony.|$|E
