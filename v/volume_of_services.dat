40|$|Logistics {{networks}} arise {{whenever there}} is a transfer of material substance or objects (such as checked baggage on international flights) as well as energy, information, or finance through links (channels). A general concept of logistics network is suggested and motivated for modeling a <b>service</b> <b>of</b> any kind supplied through links between the nodes of the network. The efficiency of a single link is defined to be the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> useful <b>service</b> at the output node to the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> expended <b>service</b> at the input node of the link (for a specific period of time). Similarly, the efficiency of a chain is the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> at the output to the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> at the input of the chain. The overall efficiency of the chain is calculated {{as the product of}} the efficiencies of its links; the more efficiency of the chain, the less are the losses in the chain. This paper introduces the notion <b>of</b> inadequacy <b>of</b> <b>service</b> {{in such a way that}} the overall inadequacy of a chain is equal to the sum of the inadequacies of its links. So the efficiencies are being multiplied, whereas the inadequacies are being added. Thus, the antagonistic pair (efficiency, inadequacy) appears to be analogous to the pair (reliability, entropy) in communication theory. Various possible interpretations of the proposed logistic model are presented: energy, material, information and financial networks. Four algorithms are provided for logistics chain search: two algorithms for finding the most effective chain from a specified origin to a specified destination, and two algorithms for finding the guaranteed minimum level <b>of</b> <b>service</b> between any pair of unspecified nodes in a given network. An example is shown as to how one of the algorithms finds the most efficient energy chain from the electrical substation to a specified user in a concrete energy network.

5000|$|Reverse {{factoring}} {{is seen as}} {{an effective}} cash flow optimation tool for companies outsourcing large <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> (e.g. clinical research activities by Pharmaceutical companies). The benefit to both parties is that the company providing the services can get the outstanding value of their invoices paid in 10 days or less vs. the normal 30- to 45-day payment terms while the ordering party can delay the actual payment of the invoices (which are paid to the bank) by 120-180 days thus increasing cash flow. After the initial period of cash flow optimation, it is unclear if this will remain of value to the ordering party because you will then be paying monthly invoices of approximately equal amounts assuming your outsourced services are stable/average across the year/future periods. The cost of the [...] "money" [...] is a set interest rate normally tied to an index plus a bps adjustment.|$|E
