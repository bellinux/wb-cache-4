In fact, I laughed and smiled the entire way through." [...] Starpulse named [...] "The Rain King" [...] as the ninth best X-Files episode and praised the lighter approach to the paranormal, saying that the episode was an [...] "ingenious way to use the paranormal motif of the show for something other than thrills". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] grade. Despite criticizing the show for [...] "filming {{in the land of}} sunshine and lemon drops" [...] and [...] "border on that overly twee independent movie vibe", Handlen noted that [...] "the episode’s essential sweetness has enough snarky asides from our heroes [...] that it never goes completely off the rails." [...] He did, however, note that the episode's placement, after a string of several humorous episodes, hurt its reception; he argued that, had it appeared in an earlier, darker season, the entry would now be viewed as [...] "a cock-eyed classic".|$|E

2500|$|The {{first look}} of the film was {{supposed}} to be released along with Dharma Productions' We Are Family on 3 September. Later the trailer was withdrawn from We Are Family. The official reason given for the postponement of the trailer was the time factor as the producers felt {{that there was a lot}} of time before the release of Guzaarish, and hence it was decided Guzaarish's first promotional trailer would feature in theaters a month later with Siddharth Anand's Anjaana Anjaani. However the real story was that there were some concerns over a sequence showing Aishwarya Rai puffing away frantically at a cigarette in the trailer. While smoking is not entirely prohibited in Indian films, it is certainly seen to be injurious to health, especially since the one smoking on screen is a global icon playing a nurse. Sources close to the film revealed, [...] "Aishwarya is not really smoking in Guzaarish. It's a <b>very</b> <b>cute,</b> funny and a very beautiful sequence where she is trying to smoke when she doesn't know how to." [...] Irrespective of the context it had been decided that the release date of the first trailer would be postponed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Story of Us" [...] {{was met with}} mostly {{positive}} reception among music critics.

He concluded that Swift is good at telling sweet little tales of unrequited love rather than trying to be a symbol of young female empowerment. Donna Kaufman of IVillage was amused with Swift's idea of what happened at a university library which was portrayed in the music video, writing [...] "it's all <b>very</b> <b>cute</b> in that patented Taylor Swift way." [...] Leah Collins of The Vancouver Sun complimented the video for its departure from music-video high school. The same opinion was expressed by Carina Adly MacKenzie of Zap2it who noted that [...] "Swift has graduated from the [...] "You Belong With Me" [...] prom days to a world of dusty books and hipster glasses for [...] "The Story of Us"." [...] To date, the video has over 78 million views on YouTube.|$|E

It was very careless of his mother to leave the fruitatives where he could get them, but she was well-known to be a heedless creature. One day she found a nest of five eggs as she was going across the fields to church with a brand new blue silk dress on. So she put them in the pocket of her petticoat and when she got to church she forgot all about them and sat down on them and her dress was ruined, not to speak of the petticoat. Let me see--would not Tod be some relation of yours? Your great grandmother West was a MacAllister. Her brother Amos was a MacDonaldite in religion. I am told he used to take the jerks something fearful. But you look more like your great grandfather West than the MacAllisters. He died of a paralytic stroke quite early in life." ...|$|R
