40|$|BACKGROUND: In-stent {{restenosis}} due to intimal hyperplasia is {{an important}} clinical problem. Animal models of stent injury are limited by inconsistent arterial responses to stenting, and less intimal hyperplasia than diseased human vessels. To address these issues, we aimed to compare the degree of intimal hyperplasia in stented rabbit jugular-carotid interposition <b>grafts</b> (<b>vein</b> <b>grafts)</b> versus stented carotid arteries. METHODS: Jugular-carotid <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> were constructed in rabbits, then stented or left unstented. Carotid arteries were treated with similar stents or left instrumented only. After 3 or 28 days, vessels were perfusion fixed, embedded in resin, and sections were cut with a diamond saw. Intimal and medial thicknesses were measured in stained sections. RESULTS: After 3 days, inflammatory changes were observed in the intima of all stented vessels. After 28 days, intimal thickness in stented <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> was 2 -fold greater than in control <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> and approximately 4 -fold greater than in stented carotid arteries. In addition, the intimal hyperplasia response was markedly more consistent in stented <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> compared with stented carotid arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Stent deployment in experimental <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> results in increased and more reproducible smooth muscle cell intimal hyperplasia than carotid arterial stenting.

Methods: Forty New Zealand white rabbits underwent jugular <b>vein</b> interposition <b>grafting</b> of the common carotid artery. Ten animals were controls, 10 animals received 2. 25 % l-arginine supplementation in their drinking water (200 ml/day; 2 mg/kg) 7 days before surgery and continued thereafter until harvest, in 10 animals the veins were immersed in deferoxamine manganese (DFMn; 10 − 3 mol/L in heparinized Ringer's lactate for 15 minutes) before implantation, and 10 received both l-arginine supplementation and DFMn therapy. Twenty-eight days after the operation, the <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> were harvested for either histologic (n= 6) or isometric tension studies (n= 4). The function of <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> was compared with that of jugular veins. Results: Treatment with DFMn, l-arginine, and DFMn/L-arginine produced decreases in mean intimal thickness of 39 % (51 ± 7 μm; p< 0. 05), 51 % (41 ± 7 μm; p< 0. 05), and 65 % (29 ± 6 μm; p< 0. 01), respectively, compared with control <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> (83 ± 12 μm). Compared with the control group, the intimal ratio ([intima]/[intima+media]) decreased by 16 % (difference not significant), 8 % (difference not significant), and 47 % (p< 0. 01) in the DFMn-, l-arginine- and DFMn/L-arginine-treated <b>vein</b> <b>grafts,</b> respectively. Jugular <b>veins</b> relaxed to acetylcholine (53 %± 12 % maximal relaxation), whereas control <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> did not relax.

Tyrosine kinase is known to mediate cell signaling. However, its role with in vivo mechanotransduction is not yet well defined. We used a novel bioprosthetic collagen tube to provide an external support to <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> and examined the subsequent changes in hemodynamics, tyrosine kinase signaling, wall remodeling, and vasomotor function. Methods: Carotid interposition bypass grafting was performed with the reversed jugular vein in New Zealand white rabbits. In the experimental group (n = 15), after the completion of the proximal anastomosis, the vein was passed through a 4 -mm collagen tube and the distal anastomosis was performed. The tube support was fashioned to completely cover the <b>vein</b> <b>grafts.</b> The control animals (n = 14) had no tube support. After surgery, the blood pressure and flow rate were measured and the wall tension and shear stress were calculated in the <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> on day 3 or day 28 (n = 5 per group). Tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed with the Western blot test in <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> at day 3 (n = 4 per group). The intimal and medial dimensions of the <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> were assessed with videomorphometry on day 28 (n = 5 per group). The cumulative dose response curves of the <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> to contractile and relaxant agonists were determined in isometric tension studies on day 28 (n = 5 per group). Results: The use of tube support reduced wall tension 1. 7 -fold (P <. 01) and increased shear stress 4. 8 -fold (P <. 001) without altering the flow rate or blood pressure. The tyrosine kinase activity was reduced 15 -fold (P <. 001) in the tube-supported <b>vein</b> <b>grafts.</b> The intimal thickness was reduced by 45 % in the tube-supported <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> as compared with the control grafts (46 ± 2 mm vs 84 ± 5 mm, respectively; P <. 0001), and the media thickness was reduced by 20 % (63 ± 8 mm vs 79 ± 4 mm, respectively; P <. 05). Isometric tension studies showed preservation of contractile function and modulation of endothelial-dependent dysfunctional relaxation in tube-supported <b>vein</b> <b>grafts.</b> Conclusion: These results show that reduced wall tension and increased shear stress with an external tube support can effectively modulate the signaling, functional, and hyperplastic responses in <b>vein</b> <b>grafts.</b> We conclude that this simple strategy deserves further study and clinical consideration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fast MR flow mapping at baseline and during adenosine-induced stress was performed in 39 nonstenotic single <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> and 20 nonstenotic sequential <b>vein</b> <b>grafts,</b> as well as in 15 stenotic <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> before and 7. 3 weeks +/- 1. 5 after successful PCI. We evaluated the following parameters (in terms of mean values +/- SDs) : average peak velocity (APV) at baseline, stress APV, and velocity reserve. Parameters in nonstenotic single and sequential <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> were compared by means of unpaired two-tailed Student t testing. To evaluate changes in velocities before and after PCI, a paired two-tailed Student t test was used. P <. 05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. RESULTS: Reference values in single <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> for baseline APV, stress APV, and velocity reserve were 8. 6 cm/sec +/- 3. 4, 20. 2 cm/sec +/- 9. 5, and 2. 4 +/- 0. 8, respectively. In sequential <b>vein</b> <b>grafts,</b> significantly higher values for baseline APV (12. 2 cm/sec +/- 5. 0) and stress APV (27. 2 cm/sec +/- 10. 6) but a similar velocity reserve (2. 3 +/- 0. 7) were found. Significant improvements were observed after PCI in baseline APV (before PCI: 9. 2 cm/sec +/- 6. 6; after PCI: 12. 9 cm/sec +/- 7. 9; P =. 008) and stress APV (before PCI: 12. 9 cm/sec +/- 6. 3; after PCI: 27. 1 cm/sec +/- 13. 9; P <. 001).

40|$|Abstract—Eddy flow {{has been}} shown to promote focal smooth muscle cell (SMC) {{proliferation}} and neointimal formation in experimental <b>vein</b> <b>grafts.</b> This study focuses on whether the angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor mediates these events. Experimental <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> with and without eddy flow were created in the rat. Losartan was used to assess the influence of the AT 1 receptor on SMC proliferation. In <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> with eddy flow, apparent focal expression of AT 1 mRNA and protein was found in the leading region of the proximal focal neointima, where eddy flow occurred, but not in the trailing region, where eddy flow diminished, at days 5, 10, 20, and 30. The rate of SMC proliferation in the leading region (10. 961. 4 %, 19. 562. 2 %, 12. 262. 0 %, and 6. 961. 3 % at these times, respectively) was significantly higher than that in the trailing region (9. 561. 8 %, 15. 362. 0 %, 8. 261. 9 %, and 3. 260. 7 %) in these <b>vein</b> <b>grafts.</b> When eddy flow was prevented in engineered <b>vein</b> <b>grafts,</b> no apparent location difference was found in the distribution of AT 1 receptor mRNA and protein in the neointima, and the rate of SMC proliferation (5. 361. 0 %, 5. 860. 9 %, 3. 461. 0 %, and 3. 760. 9 % at days 5, 10, 20, and 30, respectively) was reduced significantly. In <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> with losartan, the rate of SMC proliferation in the leading region of the neointima (9. 461. 8 %, 10. 161. 3 %, 8. 360. 9 %, and 4. 260. 5 % at days 5, 10, 20, and 30, respectively) was significantly lower than that in <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> without losartan. These results suggested that eddy flow upregulated the AT 1 receptor, which in turn mediated focal SMC proliferation in the neointima of experimental <b>vein</b> <b>grafts.</b> (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 1999; 19 : 2630 - 2639. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives:The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were {{to assess the impact of}} Duplex surveillance on the results of infrainguinal <b>vein</b> <b>grafts.</b> A review has been performed comparing the outcome of <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> undergoing Duplex surveillance plus prophylactic treatment of stenoses to that of <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> followed clinically. Design, patients and methods:Only studies providing information on occlusion rates were included. Mortality and limb salvage rates were also analysed but were not available from all studies. Results: 2680 surveillance and 3969 non-surveillance <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> were analysed. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to presence of critical ischaemia (p = 0. 3) and level of distal anastomosis (p > 0. 5). Surveillance identified 493 stenoses in 469 (19 %) grafts, 397 (16 %) grafts were treated by surgery (248; 62 %) and angioplasty (149; 38 %). Ninety-eight (26 %) grafts developed recurrent stenoses. Total number of deaths, total number of occluded grafts and number of occlusions after 30 days were significantly greater for the non-surveillance group (p 0. 5). Conclusions:The patency of infrainguinal <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> would appear to be improved as a result of surveillance. However, no improvement in limb salvage has been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of single-dose pre-insertion gamma radiation of <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> {{in the prevention of}} intimal hyperplasia. Methods: femoral artery interposition grafts with internal jugular vein were inserted in 12 mongrel dogs. The animals were randomly divided into two groups. Immediately before <b>graft</b> replacement, jugular <b>veins</b> were treated with a single dose of cobalt- 60 radiation at 14 Gy or received no radiation (control group). Six weeks after <b>graft</b> insertion, the <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> were pressure-perfusion fixed and harvested for the histomorphometric analysis. Quantitative data on anastomotic stenosis were calculated from Gilman parameters after cross-sectional image analysis. Results: <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> treated with radiation demonstrated significantly decreased neointima formation compared with grafts in the control group. The mean Gilman parameter for the control group was 1. 09 S. E. M. 0. 34 mm and for the radiotherapy group was 0. 65 S. E. M. 0. 23 mm (p< 0. 05). All <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> in the radiotherapy group had a decreased amount of intimal and cellular infiltration. Conclusion: single-dose external pre-insertion gamma radiation of <b>vein</b> <b>grafts</b> reduced the amount of intimal hyperplasia in this animal model...|$|R
