[...] The three mites species have a broad host range and are widely distributed. [...] All active stages of the mite (larvae, nymph, and adult) can acquire and transmit the virus, {{although it has been}} reported that larvae transmit the virus more efficiently. [...] It is known that there is no transovarial transmission from female to its descendents, and that after acquisition (an acquisition access period of 2 days), the mite remains <b>viruliferous</b> during entire life-span (persistent transmission), but it is not clear if the virus replicates inside the vector.|$|E
5000|$|Aphids are {{the main}} vector by which CTV is {{transmit}}ted. Initially the United States only had the melon (cotton aphid) Aphis gossypii, spirea aphid Aphis spiraecola, and black citrus aphid Toxoptera aurantii. [...] These aphids transmit the virus much less efficiently than the brown citrus aphid Toxoptera citricida. Toxoptera citricida {{had been found in}} East Asia and South America, and had slowly made its way up through Central America and the Caribbean Islands. By 1993 it had reached Cuba, and in 1995 it was found in Florida. [...] The aphids require at least 30 to 60 minutes of feeding to acquire the virus, and remain <b>viruliferous</b> for at least 24 hours after. T. citricida is much more efficient than the other aphids, and it can transmit CTV strains causing severe stem pitting or decline that the other aphids cannot vector. Even though A. spiraecola is less efficient, it tends to have higher populations and thus can still transfer the virus fairly well. T. aurantii has been shown to only transmit certain strains of CTV. Of the three lesser efficient aphids, A. gossypii has a 78% transmission efficiency, while A. spiraecola and T. aurantii are between 0-6%. [...] The main cultural practice that increases the severity of the CTV is when the citrus trees are grafted onto the sour orange rootstock. Using CTV infected budwood for grafting can transfer the CTV from the original tree to the new one.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} agricultural pests. In recent years, B. tabaci Q has invaded China, and Q has displaced B in many areas now. In a number of regions of the world, invasion by B and/or Q has been followed by outbreaks of tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV). Our previous study showed TYLCV directly and indirectly modified the feeding behavior of B. tabaci in favor of Q rather than B. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we quantified the salicylic acid (SA) titers and relative gene expression of SA in tomato leaves that were infested with <b>viruliferous</b> or non-viruliferous B and Q. We also measured the impacts of exogenous SA on the performance of B and Q, including the effects on ovary development. SA titer was always higher in leaves that were infested with <b>viruliferous</b> B than with <b>viruliferous</b> Q, whereas the SA titer did not differ between leaves infested with non-viruliferous B and Q. The relative gene expression of SA signaling was increased by feeding of <b>viruliferous</b> B but was not increased by feeding of <b>viruliferous</b> Q. The life history traits of B and Q were adversely affected on SA-treated plants. On SA-treated plants, both B and Q had lower fecundity, shorter longevity, longer developmental time and lower survival rate than on untreated plants. Compared with whiteflies feeding on control plants, those feeding on SA-treated plants had fewer oocytes and slower ovary development. On SA-treated plants, <b>viruliferous</b> B had fewer oocytes than <b>viruliferous</b> Q. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that TYLCV tends to induce SA-regulated plant defense against B but SA-regulated plant defense against Q was reduced. In other words, Q may have a mutualistic relationship with TYLCV that results in the reduction of the plant's defense response...|$|E
40|$|Leprosis is {{a serious}} disease of citrus caused by Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C, genus Cilevirus) whose {{transmission}} is mediated by false-spider mites of the genus Brevipalpus. CiLV-C infection does not systemically spread in any of its known host plants, thus remaining restricted to local lesions around the feeding sites of <b>viruliferous</b> mites. To get insight into this unusual pathosystem, we evaluated the expression profiles of genes involved in defense mechanisms of Arabidopsis thaliana and Citrus sinensis upon infestation with non-viruliferous and <b>viruliferous</b> mites by using reverse transcriptase-qPCR. These results were analyzed together with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{and the appearance of}} dead cells as assessed by histochemical assays. After interaction with non-viruliferous mites, plants locally accumulated ROS and triggered the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonate/ethylene (JA/ET) pathways. ERF branch of the JA/ET pathways was highly activated. In contrast, JA pathway genes were markedly suppressed upon the CiLV-C infection mediated by <b>viruliferous</b> mites. Viral infection also intensified the ROS burst and cell death, and enhanced the expression of genes involved in the RNA silencing mechanism and SA pathway. After 13 days of infestation of two sets of Arabidopsis plants with non-viruliferous and <b>viruliferous</b> mites, the number of mites in the CiLV-C infected Arabidopsis plants was significantly higher than in those infested with the non-viruliferous ones. Oviposition of the <b>viruliferous</b> mites occurred preferentially in the CiLV-C infected leaves. Based on these results, we postulated the first model of plant/Brevipalpus mite/cilevirus interaction in which cells surrounding the feeding sites of <b>viruliferous</b> mites typify the outcome of a hypersensitive-like response, whereas viral infection induces changes in the behavior of its vector...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNilaparvata lugens {{reovirus}} (NLRV) {{was found}} in a colony of the brown planthopper, N. lugens, an important plant virus vector. Unlike with usual phytopathogenic reoviruses, there are no visible symptoms on a rice plant which has been attacked by NLRV-infected planthoppers. Manner of transmission, host range, and multiplication of NLRV in rice plant were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or polymerase chain reaction using reverse transcriptase. NLRV was transovumly transmitted to about 15 % of nymphs. NLRV could further spread to planthoppers via rice plants through sucking by <b>viruliferous</b> insects. This horizontal transmission was apparently of primary importance for continuous NLRV infection to a colony of N. lugens. By corearing with <b>viruliferous</b> N. lugens on rice seedlings, Laodelphax striatellus acquired NLRV but Sogatella furcifera, Nephotettix cincticeps, and N. malayanus did not during the period studied. NLRV inoculated onto rice plant by <b>viruliferous</b> N. lugens failed to multiply, which accounts for the lack of symptoms on the plant even after an attack by <b>viruliferous</b> planthoppers. These biological properties and our previous data, which revealed a molecular similarity between NLRV and fijiviruses, suggest that NLRV is an ancestral virus of fijiviruses...|$|E

40|$|The stubby root nematode, Paratrichodorus allius, is {{important}} to the potato industry in the Pacific Northwest of USA, because it vectors Tobacco rattle virus (TRV), the causal agent of corky ringspot disease.

40|$|Plant viruses {{can produce}} direct and plant-mediated {{indirect}} effects on their insect vectors, modifying their life cycle, fitness and behavior.

In our study, female adults of Bemisia tabaci were subjected to an acquisition access period of 72 h in Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) -infected and non-infected tomato plants to obtain <b>viruliferous</b> and non-viruliferous whiteflies, respectively. Insects that were exposed to virus-infected plants were checked by PCR to verify their <b>viruliferous</b> status. Results of the Ethovision video tracking bioassays indicated that TYLCV induced an arrestant behavior of B. tabaci, as <b>viruliferous</b> whitefly adults remained motionless for more time and moved slower than non-viruliferous whiteflies after their first contact with eggplant leaf discs. In fact, Electrical Penetration Graphs showed that TYLCV-viruliferous B. tabaci fed more often from phloem sieve elements and made {{a larger number of}} phloem contacts (increased number of E 1, E 2 and sustained E 2 per insect, p, 0. 05) in eggplants than non-viruliferous whiteflies. Furthermore, the duration of the salivation phase in phloem sieve elements (E 1) preceding sustained sap ingestion was longer in <b>viruliferous</b> than in non-viruliferous whiteflies (p, 0. 05).

40|$|Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is {{the name}} given to a complex of geminiviruses infecting tomato {{cultures}} worldwide. TYLCV is transmitted by a single insect species, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Herein we show that a TYLCV isolate from Israel (TYLCV-Is) can be transmitted among whiteflies in a sex-dependent manner, {{in the absence of}} any other source of virus. TYLCV was transmitted from <b>viruliferous</b> males to females and from <b>viruliferous</b> females to males but not among insects of the same sex. Transmission took place when insects were caged in groups or in couples, in a feeding chamber or on cotton plants, a TYLCV nonhost.

Insect-to-insect virus transmission was instrumental in increasing the number of whiteflies capable of infecting tomato test plants in a whitefly population.

40|$|Abstract We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} mono-partite Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), a begomovirus (family Geminiviridae, genus Begomovirus) infecting tomato plants can be transmitted in a gender-dependent manner among its insect vector the whitefly Bemisia tabaci type B (Gennaduis) (Aleyrodidae: Hemiptera) during mating. <b>Viruliferous</b> females were able to transmit the virus to non-viruliferous males and vice versa, {{in the absence of}} any other virus source. The recipient insects were able to infect tomato plants. In this communication, we present evidence that two bipartite begomoviruses infecting cucurbits, Squash leaf curl virus (SLCV) and Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus (WmCSV) can be transmitted in a gender-dependent manner among whiteflies. In addition we show that TYLCV can be transmitted during mating among individuals from the same biotype (from B-males to B-females and vice versa; and from Q-males to Q-females and vice versa). How-ever, <b>viruliferous</b> males of the B biotype are unable to transmit the virus to females of the Q biotype (and vice versa); similarly, <b>viruliferous</b> males of the Q biotype are unable to transmit the virus to females of the B biotype (and vice versa). These findings support the hypothesis that a pre-zygotic mating barrier between the Q and B biotypes is the cause for the absence of gene flow between the two biotypes, and that virus transmission can be used as a marker for inter-biotype mating. To be transmitted during mating, the virus needs to be present in the haemolymph of the donor insect. Abutilon mosaic virus (AbMV), a bipartite begomovirus that can be ingested but not transmitted by B. tabaci, is absent in the whitefly haemolymph, and cannot be transmitted during mating.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{small brown}} planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus) is an {{important}} agricultural pest that not only damages rice plants by sap-sucking, but also acts as a vector that transmits rice stripe virus (RSV), which can cause even more serious yield loss. Despite being a model organism for studying entomology, population biology, plant protection, molecular interactions among plants, viruses and insects, only a few genomic sequences are available for this species. To investigate its transcriptome and determine the differences between <b>viruliferous</b> and naïve L. striatellus, we employed 454 -FLX high-throughput pyrosequencing to generate EST databases of this insect. Results We obtained 201, 281 and 218, 681 high-quality reads from <b>viruliferous</b> and naïve L. striatellus, respectively, with an average read length as 230 bp. These reads were assembled into contigs and two EST databases were generated. When all reads were combined, 16, 885 contigs and 24, 607 singletons (a total of 41, 492 unigenes) were obtained, which represents a transcriptome of the insect. BlastX search against the NCBI-NR database revealed that only 6, 873 (16. 6 %) of these unigenes have significant matches. Comparison {{of the distribution of}} GO classification among <b>viruliferous,</b> naïve, and combined EST databases indicated that these libraries are broadly representative of the L. striatellus transcriptomes. Functionally diverse transcripts from RSV, endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia and yeast-like symbiotes were identified, which reflects the possible lifestyles of these microbial symbionts that live in the cells of the host insect. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that L. striatellus encodes similar innate immunity regulatory systems as other insects, such as RNA interference, JAK/STAT and partial Imd cascades, which might be involved in defense against viral infection. In addition, we determined the differences in gene expression between vector and naïve samples, which generated a list of candidate genes that are potentially involved in the symbiosis of L. striatellus and RSV. Conclusions To our knowledge, the present study is the first description of a genomic project for L. striatellus. The identification of transcripts from RSV, Wolbachia, yeast-like symbiotes and genes abundantly expressed in <b>viruliferous</b> insect, provided a starting-point for investigating the molecular basis of symbiosis among these organisms. </p...|$|E

The <b>viruliferous</b> nematodes that were reared on 'Vernema' alfalfa or ' 770 ' scotch spearmint {{for at least}} 3 months did not transmit TRV to 'Samsun NN' tobacco, a suitable indicator plant, and did not cause CRS symptoms on 'Russet Norkotah' tubers. A new isolate of TRV was introduced into a nonviruliferous population of P. allius. First, tobacco plants were inoculated with a field population of P. allius that transmitted an isolate of TRV that caused severe symptoms on potato. The tobacco roots were then washed free from soil and dipped in 0. 525 % sodium hypochlorite to remove the initial nematode inoculum. After the disinfected tobacco plants recovered and began to grow, the virus-free population of P. allius was introduced around the root system to acquire the new virus isolate from tobacco roots. The newly established virus-vector combination caused CRS symptoms on 'Russet Norkotah' that were characteristic of the more virulent virus isolate, indicating that the virus-free P. allius population had reacquired virus...|$|E
40|$|Reverse transcriptase-quantitative {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (RT-qPCR) is a reliable technique for measuring and evaluating gene expression during variable biological processes. To facilitate gene expression studies, normalization of genes of interest relative to stable reference genes is crucial. The western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), the main vector of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), is a destructive invasive species. In this study, the expression profiles of 11 candidate reference genes from nonviruliferous and <b>viruliferous</b> F. occidentalis were investigated. Five distinct algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, the ΔCt method, and RefFinder, {{were used to determine}} the performance of these genes. geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder identified heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70), heat shock protein 60 (HSP 60), elongation factor 1 α, and ribosomal protein l 32 (RPL 32) as the most stable reference genes, and the ΔCt method identified HSP 60, HSP 70, RPL 32, and heat shock protein 90 as the most stable reference genes. Additionally, two reference genes were sufficient for reliable normalization in nonviruliferous and <b>viruliferous</b> F. occidentalis. This work provides a foundation for investigating the molecular mechanisms of TSWV and F. occidentalis interactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{proteins}} encoded by rice black streaked dwarf fijivirus (RBSDV) genomic segments 7 - 10 (S 7 -S 10) were characterized. Open reading frames (ORFs) {{from these}} segments were expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. Antibodies raised against the expressed products {{were used as}} probes {{to determine whether the}} viral ORFs encode structural proteins. In Western blots, antibodies to the expressed S 8 and S 10 products reacted with a core capsid (65 kDa) and a major outer capsid (56 kDa) protein, respectively, while none of the antibodies to S 7 and S 9 products reacted with structural proteins. Antisera to RBSDV S 7 ORF 1 and S 9 ORF 1 each detected a single protein of the predicted size in total protein extracts from infected rice plants and <b>viruliferous</b> Laodelphax striatellus. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that antibodies to RBSDV S 7 ORF 1 and RBSDV S 9 ORF 1 reacted with tubular structures and viroplasm, respectively, in sections of both infected maize plants and <b>viruliferous</b> L. striatellus. Antisera to ORF 2 of S 7 and S 9 failed to detect any proteins in the infected tissue using either Western blotting or immuno-electron microscopic techniques...|$|E
40|$|Rice stripe virus (RSV), a tenuivirus, is {{transmitted}} by small brown planthopper (SBPH) in a persistent-propagative manner. In this study, sequential infection of RSV {{in the internal}} organs of SBPH after ingestion of virus indicated that RSV initially infected the midgut epithelium, and then progressed to the visceral muscle tissues, through which RSV spread to the entire alimentary canal. Finally, RSV spread into the salivary glands and reproductive system. During viral infection, the nonstructural protein NS 4 of RSV formed cytoplasmic inclusions in various tissues of <b>viruliferous</b> SBPH. We demonstrated that the ribonucleoprotein particles of RSV were closely associated with NS 4 -specific inclusions {{in the body of}} <b>viruliferous</b> SBPH through a direct interaction between NS 4 and nucleoprotein of RSV. Moreover, the knockdown of NS 4 expression due to RNA interference induced by dsRNA from NS 4 gene significantly prevented the spread of RSV in the bodies of SBPHs without a significant effect on viral replication in continuous cell culture derived from SBPH. All these results suggest that the nonstructural protein NS 4 of RSV plays a critical role in viral spread by the vector insects...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceEntomologyC. Michael SmithThe {{bird cherry}} oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, {{and one of}} the viruses it vectors, barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), form a very {{damaging}} pest unit on cereals. Understanding how people can better manage crops to prevent damage or recognize environmental or geographic factors that put their crops at risk for BYDV could lead to improved virus aphid management strategies. One of the most successful methods for mitigating pest damage is using pest-resistant varieties of crops. Seven candidate wheat varieties were screened for resistance to R. padi, by testing aphid population densities and aphid host choice. Results of this research identified six varieties of wheat that show resistance to R. padi. One of the major knowledge gaps in BYDV management is forecasting potential damage. Our objective was to create viral presence maps, to start building the foundation of correlations between persistent and changing frequency of <b>viruliferous</b> R. padi. The results of BYDV assays in R. padi in wheat fields across Kansas indicated that the amount of BYDV infection in <b>viruliferous</b> aphids changes rapidly from year to year, and differs considerably between geographic regions and field landscape characteristics in Kansas. Neonicotinoid wheat seed treatment is a management technique that reduces R. padi populations. However, a common question among producers is whether or not seed treatments stop viral transmission. Results of greenhouse seed treatment experiments with plants from neonicotinoid treated and untreated seed infested with <b>viruliferous</b> R. padi indicated no significant difference in viral transmission due to seed treatment. This new information about R. padi wheat varietal resistance, geographic distribution of BYDV in Kansas, and neonicotinoid seed treatment creates a better understanding of aphid-virus-wheat interactions. Results from this thesis directly enhance producer ability to forecast risk from BYDV, select wheat varieties that effectively reduce R. padi as a BYDV vector, and to make better decisions about the use of insecticide to reduce BYDV infection...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{complete}} molecular {{characterization of the}} DNA-A and DNA-B of a Brazilian tomato isolate of Tomato severe rugose virus (ToSRV) and the experimental host range of the virus determined using white-fly transmission tests. Genome analysis showed that ToSRV has a close evolutionary relationship with Tomato rugose mosaic virus. Of 33 plants species inoculated with <b>viruliferous</b> Bemisia tabaci biotype B, 13 species were susceptible to ToSRV, nine asymptomatically. Therefore, ToSRV disease management strategy should include the control of infected weeds close to tomato fields...|$|E
