HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in die casting, they form a thin film. Other substances are added to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. Emulsifiers are added to water-based lubricants, so that oil based additives can be mixed into the water; these include soap, alcohol esters, and ethylene oxides.|$|E
25|$|The food {{industry}} uses hydrogenation to completely or partially saturate the unsaturated fatty acids in liquid <b>vegetable</b> <b>fats</b> and oils to convert them into solid or semi-solid fats, {{such as those}} in margarine and shortening.|$|E
25|$|Production of {{hydrogenated}} fats increased steadily until the 1960s, as processed <b>vegetable</b> <b>fats</b> replaced animal fats in the United States and other Western countries.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to survey the fatty acid profiles of fat spreads, margarines, shortenings, <b>vegetable</b> <b>fat</b> ice creams, <b>vegetable</b> <b>fat</b> milk-based cream substitutes, <b>vegetable</b> <b>fat</b> cheese substitutes, and reduced-fat cheeses on the Finnish market. The evaluation of the nutritional quality of fat in these products is of significance to dieticians and to the development of fat products with enhanced nutritional value. Remarkable differences between fatty acid profiles of <b>vegetable</b> <b>fat</b> products were found. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>fat</b> ice creams may have a lot of saturated fat and, in addition, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids may be very low. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>fat</b> half creams had, in general, less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fatty acids than cream. The spreads and shortenings studied contained less than 2 % trans fatty acids of total fatty acids. Consumption of reduced-fat cheese in place of full-fat cheese does not negatively affect the nutritional quality of the consumed fat...|$|R

2500|$|A {{vegetable}} oil is a triglyceride extracted from a plant. The term [...] "{{vegetable oil}}" [...] can be narrowly defined as referring only to plant oils that are liquid at room temperature, or broadly defined {{without regard to}} a substance's state of matter at a given temperature.

Although many plant parts may yield oil, in commercial practice, oil is extracted primarily from seeds.|$|E

2500|$|Often rules {{apply to}} all goods neutrally, but may have a greater {{practical}} effect on imports than domestic products. For such [...] "indirect" [...] discriminatory (or [...] "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional [...] "mandatory" [...] or [...] "overriding" [...] requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter {{if it was not}} cube shaped was disproportionate: it would [...] "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" [...] and labelling would protect consumers [...] "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other <b>vegetable</b> <b>fats</b> could not be labelled as [...] "chocolate". It had to be [...] "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other <b>vegetable</b> <b>fats.</b> They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a [...] "chocolate substitute" [...] label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A 'neutral and objective statement' was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have [...] "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" [...] that [...] "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.|$|E
