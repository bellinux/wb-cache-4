40|$|Background: The {{invasiveness}} {{and exposure}} to radiation in <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography led {{to the introduction of}} alternative methods of diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux, including contrast enhanced <b>voiding</b> urosonography. While there is a limited number of studies comparing these methods using new generation ultrasound contrast agents, none of them compared both methods simultaneously. This study is aimed at assessing agreement between contrast enhanced <b>voiding</b> urosonography with second-generation ultrasound contrast agents and <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography. Methods: From April 2013 to May 2014, 83 children (37 female and 46 male), mean age 3. 5 years, age range from 1 month to 17. 5 years, underwent prospective simultaneous assessment by contrast enhanced <b>voiding</b> urosonography and <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography, with a total of 166 uretero-renal units evaluated. Results: The sensitivity of <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography and contrast enhanced <b>voiding</b> urosonography were comparable, amounting to 88 %, however, neither reached 100 % for the entire studied population. The negative predictive value of <b>voiding</b> urosonography and <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography was 97 %, and {{there was no difference between}} both methods. Conclusion: <b>Voiding</b> cystourethrography and contrast enhanced <b>voiding</b> urosonography are comparable methods in diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux, and can be performed alternatively. However, some limitations of contrast enhanced <b>voiding</b> urosonography must be remembered...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Although {{functional}} bladder capacity, {{as expressed}} by maximum <b>voided</b> volume and other frequency-volume chart parameters, are important determinants of lower urinary tract symptoms, {{to our knowledge}} no population based data are available on changes in <b>voided</b> volume. We determined changes in and determinants of <b>voided</b> volume and <b>voiding</b> frequency with advancing age and with time, as measured by frequency-volume charts. Materials and Methods: We performed a longitudinal, population based study in 1, 688 men 50 to 78 years old with followup at 2. 1, 4. 2 and 6. 5 years. Data were obtained using frequency-volume charts for maximum, 24 -hour and average <b>voided</b> volume, and 24 -hour <b>voiding</b> frequency {{as well as physical}} and urological measurements, and self-administered questionnaires. We used a linear mixed effect model to determine factors predicting volume changes. Results: Median maximum and average <b>voided</b> volume decreased with time from 400 to 380 and 245 to 240 ml, respectively, and were smaller in older age groups while 24 -hour <b>voided</b> volume showed no change. The 24 -hour <b>voiding</b> frequency increased with time and with advancing age. Maximum, 24 -hour and average <b>voided</b> volumes were positively related to alcohol intake. Maximum and average <b>voided</b> volumes were negatively related to higher age at baseline and the passage of time. Hypertension, diuretics and post-void residual volume were related to higher 24 -hour <b>voided</b> volume. Conclusions: In older men maximum and average <b>voided</b> volume show a small but statistically significant decrease with time and with advancing age while 24 -hour <b>voided</b> volume does not.

Methods: A total of 180 patients were enrolled from August 2008 to August 2011. Patients received mid-urethral sling surgery with a transobturator tape, with or without concomitant cystocele repair. Patients reported relevant medical histories and a 3 -day frequency volume chart and underwent urodynamic studies. After surgery, patients were filled to their maximum bladder capacity as dictated by their frequency volume chart and performed the first <b>voiding</b> trial. Two subsequent <b>voiding</b> trials were performed after natural filling. Failure of any single <b>voiding</b> trial was considered failure.

ObjectiveTo determine whether sevoflurane is a satisfactory anesthetic agent for <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography in children. MethodsRecords of children undergoing <b>voiding</b> cystourethrogram while they were under sevoflurane were reviewed for anesthetic adverse effects and diagnostic quality of the cystourethrogram. The occurrence of on-table <b>voiding</b> and post-void residual bladder volume were documented and compared with an age- and sex-matched control group of children undergoing unsedated <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography. The caregivers were surveyed regarding the anesthetic experience. ResultsA total of 91 children underwent sevoflurane <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography; there were no adverse cardiorespiratory events. <b>Voiding</b> was observed in 96 %, with residual bladder volumes minimal in 38 %, moderate in 32 %, and large in 28 % of anesthetized children, not significantly different from the control group. Vesicoureteral reflux was observed in 53 % of examinations under sevoflurane. When children with a previous history of reflux or <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography were excluded in a comparison with age- and sex-matched controls, vesicoureteral reflux was observed in 38 % of studies under sevoflurane and in 44 % of studies in the control group, P =. 69; 85 % of caregivers of children with prior unsedated <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography found <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography with sevoflurane easier than without sevoflurane; 89 % thought the anesthetic experience reduced their child's anxiety towards medical procedures.

40|$|Summary: The {{goals of}} this study were to {{describe}} the pattern of <b>voiding</b> disorders in children in our community, to describe clinical criteria for making the specific diagnoses, and to comment on management. The medical records of 226 children referred because of <b>voiding</b> dysfunction or urinary tract infections (UTI) were evaluated. Children with normal <b>voiding</b> patterns when uninfected, with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, and with known neurologic or anatomic abnormalities were excluded. Detrusor instability, an abnormal <b>voiding</b> pattern characterized by urgency with or without frequency, was the diagnosis in 175 of the 226 children. Children with detrusor instability who used various posturing maneuvers to avoid urinary incontinence had a signif-icantly higher incidence of UTIs {{than those who did not}} attempt to obstruct urine oufflow. Detrusor instability appeared to be secondary to constipation in 19 of the children. The other diagnoses were extraordinary daytime urinary frequency, infrequent <b>voiding,</b> monosymptomatic daytime wetting, transient <b>voiding</b> dysfunction, giggle incontinence, dysfunctional <b>voiding,</b> and unexplained dysuria. It is concluded that children with detrusor instability who use posturing maneuvers to avoid incontinence are at high risk for recurrent UTIs. Constipation is 1 cause of detrusor instability. Dysfunctional <b>voiding,</b> the form of <b>voiding</b> dysfunction most likely to result in renal damage, was present in only 2 of 226 children seen for <b>voiding</b> disorders.
