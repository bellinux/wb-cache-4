2500|$|Smith {{was born}} in the village of Churchill, Oxfordshire, the son of {{blacksmith}} John Smith, himself scion of a respectable farming family. His father died when Smith was just eight years old, and he was then raised by his uncle, also called William Smith. Although largely self-educated, Smith was highly intelligent and observant, read widely from an early age, and showed an aptitude for mathematics and drawing. In 1787, he met and found work as an assistant for Edward Webb of Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, a surveyor. He was quick to learn, and soon became proficient at the trade. In 1791, he travelled to Somerset to make a <b>valuation</b> <b>survey</b> of the Sutton Court estate, and building on earlier work in the same area by John Strachey.

By 1810, one inch to the mile maps of most of the south of England were completed, but they were withdrawn from sale between 1811 and 1816 because of security fears.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} a {{generalized}} self-consistent algorithm that estimates a survivor function with across-interval- censored data. This algorithm is an iterative procedure based on Turnbull's (1974) reallocation idea. At {{each step of the}} iteration, the procedure first reduces the across-interval-censored problem to a singly-censored one, and then it applies the Kaplan-Meier estimation method. The main result of this paper is that our algorithm produces the maximum likelihood estimate. Unlike Turnbull (1974, 1976), we explicitly discuss situations in which corner solutions are encountered. The investigation is motivated from environmental economics where data from contingent <b>valuation</b> <b>surveys</b> are often used to nonparametrically estimate the willingness to pay distribution. In this estimation, the algorithm of Turnbull (1974, 1976) plays an instrumental role. However, there is a data grouping mechanism found in some contingent <b>valuation</b> <b>surveys</b> to which Turnbull's method does not apply. We refer to these cases as distinct bids and mixed bids, where across-interval-censored observations are common. ...|$|R
