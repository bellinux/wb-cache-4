This scenario is tested using the results from a mesoscale microphysical model at horizontal resolution of 1. 33 &#x 2009;km for the simulation of hurricane Katrina.

The departure from balance laws includes terms such as the local, horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>advections</b> of divergence, divergence square and a term invoking the gradient of vertical velocity.

Departures from balance laws are related to the radial gradient wind imbalances in a storm-centred coordinate. In this study, several examples, from the hurricane Katrina simulations, that display this scenario of rapid intensification are illustrated.

As a consequence, the radiative luminosity from the accretion disk can be far beyond the Eddington value. Following this spirit, we revisit the structure and radiation of hyper-accretion disks with mass accretion rates in the range 10 ^- 3 ∼ 10 M_ s^- 1. Our results show that, due to the strong cooling through the <b>vertical</b> <b>advection,</b> the disk temperature becomes lower than that in the classic model without the <b>vertical</b> <b>advection</b> process, and therefore the neutrino luminosity from the disk is lower. On the other hand, the gamma-ray photons released through the <b>vertical</b> <b>advection</b> can be extremely super-Eddington.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} coupled physical–biogeochemical {{model has}} been built to study the pelagic food web of the Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean Sea). The physical model is the turbulent closure model (version 1 D) developed at the GeoHydrodynamics and Environmental Laboratory (GHER) of the University of Liège. The ecosystem model contains 19 state variables describing the carbon and nitrogen cycles of the pelagic food web. Phytoplankton and zooplankton are both divided in three size-based compartments and the model includes an explicit representation of the microbial loop including bacteria, dissolved organic matter, nano-, and microzooplankton. The internal carbon/nitrogen ratio is assumed variable for phytoplankton and detritus, and constant for zooplankton and bacteria. Silicate is considered as a potential limiting nutrient of phytoplankton's growth. The aggregation model described by Kriest and Evans in (Proc. Ind. Acad. Sci., Earth Planet.

The dynamics of atmospheric fluxes in the Mediterranean Sea (DYFAMED) time-series data obtained during the year 2000 are used to calibrate and validate the biological model. The comparison of model results within in situ DYFAMED data shows that although some processes are not represented by the model, such as horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>advections,</b> model results are overall in agreement with observations and differences observed can be explained with environmental conditions.

40|$|Cloud microphysics budgets in the {{tropical}} deep convective regime are analyzed based on a 2 -D cloud resolving simulation. The model is forced by the large-scale vertical velocity and zonal wind and large-scale horizontal advections derived from TOGA COARE for a 20 -day period. The role of cloud microphysics is first examined by analyzing mass-weighted mean heat budget and column-integrated moisture budget. Hourly budgets show that local changes of mass-weighted mean temperature and column-integrated moisture are mainly determined by the residuals between <b>vertical</b> thermal <b>advection</b> and latent heat of condensation and between <b>vertical</b> moisture <b>advection</b> and condensation respectively. Thus, atmospheric thermodynamics depends on how cloud microphysical processes are parameterized. Cloud microphysics budgets are then analyzed for raining conditions. For cloud-vapor exchange between cloud system and its embedded environment, rainfall and evaporation of raindrop are compensated by the condensation and deposition of supersaturated vapor. Inside the cloud system, the condensation of supersaturated vapor balances conversion from cloud water to raindrop, snow, and graupel through collection and accretion processes. The deposition of supersaturated vapor balances conversion from cloud ice to snow through conversion and riming processes. The conversion and riming of cloud ice and the accretion of cloud water balance conversion from snow to graupel through accretion process. Finally, the collection of cloud water and the melting of graupel increase raindrop to compensate the loss of raindrop due to rainfall and the evaporation of raindrop...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric flow {{patterns}} are examined over the South Atlantic Ocean where {{a maximum of}} tropospheric ozone has been observed just west of southern Africa. We investigate the flow climatology during October and perform a case study for 6 days during October 1989. Analyses from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting are employed, and a high-resolution global spectral model is used to prepare forecasts during the period. Horizontal and vertical motions are examined and used to prepare three-dimensional backward trajectories from the region of greatest ozone. An initially zonally symmetric distribution of ozone is treated as a passive tracer and advected by three-dimensional flows forecast by the global model. Results from the passive tracer simulation indicate that three-dimensional advection alone can produce a maximum of tropospheric ozone in the observed location. In addition, the trajectories suggest that by-products of biomass burning could be transported {{to the area of}} maximum ozone. Low-level flow from commonly observed regions of burning in Africa streams westward to the area of interest. Over Brazil, if the burning by-products are carried into the upper troposphere by convective process, they then could be transported eastward to the ozone feature in approximately 5 days. There is considerable subsidence over the tropical southern Atlantic, such that stratospheric influences also are a factor in producing the ozone maximum. Both planetary-scale and transient synoptic-scale circulation features play major roles in the various transport processes that influence the region. In summary, the observed tropospheric ozone maximum appears to be caused by a complex set of horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>advections,</b> transport from regions of biomass burning, and stratospheric influences. 1...|$|R
30|$|In {{the layer}} between 850 and 700 hPa, the cold {{horizontal}} advection {{had a similar}} magnitude to the layer below 850 hPa, {{and it seemed to}} balance the warm <b>vertical</b> <b>advection.</b> For the moisture budget in the same layer between 850 and 700 hPa, both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>advection</b> of dry air were observed.

Although it is possible that this large individual change of moisture was not only due to eddy moisture transport but also due to evaporation, this possibility will not be discussed further in this study, because the effects of evaporation (and condensation) canceled out in the evaluation of the equivalent temperature, which we will show later.|$|E
40|$|In {{the classic}} picture of {{standard}} thin accretion disks, the viscous heating is {{balanced by the}} radiative cooling through the diffusion process, and the radiation-pressure-dominated inner disk suffers convective instability. However, recent simulations {{have shown that the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>advection</b> process owing to the magnetic buoyancy can make significant contribution to the energy transport. In addition, no convective instability has been found by comparing the simulation results with the local convective stability criterion.

40|$|International audienceOutput {{from the}} {{regional}} climate model RACMO 2 /ANT {{is used to}} calculate the heat budget of the Antarctic atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The main feature of the wintertime Antarctic ABL is a persistent temperature deficit compared to the free atmosphere. The magnitude of this deficit is controlled by the heat budget. During winter, transport of heat towards the surface by turbulence and net longwave emission are the primary ABL cooling terms. These processes show horizontal spatial variability only on continental scales. Vertical and horizontal advection of heat are the main warming terms. Over regions with convex ice sheet topography, i. e. domes and ridges, warming by downward <b>vertical</b> <b>advection</b> is enhanced due to divergence of the ABL wind field. Horizontal advection balances any excess warming caused by <b>vertical</b> <b>advection,</b> hence the ABL over domes and ridges tends to have a relatively weak temperature deficit. Conversely, <b>vertical</b> <b>advection</b> is reduced in regions with concave topography, i. e. valleys, where the ABL temperature deficit is enlarged. Along the coast, horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>advection</b> is governed by the inability of the large-scale circulation to adapt to small scale topographic features. Meso-scale (~ 10 km) topographic structures have thus a strong impact on the ABL winter temperature, besides latitude and surface elevation. During summer, this mechanism is much weaker; and the horizontal variability of ABL temperatures is smaller...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} daily satellite cloud {{observations and}} reanalysis dynamical parameters {{to determine how}} mid-tropospheric <b>vertical</b> velocity and <b>advection</b> over the sea surface temperature gradient control midlatitude North Pacific cloud properties. Optically thick clouds with high tops are generated by synoptic ascent, but two different cloud regimes occur under synoptic descent. When vertical motion is downward during summer, extensive stratocumulus cloudiness is associated with near surface northerly wind, while frequent cloudless pixels occur with southerly wind. Examinations of ship-reported cloud types indicates that midlatitude stratocumulus breaks up as the the boundary level decouples when it is advected equatorward over warmer water. Cumulus is prevalent under conditions of synoptic descent and cold advection during winter. Poleward advection of subtropical air over colder water causes stratification of the near-surface layer that inhibits upward mixing of moisture and suppresses cloudiness until a fog eventually forms.

A broad range of MSAO measurements is summarised with emphasis on the 80 – 100 km region. The objective {{here is not to}} address directly the complicated driving forces of the MSAO, but rather to employ a combination of observations and model simulations to estimate the limits of some of the underlying dynamical processes.

Diurnal tides are incorporated in the model to facilitate comparisons of observations made at different local times. The roles of water vapour as the "driver" species and ozone as the "response" species are examined to test for consistency between the model results and observations.

However, the recent spate of observations from the GPS dropsonde have confirmed that a low-level wind speed maximum is a common feature of the tropical cyclone boundary layer.
