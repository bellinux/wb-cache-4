The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included <b>varnished</b> mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability of calcium phosphate and fluoride containing <b>varnishes</b> to inhibit enamel demineralization. METHODS: Six <b>varnishes</b> were selected for analysis: (1) Enamel Pro containing amorphous calcium phosphate; (2) Clinpro White containing functionalized tricalcium phosphate (fTCP); (3) MI <b>Varnish</b> containing casein phosphopeptide-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP); (4) Duraphat (first no added calcium control); (5) Profluorid (second no added calcium control); and (6) placebo (no added calcium or fluoride control). Human enamel slabs (36) were each cut into half-slabs and covered with one of the six dental <b>varnishes</b> to create a window. The half-slabs were then individually immersed in a polyacrylate demineralization buffer pH 4. 8 for four days at 37  °C with a change of solution each day. Mineral content was determined using transverse microradiography. RESULTS: All fluoride-containing <b>varnishes</b> significantly inhibited enamel demineralization when compared with the placebo <b>varnish.</b> However, out of the calcium phosphate and fluoride containing <b>varnishes</b> only MI <b>Varnish,</b> containing fluoride and CPP-ACP was superior to the fluoride-alone <b>varnishes.</b> MI <b>Varnish</b> also released the highest levels of calcium, phosphate and fluoride ions. CONCLUSIONS: MI <b>Varnish</b> containing fluoride and CPP-ACP was superior to the other <b>varnishes</b> in protecting against enamel demineralization...|$|R

40|$|Using natural {{products}} {{can be a}} cost-effective approach for caries prevention especially in low income countries where dental caries is highly prevalent and the resources are limited. Specially prepared dental <b>varnishes</b> containing propolis, miswak, and chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs) with or without sodium fluoride (NaF) were assessed for antibacterial effect against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) using disk diffusion test. In addition, the protective effect of a single pretreatment of primary teeth enamel specimens against in vitro bacterial induced enamel demineralization was assessed for 3  days. All {{natural products}} containing <b>varnishes</b> inhibited bacterial growth significantly better than 5 % NaF <b>varnish,</b> with NaF loaded CS-NPs (CSF-NPs) showing the highest antibacterial effect, though it didn’t significantly differ than those of other <b>varnishes</b> except miswak ethanolic extract (M) <b>varnish.</b> Greater inhibitory effect was noted with <b>varnish</b> containing freeze dried aqueous miswak extract compared to that containing ethanolic miswak extract, possibly due to concentration of antimicrobial substances by freeze drying. Adding natural products to NaF in a dental <b>varnish</b> showed an additive effect especially compared to fluoride containing <b>varnish.</b> 5 % NaF <b>varnish</b> showed the best inhibition of demineralization effect. Fluoride containing miswak <b>varnish</b> (MF) and CSF-NPs <b>varnish</b> inhibited demineralization significantly better than all experimental <b>varnishes,</b> especially during the first 2  days, though CSF-NPs <b>varnish</b> had a low fluoride concentration, probably due to better availability of fluoride ions and the smaller size of nanoparticles.

50|$|The most {{important}} condition for such <b>varnishes</b> to resist was the mechanical flexing. This required a <b>varnish</b> that was flexible and elastic.

25|$|Between 1846 and 1870 {{passenger}} locomotives {{were painted}} hunter green with some having black lining. Frames were red, and wheels were black; buffer beams were the regulation 'signal red'. Goods locomotives were black {{with red and}} white lining, except those operating into Brighton or London Bridge, in passenger livery. Some engines had boilers lagged with wooden strips. These were either highly polished mahogany with brass fixings or were painted in alternating stripes of dark green and vermillion. The main shade of green used gradually became darker. By the time Stroudley became Locomotive Superintendent the colour had become a variant of Brunswick Green used by many other companies.

25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{construction was}} quite novel. Barnwell borrowed from marine experience by using duralumin sheet, <b>varnished</b> to prevent corrosion and used these {{to make the}} fuselage in four sections. The two forward sections were semi-monocoque (i.e. open channels) with braced longitudinal upper members which, bolted together, held the engine, a water-cooled inline upright 140hp (100kW) Hispano-Suiza) and the pilot's cockpit. Aft, two more sections, both true monocoques, held the observer and carried the tail unit. The two cockpits were close together, with the pilot under the wing at mid-chord and the observer under a trailing edge cutout; Barnwell proposed that the short observer's fuselage section should be removable to turn the M.R.1 into a single-seater, though this configuration was not realised. The monocoque sections were very early examples of double-skinned construction, with a smooth outer skin riveted to a longitudinally-corrugated inner skin. The detailed design was by W.T.Read. The complete fuselage was of round-cornered rectangular cross-section and quite slender, mounted between the wings. The M.R.1 was a two-bay biplane without stagger or sweep, with ailerons on both planes. Aluminium wing spars proved difficult to make sufficiently rigid and Bristol outsourced their manufacture to The Steel Wing Company at Gloucester, who had built experimental steel wings for other aircraft.|$|E

40|$|<b>Varnish</b> {{and its use}} {{has been}} known since ancient times. Altho the {{knowledge}} of <b>varnish</b> {{has been attributed to}} the Japanese as early as 500 - 600 B. C., Tschirsch and A. D. Stevens say that the Japs did not possess this art originally, but that they probably acquired it from the continent during the third century. Nevertheless, <b>varnish</b> did not come into general use until the middle ages. In the 12 th century, a monk by the name of Theophilus published the first directions for making an oil <b>varnish,</b> {{but it was not until}} 1790 in England, and between 1820 and 1830 in France and Germany, that a factory was established for the commercial production of <b>varnish.</b> In general, a <b>varnish</b> may be defied as a homogeneous, sticky, viscous solution of resins, of a colloidal nature, which when applied to a surface in a thin coat, dries to a hard, smooth, glossy surface. The color of <b>varnish</b> varies considerably, depending on the grade and on its use. Pale <b>varnishes</b> are generally sought, yet there are many dark <b>varnishes</b> of excellent quality. The following scale gives an idea of the degree of color of <b>varnish.</b> A solution of 0. 25 g K 2 Cr 2 O 7 in 100 g pure concentrated H 2 SO 4 is equivalent to a very light <b>varnish.</b> A solution of 2. 00 g K 2 Cr 2 O 7 in 100 g pure concentrated H 2 SO 4 is equivalent to a medium <b>varnish.</b> A solution of 4. 00 g K 2 Cr 2 O 7 in 100 g pure concentrated H 2 SO 4 is equivalent to a dark <b>varnish.</b> <b>Varnishes</b> may be divided into two main classes, according to the manner in which the film dries. The <b>varnishes</b> of the first class, which is the largest and most important, are known as oil <b>varnishes.</b> These <b>varnishes</b> dry mainly by the oxidation of the oil, which forms a tough, elastic film. The secondary drying in these oil <b>varnishes</b> is caused by the evaporation of the volatile vehicle, and by the polymerization of the constituents. On the whole, the drying of an oil <b>varnish</b> is of a chemical nature. The <b>varnishes</b> of the second class are called spirit <b>varnishes.</b> These dry merely by the evaporation of the solvent, and there is practically no chemical action. The gum is transferred from a lump form into a thin sheet by means of the solvent. The most important example of this class is shellac, which is the hardened secretion of the lac insect, dissolved in alcohol...|$|R
50|$|<b>Varnishes</b> {{are applied}} to {{paintings}} to enhance {{the appearance of the}} image, as well as to protect it over time. When dry, <b>varnishes</b> are typically transparent and can vary in gloss and durability as its composition changes. <b>Varnishes</b> may be organic or synthetic. Since natural <b>varnishes</b> tend to darken or discolor over time, attention from a paintings conservator is often necessary to remove, replace, or restore it. It is again important to remember the artist's original intent when choosing a new <b>varnish.</b> <b>Varnishes</b> often offer a desired effect, and a synthetic variety may not offer what an originally natural resin provided.|$|R
25|$|The Melbourne-based Epoch re-ignited {{fears of}} a Russia {{invasion}} when three Russian ships—the Afrika, Vestnik, and Platon—were sighted near Port Phillip in January 1882. Despite the hysteria generated by the media in Melbourne, no invasion ensued. David Syme, the proprietor of The Age, wrote {{in a series of}} editorials that the visit of the three ships was associated with a war that was threatening to engulf Britain and Russia, and that the squadron under the command of Avraamy Aslanbegov was in the Pacific in order to raid British commerce. Newspapers wrote that Admiral Aslanbegov behaved like a <b>varnished</b> barbarian due to his non-acceptance of invitations, and because he preferred to stay at the Menzies Hotel, rather than the Melbourne Club or the Australian Club. Aslanbegov was accused of spying and fraud, leading to the Admiral complaining to the Premier of Victoria Bryan O'Loghlen and threatening legal action against the newspaper. John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, defused the situation when he sent a telegraph to the government stating that relations with Russia are of a friendly character, and such newspaper reports are rendered incredible. Due to the {{fears of a}}n invasion, Fort Scratchley in Newcastle was completed by 1885.|$|E
25|$|From 1870 to 1905 the livery was Stroudley's 'Improved Engine Green', {{a golden}} ochre {{very similar to}} that used by his former employer, the Highland Railway. On {{passenger}} locomotives Improved Engine Green was finished with olive green borders lined with black, red and white. Frames and buffer beams were carmine red, lined with yellow and black. The wheels were Improved Engine Green with red lining. Cab roofs were white. Goods engines were all-over olive green with black borders, similar to the pre-1870 colours. If fitted with Westinghouse brakes the black borders were edged with red lines. Locomotives with names had the name applied in gold leaf to the tank side on tank locomotives, to a wheel splasher on tender locomotives. The letters were edged with a thin red line and given depth with black shading. This livery {{was one of the most}} ornate and distinctive used on British locomotives, and is remembered with nostalgia. Carriages were all mahogany in colour, with white roofs and black chassis gear. Initially the wood of the body was <b>varnished,</b> but as it became harder to maintain a high-quality varnish finish and it was painted in a similar-coloured paint. Panel lining and other details were picked out with gold leaf.|$|E
25|$|Previously to this, in 1859, a {{committee}} {{had been appointed}} {{to report on the}} internal condition and fittings of the Chapel. Whether disrepair or the aversion of the Gothic Revivalists to the old Georgian fittings prompted this movement is not apparent, but Buckler's report would suggest that his leanings are certainly in the direction of reform, though he does not advise any very drastic change. The walls and roof were to be painted the same colour, the panels of the roof painted brilliant blue, the edges of the ribs to be gilded, and the sides coloured vermilion. One bay, over the altar, was to be coloured in this manner, as a trial. The marble screen at the east end was to be re-polished and re-gilded. The altar dais and steps and also the rest of the Chapel floor was to be paved with Minton's tiles, using for the latter as much of the black and white marble as remained, and the panelling to be darkened and <b>varnished.</b> The Portland stone paving of the ante-chapel was to be renewed, leaving the gravestones, and the platform on which the eagle stood altered. The ante-Chapel must have been then seated throughout, as it was proposed to remove the seats, leaving only the seat along the wall at the south end. A new altar was also suggested, and new furniture and gas standards. How much of this proposed work was actually carried out is unclear.|$|E
40|$|Fluoride <b>varnishes</b> play an {{important}} role in the prevention of dental caries, promoting the inhibition of demineralization and the increase of remineralization. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the amount of fluoride released into water and artificial saliva from experimental TiF 4 and NaF <b>varnishes,</b> with different concentrations, for 12 h. Material and Methods: Fluoride <b>varnishes</b> were applied on acrylic blocks and then immersed in 10 ml of deionized water and artificial saliva in polystyrene bottles. The acrylic blocks were divided in seven groups (n= 10) : 1. 55 % TiF 4 <b>varnish</b> (0. 95 % F, pH 1. 0); 3. 10 % TiF 4 <b>varnish</b> (1. 90 % F, pH 1. 0); 3. 10 % and 4 % TiF 4 <b>varnish</b> (2. 45 % F, pH 1. 0); 2. 10 % NaF <b>varnish</b> (0. 95 % F, pH 5. 0); 4. 20 % NaF <b>varnish</b> (1. 90 % F, pH 5. 0); 5. 42 % NaF <b>varnish</b> (2. 45 % F, pH 5. 0) and control (no treatment, n= 5). The fluoride release was analyzed after 1 / 2, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h of exposure. The analysis was performed using an ion-specific electrode coupled to a potentiometer. Two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's test were applied for the statistical analysis (p< 0. 05). Results: TiF 4 <b>varnishes</b> released larger amounts of fluoride than NaF <b>varnishes</b> during the first 1 / 2 h, regardless of their concentration; 4 % TiF 4 <b>varnish</b> released more fluoride than NaF <b>varnishes</b> for the first 6 h. The peak of fluoride release occurred at 3 h. There was a better dose-response relationship among the <b>varnishes</b> exposed to water than to artificial saliva. Conclusions: The 3. 10 % and 4 % TiF 4 -based <b>varnishes</b> have greater ability to release fluoride into water and artificial saliva compared to NaF varnish; however, more studies must be conducted to elucidate the mechanism of action of TiF 4 <b>varnish</b> on tooth surface...|$|R
