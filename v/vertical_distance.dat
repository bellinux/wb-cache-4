5|$|At Utica Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line, a four-track station above {{can be seen}} in {{the ceiling}} of the {{existing}} station. This portion of the Utica Avenue Line was built with the construction of the Fulton Street Line. Ramps were built from the mezzanine to the platforms because the normal <b>vertical</b> <b>distance</b> of ten feet from the mezzanine floor to the platforms was increased to 25 feet in anticipation of the Utica Avenue Line. The existing mezzanine passes over the unused space.|$|E
5|$|If {{a spider}} walks under a P. schultzi female's capture web and the <b>vertical</b> <b>distance</b> {{is less than}} 8centimetres, the P. schultzi often drops onto the prey too fast for a human eye to follow. If the P. schultzi misses, it quickly returns up its safety line to its vantage point and looks for another chance - and seldom misses the second time. Most drops cover two to four centimetres, as longer drops are often {{obstructed}} by the web.|$|E

5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the <b>vertical</b> <b>distance</b> between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
25|$|The {{distances}} {{mentioned above}} are horizontal distance. There is also <b>vertical</b> <b>distance</b> that communicates something between people. In this case, however, <b>vertical</b> <b>distance</b> is often understood {{to convey the}} degree of dominance or sub-ordinance in a relationship. Looking up at or down on another person can be taken literally in many cases, with the higher person asserting greater status.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article first {{introduces}} oblique aerial imagery, then {{describes how}} <b>vertical</b> <b>distances</b> {{can be measured}} once the pixel distances of the original pictures are known. The calculations require that, not only all camera settings be known, but also that one relies {{on the availability of}} detailed digital terrain and digital surface models (DSM and DTM), in order to provide the necessary ground level for calculating <b>vertical</b> <b>distances.</b> The algorithm is finally implemented in an online viewer...|$|R

25|$|Teachers, and {{especially}} {{those who work with}} small children, should realize that students will interact more comfortably with a teacher when they are in same vertical plane.

On the other hand, a disciplinarian might put this information to use in order to gain psychological advantage over an unruly student.|$|E

25|$|During a {{free-fall}} with no aerodynamic forces, {{the object}} accelerates due to gravity, resulting in increasing velocity {{as the object}} descends. During parachuting, animals use the aerodynamic forces on their body to counteract the force or gravity. Any object moving through air experiences a drag force that is proportion to surface area and to velocity squared, and this force will partially counter the force of gravity, slowing the animal's descent to a safer speed. If this drag is oriented {{at an angle to}} the vertical, the animal's trajectory will gradually become more horizontal, and it will cover horizontal as well as <b>vertical</b> <b>distance.</b> Smaller adjustments can allow turning or other maneuvers. This can allow a parachuting animal to move from a high location on one tree to a lower location on another tree nearby.|$|E
25|$|A {{steep and}} rough slope descends north east {{from the summit}} of Green Gable, {{dropping}} through Mitchell Cove to the flat-topped and rather damp col of Blackmoor Pols (1,995ft). Beyond this the ground rises again to the steep sided dome of Base Brown. On the south eastern face are crags overlooking Styhead Gill with Seathwaite Fell across the valley. The north western flanks are equally steep, but descending only half the <b>vertical</b> <b>distance</b> into the hanging valley of Gillercomb. This is the gathering ground of Sour Milk Gill, which drops over a series of falls around the northern extremity of Base Brown. Here it joins Styhead Gill and Grains Gill to form the nascent River Derwent. Across Gillercomb is the main ridge continuing north around Ennerdale, Brandreth being the initial fell. The top of Base Brown narrows considerably {{to the north of}} the summit, a prow-like ridge descending toward the falls of Sour Milk Gill. There is a prominent hanging stone here, startlingly poised over the rim of the crags. Another feature is the Seathwaite Slabs, a set of slabs of rocks used for rock climbing practice by novices and conveniently located only minutes from Seathwaite.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Trans-sphenoidal {{surgery is}} often {{combined}} with other approaches {{for the treatment of}} middle cranial base tumors. By combining a maxillotomy with trans-sphenoidal approach, significantly wider exposure to these regions is gained. However, endoscope-assisted techniques have also been used for sellar and parasellar and upper clival regions. Methods: An extended trans-sphenoidal approach was performed on 10 cadaver heads using the operating microscope and was repeated with a 0 -degree endoscope. The mean horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>distances</b> were measured and pictured for each technique, and both distances were compared using a parametric paired Student's t-test. Results: The mean horizontal distances in the 10 specimens were 19. 5 ± 1. 8 mm by microscope and 27. 5 ± 2. 2 mm by endoscope, and the mean <b>vertical</b> <b>distances</b> were 25. 8 ± 1. 9 mm by the microscope and 34. 5 ± 3. 5 mm by the endoscope.
