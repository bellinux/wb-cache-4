5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} Mach2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air intake ramps were variable. Initially, it had been expected that a Mach1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude performance requirement was later lowered to Mach0.85, {{reducing the amount of}} titanium and therefore cost. A pair of small vanes mounted near the nose are part of an active <b>vibration</b> <b>damping</b> system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride. The first three B-1As featured the escape capsule that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside. The fourth B-1A was equipped with a conventional ejection seat for each crew member.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} on the bike, the rider, and safety. An important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of the natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in <b>vibration</b> <b>damping</b> is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2008, NASA Watch {{revealed}} that the first stage solid rocket of the Ares I could have created high vibrations {{during the first few}} minutes of ascent. The vibrations would have been caused by thrust oscillations inside the first stage. NASA officials had identified the potential problem at the Ares I system design review in late October 2007, stating in a press release that it wanted to solve it by March 2008. NASA admitted that this problem was very severe, rating it four out of five on a risk scale, but the agency was very confident in solving it. The mitigation approach developed by the Ares engineering team included active and passive <b>vibration</b> <b>damping,</b> adding an active tuned-mass absorber and a passive [...] "compliance structure" [...] – essentially a spring-loaded ring that would have detuned the Ares I stack. NASA also pointed out that, since this would have been a new launch system, like the Apollo or Space Shuttle systems, it was normal for such problems to arise during the development stage. According to NASA, analysis of the data and telemetry from the Ares I-X flight showed that vibrations from thrust oscillation were within the normal range for a Space Shuttle flight.|$|E

40|$|The slip <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> {{on power}} {{transmission}} lines (PTLs), {{which is caused}} by aeolian vibration, material aging and some outside interference, is a serious fault in power grid. The maintenance task, with high working intensity and risk, is generally completed on the high voltage live line by specially trained workers. This paper presents {{the development of a}} novel mobile robot aiming at retrieving slip vibration dampers in power grid. The mobile robot with an operation platform can adapt to uncertain postures of the <b>vibration</b> <b>damper,</b> though the posture varies in a random way within a certain range. After approaching the fault location, the robot first disassembles the connection clamps of the loose <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> with specialized tools, and then the <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> is transported to the original position and assembled by virtue of a lifter and a revolute sleeve barrel. With the consideration of practical application, safety and performance on maintenance, the robot prototype has been developed. The inverse kinematics with geometrical constraints has been deduced. Robot experiments on mock-up lines have been carried out and the results are shown in this paper. © 2016 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{vibration}} absorbers and dampers {{are used}} to reduce the vibration responses of mechanical systems. A dynamic vibration absorber reduces vibrations of a primary system over a desired frequency range by absorbing the energy through responding with opposite phase {{to that of the}} force acting on the primary system. A damper, on the other hand, is a device used for reducing the magnitude of a shock or vibration by energy dissipation methods. The latter is extensively used in automotive engines to reduce torsional oscillations and in aircraft landing gears to damp out shimmy oscillations. This thesis aims to study and understand an optimally tuned viscous torsional <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> which is a combination of a dynamic <b>vibration</b> absorber and <b>damper.</b> The primary system whose vibration is to be suppressed, along with the optimally tuned viscous torsional <b>vibration</b> <b>damper,</b> will form a two-degree-of-freedom system which will be studied for its dynamic behaviour. The analytical model includes parameters such as primary inertia, damping and stiffness and secondary inertia, damping and stiffness. Numerical determination of optimum damping and stiffness for a secondary system is carried out and simulated results are presented and discussed. Validation of some aspects of the analytical studies is carried out with experimental investigation for the optimally tuned viscous torsional <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> and viscous damper. The test results of the two damping devices and the analytical investigations are compared. In addition, the study is extended, applying the optimally tuned viscous torsional <b>vibration</b> <b>damper</b> to a seven-degree-of-freedom torsional system namely to a four-stroke six-in-line cylinder internal combustion engine. This numerical study compares the engine response with and without damping. For both cases same excitation torque per cylinder was applied.
