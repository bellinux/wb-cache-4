500|$|The {{journalist}} Sheila Johnston of The Daily Telegraph, in 2010, described Zeta-Jones as [...] "the ultimate self-made success" [...] who [...] "constantly made bold decisions, and scrubbed up <b>very</b> <b>nicely</b> into a luscious {{star who}} radiates a classic [...] brand of big-screen glamour." [...] Guy Adams of The Independent considers her personality to be [...] "self-effacing and energetic" [...] but takes note of her [...] "steely core" [...] in her off-screen persona. Zeta-Jones' success {{in her early}} Hollywood films The Mask of Zorro (1998) and Entrapment (1999) relied predominantly on her sex appeal, but she was later appreciated for her versatility.|$|E

On the possibility of a sequel, Lundgren said: [...] "I didn't consider [...] as a franchise, but when I was over there , I started thinking, 'How would I do this different? How would I stay close to the subject matter?' Organ trafficking is quite big as well, so I thought that could be interesting. We could follow up with some kind of other trade." ...|$|E

500|$|Around 100 {{tracks were}} used on [...] "Schoolin' Life"; they were roughly split with 50 {{for the music}} and 50 for the vocals. As stated by Swivel, musically {{the aim of the}} mix was to take a large number of tracks and create a perfect balance. So, he used Waves’ Metaflanger on the {{percussion}} and some of the snares, and spent some time EQ’ing. Swivel explained that there was much parallel processing on the lead vocal. The lead-vocal bus was multed to a second bus, {{and one of them was}} entirely crushed on a 50:1 compression ratio which was totally limited and with a very low threshold. He elaborated, [...] "It creates a very gritty distorted sound in there, really low to taste, and it fills in the lead vocal <b>very</b> <b>nicely.</b> The crushed vocal runs quietly underneath." ...|$|E
500|$|Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. On the critic review aggregator site Metacritic, the album holds {{a score of}} 71/100, based on 39 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable" [...] reviews. At Digital Spy, Adam Silverstein commends that [...] "more often than not, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is this band sharpening their particular surefire indie to glittering distinction." [...] Commenting on the band's future, {{he says that the}} [...] "half-sorry, half-bitter 'Goodbye Lovers & Friends' is probably not Franz Ferdinand's very last act, even if Kapranos proclaiming in the final seconds 'But this really is the end' would make one awesome blowout. Although after delivering a record as good as this, they can take as long as they want". At The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski wrote positively of the musical differences between many of this album's tracks compared to the band's prior work, adding: [...] "Admittedly, these more nuanced Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action sounds aren't as easily accessible; it's much easier to gravitate toward more familiar raucous post-punk ('Bullet,' 'Right Action') or the Clash-reminiscent punk-funk of 'Evil Eye.' But by expanding its worldview, Franz Ferdinand has <b>very</b> <b>nicely</b> settled onto a path toward career longevity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} these ships was very {{controversial}} {{while they were}} being built in the 1870s, with many articles being published in the newspapers of the day by supporters and detractors, and later picked up by historians. One such account, published in 1875, claimed that Novgorod made an uncontrollable turn while on the Dniepr, while Reed, describing {{a time when the}} ship's engines on one side were reversed during a cruise in Sevastopol Bay, wrote: [...] "The circular form is so extremely favourable to this kind of handiness that the Novgorod can easily be revolved on her centre at a speed which quickly makes one giddy. She can, nevertheless, be promptly brought to rest, and, if, needed have her rotary motion reversed." [...] It would seem probable that the two reports quoted above were combined into the story as given by Fred T. Jane: [...] "On a trial cruise, they (Novgorod and [...] ) went up the Dniepr <b>very</b> <b>nicely</b> for some distance, till they turned to retire. Then the current caught them, and they were carried out to sea, whirled helplessly round and round, every soul on board helplessly incapacitated by vertigo." [...] The other criticisms made by Preston have been discussed earlier and the opinion of naval historian Stephen McLaughlin is a reasonable assessment of these ships: In the final analysis, the popovkas seem to have been relatively effective coast-defence vessels; certainly their combination of armament and armour could have only been carried by a conventional ship of much greater draught. Their faults – and they certainly had faults — were exaggerated by critics, both in Russia and abroad, and have left as a legacy stories of uncontrollable ships designed by incompetent men.|$|E

Nevertheless, Mrs Cora Lansquenet, says, [...] "It's been hushed up <b>very</b> <b>nicely</b> ... but he was murdered, wasn't he?" [...] The family lawyer, Mr Entwhistle, begins to investigate. Mr Entwhistle relates the outline of the will to the relatives. As Richard's wife and child died before he did, his possessions are divided among his two living siblings and the widow or children of those who died before him. His brother Timothy and sister Cora Lansquenet were alive when he wrote the will. Brothers Leo and Gordon were killed in the war. Richard has a nephew and two nieces, the sum total of the next generation. He spent time with his nephew George, and his nieces Susan and Rosamund and their husbands, Leo's widow Helen, Timothy, and Cora. He split his wealth in six portions. Enderby Hall is to be sold.|$|E

30|$|Based on 9  years of {{experience}} with an integrated ultrasound curriculum, the value of ultrasound as an active learning tool, as a platform for curricular integration, and as an important clinical skill is clear.

Ultrasound by its <b>very</b> nature fits <b>nicely</b> into a competency-based model of medical education. Ultrasound curricula can be designed with flexibility and objectivity that allow self-directed and self-paced learning.

50|$|An echelle {{spectrograph}} uses two diffraction gratings, rotated 90 degrees {{with respect}} to each other and placed close to one another. Therefore, an entrance point and not a slit is used and a 2d CCD-chip records the spectrum.

The small chip also means that the collimating optics need not to be optimized for coma or astigmatism, but the spherical aberration can be set to zero.|$|R

March 3, 1955. 8 °. i-xv, 1 - 165 pp., 43 photogr., 31 coloured plates, and text-figures; clothbound. Sh. 30 /- net. A simple, illustrated {{guide to}} some of the most beautiful flowering trees to be seen in India and Pakistan. It should be of use and interest throughout the tropics as most of the plants treated are grown as ornamentals outside their native country. Thirty nine species have been fully described with accurate synonymy, and notes on distribution, gardening, uses, economic value, vernaculars, domestic uses, medicinal properties, ethnobotany, and ecology of leafshedding, flowering and fruiting seasons. In some cases also closely related species are briefly indicated or described. In appendices descriptions are given of families represented, further a key to the genera, a glossary of some botanic terms, and a bibliography to some sources of further information. An index concludes this <b>very</b> attractive, <b>nicely</b> executed, and relatively very cheap book which is a valuable educative tool to laymen and those interested in gardening in the tropics. It contains much concise adequate information on the plants treated. In a way it is a counterpart to Bor & Raizada’s Some beautiful Indian climbers and shrubs, published by the same Society...|$|R
40|$|Let {{me begin}} with a {{postulate}} that some may find argumentative, more likely will find merely banal: all accounts of behavior in our species, among whom I will graciously count businessmen, {{fall into one of}} two sets. One set is grounded in the singular supposition that all hominid behavior, even aggregate behavior, is fully explicable in terms of "thinly described " atomistic individuals pursuing yenally selfish goals, or "self interests, " or even "rational self-interests. " This supposition has until <b>very</b> recently harmonized <b>nicely</b> with ideas in evolutionary biology and in sociobiology which see our species' behavior, {{as well as that of}} all other sexually reproducing species, as driven by "selfish genes " seeking only to maximize their inclusive fitness [...] their representation in the next generation [4]. In this paradigm, altruism, quasi-altruism, or even cooperation in pursuit of collective interests, are at best instrumental: they are extended only to near-kin, or they depend upon an imputed (rational) "calculation" of expected returns or future reciprocity.

We are viewed as objects for pity. It is a fine evening; we stop and lean against a bank by the roadside to look at the sunset. An old woman comes tottering by on high pattens, <b>very</b> comfortably and <b>nicely</b> clad. She sees our knapsacks, and instantly stops in front of us, and begins to moan lamentably.

His recognition as a poet has been hearty enough to give him a feeling of success, for he showed me various tokens of the estimation in which he is held,--for instance, a presentation copy of Southey's works, in which the latter had written [...] "Amicus amico,--poeta poetae." [...] He said that Southey had always been most kind to him. [...] . There were various other testimonials from people of note, American as well as English. In his parlor there is a good oil-painting of himself, and in the drawing-room a very fine crayon sketch, wherein his face, handsome and agreeable, is lighted up with all a poet's ecstasy; likewise a large and fine engraving from the picture. The government has recognized his poetic merit by a pension of fifty pounds,--a small sung, it is true, but enough to mark him out as one who has deserved well of his country. [...] . The man himself is very good and lovable. [...] . I was able to gratify him by saying that I had recently seen many favorable notices of his poems in the American newspapers; an edition having been published a few months since on our side of the ocean. He was much pleased at this, and asked me to send him the notices. [...] .|$|R

Alvina was more fascinated by the odd fish: like the lady who did marvellous things with six ferrets, or the Jap who was tattooed all over, and had the most amazing strong wrists, {{so that he could}} throw down any collier, with one turn of the hand. Queer cuts these!--but just a little bit beyond her. She watched them rather from a distance. She wished she could jump across the distance. Particularly with the Jap, who was almost quite naked, but clothed with the most exquisite tattooing. Never would she forget the eagle that flew with terrible spread wings between his shoulders, or the strange mazy pattern that netted the roundness of his buttocks. He was not <b>very</b> large, but <b>nicely</b> shaped, and with no hair on his smooth, tattooed body. He was almost blue in colour--that is, his tattooing was blue, with pickings of brilliant vermilion: as for instance round the nipples, and in a strange red serpent's-jaws over the navel. A serpent went round his loins and haunches. He told her how many times he had had blood-poisoning, during the process of his tattooing. He was a queer, black-eyed creature, with a look of silence and toad-like lewdness. He frightened her. But when he was dressed in common clothes, and was just a cheap, shoddy-looking European Jap, he was more frightening still. For his face--he was not tattooed above a certain ring low on his neck--was yellow and flat and basking with one eye open, like some age-old serpent. She felt he was smiling horribly all the time: lewd, unthinkable. A strange sight he was in Woodhouse, on a sunny morning; a shabby-looking bit of riff-raff of the East, rather down at the heel. Who could have imagined the terrible eagle of his shoulders, the serpent of his loins, his supple, magic skin? ...|$|R
