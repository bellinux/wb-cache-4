40|$|This paper {{argues that}} a {{generalized}} model of social preferences must simultaneously pass two tests; the <b>Variety</b> <b>Test</b> (explain outcomes under variety, the V-test) and the Psychological Test (conform to psychological intuition, the P-test).

The paper extends the Fehr and Schmidt model of inequality-aversion to a generalized model of inequity-aversion which parsimoniously explains interior outcomes in the dictator game and dynamics of outcomes in other games. This is done through introducing the equity-bias in the Fehr and Schmidt model. The paper postulates that a player’s idea of equitable distribution is state-dependent, where the state is determined by psychological and structural parameters. The state could be fair, superior or inferior. Individuals in a fair state have zero equity-bias and split the pie evenly. Those in a superior (inferior) state have positive (negative) equity-bias and value more (less) than fair distribution as equitable...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the Illinois State <b>Variety</b> <b>Test</b> results for total and extractable starch content in 708 samples of 401 commercial varieties of corn. It is {{shown that the}} normally distributed extractable starch content has the mean of 66. 2 % and the standard deviation of 1. 13 %. The corresponding maximum theoretical yield of ethanol is 0. 364 kg EtOH/kg dry corn, and the standard deviation is 0. 007. In the ethanol industry units, this yield translates to 2. 64 gal EtOH/nominal wet bushel, and the standard deviation is 0. 05 gal/bu. The U. S. ethanol industry consistently has inflated its ethanol yields by counting 5 volume percent of # 14 gasoline denaturant (8 % of energy content) as ethanol. Also, imports from Brazil and higher alcohols {{seem to have been}} counted as U. S. ethanol. The usually accepted USDA estimate of mean ethanol yield in the U.

40|$|Following the {{publication}} of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment station’s last bulletin on Oats, in March, 1908, a number of additional experiments with this cereal were inaugurated which are now drawing toward completion.

Other experiments were undertaken upon the size and weight of seed and upon the rate and method of seeding. These, while as yet incomplete, are showing some tendencies which are valuable and should now be made public. From the variety tests we find certain types adapted to certain soils and conditions. Buying heavy seed in the open market does not show satisfactory returns for the money invested. The value of repeated fanning of seed oats has been overestimated.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Economic Sciences, Washington State UniversityData {{from the}} WSU wheat <b>variety</b> <b>test</b> program along with {{spatially}} interpolated historic weather records present {{a unique opportunity}} to compare wheat variety performance across time and Washington State geography. A key assumption in this analysis takes wheat variety to be genetically constant year-over-year. This assumption allows us to separate breeding versus farm-level productivity gains. Furthermore, across the wide variety of climate regions within Washington State, productivity gains can be measured for different climate regions, allowing a unique contribution to the body of literature attempting to differentiate the various technology contributions to farm productivity. Analysis of breeder contributions to wheat productivity gains are then applied to state-wide USDA productivity data and determine the economic benefit provided by the wheat variety improvements to average $ 1. 8 M per year (2010 dollars). Finally, a close analysis of wheat variety response to moisture is combined with results from ten global circulation models to make long-range predictions on Washington State wheat productivity for the 30 year average 2020 - 2050, expecting wheat growing regions in Eastern Washington to remain consistent with current trends while the East Central agriculture district will see modest gains compared to the other districts.
