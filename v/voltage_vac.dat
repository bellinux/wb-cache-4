40|$|Abstract. We examine {{oscillations}} as {{a function}} of Fermi energy in the capacitance of a mesoscopic cavity connected via a single quantum channel to a metallic contact and capacitively coupled to a back gate. The oscillations depend on the distribution of single levels in the cavity, the interaction strength and the transmission probability through the quantum channel. We use a Hartree-Fock approach to exclude selfinteraction. The sample specific capacitance oscillations are in marked contrast to the charge relaxation resistance, which together with the capacitance defines the RCtime, and which for spin polarized electrons is quantized at half a resistance quantum. Both the capacitance oscillations and the quantized charge relaxation resistance are seen in a strikingly clear manner in a recent experiment. Charge relaxation 2 Figure 1. (color online).

40|$|Piezoresponse force {{microscopy}} (PFM) is {{a powerful}} technique to characterize ferroelectric thin films by measuring the dynamic electromechanical response. The ferroelectricity is commonly demonstrated by the PFM hysteresis loops and a 180 o phase difference of PFM images before and after poling. Such ferroelectric-like behaviors, however, recently are also found in many non-ferroelectrics. Consequently, {{it is still a}} challenge to identify intrinsic ferroelectricity in various kinds of thin films. Here, using PFM, we systematically studied the electromechanical responses in ferroelectric thin films with fast (BaTiO 3) and slow (PVDF) switch dynamics, and also in the non-ferroelectric (Al 2 O 3) thin films. It is found that both of the ac <b>voltage</b> (<b>Vac)</b> and pulsed dc voltage (Vdc) {{play an important role in}} the PFM measurement. When the Vac amplitude is higher than a explicit threshold voltage (Vc), collapse of the PFM hysteresis loops is observed for the films with fast switch dynamics. By measuring PFM hysteresis loops at various Vdc frequencies, an explicit Vc could be found in ferroelectric rather than in non-ferroelectric. The existence of an explicit Vc as well as nonvolatile behavior is proposed as an important approach to unambiguously identify intrinsic ferroelectricity in materials regardless of switch dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Flame {{spread over}} polyethylene-insulated {{electrical}} wires was studied experimentally with applied alternating current (AC) by varying the inclination angle (θ), applied <b>voltage</b> (<b>VAC),</b> and frequency (fAC). For the baseline case with no electric field applied, the flame spread {{rate and the}} flame width of downwardly spreading flames (DSFs) decreased from the horizontal case for − 20 ° ≤ θ <  0 ° and maintained near constant values for − 90 ° ≤ θ < − 20 °, while the flame spread rate increased appreciably as the inclination angle of upwardly spreading flames (USFs) increased. When an AC electric field was applied, the behavior of flame spread rate in DSFs (USFs) could be classified into two (three) sub-regimes characterized by various functional dependences on VAC, fAC, and θ. In nearly all cases of DSFs, a globular molten polyethylene formed ahead of the spreading flame edge, occasionally dripping onto the ground. In these cases, an effective flame spread rate was defined to represent the burning rate by measuring the mass loss due to dripping. This effective spread rate was independent of AC frequency, while it decreased linearly with voltage and was independent of the inclination angle. In DSFs, when excessively high voltage and frequency were applied, the dripping led to flame extinction during propagation and the extinction frequency correlated well with applied voltage. In USFs, when high voltage and frequency were applied, multiple globular molten PEs formed at several locations, leading to ejections of multiple small flame segments from the main flame, thereby reducing the flame spread rate, which {{could be attributed to}} the electrospray phenomenon...|$|E

50|$|If the SMPS has an AC input, {{then the}} first stage is to convert the input to DC. This is called rectification. A SMPS with a DC input does not require this stage. In some power {{supplies}} (mostly computer ATX power supplies), the rectifier circuit can be configured as a voltage doubler {{by the addition of}} a switch operated either manually or automatically. This feature permits operation from power sources that are normally at 115 V or at 230 V. The rectifier produces an unregulated DC voltage which is then sent to a large filter capacitor. The current drawn from the mains supply by this rectifier circuit occurs in short pulses around the AC voltage peaks. These pulses have significant high frequency energy which reduces the power factor. To correct for this, many newer SMPS will use a special PFC circuit to make the input current follow the sinusoidal shape of the AC input voltage, correcting the power factor. Power supplies that use active PFC usually are auto-ranging, supporting input <b>voltages</b> from ~100 <b>VAC</b> - 250 VAC, with no input voltage selector switch.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Conventional {{electrical}} distribution systems onboard aircraft use a {{three-phase system}} with a typical <b>voltage</b> of 115 <b>VAC</b> or 230 VAC to supply electrical loads. Future aircraft demand more electric power due to the replacement of hydraulic and pneumatic systems by electrical ones and {{the increased use of}} multimedia entertainment systems.

These higher voltages reduce cable weight, but are a new challenge for solid-state power controllers (SSPC), which are used as protection devices for cables and loads.

This study provides a vital step {{in the development of}} a consistent arc structure and motion in circuit breakers operating at low contact opening velocity. The experimental investigations focus on the influence of the contact material, arc chamber material, contact velocity, power supply polarity, the gap behind the moving contact and the peak short circuit current level on the arc motion. The gas flows and gas composition effects are inspected. This thesis concentrates on the arc commutation at reduced contact opening velocity down to 1 m/s from a moving contact and in particular the point at which the arc root moves off from the contact region To investigate the arc root motion, the Flexible Test Apparatus (FTA) is used to simulate circuit breaker operation. The Arc Imaging System (AIS) is used to record series of the arc motion. New pressure transducers and a spectrometer are used to observe the gas flow and gas composition in the contact region. This data combination provides a new insight into the arc motion. The studies have observed that the gas flow in the region of the moving contact has been shown to affect the arc root mobility. The spectral emission from the arc gases confirms the presence of electronegative species. Experimental results are presented which include the measurements of pressures in the arc chamber, arc spectrum, and arc root motion.

50|$|Capacitors, {{including}} film types, {{designed for}} continuous operation at low-frequency (50 or 60 Hz) mains voltage, typically between line and neutral or line and ground for interference suppression, {{are required to}} meet standard safety ratings; e.g., X2 is designed to operate between line and neutral at 200-240 VAC, and Y2 between line and ground. These types are designed for reliability, and, in case of failure, to fail safely (open-, rather than short-circuit). A non-catastrophic failure mode in this application {{is due to the}} corona effect: the air enclosed in the winding element becomes ionized and consequently more conductive, allowing partial discharges on the metallized surface of the film, which causes local vaporization of the metallization. This occurs repeatedly, and can cause significant loss of capacitance (C-decay) over one or two years. International standard IEC60384-14 specifies a limit of 10% C-decay per 1,000 test hours (41 days of permanent connection). Some capacitors are designed to minimise this effect. One method, at the expense of increased size and cost, is for a capacitor operating at 200-240 VAC to consist internally of two parts in series, each at a <b>voltage</b> of 100-120 <b>VAC,</b> insufficient to cause ionisation.

In a similar way the effectiveness of the switches and mgnetics are presented to enable design decisions in the output stage of the rectifier. Chapter 3 presents the design of the 1400 W telecom power supply, keeping in view of the stated specifications. The performance results of the converter are presented in Chapter 4. All the design goals have been met. The design exercise has also given insights into possible further improvements. Contributions from this work and course of future development work are indicated in the concluding chapter...|$|R

This design provides power when required and absorbs power when required to smooth the system load and also has excellent low-temperature performance. The UPS used during hardware tests at Glenn is an efficient, compact, maintenance-free, rack-mount, pure sine-wave inverter unit. The UPS provides a continuous output power up to 1, 700 W with a surge rating of 1, 870 W for up to one minute at a nominal output <b>voltage</b> of 115 <b>VAC.</b> The ultracapacitor energy storage system tested {{in conjunction with the}} UPS is rated at 5. 8 F. This is a bank of ten symmetric ultracapacitor modules. Each module is actively balanced using a linear voltage balancing technique in which the cell-to-cell leakage is dependent upon the imbalance of the individual cells. The ultracapacitors are charged by a DC power supply, which can provide up to 300 VDC at 4 A. A constant-voltage, constant-current power supply was selected for this application. The long life of ultracapacitors greatly enhances system reliability, which is significant in critical applications such as medical power systems and space power systems. The energy storage system can usually last longer than the application, given its 20 -year life span. This means that the ultracapacitors will probably never need to be replaced and disposed of, whereas batteries require frequent replacement and disposal. The charge-discharge efficiency of rechargeable batteries is approximately 50 percent, and after some hundreds of charges and discharges, they must be replaced. The charge-discharge efficiency of ultracapacitors exceeds 90 percent, and can accept more than a million charges and discharges. Thus, there is a significant energy savings through the efficiency improvement, and there is far less downtime for applications and labor involved in replacing an ultracapacitor versus batteries. Also, the lengthy lifespan of this design would greatly reduce the disposal problems posed by lead acid, nickel cadmium, lithium, and nickel metal hydride batteries. This innovation is recyclable by nature, which further reduces system costs. The disposal of ultracapacitors is simple, as they are constructed of non-hazardous components. They are also safer than batteries in that they can be easily discharged, and left indefinitely in a safe, discharged state where batteries cannot...|$|R

L’energia es pren directament de la xarxa de subministrament elèctric i permet encendre tot tipus de focus i bombetes. Actualment la necessitat de controlar la intensitat lumínica de focus és de gran utilitat i es poden veure exemples en escenaris de teatres, concerts musicals, domòtica bàsica a vivendes, botigues, restaurants, etc. on s’incorporen aparells òptims per aquest control. Aspectes com la programació d’encesa, apagat i intensitat desitjada de focus a una hora convinguda facilita el fet de fer-ho manualment i disposar de més temps propi. L’objectiu principal d’aquest treball és dissenyar i construir un regulador de llum controlat per ordinador capac de regular la intensitat lumínica de 8 focus independentment l’un de l’altre. El control de regulació s’efectua mitjancant un programa informàtic compatible amb ordinadors que incorporin el sistema operatiu Windows i és programable en el temps permetent seleccionar la intensitat desitjada a diferents hores del dia seleccionat. Com a conclusions es pot destacar un estalvi energètic al regular la intensitat dels focus evitant així la permanent connexio a una tensió màxima de 230 VAC i la oportunitat de construir un regulador de llum amb els documents subministrats. SUMMARY The electric {{light is}} a kind of energy that illuminates the whole world, being used to illuminate the night and to provide additional light during the day. This light is powdered directly from the electricity grid and allows the activation of all types of light bulbs and focus. Currently the need to control the light intensity of focus is nowadays useful and it can bee seen on stage theatres, concerts, home automation, shops, restaurants, etc. where optimal devices are incorporated for this control. Aspects like the on, off and the required intensity focus programming at the desired hour, makes it easier than do it manually and you can have more own time. The main objective of this work is to design and build a computer controlled dimmer to regulate the light intensity of 8 focuses independently of each other. The regulation control is performed by a computer program compatible with computers that include Windows operating system and it is programmable in time allowing to select the light intensity to be regulated at the wished hour of the selected day. The most out-standing conclusions are the energy saving when the light intensity is regulated avoiding the permanent connection to a maximum <b>voltage</b> of 230 <b>VAC</b> and the opportunity of build a computer controlled dimmer with the documents supplied.
