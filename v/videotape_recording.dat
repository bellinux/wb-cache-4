25|$|The only {{director}} {{to return for}} Series Three was Vere Lorrimer. The other directors appointed were George Spenton-Foster, Jonathan Wright Miller and Derek Martinus. Because of the difficulties caused {{by the use of}} strike filming, Series Two was recorded using block filming. This filming method involved a month of location filming for the first six episodes before the studio <b>videotape</b> <b>recording</b> of those episodes, each director being assigned to work on two episodes. The process was repeated for the next six episodes and the final episode would be recorded on its own.|$|E

The 13-minute recording shows the flight crew astronauts conducting routine re-entry procedures and joking with each other. None gives any indication of a problem. In the video, the flight-deck crew puts on their gloves and passes the video camera around to record plasma and flames visible outside {{the windows of the}} orbiter (a normal occurrence). The recording, which on normal flights would have continued through landing, ends about four minutes before the shuttle began to disintegrate and 11 minutes before Mission Control lost the signal from the orbiter.|$|E
500|$|In early 1960, Skelton {{purchased}} the old Charlie Chaplin Studios and updated it for <b>videotape</b> <b>recording.</b> With a recently purchased three-truck mobile color television unit, he recorded {{a number of}} his series episodes and specials in color. Even with his color facilities, CBS discontinued color broadcasts on a regular basis and Skelton shortly thereafter sold the studio to CBS and the mobile unit to local station, KTLA. Prior to this, he had been filming at Desilu Productions. Skelton then moved back to the network's Television City facilities, where he resumed taping his programs until he left the network. In the fall of 1962, CBS expanded his program to a full hour, retitling it The Red Skelton Hour. While a staple of his radio programs, he did not perform his [...] "Junior" [...] character on television until 1962, after extending the length of his program.|$|E

500|$|The precise {{manner in}} which the text was {{obtained}} for MindVox is unclear, although the initial custodian of the text, known only as [...] "Templar" [...] attached to it an introductory note in which he claimed credit. Begos claimed that a troupe of New York University students representing themselves as documentarians attended The Transmission and made a <b>videotape</b> <b>recording</b> of the screen as it displayed the text as an accompaniment of Jillette's reading. Kirschenbaum speculates that this group included the offline persona of Templar or one of his associates. According to this account, ostensibly endorsed by Templar in a post to Slashdot in February 2000, the students then transcribed the poem from the tape and within hours had uploaded it to MindVox. However, according to a dissenting account by hacktivist and MindVox co-founder Patrick K. Kroupa, subterfuge prior to The Transmission elicited a betrayal of trust which yielded the uploaders the text. Kirschenbaum declined to elaborate on the specifics of the Kroupa conjecture, which he declared himself [...] "not at liberty to disclose".|$|E

40|$|The <b>videotape</b> <b>record</b> of a user-system {{interaction}} {{can be very}} valuable in locating usability problems. However, {{the analysis of the}} <b>videotape</b> <b>record</b> is often unstructured, non-quantitative, and time-consuming. The Video Analysis Method (VAM) provides a method to structure this data and derive measures of usability. A grammar integrates the videotape data with transaction log information and segments of the program code into a. single representation of the interaction. Various usability metrics can then be derived from this representation. In addition, the use of the transaction log to edit usability problems from the videotape before the application of the grammar reduces the total analysis time...|$|R

50|$|Another {{limitation}} {{to camera}} perspective bias research {{is that the}} majority of interrogations/confessions that have been used as converging evidence include simulations of trial evidence rather than actual trial information. Therefore, there is no evidence demonstrating the camera perspective bias generalizes to authentic <b>videotapes</b> <b>recorded</b> by police that depict actual suspects and interrogators. Researchers have thus begun comparing judgments of voluntariness and guilt of the suspect in each perspective condition (suspect-focus, equal-focus, and detective-focus, audio only, reading only) using authentic, recorded interrogations. The investigations demonstrate the camera perspective bias found in previous studies.|$|R
