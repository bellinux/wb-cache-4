25|$|The {{door frame}} for this opening is highly altered {{in almost every}} detail with the {{exception}} of the basic size. The door itself may be original but is almost certainly of old if not of colonial origin. It consists of a pair of narrow, white battened doors opening at the center. Each door has a pair of vertical recessed panels on the top and bottom half, comprising four panels on each door. The brick arch is obviously a replacement, but the wooden door trim consisting of two vertical frames surmounted by a horizontal board bearing a chamfer and lamb’s tongue molding may be of colonial age. The <b>vertical</b> <b>frame</b> members extend beyond the lintel to the bottom of the brick arch. The space between the arch and the top board is filled with flat plaster. The sill is a simple wooden one. In all likelihood, this opening had a pediment of unknown appearance in colonial days. It is the only door in the church that has a lock and key. These are of modern origin.|$|E

2500|$|Like some Zöglings, the Hols der Teufel had a light nacelle, ending {{under the}} wing at a forward leaning {{vertical}} knife edge around the aft central wing strut, enclosing both the pilot's seat {{and the other}} supporting struts. [...] Aft, the cross braced girder had a horizontal upper beam onto which the tailplane was mounted, strut braced from below. Its leading edge was straight and strongly swept; the cropped, parallel chord elevators had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames. Its upright, near rectangular rudder was hinged on the extended, final <b>vertical</b> <b>frame</b> member. The Hols der Teufel landed on a rubber sprung skid which ran from the nose to a little beyond the aft lift struts.|$|E
2500|$|The Poppenhausen had a light nacelle {{fuselage}} extending {{well behind}} the wing trailing edge and ending at a forward leaning vertical knife edge.The forward cockpit was largely {{ahead of the}} leading edge and the rear one under the wing. Behind the wing the fuselage had the same flat, cross braced girder form as the Hols der Teufel, with a horizontal upper beam, its [...] first diagonal brace within the nacelle. The tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} horizontal beam, its leading edge straight and strongly swept. Cropped, parallel chord elevators had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames. Its upright, balanced, near rectangular rudder was hinged on the extended, final <b>vertical</b> <b>frame</b> member. The Poppenhausen landed on a rubber sprung skid which ran from the nose to a little beyond the aft lift struts.|$|E
2500|$|The Type L did {{not have}} a long, {{enclosed}} fuselage but instead the empennage was supported on an open girder. [...] The Type L, unusually for Caudron, had two parallel sided, cross braced side frames. The longitudinal members were steel and the cross-members ash. [...] The side frames began from the rear spars of both upper and lower wings and converged rearwards to meet at the tail, with upper and lower cross-members towards the rear. [...] A short nacelle on the lower wing contained an open, wide cockpit with side-by-side seating, the pilot on the right. [...] Controls were conventional. [...] The nacelle ended behind the forward wing spar, ahead of the [...] Gnome Delta nine cylinder rotary engine mounted on the rear interplane struts and driving a two blade propeller via 2:1 reduction gearing and a long shaft to clear the trailing edge. At the extreme tail, the final <b>vertical</b> <b>frame</b> member served as the axis for the rudder, with a small, roughly triangular fin ahead of it. The elevator hinge was also mounted high on this member, with a straight edged tailplane ahead of it.|$|E

6000|$|... § IX. We {{have thus}} {{arrived at the}} idea of a <b>vertical</b> <b>frame</b> work of subordinated bars, {{supported}} by cross bars at the necessary intervals, and the only remaining question is the method of insertion into the aperture. Whatever its form, if we merely let the ends of the bars into the voussoirs of its heading, the least settlement of the masonry would distort the arch, or push up some of its voussoirs, or break the window bars, or push them aside. Evidently our object should be to connect the window bars among themselves, so framing them together that they may give the utmost possible degree of support to the whole window head in case of any settlement. But we know how to do this already: our window bars are nothing but small shafts. Capital them; throw small arches across between the smaller bars, large arches over them between the larger bars, one comprehensive arch over the whole, or else a horizontal lintel, if the window have a flat head; and we have a complete system of mutual support, independent of the aperture head, and yet assisting to sustain it, if need be. But we want the spandrils of this arch system to be themselves as light, and to let as much light through them, as possible: and we know already how to pierce them (Chap. XII. § VII.). We pierce them with circles; and we have, if the circles are small and the stonework strong, the traceries of Giotto and the Pisan school; if the circles are as large as possible and the bars slender, those which I have already figured and described as the only perfect traceries of the Northern Gothic.[58] The varieties of their design arise partly from the different size of window and consequent number of bars; partly from the different heights of their pointed arches, as well as the various positions of the window head in relation to the roof, rendering one or another arrangement better for dividing the light, and partly from æsthetic and expressional requirements, which, within certain limits, may be allowed a very important influence: for the strength of the bars is ordinarily so much greater than is absolutely necessary, that some portion of it may be gracefully sacrificed to the attainment of variety in the plans of tracery--a variety which, even within its severest limits, is perfectly endless; more especially in the pointed arch, the proportion of the tracery being in the round arch necessarily more fixed.|$|E

In C-MFSF, a signature file is divided into variable sized compressed <b>vertical</b> <b>frames</b> with different on-bit densities to optimize the response time. Experiments with a real database of 152, 850 records show that a response time less than 150 milliseconds is possible. For multi-term queries C-MFSF obtains the query results with fewer disk accesses than the inverted files. The method requires no indexing vocabulary. These attributes have important implications; for example, web search engines process multi-term queries in very large databases with sizeable vocabularies...|$|R

5000|$|A katōmado (lit. fire light window), {{also written}} as (lit. flower top window), is {{a style of}} pointed arch or {{bell-shaped}} window found in Japanese architecture.
