50|$|Dynamo Dresden {{performed}} well in 2011-12 2. Bundesliga season. Reaching a stable place the team kept always away from struggling against relegation. While Dynamo Dresden {{had won the}} first round DFB-Pokal match against Bayer Leverkusen with 4-3 (after 0-3 in deficit), Dynamo was excluded from the 2012/2013 DFB-Pokal due to fan excesses and abuse of fireworks during the second round match against Borussia Dortmund (0-2) in a first trial. The sentence was later turned into one Game behind closed doors and one away game without own fan support. <b>Virtual</b> <b>tickets</b> were offered to reduce the financial loss, creating the first sold-out Ghost Game in history. The 2012-13 season started poorly for Dynamo and Ralf Loose was sacked in December 2012 after a 3-0 defeat to VfL Bochum with the team in 15th place. He was replaced by Peter Pacult, returning to the club after more than six years. Dynamo's form improved after Pacult's arrival but the team still finished the league as 16th behind Erzgebirge Aue. Both teams had collected {{the same number of}} points, so Aue's better goal average made the difference. Due to this Dynamo had to enter relegation play-offs again after just two seasons, incidentally meeting VfL Osnabrück once more—with the roles reversed. Dynamo emerged victorious with 2-1 on aggregate and remains in the second tier for the 2013-14 season. Pacult was sacked in August 2013 after a poor start to the 2013-14 season, and replaced with Olaf Janßen. Jansen was unable to save the club from the drop to the 3. Liga after they lost 3-2 at home to relegation rivals Arminia Bielefeld to drop into 17th place, ultimately costing Jansen his job. Dynamo had drawn half of their matches, winning just five all season.|$|R

The Supply Tickets are to be exchanged in a game catalogue for certain special airplanes (except for aircraft that are tournament rewards), skins and logos, radio messages, and nicknames. Players will also {{have a chance to}} research upgrades to their current aircraft through a special development tree, which will include options for new aircraft, aircraft parts, and weapons. The special aircraft, skins and logos include those from other Ace Combat titles, including the original Scarface Squadron (Phoenix) skins from the first Ace Combat game as well as those from notable air combat franchises such as Area 88 and Namco's own game franchises. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the JASDF, Namco Bandai included a special F-15J & F-2A that were featured at the 2014 Air Festival at Misawa Air Base in Japan. The US Department of Defense also authorized the use of the VF-84/VF-103 Jolly Roger high-visibility paint schemes for the F-14D and F/A-18F, the VMFA-232 skin for the F/A-18F, as well as renditions of the F-117, F-15C & F-16C in US flag livery.

40|$|Virtual reality (VR) has {{provoked}} enormous {{interest in the}} medical community. In particular, VIR offers therapists new approaches for improving rehabilitation effects. However, most of these VR assistant toots are not very portable, extensible or economical. Due to the vast amount of 3 D data, they are not suitable for Internet transfer. Furthermore, in order to run these VR systems smoothly, special hardware devices are needed. As a result, existing VIR assistant toots tend to be available in hospitals but not in patients' homes. To overcome these disadvantages, as a case study, this paper proposes a Web-based <b>Virtual</b> <b>Ticket</b> Machine, called WBVTM, using VRML [VRML Consortium, The Virtual Reality Modeling Language: International Standard ISO/IEC DIS 14772 - 1, 1997, available at [URL] Java and EAI (External Authoring Interface) [Silicon Graphics, Inc., The External Authoring Interface (EAI), available at [URL] to help people with acquired brain injury (ABI) to relearn basic living skills at home at a low cost. As these technologies are open standard and feature usability on the Internet, WBVTM achieves the goals of portability, easy accessibility and cost-effectiveness. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
