5000|$|The main {{contribution}} of Eppendorf, by the commercial {{success of the}} piston stroke was the development of interchangeable pipette tips made of polyethylene and polypropylene [...] From the American Gilson, attributed by Schnitger's invention {{in the early years}} of little importance, came in the early 1970s, the first piston pipettes with <b>variably</b> <b>adjustable</b> pipetting on the market, currently represent the most commonly used form. Further, based on the developed by Heinrich Schnitger basic principle variants are called multi-channel pipettes for simultaneous dosing over eight or twelve channels and pipettes with electronic adjustment and control of dosage.|$|E
5000|$|The cut crop {{is carried}} up the feeder throat (commonly called the [...] "feederhouse") by a chain and flight elevator, then {{fed into the}} {{threshing}} mechanism of the combine, consisting of a rotating threshing drum (commonly called the [...] "cylinder"), to which grooved steel bars (rasp bars) are bolted. The rasp bars thresh or separate the grains and chaff from the straw through {{the action of the}} cylinder against the concave, a shaped [...] "half drum", also fitted with steel bars and a meshed grill, through which grain, chaff and smaller debris may fall, whereas the straw, being too long, is carried through onto the straw walkers. This action is also allowed because grain is heavier than straw, which causes it to fall rather than [...] "float" [...] across from the cylinder/concave to the walkers. The drum speed is <b>variably</b> <b>adjustable</b> on most machines, whilst the distance between the drum and concave is finely adjustable fore, aft and together, to achieve optimum separation and output. Manually engaged disawning plates are usually fitted to the concave. These provide extra friction to remove the awns from barley crops. After the primary separation at the cylinder, the clean grain falls through the concave and to the shoe, which contains the chaffer and sieves. The shoe is common to both conventional combines and rotary combines.|$|E
40|$|The device applies a {{compensation}} force, {{and consists of}} an active hydraulic unit (110). This {{has at least one}} hydraulic cylinder (114) positioned between a ram (112) and a press frame (100). The cylinder is coupled to a double-sided pivoted hydrostatic machine (116). The machine is directly connected to the flywheel (118) of a main press drive (120). The connection may be via a transmission stage, or alternatively, the machine may be connected to the flywheel of an auxiliary drive. The compensation force for the ram is adjusted variably and independently of the stroke by the hydrostatic machine via a regulator (124). USE - Compensation device for press ram is incorporated in mechanical press. ADVANTAGE - Compensation force is <b>variably</b> <b>adjustable</b> independently of stroke...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that some of the {{controversy}} over the structure of articular cartilage may be due to slight differences in the orientation of the sample that has been studied. As our decisive criterion we have used the simple physical fact that elongate proteins, such as collagen micelles, that can exhibit form-birefringence, had to show virtually straight extinction when viewed under crossed polars. The use of a <b>variably</b> <b>adjustable</b> microtome chuck facilitated small adjustments in the orientation of the cartilage to meet this criterion. Under these conditions, the collagen of the matrix {{has been shown}} to be aligned mainly perpendicularly to the surface which was bounded by a thin lamina in which the collagen showed birefringence at 90 degrees to that of the matrix. The conventionally described zonation of articular cartilage {{has been shown to be}} inadequate for that of the dog tibial plateau. The conventional Zone 2 has been shown to consist of two zones, Zones 2 a and 2 b, with different cell sizes, cell concentrations, and concentration of matrix components...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a shaft arrangement for transferring torques acting about a rotation axis, having a <b>variably</b> <b>adjustable</b> torsional rigidity acting about the rotation axis, {{and to a}} method for changing the torsional rigidity of a shaft arrangement. The invention is characterized in that a first shaft section is provided, on which at least one torque transferring element is attached in a torsionally and axially fixed manner, wherein said element is designed and/or mounted in a dimensionally stable manner transversely {{with respect to the}} rotation axis, in that a second wave section is provided, which is axially separated from the first wave section, on which at least one torsion element is attached in a torsion resistant and axially movable manner, and in that a means is provided, which is operatively connected or can be brought into an operative connection with the second shaft section, by which means the second shaft section can be axially moved relative to the first shaft section and to the at least one torsion element...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for transmitting or decoupling mechanical vibrations, comprising a first component {{and a second}} component, which are connected to each other {{by means of a}} coupling element that has a <b>variably</b> <b>adjustable</b> stiffness in at least one direction of action in which at least one component is supported in a vibrating manner. The invention is characterized in that the coupling element is a planar element having a planar-element top side and a planar-element bottom side and a planar-element longitudinal extent, the planar element being dimensionally stable in the planar-element longitudinal extent and elastic lateral to the planar-element longitudinal extent, that n > 2 contacting agents are attached to the first component in a spatially fixed manner, by means of which contacting agents the first component contacts n > 2 first contact points at the planar-element bottom side and/or planar-element top side of the planar element, that n > 2 contacting agents are attached to the second component in a spatially fixed manner, by means of which contacting agents the second component contacts n > 2 second contact points at the planar-element bottom side and/or planar-element top side of the planar element, and that both components are arranged such as to be rotatable relative to each other about a spatial axis oriented orthogonally to the planar-element longitudinal extent, said spatial axis coinciding with the at least one direction of action in which at least one component is supported in a vibrating manner...|$|E

According to the updated guidelines, the greatest efficacy in cardiac massage is only achieved when the right compression point, an adequate compression depth, vertical pressure, the correct frequency, and equally long phases of compression and decompression are achieved. The very highest priority is placed on restoring continuous circulation. Against this background, standardized continuous chest compression with active decompression has contributed to a favorable outcome in this case. The hydraulically operated and <b>variably</b> <b>adjustable</b> automatic Lund University Cardiac Arrest System (LUCAS) device (Jolife, Lund, Sweden) undoubtedly meets these requirements. This case report describes a 44 -year-old patient who &ndash; approximately 15 min after the onset of clinical death due to apparent ventricular fibrillation &ndash; received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, initially by laypersons and then by the emergency medical team (manual chest compressions followed by situation-adjusted LUCAS compressions). Sinus rhythm was restored after more than 90 min of continuous resuscitation, with seven defibrillations. Interventional diagnostic workup did not reveal a causal morphological correlate for the condition on coronary angiography. After a 16 -day period of hospital convalescence, with preventive implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and several weeks of rehabilitation, the patient was able to return home with no evidence of health impairment.
