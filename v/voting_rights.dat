5|$|In 1892, Cleveland had campaigned {{against the}} Lodge Bill, {{which would have}} {{strengthened}} <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> protections through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The Enforcement Act of 1871 had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36). The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> to the repealing of <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> in Giles v. Harris, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and Giles v. Teasley, 193 U.S. 146 (1904).|$|E
5|$|To {{defeat the}} <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> Act, McCulloch {{introduced}} an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It {{would have allowed}} the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction, {{and it would have}} imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was co-sponsored by House Minority Leader Gerald Ford (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats {{as an alternative to the}} <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> Act. The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> Act. However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after William M. Tuck (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> Act would legitimately ensure that African Americans could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171-248 vote on July 9. Later that night, the House passed the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> Act by a 333-85 vote (Democrats 221-61, Republicans 112-24).|$|E
