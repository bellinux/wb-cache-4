25|$|A {{filing cabinet}} {{is a piece}} of office {{furniture}} usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15inches) of the cabinet. The <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> <b>cabinet</b> was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient record-keeping and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.|$|E

5000|$|The {{invention}} of the vertical file remains an unsolved mystery. The <b>Vertical</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Cabinet</b> section in the Early Office Museum website begins {{with a discussion of}} the erroneous conclusions by highly credentialed “secondary sources,” concerning the origin of vertical filing. The secondary sources claimed that a gold medal was presented at the World’s Fair of 1893 for a vertical file. The Early Office Museum found no evidence to substantiate those claims. However, the information presented in the Early Office Museum’s discussion of vertical filing cabinets suggests that the commercial introduction of vertical filing may have occurred in 1900 when a company named the Library Bureau (founded in 1876, later a division of Remington Rand) published a catalog that included a <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> <b>cabinet.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Library Bureau, early manufacturers of <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> included Globe-Wernicke, Yawman and Erbe Manufacturing Company, and the Art Metal Construction Company.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of commercial <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> businesses kept papers in envelopes in turn stored in arrays of pigeonholes often lining a wall. Finding and opening envelopes and unfolding papers was troublesome and inefficient. However, the concept of <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> was clearly practiced as early as 1895 when a U.S. patent(533053)was issued to W.A. Cooke, Jr. for A Receptacle for Letters or Other Papers.|$|R
50|$|In the US, these {{come in two}} sizes: for letter-size {{paper and}} legal-size paper. Most modern commercially {{oriented}} <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> in the US are manufactured in two-, three-, four-, and five-drawer versions in depths of 25, 26½, and 28 inches. The drawers are typically supported on a three-member suspension system that allows the drawer to be fully extended for complete access.|$|R
50|$|PIM is a {{new field}} with ancient roots. When the oral rather than the written word dominated, human memory was the primary means for {{information}} preservation. As information was increasingly rendered in paper form, tools were developed over time to meet the growing challenges of management. For example, the <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> <b>cabinet,</b> now such a standard feature of home and workplace offices, was first commercially available in 1893.|$|E
50|$|A <b>filing</b> <b>cabinet</b> (or {{sometimes}} <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> in American English) is a {{piece of}} office furniture usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple context, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. The two most common forms of <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> are <b>vertical</b> <b>files</b> and lateral <b>files.</b> A <b>vertical</b> <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15 inches) of the <b>cabinet.</b> A lateral <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> has drawers that extend from the long side (various lengths) of the cabinet. These are also called side filers in Great Britain. There are also shelf files, which go on shelves. In the United States, <b>file</b> <b>cabinets</b> are usually built to accommodate 8.5 × 11 paper, and in other countries, <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> are often designed to hold other sizes of paper, such as A4 paper.|$|R
5000|$|The drawers of most <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> are {{engineered}} to accept hanging file folders, as these {{have come to}} dominate the way most users store information. Some files still have a [...] "follower block" [...] in each drawer. This is a device that adjusts the apparent depth of the drawer interior so that files are kept upright in the drawer. These are the legacy {{of a time when}} most filing was done with manila folders rather than hanging files.|$|R
5000|$|Within the United States, {{the primary}} {{standard}} for <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> is the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA) Standard X5.3. [...] BIFMA used {{to maintain a}} separate Standard X5.2 for lateral <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> but that standard has been withdrawn. The standards provide requirements for cabinet stability, durability, and strength, among others. The General Services Administration (GSA) also maintains standards for vertical and lateral steel <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> A-A-3186and A-A-3187respectively. The GSA standards define two grades of <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets,</b> medium- and heavy-duty. They reference the BIFMA standard for the medium-duty cabinets, and provide additional performance requirements for the heavy-duty cabinets. The GSA is also responsible for maintaining the standards for <b>filing</b> <b>cabinets</b> and security containers for storing classified materials; more information on that subject {{may be found in}} the article on classified information in the United States.|$|R

By using a scanner to transform documents into electronic files, the self-organized <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> can index the documents on visual and textual information. The selforganized <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> helps the user find the documents at a later date. The focus of this thesis is on the design and evaluation of the self-organized <b>file</b> <b>cabinet.</b> User studies show that this tool is natural to use.

50|$|To use {{the example}} of a {{physical}} <b>file</b> <b>cabinet,</b> if the separate drawers in the <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> are represented as the highest level of sub-directories in the file system or system prompt, then the room the <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> is in may be represented as the root directory. That is, the other directories may be inside it, but the root directory cannot go in any other directories, at least in that file system. In most operating systems, files can be placed inside the root directory, as well as in its sub-directories. One may envision this as placing paper files anywhere in the room, or into any <b>file</b> <b>cabinet</b> within the room.|$|R
