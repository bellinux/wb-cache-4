At the time, he was an employee of Netscape Communications, which was developing an e-commerce application for MCI. Vint Cerf and John Klensin represented MCI in technical discussions with Netscape Communications. MCI did not want its servers to have to retain partial transaction states, which led them to ask Netscape {{to find a way to}} store that state in each user's computer instead. Cookies provided a solution to the problem of reliably implementing a <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>cart.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the site is its pricing scheme. Pricing adjustments are offered to encourage users to buy more items at once and to purchase items that {{are located in the}} same distribution center, thus making the purchases less expensive for the company to collect and ship. As users add items to their <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>cart,</b> they are encouraged to select additional items using pricing incentives. Pricing options are also offered during the check-out process, such as having the user opt out of the ability to return merchandise for free in exchange for a reduced price. Users are also offered a price incentive to use a debit card rather than a credit card for purchases.|$|E
5000|$|In marketing, {{abandonment}} rate {{is a term}} {{associated with}} the use of <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>carts.</b> Also known as [...] "shopping cart abandonment". Although shoppers in brick and mortar stores rarely abandon their <b>carts,</b> abandonment of <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> is quite common. Marketers can count how many of the <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> used in a specified period result in completed sales versus how many are abandoned. The abandonment rate is the ratio of the number of abandoned <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> to the number of initiated transactions or to the number of completed transactions. The typical <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> abandonment rate for online retailers varies between 60% and 80%, with an average of 67.91%.|$|R

50|$|In {{computer}} science, {{a session}} identifier, session ID or session token {{is a piece}} of data that is used in network communications (often over HTTP) to identify a session, a series of related message exchanges. Session identifiers become necessary in cases where the communications infrastructure uses a stateless protocol such as HTTP. For example, a buyer who visits a seller's site wants to collect a number of articles in a <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> and then finalize the shopping by going to the site's checkout page. This typically involves an ongoing communication where several webpages are requested by the client and sent back to them by the server. In such a situation, it is vital {{to keep track of the}} current state of the shopper's cart, and a session ID is one way to achieve that goal.|$|E

40|$|Part 16 : Mobile Phone ApplicationsInternational audienceWe present MoCoShoP, {{a system}} that {{supports}} the collaborative process of shopping and planning furniture and interior items. The system consists of a mobile application running on the users’ mobile phones and an interactive surface application deployed on shared planning desks in the furniture retail store environment. Users belonging together share a <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>cart.</b> By scanning labels attached to furniture items with their phones that are of interest, users can inspect item details (e. g., dimensions, available colors) with the mobile application and add items to their shopping cart. The shared planning desk allows users to collaboratively review collected items and create possible arrangements of items on a floor plan. Finally, users can store furniture arrangements for later inspection. In this work, we contribute the design and a prototype implementation of MoCoShoP. Results of a first evaluation indicate that users appreciate how they can collect and share data {{during the process of}} shopping and how it supports collaborative planning...|$|E
40|$|When {{thinking}} of users, {{it is possible}} to look at them from a variety of perspectives. One essential way of considering users within the human–technology environment involves technical concepts. In this manner, we define what users {{should be able to do}} with a particular technical system. As such, there are tasks to accomplish and goals to reach by means of some technology, and therefore specific operations must be carried out in order to reach those goals or fulfill those tasks. For example, if someone wishes to buy boots from an eShop, it is necessary to get onto the Internet, find the eShop, find the boots, load them into a <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>cart,</b> and follow the process to check out. Savvy online shoppers can do this quite effortlessly. This example provides a perspective on human–technology that can be called technical. This view simply defines what it is that people need to do technically to successfully accomplish whatever it is that they want to do. Within this perspective, people are considered a subsystem of a particular technical system—actually, one of several subsystems that work together to accomplish an intended goal. And, like all of the subsystems, the human element needs to be seriously considered in planning how the technology will work, thus making it a necessary component of human–technology interaction. This represents a traditiona...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{e-commerce}} applications {{on the web}} {{provide the}} users a relatively simple, browser-based interface to access available products. Customers are not provided with the same shopping experience as they would in an actual store or mall. This experience, however, {{can be achieved by}} the creation of a virtual shopping mall environment, simulating most of the actual shopping user interactions. The virtual mall brings together the services and products of various vendors. Users can navigate through the virtual shopping malls, adding items of interest into a <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>cart,</b> and perform searches assisted by 'intelligent agents'. A Collaborative Virtual Environment (CVE) can realize a sophisticated virtual shopping application. In such a CVE, a large number of potential users may interact with each other. In this paper, vCOM, a VRML and Java 3 D-based prototype is presented, which permits users to navigate around virtual e-commerce worlds and perform collaborative shopping and intelligent searches with the assistance of software agents, in order to find the products and services of interest to them. They can then negotiate with sales agents to bargain for the best possible price and then make a secure buying transaction. The virtual mall prototype also allows the user to communicate with an 'intelligent shopping assistant' using simple voice commands. This assistant interacts with the shopper using voice synthesis and helps him/her use the interface to efficiently navigate in the mall. Real-time interactions between the entities in this shared environment are implemented over the High Level Architecture (HLA), an IEEE standard for distributed simulations and modeling. The paper focuses on user interface design, collaborative e-commerce through HLA and multi-agent archit [...] ...|$|E

Current market implementations allow agents and Web visitors to talk via an online chat session or by a callback through the telephone network. Emerging technologies and products {{will provide the}} capability for having Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) conversations over the Internet. To research and evaluate these new technologies and products, Mitretek implemented an IP-based Call Center Laboratory. This paper describes the design and configuration of the laboratory and provides the results of initial testing of IP-based call center products. E-Commerce Customer Service The Internet’s explosive growth has provided corporations with a new delivery channel for both electronic commerce (e-commerce) and customer service. E-commerce transactions are expected to grow from $ 1 billion in 1997 to an estimated $ 1. 3 trillion worldwide by 2003. [1] Businesses have created Web sites as “click-andmortar” storefronts where Web visitors can browse through the store and purchase products using a <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>cart.</b> However, {{a significant portion of}} the populace is still reluctant to complete a transaction over the Web without first talking to a “live ” agent. A study of the top 25 e-commerce Web sites showed that 67 percent of the online shoppers abandoned their shopping cart prior to actually making a purchase. The primary reason given for this abandonment was the lack of real-time customer service on the Web site. [2] Another study, performed by Andersen Consulting during the 1999 holiday buying season, showed that 88 percent of Web shoppers abandoned their online shopping carts at some point during their gift buying. [3] The owners of these electronic stores are discovering that having the ability to provide personal help to their cyber shoppers is as important as it is in traditional “brick-andmortar” stores. In a study done by Yankelovich Partners, 63 percent of respondents said that they would not buy over the Internet until there is more human interaction. [4] To address these 83 concerns, corporations are linking their Web sites to call centers where large pools of trained agents are available to assist Web shoppers that need help in real time...|$|E
