50|$|A {{preceding}} organisation {{started out}} as the National Veterinary Association in 1882 after the first ever British National Veterinary Congress in July 1881. A vet, George Banham, had suggested {{the idea of a}} national veterinary association. George Fleming, the principal vet to the Armed Forces, was the first elected President. The Association was open to any <b>vet,</b> <b>no</b> matter which country they were from, on the payment of half a guinea. Other previous veterinary associations still co-existed though. It had an informal organisation and meetings across the country were arranged on an ad hoc basis. This style of organisation did not suit many vets, who wanted an organisation where they could discuss matters which did not or could not be discussed by the RCVS. In 1909 {{at a meeting of the}} Scottish Metropolitan Veterinary Association, Professor Orlando Charnock Bradley of the Edinburgh Veterinary College, called for a 'one single British veterinary association'. The idea was generally accepted, but the First World War stopped anything from happening.|$|E
40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) is a {{plant hormone}} {{involved}} in many developmental and physiological processes, but as <b>vet,</b> <b>no</b> ABA receptor has been identified. Flow cytometry of rice protoplasts and immunoblotting of purified plasma membranes (PMs) {{have been used}} to demonstrate that the monoclonal antibody JIM 19 recognizes carbohydrate epitopes of cell surface glycoproteins, Using surface plasmon resonance technology specific binding of PMs to JIM 19 was observed, Such interaction was antagonized significantly by ABA, but not by the biologically inactive ABA catabolite phaseic acid. These in vitro interactions were correlated with the biological activities of JIM 19, ABA and phaseic acid on activation of the ABA-inducible Em promoter using two different transient reporter gene assays, beta-glucuronidase/luciferase and quantitative flow cytometry of Aequoria in green fluorescent protein. Pre-treatment with JIM 19 resulted in significant inhibition of ABA-inducible gene expression. Taken together, these data suggest that JIM 19 interacts with a functional PM complex involved in ABA signalling. (C) 1999 Federation of European Biochemical Societies...|$|E

40|$|In simple {{words and}} {{with the aid of}} over 400 drawings, this major new work {{explains}} how to keep animals healthy in places where there is <b>no</b> <b>vet</b> or where veterinary services are not easily accessible. It deals with cattle, buffaloes, camels, horses, donkeys, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry, rabbits, and dogs. The book is an invaluable tool for livestock farmers, NGO and agricultural extension workers, vet assistants, and rural schoolteachers. It covers a wide range of problems from diarrhoea to rinderpest and various ways of treating them, from helpful traditional remedies to modern medicines and vaccines. It describes how to feed and handle animals, prevent and control infection, look for signs of disease, care for a sick animal, assist births, and deal with emergencies and simple operations. Included are sections on ways of using the book to train others and on diseases that people can acquire from animals. There is also a guide to helpful publications and organisations. This book will not only help readers realise what they can do for their animals, it will also help them recognise which problems need assistance from experienced vets or skilled workers. A veterinary practitioner, farmer, and writer, Bill Forse (see photo) visited various countries to research this book, and many people from Senegal to Uganda, and from Pakistan to the Philippines contributed advice and comments.

Sertoli cells, being {{an integral part of}} the seminiferous lobules underwent considerable changes, which influenced their cytomorphological features.

Lipid vacuoles of dif-ferent size were noticed in their cytoplasm, while the nuclei acquired a polymorphic appearance. In the seminiferous lobules with rare sperm residues Sertoli cells underwent further changes which caused their involution. The degenerative changes of Sertoli cells were manifested by an ex-treme vacuolisation, mitochondria with desintegrated crysts or mitochondria in degeneration (with widened crysts and thickened matrix), by desorganised endoplasmic reticulum, digestive vacuoles (autophagosomes), “myeline-like ” structures and lysed cytoplasmic regions. The above mentioned changes were followed by karyopyknosis, complete degeneration and delamination of cells from the wall of the seminiferous lobules, lysis and detritus formation (Sertoli necrotic material) in the lumen of the lobules.
