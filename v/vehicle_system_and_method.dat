On {{the basis of the}} in-situ dynamic response measurement, the deterministic data for vertical acceleration of rail were obtained. The problem of identifying the random vibration load of subway train was solved in Matlab, according to the simplified vibration model of <b>vehicle</b> <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> in Newmark-β <b>method.</b> Then the time curve and the amplitude spectrum curve of the vertical random vibration train load were obtained.

40|$|Airborne remote sensing, whether {{performed}} {{from conventional}} aerial survey platforms such as light aircraft {{or the more}} recent Remotely Piloted Airborne Systems (RPAS) {{has the ability to}} compliment mapping generated using earth-orbiting satellites, particularly for areas that may experience prolonged cloud cover. Traditional aerial platforms are costly but capture spectral resolution imagery over large areas. RPAS are relatively low-cost, and provide very-high resolution imagery but this is limited to small areas. We believe that we are the first group to retrofit these new, low-cost, lightweight sensors in a traditional aircraft. Unlike RPAS surveys which have a limited payload, {{this is the first time}} that a method has been designed to operate four distinct RPAS sensors simultaneously—hyperspectral, thermal, hyper, RGB, video. This means that imagery covering a broad range of the spectrum captured during a single survey, through different imaging capture techniques (frame, pushbroom, video) can be applied to investigate different multiple aspects of the surrounding environment such as, soil moisture, vegetation vitality, topography or drainage, etc. In this paper, we present the initial results validating our innovative hybrid system adapting dedicated RPAS sensors for a light aircraft sensor pod, thereby providing the benefits of both methodologies. Simultaneous image capture with a Nikon D 800 E SLR and a series of dedicated RPAS sensors, including a FLIR thermal imager, a four-band multispectral camera and a 100 -band hyperspectral imager was enabled by integration in a single sensor pod operating from a Cessna c 172. However, to enable accurate sensor fusion for image analysis, each sensor must first be combined in a common <b>vehicle</b> coordinate <b>system</b> <b>and</b> a <b>method</b> for triggering, time-stamping and calculating the position/pose of each sensor at the time of image capture devised. Initial tests were carried out over agricultural regions with geometric tests designed to assess the spatial accuracy of the fused imagery in terms of its absolute and relative accuracy. The results demonstrate that by using our innovative system, images captured simultaneously by the four sensors could be geometrically corrected successfully and then co-registered and fused exhibiting a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of approximately 10 m independent of inertial measurements and ground control...|$|R

Based on the Matlab/Simulink, establish the dynamic simulation <b>system</b> of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> for overturning prevention for the Chery A 3 car. Using the brake / drive integrated ESP control principle, based on the simulation model, respectively simulate and analyze the ESP control performances of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> for overturning prevention on different simulation conditions. The study results indicate that when there is no ESP control or ESP control <b>system</b> failure, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> for overturning prevention can simulate the ESP control performances of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> effectively, the ESP control performances of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> for overturning prevention have remarkable consistency.

Fifty-four technology requirements were identified which are judged to be unigue, or particularly critical, to very large aircraft. The requirements were about equally divided among the four general areas of aerodynamics, propulsion and acoustics, structures, <b>and</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> operations. The state of technology readiness was judged to be poor to fair for slightly more than one-half of the requirements.
