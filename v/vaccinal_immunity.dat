40|$|The {{effect of}} {{infection}} with low-virulence, tissue culture-propagated strains of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) on protective <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity</b> against Marek's disease (MD) lymphomas was investigated. Vaccinated chickens inoculated at hatching with greater than 10 (4) focus-forming units of REV and challenged with MD virus were poorly protected against MD lesion development {{as indicated by}} protective indices of 53 to 79 % for strain CS (P less than 0. 05) and 42 to 49 % for strain T (P less than 0. 01) compared to 78 to 100 % for REV-free controls. Furthermore, the response of blood lymphocytes to mitogen stimulation and the antibody response to sheep erythrocytes and Brucella abortus were less in REV-inoculated chickens than in controls. The REV-induced depression of immune responses was more severe in chickens infected with mildly pathogenic strain T than in chickens infected with the apathogenic strain CS and was generally transient with both virus strains. Little or no depression of immune responses was observed in chickens inoculated with less than 10 (3) focus-forming units of REV. These studies extend knowledge on the immunodepressive ability of low-virulence REV strains and establish that infection with these viruses depresses certain parameters of MD <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity,</b> an important model for cellular immunity against virus-induced neoplasia in the chicken...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT-In {{an attempt}} to {{elucidate}} mechanisms of <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity</b> in Marek's disease (MO), two nonprotective variants of MO vaccine viruses were compared with their counterpart protec-tive viruses. The variant viruses were 2000, an MO virus stock passaged over 200 times in duck embryo fibroblast cultures, and HVT/hub, a stock of turkey herpesvirus passed over 70 times in chicken embryo fibroblast cultures. At doses up to 1. 4 x 10 · plaque-forming units, the viruses were partly (HVT/hub) or totally (2000) deficient in their abilities to protect chickens against MO. Simi-larly, they were partly (HVT/hub) or totally (2000) deficient in their abilities to replicate in vivo as measured by virus reisolation and antibody assays; however, both viruses replicated well in vitro. Attempts were unsuccessful to implicate host range mutation, temperature sensitivity, or autointerference {{as the basis for}} the defective in vivo replication.

Likewise, higher levels of virus-specific CTLs were also observed in transiently viraemic cats which recovered following exposure to FeLV. In cats that controlled their infection, recognition of Gag/Pro antigens was significantly higher than the recognition of Env antigens. This is the first report highlighting the very significant role that virus-specific CTL have in determining the outcome of FeLV infection in either vaccinated cats or cats recovering naturally from FeLV exposure...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for vaccines {{to act as}} triggers of autoimmune reactions has received much recent attention. Such an association is very poorly defined mechanistically, but may potentially involve epitope mimicry between vaccinal and self antigen, or the immuno-stimulatory effects of vaccine adjuvant. If such reactions occur, {{they are more likely}} to involve adults than infants in early life, as a reflection of the immunological immaturity of the newborn. There has been a recent focus in immunology on the link between innate and adaptive immunity provided by dendritic cells and the range of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are the point of first contact of these cells with microbial antigen. These interactions appear to determine the nature of the subsequent adaptive immune response and whether it may be mediated by Th 1, Th 2, Th 17 or T regulatory populations. TLR interactions may also be significant in the induction of <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity</b> and agonists of these receptors are being developed as potential vaccine adjuvants. There are differences in cytokine production of adult and newborn dendritic cells, and these differences must be considered in the application of such novel adjuvants to products intended for either age group.

40|$|Immune serum {{injected}} into mice before a footpad challenge of virulent strain Brucella abortus 544 can prevent dissemination of infection to the spleen. Sera from mice infected with Brucella {{for at least}} 2 months or from mice vaccinated with a protein-bound cell wall peptidoglycan Brucella fraction completely stopped dissemination. Brucella lipopolysaccharide and polysaccharide cross-reacting Yersinia immune sera reduced dissemination. Both peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide immune sera injected simultaneously with an intravenous challenge caused a shift in Brucella from spleen to liver. When immune sera were injected simultaneously with an intravenous challenge, the kinetics of splenic infection showed two effects: an early one, optimally measured at day 7 postchallenge, showed reduced numbers in the spleen due to the shift of Brucella to the liver; a late effect, measured at day 21 postchallenge, showed reduced numbers in spleen and liver with nearly complete clearance by day 49 postchallenge. Brucella lipopolysaccharide and cross-reacting bacterial antisera induced the early effect only, whereas peptidoglycan and infected mouse sera induced both effects. When peptidoglycan immune serum was injected 2 or 7 days after intravenous challenge, the late effect was somewhat reduced. Hence, immune sera to protein and polysaccharide surface antigens can (i) prevent dissemination of systemic infection and (ii) help destroy intercellular bacteria (protein antigen only).

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that cats can be {{protected}} against infection with the prototypic Petaluma strain of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIVPET) using vaccines based on either inactivated virus particles or replication-defective proviral DNA. However, the utility of such vaccines in the field is uncertain, given the absence of consistent protection against antigenically distinct strains and the concern that the Petaluma strain may be an unrepresentative, attenuated isolate. Since reduction of viral pathogenicity and dissemination may be useful outcomes of vaccination, {{even in the absence of}} complete protection, we tested whether either of these vaccine strategies ameliorates the early course of infection following challenge with heterologous and more virulent isolates. We now report that an inactivated virus vaccine, which generates high levels of virus neutralizing antibodies, confers reduced virus loads following challenge with two heterologous isolates, FIVAM 6 and FIVGL 8. This vaccine also prevented the marked early decline in CD 4 /CD 8 ratio seen in FIVGL 8 -infected cats. In contrast, DNA vaccines based on either FIVPET or FIVGL 8, which induce cell-mediated responses but no detectable antiviral antibodies, protected a fraction of cats against infection with FIVPET but had no measurable effect on virus load when the infecting virus was FIVGL 8. These results indicate that the more virulent FIVGL 8 is intrinsically more resistant to <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity</b> than the FIVPET strain and that a broad spectrum of responses which includes virus neutralizing antibodies is a desirable goal for lentivirus vaccine development...|$|E
40|$|Objective. - The authors had for aim {{to assess}} the {{prevalence}} of hepatitis B co-infection in a cohort of HIV-infected patients, routinely followed-up at the Day Care Unit of the Bobo Dioulasso Sanou Souro University Hospital, Burkina Faso.

Results. - The AgHBs prevalence was 12. 7 % [CI at 95 %; 10. 7 - 15. 0 %] and men were slightly {{more likely to be}} positive for AgHBs than women (16. 5 % [12. 0 - 21. 9 %] versus 11. 6 % [9. 4 - 14. 1 %]; P = 0. 047); 83. 3 % of the patients [80. 8 - 85. 6 %] were positive for hepatitis B core antibody, and 32. 6 % [29. 7 - 35. 6 %] for hepatitis B surface antibody; 29. 9 % of the patients [27. 1 - 32. 8 %] had a complete profile of former hepatitis B infection, 41. 3 % [38. 2 - 44. 4 %] expressed core antibodies only; 13. 8 % [11. 7 - 16. 0 %] had a negative serological test, and 2. 3 % [1. 5 - 3. 4 %] presented a <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity.</b> Conclusion. - These results stress the usefulness of screening for hepatitis B in all HIV-infected patients, along with the initial biological tests. This would help adapt HIV treatment to co-infected patients and to build an expanded program of vaccination for non-immune patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{has been}} concern that variola virus might be held clandestinely elsewhere. Through {{constructing}} mathematical model {{based on the}} detailed epidemiologic data, we focused on simulating the various possible scenarios arising from a bioterrorist attack whereby smallpox virus was introduced into Japan, and sought to develop {{the most effective way}} of nationwide vaccination policy based on the theory of residual immunity. Method: The analysis is based on a deterministic mathematical model which predicted the epidemiologic outcome while simultaneously evaluating the effect of any specified control strategy of the smallpox epidemic. To clarify the required amount of vaccines, we performed mathematical analysis for hypothetical population to acquire herd immunity based on long-lasting <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity.</b> Results: It is demonstrated that the crude size of the potential epidemic could be greatly affected by possible level of residual immunity. The results also suggest the possibility to develop optimal distribution of nationwide vaccination according to the immune status. The prevalence at 50 th day among population without immunity in our simulation would be approximately 405 times greater than expected population with residual immunity, and required amount of vaccines for equal distribution would be 3. 13 times more than optimal distribution. Conlusion: The mathematical model formulated could determine the vaccination priority based on the real status of immunity which required much less amount of vaccinations than would be calculated using an equal distribution program. It is therefore crucial to determine the real immunity status of the population via epiderniologic studies. Copyright © 2005 by Japan Epidemiological Association. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMarek’s disease (MD) is a {{lymphotropic}} and oncogenic {{disease of}} chickens {{that can lead}} to death in susceptible and unvaccinated host birds. The causative pathogen, MD virus (MDV), a highly oncogenic alphaherpesvirus, integrates into host genome near the telomeres. MD occurrence is controlled across the globe by biosecurity, selective breeding for enhanced MD genetic resistance, and widespread vaccination of flocks using attenuated serotype 1 MDV or other serotypes. Despite over 40 years of usage, the specific mechanism(s) of MD vaccine-related immunity and anti-tumor effects are not known. Here we investigated the cytogenetic interactions of commonly used MD vaccine strains of all three serotypes (HVT, SB- 1, and Rispens) with the host to determine if all were equally capable of host genome integration. We also studied the dynamic profiles of chromosomal association and integration of the three vaccine strains, a first for MD vaccine research. Our cytogenetic data provide evidence that all three MD vaccine strains tested integrate in the chicken host genome as early as 1 day after vaccination similar to oncogenic strains. However, a specific, transformation-associated virus-host phenotype observed for oncogenic viruses is not established. Our results collectively provide an updated model of MD vaccine-host genome interaction and an improved understanding of the possible mechanisms of <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity.</b> Physical integration of the oncogenic MDV genome into host chromosomes along with cessation of viral replication appears to have joint signification in MDV’s ability to induce oncogenic transformation. Whereas for MD vaccine serotypes, a sustained viral replication stage and lack of the chromosome-integrated only stage were shared traits during early infection...|$|E
40|$|In case of mycobacterial {{infection}} the granulomatous infiltration foci contain the {{significant amount of}} mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which functional phenotype and respective function in anti-tuberculosis immune defense remain unknown. Goal of the study: to characterize the MSC phenotype, formed by their interaction with BCG of M. bovis and to evaluate the changes in this phenotype caused {{by the action of}} inhibitors and stimulants of immune regulatory action. Materials and methods: MSC retrieved from bone marrow of mice were cultured with the presence and absence of BCG of M. bovis and/or poludanum TLR 3 agonist; and the effect of two latter on the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines was evaluated by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. Flow cytometry and radioactive testing were used to evaluate the impact of cultured BCG fluid and poludanum-conditioned MSC on the proliferative and apoptotic activity of splenocytes. The inhibitors of indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO), cyclooxygenase- 2 (COG- 2) or NO synthase were added to certain cultures alone with BCG and poludanum, and the contributions of IDO, COG- 2 and NO to BCG and poludanum-induced response were assessed. Results. Pro-inflammatory polarization of MSC under the action of BCG and poludanum was demonstrated. Pro-inflammatory MSC phenotype correlated to their anti-apoptogenic and growth-stimulating actions on the splenocytes. It was demonstrated that IDO and NO restrained BCG-induced polarization and conversely COG- 2 promoted BCG-induced pro-inflammatory polarization of MSC. Conclusions. 1. MSC actively participate in the formation of immunologic anti-mycobacterial resistance. 2. Targeted regulation of IDO and NO production can be feasibly applied for formation of anti-tuberculous <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity</b> and control {{mycobacterial infection}}.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of an effective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus {{is considered to be}} the most practicable means of controlling the advancing global AIDS epidemic. Studies with the domestic cat have demonstrated that <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity</b> to infection can be induced against feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV); however, protection is largely restricted to laboratory strains of FIV and does not extend to primary strains of the virus. We compared the pathogenicity of two prototypic vaccine challenge strains of FIV derived from molecular clones; the laboratory strain PET F 14 and the primary strain GL 8 414. PET F 14 established a low viral load and had no effect on CD 4 + - or CD 8 + - lymphocyte subsets. In contrast, GL 8 414 established a high viral load and induced a significant reduction in the ratio of CD 4 + to CD 8 + lymphocytes by 15 weeks postinfection, suggesting that PET F 14 may be a low-virulence-challenge virus. However, during long-term monitoring of the PET F 14 -infected cats, we observed the emergence of variant viruses in two of three cats. Concomitant with the appearance of the variant viruses, designated 627 W 135 and 628 W 135, we observed an expansion of CD 8 + -lymphocyte subpopulations expressing reduced CD 8 ß-chain, a phenotype consistent with activation. The variant viruses both carried mutations that reduced the net charge of the V 3 loop (K 409 Q and K 409 E), giving rise to a reduced ability of the Env proteins to both induce fusion and to establish productive infection in CXCR 4 -expressing cells. Further, following subsequent challenge of naïve cats with the mutant viruses, the viruses established higher viral loads and induced more marked alterations in CD 8 + -lymphocyte subpopulations than did the parent F 14 strain of virus, suggesting that the E 409 K mutation in the PET F 14 strain contributes to the attenuation of the virus...|$|E
40|$|A hepatite B se caracteriza como problema de saúde pública no âmbito mundial. Profissionais de saúde e de segurança pública, como os Policiais Rodoviários Federais, são uns dos grupos de maior risco para a infecção, uma vez que o contato direto com sangue e fluidos corporais são formas de transmissão da mesma. Estudos com a população em questão se mostram escassos no país e no estado de Mato Grosso do Sul, ainda que as características de seu trabalho a torne mais suscetível à infecção. Este estudo de corte {{transversal}} com abordagem quantitativa teve por objetivo caracterizar a infecção pelo vírus da hepatite B e a imunidade vacinal em Policiais Rodoviários Federais do município de Campo Grande - MS e foi realizado no ano de 2015 com 118 policiais lotados na Superintendência e na 1 º Delegacia da Polícia Rodoviária Federal do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul, por meio de entrevista estruturada e coleta sanguínea, com posterior realização de testes sorológicos em laboratório. Para a análise estatística, foram utilizados os testes Qui-quadrado, Qui-quadrado de tendência e Teste Exato de Fisher, e calculadas as razões de prevalência, com intervalo de confiança de 95 %. Para estimar as razões de prevalência ajustadas foi utilizada a Regressão de Cox (com tempo igual a uma unidade), utilizando as variáveis com significância ≤ que 20 %. A faixa etária predominante foi de 36 a 45 anos (46, 6 %), 83, 9 % eram do sexo masculino e 89 % possuía ensino superior. A prevalência global da infecção pelo HBV foi de 7, 6 % (2, 8 % a 12, 4 % IC 95 %). Não foi encontrada positividade para o HBsAg. A presença do marcador anti-HBc total isolado foi encontrada em 0, 8 % (0, 3 % a 1, 4 % IC 95 %) e o anti-HBc total associado ao anti-HBs em 6, 8 % (2, 2 % a 11, 3 % IC 95 %). Observou-se que 46, 6 % (37, 6 % a 55, 6 % IC 95 %) apresentou anti-HBs isolado, indicando imunidade vacinal e a taxa de indivíduos suscetíveis foi de 45, 8 % (36, 8 % a 54, 8 %). Acidentes de trabalho com material biológico se mostraram presentes em 24, 6 % dos casos, sendo que o tabagismo e a realização de outra atividade remunerada apresentaram associação estatística significativa em relação à ocorrência dos mesmos. Os resultados mostraram taxa de infecção pelo HBV nos policiais semelhante à população em geral, contudo os mesmos se encontram em risco constante de adquirir a infecção devido à exposição ocupacional, principalmente pela não utilização de EPI. Baixa taxa de vacinação contra a hepatite B e elevado índice de suscetibilidade também foram encontrados. Evidencia-se assim, a necessidade de estratégias mais eficazes de promoção e prevenção e de adequado fluxo pós-exposição ocupacional. ABSTRACT - Hepatitis B {{is characterized}} {{as a public health}} problem worldwide. Health workers and public security, as the Federal Highway Police, are one of the highest risk groups for infection, since the direct contact with blood and body fluids are its forms of transmission. Studies arround the population in question are scarce in the country and in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, although the characteristics of their work makes they to be more susceptible to infection. This study of cross-sectional cohort with a quantitative approach aimed to characterize the infection by hepatitis B virus and the <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity</b> in Federal Highway Officers of Campo Grande - MS and was conducted in 2015 with 118 police officers of the Superintendency and at the 1 st Federal Highway Police Station of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, through structured interviews and blood collection, with subsequent serological tests in the laboratory. For statistical analysis, were used chi-square tests, chi-square of trend and Fisher's Exact test, and was calculated prevalence ratios with 95 % confidence interval. To estimate the reasons adjusted prevalence was used Cox Regression (with period equal to one unit) using the significance variables ≤ 20 %. The predominant age group was 36 - 45 years (46. 6 %), 83. 9 % were male and 89 % had higher education. The overall prevalence of HBV infection was 7. 6 % (2. 8 % to 12. 4 %; CI 95 %). Was not founded positive for HBsAg. The presence of anti-HBc isolated marker was found in 0. 8 % (0. 3 % to 1. 4 % CI 95 %) and the anti-HBc associated with the Anti-HBs in 6. 8 % (2. 2 % to 11. 3 % CI 95 %). It was observed that 46. 6 % (37. 6 % to 55. 6 % CI 95 %) showed a isolate anti-HBs, indicating <b>vaccinal</b> <b>immunity</b> and the rate of susceptible individuals was 45. 8 % (36. 8 % to 54, 8 %). Work accidents with biological material was showed present in 24. 6 % of the cases, and still, the cigarette smoking and performing other gainful activity showed statistically significant association in relation to the occurrence thereof. The results showed rates of HBV infection in police officers similar to the general population, however they were at constant risk of acquiring infection due to occupational exposure, mainly by not using IPE. Low rate of vaccination against hepatitis B and high susceptibility index were also found.
