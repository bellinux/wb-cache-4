5000|$|A {{daggerboard}} is {{a removable}} <b>vertical</b> <b>keel</b> that is inserted through a [...] "trunk" [...] {{in the center}} of a vessel's hull, usually amidships. Daggerboards are usually found in small sailing craft such as day sailers, which are easily handled by a single person. Daggerboards are not usually ballasted but are locked in place by a clip or pin. Unlike a centreboard, which can be set at different angles to the hull of the boat, daggerboards are generally limited to a single perpendicular position relative to the hull. If a daggerboard is located off center, it is called a leeboard or a bilgeboard.|$|E
5000|$|At frame 18 the <b>vertical</b> <b>keel</b> {{is broken}} {{in two and}} the flat keel is bent at an angle similar to the angle formed by the outside bottom plating. ... In {{the opinion of the}} court, this effect could have been {{produced}} only by the explosion of a mine situated under the bottom of the ship at about frame 18, and somewhat on the port side of the ship." [...] (part of the court's 5th finding)"In the opinion of the court, the Maine was destroyed by the explosion of a submarine mine, which caused the partial explosion of two or more of her forward magazines." [...] (the court's 7th finding) and"The court has been unable to obtain evidence fixing the responsibility for the destruction of the Maine upon any person or persons." [...] (the court's 8th finding).|$|E
5000|$|This genus {{has been}} {{strongly}} suggested {{to be put}} under taxonomic review. It was originally declared its own genus because of its distinct combination of characteristics. Namely, it had premaxillary teeth which did not extend {{to the level of}} the posterior nasal apertures. It had [...] vomerine teeth which were organized in rows of compact semicircles and were separated from the palatine teeth by a gap. The eye was not visible externally, instead covered by thick bone. There were small tentacles which, in comparison to other caecillians of similar size, were much closer to the mouth. Lastly, the specimen has a weak <b>vertical</b> <b>keel</b> on the terminal part of the body. However, the finding of the second species, B. guarantanus, has redefined the genus characteristics. Now, the genus is described as diminutive caecilian, being no more than 305 mm in length.|$|E
40|$|The design, {{instrumentation}} {{and analysis}} techniques for bottom slamming experiments developed in IMD have been described. The measurements include <b>vertical</b> bow force, <b>keel</b> pressure, relative motion and rigid body motion. The results demonstrate viability {{and some of}} the limitations of these techniques. Possible areas of improvement for future research have been recommended. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} first {{focuses on}} modelling the flow around cantilever plates in normal oscillation, providing key guidance for attaining sufficient accuracy for most engineering applications, {{in terms of}} turbulence modelling, mesh refinement and time step selection. The modelling approach is then applied to the hydrodynamics of a ship-like section fitted with <b>vertical</b> bilge <b>keels,</b> rolling at free surface. The results obtained from RANS are compared to available experimental data and predictions obtained from potential flow analysis. Viscous effects arising from {{the presence of the}} bilge keels are shown to influence more hydrodynamic coefficients than just roll fluid damping. Finally, empirical formulae commonly used to allow for the influence of viscous roll damping are compared to RANS predictions and experimental data...|$|R
50|$|Shells of Cleviceras show {{dimorphism}} {{in their}} size. While microconchs reach 16-62 mm in diameter, macroconchs shells width is 85-200 mm. They are moderately involute, compressed and have flat whorl sides. Umbilical walls can be sloping, <b>vertical,</b> or undercut. <b>Keel</b> {{is strong and}} floored, but in abnormal specimens might be missing. This kind of abnormality {{has been described as}} invalid genus Monestieria. Under this name were added not only specimens of Cleviceras, but also members of genera Protogrammoceras and Harpoceras. Ribs are falcoid and in small sizes of shell are bifurcating, later they are single. On the outer part of whorl, they are broad and flat. In adults, ribs become striate. There are no tubercules.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hull of the}} destroyer, {{like all}} ships in those days, was riveted. The {{greatest}} length is 92.75 m and width 9.07 m. Index extension was (L:B) = 10,23 (higher index ratio of length to width of the shell shows its degree of longitudinal flexibility). This allowed destroyers to withstand severe wave activity (five-meter wavelength of 100 meters). It also provided vysokohnuchkoyu steel (with a time fracture resistance of 55 kg / mm 2 [...] ).Strength and flexibility provided hull {{of a set of}} longitudinal and transverse ribs. Calculation of the frames was carried out from the stern to the bow of the ship. The main feature of the design of the shell was the use of a set of longitudinal ribs (41 - 139 units) in the boiler and engine room. The body is composed of 8-mm vertical stakes height 1050 mm, with double steel angles at the upper and lower edges, two dnyschevyh and other airborne stringer on each side, and one carling (350 × 1-1,5 mm [...] ) on each side.The whole design with 4 mm steel deck of the second floor and upper deck with longitudinal septa, 6-9 millimeter siding and 11.5 mm deck Stringer, were sufficiently strong and rigid structure, which was opposed longitudinal bending moment at different operating conditions.Since the construction of the ship included a double bottom mizhdonnyy space divided flora (peredilkamy) into compartments where fuel is stored. For machine and boiler compartment <b>vertical</b> <b>keel</b> gradually declined and proceeded to a vertical stem shaped and molded sternpost.Cross set consisting of frames (double angles 6 mm interconnected cakes - 4.5 mm sheets) and Bims upper and residential decks (5 mm angles). Nine metal main transverse bulkheads provided unsinkability ship.|$|E

40|$|A new {{arboreal}} {{species of}} Rhinella tentatively {{assigned to the}} veraguensis Group is described from the National Park Yanachaga Chemillen at 2600 m elevation in central Peru (Departamento de Pasco). The new species {{is characterized by a}} maximum snout-vent length of 45. 7 mm, a moderate body with relatively long and slim extremities, a dorsum with small tubercles and enlarged tubercles on legs, a distinct tympanum, distinct <b>vertical</b> <b>keel</b> on snout, weak orbitotympanic and postorbital crests, weakly defined row of dorsolateral tubercles, and males with vocal slits, nuptial pads, hypertrophied arms, and a protuberant, ventrally oriented cloaca. The new species is compared {{with other members of the}} veraguensis Group and is considered most similar to arboreal R. Iacona from northern Bolivia. The skull of the new species is described and compared to other members of the veraguensis Group. Tadpole and call of the new species remain unknown...|$|E
40|$|A 38 kHz {{split beam}} survey {{transducer}} has been {{mounted on the}} tip of a 4 m <b>vertical</b> protrusile stabilizing <b>keel</b> of the United States NOAA fishery research vessel R/V Miller Freeman. Air blocking problems, generally observable on all hull mounted transducers, were reduced substantially, and excellent acoustic conditions were achieved with the new mounting for wind speeds up to 35 knots (19 m/s). The improvements are demonstrated through comparative, sequential echo integration of the air close to the transducer with the keel in retracted and extended positions, and through echo recordings on fish. Empirical functions for residual air bubble corrections of echo integration data will presumably work well up to wind speeds where target identification by trawl is problematic because of safety...|$|R
50|$|There are {{disadvantages}} {{to using}} high-density ballast. The {{first is the}} increased mass of the boat; a heavier boat sits lower in the water, increasing drag when it moves, and is generally less responsive to steering. A heavier boat is also more difficult {{to put on a}} trailer and tow behind an automobile. Secondly, since the ballast needs to be as low as possible, it is often placed into a centerboard or retracting keel, requiring a heavy-duty crank to lift the massive foil. The simplest solution is to use a fixed ballasted keel, but that makes the boat nearly incapable of sailing in very shallow water, and more difficult to handle when out of the water. While prohibited by most class racing rules, some cutting-edge boats use a bulb of ballast on a long, thin keel that can tilt from side to side to create a canting keel. This lets the ballast be placed on the windward side, providing a far greater righting moment with a lower angle of heel. Tilting the keel, however, greatly reduces its lift, so canting keels are usually combined with a retractable centerboard or daggerboard that is deployed when the keel is tilted, and retracted (to reduce drag) when the keel is returned to the <b>vertical.</b> Some canting <b>keels</b> are designed so that when fully extended to either side they have an angle of attack of about 5° allowing the hydrofoil effect of the blade to lift the boat up and reduce wetted surface area for an increase in boat speed.|$|R
