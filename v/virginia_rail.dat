5|$|There is an {{herbaceous}} wetland along Abrahams Creek just upstream {{of where}} it enters Frances Slocum Lake. Further to the north, there is a flooded forested wetland. The creek has a substantial riparian buffer upstream of Frances Slocum Lake. The plant species Carex disperma inhabits the area. Bird species such as <b>Virginia</b> <b>rail</b> and Sora inhabit the area as well.|$|E
5|$|The cool, damp habitat {{provided}} by the bogs at Black Moshannon State Park provides a home for some birds {{that are at the}} southern limit of their habitat in central Pennsylvania. The Canada warbler and northern waterthrush nest in the bogs, as do the alder flycatcher, common yellowthroat, swamp sparrow, red-winged blackbird, and gray catbird. The olive-sided flycatcher, which is designated as locally extinct in Pennsylvania, has been seen during the breeding season at Black Moshannon State Natural Area. Bird watchers have observed nesting barred owls in the IBA, as well as <b>Virginia</b> <b>rail</b> and sora.|$|E
25|$|Temperature {{may also}} {{influence}} sora abundance. In Colorado, average April temperature was significantly (p<0.01) negatively correlated (r= -0.94) with sora abundance.

50|$|In the summer, orioles and prairie warblers can be heard. Butterflies {{are brought}} to the lake by the {{blooming}} of milkweed and dogbanes in the summer. <b>Virginia</b> <b>rails</b> and king rails can be spotted here, especially in the marsh and swampy areas of the lake.|$|R
50|$|Benicia SRA {{has been}} {{designated}} an Important Bird Area, providing habitat for endangered California clapper rails (Rallus longirostris obsoletus) and black rails (Laterallus jamaicensis). Other uncommon species include <b>Virginia</b> <b>rails</b> (Rallus limicola), Suisun song sparrows (Melospiza melodia maxillaris) and salt marsh common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas sinuosa). On their journey along the Pacific Flyway, many waterfowl winter in the park.|$|R
50|$|The {{wetlands}} also attract numerous marsh, shore, {{and water}} birds. Sora and <b>Virginia</b> <b>rails</b> are numerous but seldom seen.

50|$|Through the {{lobbying}} {{of public interest}} groups, actions were initiated to restore Maplewood Flats back to its natural state. Landscape architect Patrick Mooney, designed all the major enhancement projects for Maplewood Flats, including the freshwater marsh. The projects were installed from 1995 to 2004. In 1997, the system was dedicated {{and is now a}} breeding ground for marsh wrens, common yellowthroats, wood ducks, American coots, blue-winged teal, red-winged blackbirds, pied-billed grebes, soras and <b>virginia</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} bird species {{occur at the}} Bucknell Preserve along Chillisquaque Creek. These include marsh wrens and soras. <b>Virginia</b> <b>rails</b> were {{observed}} at the site in 1980 and 1984, though {{it is likely that}} they still remain there. Additionally, several mussel species that require high levels of water quality to survive have been observed in the creek. In the Montour County reach of the watershed of Chillisquaque Creek, livestock is commonly allowed access to streams.|$|R
500|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon hunts most often {{at dawn and}} dusk, when prey are most active, but also nocturnally in cities, particularly during migration periods when hunting at night may become prevalent. Nocturnal migrants taken by peregrines include species as diverse as yellow-billed cuckoo, black-necked grebe, <b>virginia</b> <b>rail,</b> and common quail. The peregrine requires open space in order to hunt, and therefore often hunts over open water, marshes, valleys, fields, and tundra, searching for prey either from a high perch or from the air. Large congregations of migrants, especially species that gather in the open like shorebirds, can be quite attractive to hunting peregrines. Once prey is spotted, it begins its stoop, folding back the tail and wings, with feet tucked. Prey is typically struck and captured in mid-air; the {{peregrine falcon}} strikes its prey with a clenched foot, stunning or killing it with the impact, then turns to catch it in mid-air. If its prey is too heavy to carry, a peregrine will drop {{it to the ground}} and eat it there. If they miss the initial strike, peregrines will chase their prey in a twisting flight. Although previously thought rare, several cases of peregrines contour-hunting, i.e. using natural contours to surprise and ambush prey on the ground, have been reported and even rare cases of prey being pursued on foot. In addition, peregrines have been documented preying on chicks in nests, from birds such as kittiwakes. Prey is plucked before consumption. [...] A recent study showed the presence of peregrines benefits non-preferred species {{while at the same time}} causing a decline in its preferred prey.|$|E

[...] Other water-dependent birds found at the reservoir include sandhill crane, great blue heron, black-crowned night heron, American bittern, snowy egret, American white pelican, American avocet, long-billed curlew, willet, <b>Virginia</b> <b>rail,</b> spotted sandpiper, and common snipe.|$|E

In addition, Leach's storm-petrels have been confirmed nesting on the Island since 2002 (one of only two sites where this species nests in Massachusetts). During the fall migration, numerous species of raptors (such as peregrine falcons and Cooper's hawks) and neotropical migrants use the island as feeding and resting habitat.|$|R
