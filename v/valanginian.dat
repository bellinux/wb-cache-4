5|$|I. hollingtoniensis (also spelled I. hollingtonensis), {{described}} by Lydekker in 1889, has variously {{been considered a}} synonym of Hypselospinus fittoni or a distinct species assigned to the genus Huxleysaurus. A specimen from the <b>Valanginian</b> Wadhurst Clay Formation, variously assigned to I. hollingtoniensis and I. mantelli over the years, has an unusual combination of hadrosaurid-like lower jaw and very robust forelimb; Norman (2010) assigned this specimen to the species Hypselospinus fittoni, while Paul (2012) made it the holotype of a separate species Darwinsaurus evolutionis.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a corner}} of the Jydegaard Formation is exposed today; the {{remainder}} is overgrown. Jydegaard is part of the Nyker Group, which includes three formations (Rabekke, Robbedale and Jydegaard) ranging from the Berriasian to the <b>Valanginian</b> ages of the Early Cretaceous. Jydegaard consists of sediments deposited in a fresh-to-brackish lagoon facing a coastal strip. In addition to Dromaeosauroides and a possible titanosaur, remains of hybodont sharks, fish such as Lepidotes and Pleuropholis, turtles, lizards, the crocodile Pholidosaurus and thin bone fragments from birds or pterosaurs have been found in the deposit. The bivalve Neomiodon is found in abundance in the sediments below (the Neomiodon Bed), indicating mass mortality, perhaps due to dinoflagellate toxins.|$|E
5|$|The holotype of Paranthodon, BMNH 47338, {{was found}} in a layer of the Kirkwood Formation that has been dated between the Berriasian and early <b>Valanginian</b> ages. It {{consists}} {{of the back of the}} snout, containing the maxilla with teeth, the posterior caudodorsal ramus of the premaxilla, part of the nasals, and some isolated teeth probably from the lower jaw. One additional specimen can be assigned to it based on the dentition, BMNH 47992, including only isolated teeth sharing the same morphology as those from the holotype. However, the teeth do not bear any autapomorphies of Paranthodon, and were referred to an indeterminate stegosaurid in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{deposition}} of the Barrow Delta's sediment ceased {{during the early}} or middle <b>Valanginian</b> with due the continental break up at the southern margin of the Exmouth Plateau. This was followed seafloor spreading at the Gascoyne and Cuvier Abyssal Plains and erosion at {{the surface of the}} Exmouth, Dampier and Barrow sub-basins and an unconformity to be position {{at the top of the}} early to middle <b>Valanginian.</b> By the middle to late <b>Valanginian</b> and through the Cretaceous major transgression occurred with deposit the Winning Group atop the <b>Valanginian</b> unconformity. The Winning Group consists of Muderong Shale, Windalia Radiolarite, and Gearle Siltsone. The Muderong Shale actually considered a siltstone and was deposited in a low energy, offshore-marine environment. The {{deposition of}} these sediments makes good seal for gas buildups in the Exmouth Plateau and the surrounding sub-basins of the Northern Carnvon Basin. The Windalia Radiolarite are primarily carbonate marine deposits commonly containing poorly preserved radiolarians and forminiferas. The Gearle Siltstone is a low-energy, offshore-marine deposit in a period of that input of the terrigenous sediments to the offshore was low minimal.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} Tithonian to early <b>Valanginian</b> there were {{major changes in}} depositional patterns, {{specifically}} associated with the Barrow Group. At {{this period of time}} there was large uplift of the Cape Range Fracture Zone that provided sediments from the Barrow Delta prograde northward past Barrow Island and across the Exmouth Plateau. The sediments of the Barrow Group are composed of interbedded shale and fluvial-deltiac sands that were extensively deposited into Exmouth and Barrow sub-basins.|$|E
25|$|The other {{component}} formations of the Hastings Beds are {{the underlying}} Wadhurst Clay Formation and the Ashdown Formation. The Hastings Beds in turn {{form part of}} the Wealden Group which underlies much of southeast England. The sediments of the Weald, including the Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation, were deposited during the Early Cretaceous Period, which lasted for approximately 40 million years from 140 to 100 million years ago. The Tunbridge Wells Sands are of Late <b>Valanginian</b> age. The Formation {{takes its name from}} the spa town of Tunbridge Wells in Kent.|$|E
25|$|The tectonic {{evolution}} of {{the area of the}} present-day Eastern Hills started with a marine back-arc basin in the Late Jurassic. The Early Cretaceous stages Berriasian and <b>Valanginian</b> were dominated by the presence of a marine incursion from the proto-Caribbean into the continent of South America, in those times still attached to Africa and Antarctica. The central region of current Colombia, the later Eastern Cordillera, was characterised by the deposition of calcareous shales with turbidite deposits from the Cáqueza area. During the Late Aptian to Early Albian, a marine shale-dominated sedimentation existed with more carbonate-rich deposits to the north, represented by the mosasaur fossil-bearing Paja Formation in Boyacá. The Turonian stage of the Cretaceous era experienced a worldwide anoxic event that produced highly organic shales in the area, today represented by the Chipaque Formation. The Upper Cretaceous sequence, illustrated in the stratigraphy by the Guadalupe Group, was deposited in a marine environment with alternating sandstones and shales.|$|E
500|$|The Kirkwood Formation is in South Africa, {{and many}} fossils of {{different}} species and genera {{have been discovered}} in it, with Paranthodon being the first uncovered. The formation is of a Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age, with the oldest deposits from the Tithonian, about 145.5 million years ago, and the youngest rocks being from the <b>Valanginian,</b> about 136.4 million years ago. A large variety of different animal groups {{have been found in}} the formation, including dinosaurs, at least two different sphenodontian lizards, multiple teleost fishes, a few crocodylians, some frog specimens, and also turtles. However, a large amount of the material of the Kirkwood formation only includes isolated teeth or partial and fragmentary pieces of bone. Dinosaurs of the formation include a basal tetanuran, the primitive ornithomimosaurian Nqwebasaurus, the possible brachiosaurid Algoasaurus, a potential titanosaurian, many ornithischians, Paranthodon, a genus of iguanodontian, and a [...] "hypsilophodontid" [...] (the family Hypsilophodontidae is no longer considered to be a natural grouping).|$|E
500|$|The {{clay pit}} {{from which the}} type {{specimen}} originates {{is part of the}} Isterberg Formation in the Bückeberg Group, also known in the past as the [...] "German Wealden facies". The Bückeberg Group, which is divided into six zones, belongs to the Berriasian of the Cretaceous, with the boundary between the Berriasian and the <b>Valanginian</b> being {{at the top of the}} group. The parts of the Isterberg Formation exposed at Gronau belong to the zones [...] "Wealden 5" [...] and [...] "Wealden 6", which correspond to the uppermost-Berriasian. A second, more fragmentary subadult individual, GZG.BA.0079, consists of the pubis, ischium, and several vertebral components; it originates from the slightly lower Deister Formation ("Wealden 3") in the Bückeberg Group, and can only be referred to Brancasaurus sp., since it is relatively incomplete and differs in several minor vertebral characteristics from the type of B. brancai. Other probable but isolated Brancasaurus elements come from outcrops of the Isterberg and Fuhse Formations in Lower Saxony; the latter formation is also in the Bückeberg Group.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to its late Jurassic occurrence, Aegirosaurus has recently been discovered from the late <b>Valanginian</b> (Early Cretaceous) of Southeastern France (Laux-Montaux, department of Drôme; Vocontian Basin), the first diagnostic ichthyosaur recorded from the <b>Valanginian.</b> This shows that most types of Late Jurassic ichthyosaurs crossed the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary.|$|E
