5000|$|The {{vertical}} cut recording process {{is an early}} method of audio recording by which a stylus cuts a vertical groove into a phonograph record. This {{is in contrast to}} the lateral recording system which uses a stylus that cuts side-to-side across a record. The <b>vertical</b> <b>recording</b> process, also known as the hill and dale process, was used to record phonograph cylinder records as well as Edison Disc Records, Pathé disc records, and disc records made by numerous smaller companies. Vertical cut recording was also used as a means of copyright protection by the early Muzak 16-inch background music discs.|$|E
5000|$|Initially known as, [...] "The Video Disc" [...] or the Teldec Television Disc, TeD (Television Electronic Disc) {{was first}} {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference in Berlin on June 24, 1970. It was developed by a team from two German companies: AEG-Telefunken and Teldec. Program information was stored in the form of ridges in the surface of a thin, flexible foil disc, which was claimed to be sufficiently robust to withstand being played 1,000 times. The main technological breakthrough was the <b>vertical</b> <b>recording</b> method that reduced the track pitch to 0.007 mm, and increased the rotation speed to 1,500 rpm, making it possible to record 130-150 grooves per millimeter, compared with the typical 10-13 grooves on an audio disc. This increased the available bandwidth from around 15 kHz to 3 MHz. The tracks were read by a pressure pick-up, which translated the surface of the ridges, via a piezo-electric crystal, into an electrical signal.Tracking was controlled not by the pick-up resting within the walls of a groove, but by a mechanical coupling on which the pick-up mounting is supported. There was no turntable. The rotation of the disc at 1,500 rpm created a thin cushion of air between the disc and a fixed plate. Vertical movement of the disc was kept to within 0.05mm. Eight-inch discs could store five minutes of programming, twelve-inch discs about 7½ minutes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Vertical surface {{properties}} of the landscape were measured using a laser altimeter mounted in a small twin-engine aeroplane. The laser altimeter makes 4000 measurements per second with a <b>vertical</b> <b>recording</b> precision of 0. 05 m for a single measurement. These airborne laser measurements were analysed to provide information on topography, vegetation canopy and stream and gully cross-sections. Laser altimeter data were used to measure small (less than 0. 20 m deep) and large gullies and stream cross-sections. Vegetation canopy heights, cover, structure and distribution were determined in studies in Texas and Arizona. Laser measurements of vegetation cover and height were significantly correlated with ground measurements made with line-intercept methods. While conventional ground-based techniques {{may be used to}} make all these measurements, airborne laser altimeter techniques allow the data to be collected in a quick and efficient way over large and inaccessible areas. The airborne laser altimeter data can also help quantify various lan...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present two new {{procedures}} for automatic detection and picking of P-wave arrivals. The first involves {{the application of}} kurtosis and skewness on the vector magnitude of three component seismograms. Customarily, P-wave arrival detection techniques use vertical component seismogram which is appropriate only for teleseismic events. The inherent weakness of those methods {{stems from the fact}} that the energy from P-wave is distributed among horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>recording</b> channels. Our procedure, however, uses the vector magnitude which accommodates all components. The results show that this procedure would be useful for detecting/picking of P-arrivals from local and regional earthquakes and man-made explosions. The second procedure introduces a new method called "Ratios in Higher Order Statistics (RHOS). " Unlike commonly used techniques that involve derivatives, this technique employs ratios of adjacent kurtosis and skewness values to improve the accuracy of the detection of the P onset. RHOS can be applied independently on vertical component seismogram as well as the vector magnitude for improved detection of P-wave arrivals...|$|E
40|$|A laser {{altimeter}} {{mounted in}} a twin-engine airplane: {{was used to}} measure surface patterns on the landscape of! Walnut Gulch Watershed near Tombstone, Arizona. The j airborne laser altimeter is a pulsed gallium-arsenide diode laser, transmitting and receiving 4, 000 pulses per second at a wavelength of 0. 904 Jim. The laser has a 1 mrad field-of-view and is designed to have a <b>vertical</b> <b>recording</b> accuracy of 0. 05 m on a single measurement. Aircraft altitude was between 100 and 300 m for the flights. Digital data from the laser are collected with a portable computer and analyzed to provide information,on surface features of the landscape. Changes in landscape topography and vegetation patterns were measured with the laser data. Vegetation height, spatial patterns, and patchiness of vegetation cover were measured. Laser measured vegetation properties were significantly related with field measurement made using line-transect methods. These studies demonstrate the potential of airborne laser data to measure landscape patterns of large areas quickly and quantitatively. Rapid methods of determining canopy height and cover are valuable for understanding vegetation patterns and characteristics, improving estimates of infiltration, erosion, and evapotranspiration, and making decisions for managing our natural resources...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{conventional}} seismic reflection {{processing methods}} for detecting and suppressing multiples tend to fail in some circumstances. Vertical seismic profile (VSP) corridor stacks are now widely used {{to differentiate between}} primaries and multiples. However, they sometimes prove ineffective and the classical approach, using synthetics, becomes unoutlined. In the Hassi R'mel field, a strong event on the surface seismic sections, between clayey Dogger and lagoonal Dogger tops, is suspected to be a multiple because it is practically missing on the outside VSP corridor stacks. In this study, we show that the inside and outside VSP corridor stacks cannot help to identify this event. Using synthetics derived from well logs, acquired in six wells regularly distributed on the field, we conclude that the event is a primary. VSPs and sonic logs were recorded in the same well in every case. Synthetics, with multiples only, show an energetic long-path multiple with inverse polarity, {{at the same time}} as the event on the surface seismic sections. This explains: 1 ƒthe vanishing of the primary on the VSP corridor stacks, due to <b>vertical</b> <b>recording</b> in zero offset VSP acquisition, and 2 ƒthe efficiency of the standard common-midpoint (CMP) stacking to suppress the multiple on the surface seismic sections because of normal moveout differences between primaries and long-path multiples within the far-offset regions of data gathers...|$|E
40|$|Some {{aspects of}} Rayleigh wave {{propagation}} on the North American continent have been deduced from {{the observations of}} the directions of approach in the Alberta microseisms. The results are compared to work done elsewhere in North America. The directions of approach were determined {{by means of a}} method developed by Jensen (1958). The method is based on particle motion analysis at a single station, and it yields the direction of approach of Rayleigh modes with retrograde particle motion, provided that such modes dominate the <b>vertical</b> <b>recording.</b> By means of an approximation formula given by Jensen (1961), the method also yields an estimate of the probable error of each single determination. This estimate will generally increase when there is interference from other waves, excepting Love waves from the same direction. The directions of approach were determined from the long-period seismograms recorded at the University of Alberta seismograph station at Edmonton during 1963 July and August. The complete list of observations was given by Hjortenberg (1963). From this list Tables 1 and 2 were prepared. Table 1 presents the observa-tions from the six isolated microseismic storms that occurred. Table 2 presents ten samples selected a t random from the intervals between the storms. The tables show the range of measured periods, the distribution into octants of the directions of approach, and the probable error. Each probable error quoted is the largest esti-mate obtained.
