(For practical purposes, also the electromagnetic “ether ” falls into this class.) Our {{emphasis is on the}} case where the successive users act independently and selfishly, but not maliciously; typically, the “first user ” would be a blind natural process tending to degrade the recording medium, and the “second user ” a human trying {{to make the most of}} whatever capacity is left. To what extent is a length of used tape “equivalent”—for information transmission purposes—to a shorter length of <b>virgin</b> <b>tape?</b> Can we characterize a piece of used tape by an appropriate “effective length” and forget all other details? We identify two equivalence principles. The weak principle is exact, but only holds for a sequence of infinitesimal usage increments.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{repeated}} {{use of a}} monotonic recording medium [...] such as punched tape or photographic plate [...] where marks can be added at any time but never erased. (For practical purposes, also the electromagnetic "ether" falls into this class.) Our {{emphasis is on the}} case where the successive users act independently and selfishly, but not maliciously; typically, the "first user" would be a blind natural process tending to degrade the recording medium, and the "second user" a human trying {{to make the most of}} whatever capacity is left. To what extent is a length of used tape "equivalent" [...] for information transmission purposes [...] to a shorter length of <b>virgin</b> <b>tape?</b> Can we characterize a piece of used tape by an appropriate "effective length" and forget all other details? We identify two equivalence principles. The weak principle is exact, but only holds for a sequence of infinitesimal usage increments. The strong principle holds for any amount of incremental usage, but is only approximate; nonetheless, it is quite accurate even in the worst case and is virtually exact over most of the range [...] becoming exact in the limit of heavily used tape. The fact that strong equivalence does not hold exactly, but then it does almost exactly, comes as a bit of a surprise. Comment: 7 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
2500|$|Polydor {{was also}} not happy with Faust So Far and demanded more {{commercial}} music from the band. Unwilling to compromise, Nettelbeck signed Faust with a fledgling record company in London, Virgin Records. Part of the deal between Nettelbeck and Virgin {{was that he would}} give <b>Virgin</b> his <b>tapes</b> of the music Faust had been working on since So Far [...] "for nothing" [...] and that Virgin would release a record priced as low as possible. The result was The Faust Tapes (1973) which cost 49 pence (the price of a single), and sold 100,000 copies in a few weeks, putting the unknown band into the British album charts. The [...] "success" [...] of this album ("90% of the people that bought it hated it!" [...] ) gave Nettelbeck access to Virgin's Manor Studio where Faust recorded Faust IV (1974), which sold moderately well, although not as well as Tapes. But back in Germany, their next effort, Faust 5 was abandoned and the band dispersed across Europe. (In 1979 Recommended Records rekindled interest in Faust by re-issuing the two Polydor albums, which led to the band reforming.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Richard Branson and Nik Powell had {{initially}} run a small record shop called <b>Virgin</b> Records and <b>Tapes</b> on Notting Hill Gate, London, specialising particularly in [...] "krautrock" [...] imports, and offering bean bags and free vegetarian {{food for the}} benefit of customers listening to the music on offer. After making the shop into a success, they turned their business into a fully fledged record label, Virgin Records. The name Virgin, according to Branson (in his autobiography), arose from a colleague of his when they were brainstorming business ideas. She suggested Virgin – as they were all new to business – like [...] "virgins". The first release on the label was the progressive rock album Tubular Bells by multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield in 1973.|$|R

By consequence, the maximum values and the slopes of absorption/resorption (A/R) currents can change with insulation systems ageing. In this paper, {{an analysis of the}} nature of the A/R currents and the importance of their components, especially the polarization current and the current given by the space charge, is presented. The experimental study concerns the A/R currents measurements of plane samples (made from CALMICAGLAS <b>tapes),</b> <b>virgin</b> and thermally accelerated aged. The obtained results show that the ageing process produces an increase of the values and a decrease of shapes of the A/R currents. Finally, the possibility of estimating insulations ageing state and lifetime from A/R currents measurements is discussed...|$|R

In fact the first real store was above a shoe shop at the Tottenham Court Road end of Oxford Street.After making the shop into a success, they turned their business into a fully fledged record label. The name Virgin, according to Branson (in his autobiography), arose from Tessa Watts, a colleague of his, when they were brainstorming business ideas. She suggested Virgin - as they were all new to business - like [...] "virgins". The original Virgin logo (known to fans as the [...] "Gemini" [...] or [...] "Twins" [...] logo) was designed by English artist and illustrator Roger Dean: a young naked woman in mirror image with a large long-tailed serpent and the word [...] "Virgin" [...] in Dean's familiar script. A variation on the logo was used for the spin-off Caroline Records label.|$|R
