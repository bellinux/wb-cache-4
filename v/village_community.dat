The road down to Chesham was frequently impassable in winter and periodic flooding has occurred even in recent years. The Second World War resulted in an influx of people escaping the London Blitz and not returning afterwards. This migration had a lasting effect with more houses built or greatly enlarged or refurbished. Transport improvements enabling daily commuting to London from the 1950s onwards also led to a further change with the growth in more affluent families which irrevocably changed {{the composition of the}} <b>village</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

'The Parade' Shops, built in 1954 in north Blacon, are an example of Chester City Council building. In 2015, the Parade Enterprise Centre opened, a joint venture between Avenue Services and Cheshire West and Chester Council. The Parade Enterprise Centre houses Sanctuary Housing, Blacon Library, as well as a community hall and various other offices for local businesses.|$|E
25|$|This crane {{species is}} legally {{protected}} in Bhutan and its hunting is prohibited. The religious {{culture of the}} Buddhists has attracted the cranes closer to the religious communities of Lamas, particularly in the Phobjikha and Khotokha valleys. Another {{reason for this is}} that when the large number of cranes visit these valleys, which are snow bound, the <b>village</b> <b>community,</b> including the Buddhist Lamas migrate to warmer regions to Wangdue Phodrong, thus avoiding a human conflict with the cranes' habitat, which forage in the valleys in marshy lands that are ploughed before winter and that provide insects and plant material and seeds. In these habitats, it is inferred, that livestock also helps by grazing on grass which in turn helps in bamboo regeneration on which the cranes feed.|$|E

25|$|The Dancer (Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk) is a trilogy of novels, by Indonesian author Ahmad Tohari, {{depicts a}} <b>village</b> <b>community</b> {{caught in a}} revolution, giving readers a {{perspective}} less acknowledged in the more popular account of the massacres.

As the novel was published in 1981, certain details were censored by the New Order, but all the same, the trilogy provides valuable insight into the grass-root level of the anti-communist coup and the tragedies that followed.|$|E
25|$|Local {{community}} groups actively {{are working to}} gain individual and district landmark designations for the East Village to preserve and protect the architectural and cultural identity of the neighborhood. One such group is the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (GVSHP). It has undertaken a complete survey of the East Village, documenting the history of every single building in the area. In the spring of 2011, the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) proposed two East Village historic districts: one small district covering the block of East 10th Street known as Tompkins Square North, and one larger district focused around lower Second Avenue that would encompass 15 blocks and 330 buildings. The original proposal for the larger district excluded buildings such as the Pyramid Club and the Russian Orthodox Cathedral on East 2nd Street. As {{a result of the}} efforts made by local {{community groups}} such as GVSHP, the Lower East Side Preservation Initiative, East <b>Village</b> <b>Community</b> Coalition, and Historic Districts Council, however, the proposed district now includes these buildings.|$|E
25|$|In fall 2009, it was {{proposed}} {{to close the}} Butterfield Elementary campus and combine its students with those at a nearby middle school, to form the Lakeland Village School. On February 11, 2010, the Lake Elsinore Unified School District Governing Board voted to close the campus and {{to proceed with the}} conversion of the Lakeland Village Middle School into a K-8th grade facility. Butterfield closed {{on the last day of}} school on June 3, 2010, after 28 years of service to the Lakeland <b>Village</b> <b>community.</b> The district believed it would save $500,000 through the closure. Most students from Butterfield continued at the new campus. On February 11, 2010, a new principal, Rita Post, was appointed to head the Lakeland Village School, with the then Butterfield principal, Dorri Neal, becoming principal at William Collier Elementary. The district spent approximately $1.5 million to renovate the 5 year old Lakeland Village Middle School to accommodate the K-5th grade students. The entire student and teacher population (along with the same attendance boundaries) moved 3 miles south to the campus of Lakeland Village Middle School which was renamed Lakeland Village School as it becomes a K-8 school.|$|E
40|$|I {{am pleased}} to present the Rural Villages Plan 2010 and the {{supporting}} summary action plans {{for each of the}} nine rural villages of the Wagga Wagga Local Government Area (WWLGA). Wagga Wagga City Council is committed to the continued development of resilient, strong and well connected urban and rural communities and neighbourhoods across the WWLGA. The development of the Rural Villages Plan 2010 is a significant part of that commitment. The plan was developed by community members, groups and key stakeholders working together with Council staff. Fundamental to the plan are the suggestions which came from the <b>village</b> <b>communities</b> themselves. The plan sets a framework and platform for Council and the rural <b>village</b> <b>communities</b> to work together to implement the plan’s initiatives. These are prioritised and practical solutions derived from identified issues within the rural <b>village</b> <b>communities</b> by the local community members themselves. This plan aims to strengthen Council’s partnerships with rural <b>village</b> <b>communities</b> and promote community cooperation and engagement through implementing a shared direction for the future. The implementation of the plan will be based on a partnership approach, characterised by personal connections and respect, the achievement of outcomes for all stakeholders and facilitation of the opportunity for rural <b>village</b> <b>communities</b> to build on their strengths. The successful implementation of this plan will provide economic, environmental and social benefits to each of the nine rural <b>village</b> <b>communities.</b> I {{would like to thank the}} community members involved in the development of this plan for sharing time, local knowledge and passion for the future well-being of rural villages...|$|R

25|$|Alphabet City has a {{surprisingly}} {{large number of}} surviving early 19th century houses connected to the maritime history of the neighborhood, which also are the first houses ever to be built on what had been farmland. GVSHP {{and others have been}} trying to protect them, but the LPC has been resistant. Despite local advocacy, an 1835 rowhouse at 316 East 3rd Street was demolished in 2012 {{for the construction of a}} 33-unit rental called “The Robyn,” which opened in 2014. In 2010, GVSHP and the East <b>Village</b> <b>Community</b> Coalition asked the LPC to consider for landmark designation 326 and 328 East 4th Street, two Greek Revival rowhouses dating from 1837–41, which over the years housed merchants affiliated with the shipyards, a synagogue, and most recently an art collective called the Uranian Phalanstery. The LPC declined, and those buildings were heightened, altered, and remade into luxury rentals in 2012. The LPC also declined a request to evaluate 285 and 287 East 3rd Street, two highly intact Greek Revival “sister” rowhouses dating from 1837, built on land originally owned by the prominent Fish family. Those buildings still stand, however.|$|E
25|$|The term “thangata” has {{had several}} {{meanings}} in Malawi {{in the last}} 120 years, and its traditional or pre-colonial use {{was very different from}} its uses in colonial and modern times. The word exists in the Chewa and the related Mang'anja languages, and its first pre-colonial meaning was “help” or “to assist”, in the sense of freely-given reciprocal help such as neighbours might give each other building huts or clearing fields. It also had the meaning of the agricultural work that a member of the <b>village</b> <b>community</b> did for his chief. The ownership of land in much of Malawi was vested in the community, not individuals. Traditional leaders acted as trustees over communal land, and granted the right to use it to individuals in their communities. By custom, these leaders received in gifts in kind or labour from those in their community who had benefitted. This was also called thangata. When communal land was plentiful, community leaders could not demand thangata, but once it became scarcer in the colonial period, and particularly after the introduction of Indirect rule on 1933, the chiefs could impose a condition of thangata work on any grant. In {{the last two or three}} decades, chiefs have begun to require cash sums or rents to allow the use of communal land, but these cash payments are not called thangata.|$|E
25|$|West Village, {{located on}} the University of California campus in Davis, California, was the largest ZNE-planned {{community}} in North America {{at the time of}} its opening in 2014. The development contains student housing for approximately 1,980 UC Davis students as well as leasable office space and community amenities including a community center, pool, gym, restaurant and convenience store. Office spaces in the development are currently leased by energy and transportation-related University programs. The project was a public-private partnership between the university and West <b>Village</b> <b>Community</b> Partnership LLC, led by Carmel Partners of San Francisco, a private developer, who entered into a 60-year ground lease with the university and was responsible for the design, construction, and implementation of the $300 million project, which is intended to be market-rate housing for Davis. This is unique as the developer designed the project to achieve ZNE at no added cost to themselves or to the residents. Designed and modeled to achieve ZNE, the project uses a mixture of passive elements (roof overhangs, well-insulated walls, radiant heat barriers, ducts in insulated spaces, etc.) as well as active approaches (occupancy sensors on lights, high-efficiency appliances and lighting, etc.). Designed to out-perform California's 2008 Title 24 energy codes by 50%, the project produced 87% of the energy it consumed during its first year in operation. The shortcoming in ZNE status is attributed to several factors, including improperly functioning heat pump water heaters, which have since been fixed. Occupant behavior is significantly different than anticipated, with the all-student population using more energy on a per-capita basis than typical inhabitants of single-family homes in the area. One of the primary factors driving increased energy use appears to be the increased miscellaneous electrical loads (MEL, or plug loads) in the form of mini-refrigerators, lights, computers, gaming consoles, televisions, and other electronic equipment. The university continues to work with the developer to identify strategies for achieving ZNE status. These approaches include incentivizing occupant behavior and increasing the site's renewable energy capacity, which is a 4 MW photovoltaic array per the original design. The West Village site is also home to the Honda Smart Home US, a beyond-ZNE single-family home that incorporates cutting-edge technologies in energy management, lighting, construction, and water efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Although Iraqi Kurdistan is {{not well}} known from an archaeological point of view, the {{available}} evidence nevertheless shows that the relatively favourable ecological conditions of the Iraqi part of the Zagros attracted human groups from early prehistory onwards. Lower Palaeolithic archaeological sites have to date not {{been found in the}} Iraqi part of the Zagros Mountains, but they are known from the Iranian side where numerous cave sites have been found during archaeological surveys. Information on the early prehistory of the wider Little Zab region itself comes from the excavations carried out by the Oriental Institute at archaeological sites east of Kirkuk and south of the Little Zab. The earliest evidence for human occupation in this region comes from the Middle Palaeolithic site of Barda Balka, where Late Acheulean stone tools have been found. Archaeological research elsewhere in the Zagros confirms the importance of this area to early human hunter-gatherers – including groups of Neanderthals as evidenced by the finds in Shanidar Cave in the Great Zab basin. Mousterian stone tools that were used by either Neanderthals or anatomically modern humans have recently been excavated in Arbil, between the Little Zab and the Great Zab. Both open-air and cave sites are attested for the Zarzian culture, which straddles the Upper and Epipalaeolithic periods. After the Zarzian, the focus of human occupation shifted from cave-sites, which continue to be used as secondary or seasonal occupation sites up to today, to open-air sites and it was in this period that the trend toward domestication of plants and animals set in. Domestication of the goat probably occurred first in this area of the Zagros. Jarmo, a tell east of Kirkuk, was a Neolithic <b>village</b> <b>community</b> that practiced agriculture and animal husbandry. Pottery occurs from the early occupation levels onward; in its later phases it resembles pottery from Hassuna. The early occupation of Tell Shemshara, in the Ranya Plain, can also be dated to this period. The archaeological fieldwork in the Ranya Plain showed that this area was occupied during the Ubaid, Uruk and Ninevite V periods – roughly from the middle 6th to the mid-3rd millennium BCE. Evidence for these periods comes from the Citadel of Arbil as well.|$|E

500|$|In 1894, Claud Biddulph, {{youngest}} {{son of the}} politician Sir Michael Biddulph, was given [...] of land by his father and in 1906, he committed £5000 (worth approximately £2 million in 2015) per year to building a house.

Biddulph referred to the manor as a [...] "cottage in the country". The Biddulphs originally hoped for a large village house, {{a focal point for}} the <b>village</b> <b>community,</b> who would work on craft projects in the house.
