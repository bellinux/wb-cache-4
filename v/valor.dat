5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 April 2013, the Facebook and Twitter {{accounts}} of <b>Valor</b> por Tamaulipas were shut down unexpectedly and without any explanation.

Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that <b>Valor</b> por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator.

40|$|Aquest article presenta un interessant fenomen quàntic, incomprensible des de la lògica mecanoclàssica: l’efecte túnel. Aquest efecte és invocat després per poder explicar la inversió quàntica dels pols d’un imant - apareix en escena l’anomenat nét magnètic del gat de Schrödinger- i es descriuen les possibles aplicacions que pot tenir en la computació quàntica, on s’abandona la lògica binària (el bit —que pot assumir els <b>valors</b> 0 o 1 -) substituint-la per una altra lògica basada en el qubit, magnitud que pot posseir tots dos <b>valors,</b> 0 i 1, simultàniament. An {{interesting}} and curious quantum phenomenon is discussed, which is incomprehensible {{in the frame}} of classical mechanics, namely, a tunnelling process. This is invoked to explain the quantum inversion of the poles of a magnet whiting the mass ofa solid body. It is then that the “magnetic grandson of Schröringer s cat” appears in the story. The article discusses possible applications of this phenomena to radically different forms of quantum computation, in which the usual binary logic, based on a variable which can take the values 0 or 1, is abandoned. In the simplest case, the new logic can be based on a qubit which can take the two values, 0 and 1, simultaneously and more complex situations are possible...|$|R
40|$|In his Le Morte Darthur (1485), Malory took {{previous}} Arthurian {{myths and}} compiled {{them in one}} volume, adapting them so as to satisfy the values of his time. These changes and values {{can be seen in}} the case of the female figures, and specifically in the figure of Morgan le Fay. This paper studies the role of Morgan le Fay as the antagonist in Le Morte Darthur and how she becomes an active character from the marginality of her position; analyzing also whether her position as an active woman is, precisely, what puts her in the margins. En Le Morte Darthur (1485), Malory va agafar mites artúrics anteriors i els va recopilar en un volum, adaptant-los per a satisfer els <b>valors</b> del seu temps.

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} {{realized}} stock-bond correlation. Gradual transitions between {{negative and positive}} stock-bond correlation is accommodated by the smooth transition regression (STR) model. The changes in regime are de…ned by economic and …financial transition variables. Both in sample and out-of- sample results document that STR models with multiple transition variables outperform STR models with a single transition variable. The most important transition variables are the short rate, the yield spread, and the VIX volatility index.
