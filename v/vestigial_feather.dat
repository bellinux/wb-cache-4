500|$|Frigatebirds {{are large}} slender mostly black-plumaged seabirds, {{with the five}} species similar in {{appearance}} to each other. The largest species is the magnificent frigatebird, which reaches [...] in length, with three of the remaining four almost as large. The lesser frigatebird is substantially smaller, at around [...] long. Frigatebirds exhibit marked sexual dimorphism; females are larger and up to 25 percent heavier than males, and generally have white markings on their underparts. Frigatebirds have short necks and long, slender hooked bills. Their long narrow wings (male wingspan can reach [...] ) taper to points. Their wings have eleven primary flight feathers, with the tenth the longest and eleventh a <b>vestigial</b> <b>feather</b> only, and 23 secondaries. Their tails are deeply forked, though this is not apparent unless the tail is fanned. The tail and wings give them a distinctive 'W' silhouette in flight. The legs and face are fully feathered. The totipalmate feet are short and weak, the webbing is reduced and part of each toe is free.|$|E
50|$|Eyelashes are an {{uncommon}} but not unknown feature in birds. Hornbills have prominent eyelashes (<b>vestigial</b> <b>feathers</b> with no barbs), as do ostriches. Amongst the reptiles, only Eyelash vipers show {{a set of}} modified scales over the eyes which look much like eyelashes.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{they have}} light hollow bones, {{and on their}} forearms {{there are still some}} <b>vestigial</b> <b>feathers</b> left of wings that were lost over {{millions}} of years of evolution. The average Shi'ar can lift 1 ton in Earth-like gravity and has far greater stamina than the average human. Most Shi'ar have no other special abilities, though some are genetic throwbacks. These individuals possess wings which allow them to fly.|$|R
50|$|This is a short-tailed robust {{bird with}} a long hook-tipped bill; like other tityras it has a {{peculiar}} <b>vestigial</b> ninth primary <b>feather.</b> The adult black-tailed tityra is about 20 - 22 cm long and weighs about 60 - 70 g. The male is dull white above and white below. The rectrices, the primary and secondary remiges and a cap extending to below the eyes are black; the tertiary remiges are silvery grey. Females have dark brown rather than black on wings and tail and some brown pattern on head, back and underside. In both sexes there is a patch of rosy-red bare skin around the eye, extending to the bill which is red-based with a black tip. The iris and feet are dark. The juvenile plumage is unknown.|$|R
