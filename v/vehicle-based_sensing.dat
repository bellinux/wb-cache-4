40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we review}} recent works {{comprising}} an emerging field of intelligent transportation: behavior analysis of vehicles. The ITS community has approached this topic both from vehicle-based and infrastructure-based sensing. In both cases, motion {{is the key}} indicator required for behavioral characterization, with accurate long-term prediction being the ultimate goal. However, the popular methods for behavior char-acterization differ between the sensing methodologies. <b>Vehicle-based</b> <b>sensing</b> tends to focus on spatio-temporal measurements coupled with various features for accurate estimation of object state. In contrast, infrastructure-sensing tends to avoid attempt-ing high resolution estimation of vehicle state and prefers to utilize patterns learned in aggregate for constrained estima-tion. This review focuses on vision-based sensing and provides highlights of state-of-the art methods used in surveillance, and on-road vision modalities. We provide discussion and comment on future directions in the field. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of UAV-based sensing systems for agronomic applications serves {{the improvement of}} crop management. The latter is in the focus of precision agriculture which intends to optimize yield, fertilizer input, and crop protection. Besides, in some cropping systems <b>vehicle-based</b> <b>sensing</b> devices are less suitable because fields cannot be entered from certain growing stages onwards. This is true for rice, maize, sorghum, and many more crops. Consequently, UAV-based sensing approaches fill a niche of very high resolution data acquisition on the field scale in space and time. While mounting RGB digital compact cameras to low-weight UAVs (< 5 kg) is well established, the miniaturization of sensors {{in the last years}} also enables hyperspectral data acquisition from those platforms. From both, RGB and hyperspectral data, vegetation indices (VIs) are computed to estimate crop growth parameters. In this contribution, we compare two different sensing approaches from a low-weight UAV platform (< 5 kg) for monitoring a nitrogen field experiment of winter wheat and a corresponding farmers’ field in Western Germany. (i) A standard digital compact camera was flown to acquire RGB images which are used to compute the RGBVI and (ii) NDVI is computed from a newly modified version of the Yara N-Sensor. The latter is a well-established tractor-based hyperspectral sensor for crop management and is available on the market since a decade. It was modified for this study to fit the requirements of UAV-based data acquisition. Consequently, we focus on three objectives in this contribution: (1) to evaluate the potential of the uncalibrated RGBVI for monitoring nitrogen status in winter wheat, (2) investigate the UAV-based performance of the modified Yara N-Sensor, and (3) compare the results of the two different UAV-based sensing approaches for winter wheat...|$|E
40|$|An ongoing {{research}} project examines guidance systems, which {{can take over}} control of a vehicle if the driver becomes incapacitated. Part of this project includes an evaluation of a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) for <b>vehicle-based</b> lane <b>sensing.</b> This report documents the results of tests of the 5 Hz NovAtel RT 20 DGPS receiver. A series of 32 static tests found the overall {{mean and standard deviation}} for the offset errors within specifications. In a series of dynamic tests, in which the vehicle was driven around the track at speeds of 20 - 35 miles per hour, after removing the effect of the GPS receiver's latency, the DGPS determined position exhibited a mean offset error of- 17. 3 cm (- 6. 82 in) and a mean standard deviation of 25. 5 cm (10. 1 in) in the direction of vehicle motion. In the direction perpendicular to vehicle motion, the mean offset was 4. 57 cm (1. 8 in) with a mean standard deviation of 39. 6 cm (15. 6 in). With no overhead obstructions in these tests, continuous satellite lock was possible. Tests at higher speeds based on a more accurate methodology are planned for the future. 17.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in smartphone technology, including motion sensing and wireless communications, {{have resulted in}} these devices being used for <b>vehicle-based</b> driver behaviour <b>sensing</b> applications, replacing existing bespoke vehicle-based solutions. Acceleration is normally used as the primary indicator for recklessness. Despite the many benefits of using a smartphone to determine vehicle acceleration, the mobility of the phone relative to the vehicle, and the vehicle relative to the earth, causes the earth's gravitational force to obscure the true vehicle acceleration as perceived by the phone. The design and test results in this paper demonstrate how quaternions and an unscented Kalman filter {{can be used to}} remove the gravitational vector from the sensed acceleration, which enables reckless driving detection.

40|$|To {{optimize}} plant architecture (e. g., photosynthetic active leaf area, leaf-stem ratio), plant physiologists {{and plant}} breeders rely on destructively and tediously harvested biomass samples. A fast and non-destructive method for obtaining information about different plant organs could be <b>vehicle-based</b> spectral proximal <b>sensing.</b> In this 3 -year study, the mobile phenotyping platform PhenoTrac 4 {{was used to}} compare the measurements from active and passive spectral proximal sensors of leaves, leaf sheaths, culms and ears of 34 spring barley cultivars at anthesis and dough ripeness. Published vegetation indices (VI), partial least square regression (PLSR) models and contour map analysis were compared to assess these traits. Contour maps are matrices consisting of coefficients of determination for all of the binary combinations of wavelengths and the biomass parameters. The PLSR models of leaves, leaf sheaths and culms showed strong correlations (R 2 = 0. 61 – 0. 76). Published vegetation indices depicted similar coefficients of determination; however, their RMSEs were higher. No wavelength combination could be found by the contour map analysis to improve the results of the PLSR or published VIs. The best results were obtained for the dry weight and N uptake of leaves and culms. The PLSR models yielded satisfactory relationships for leaf sheaths at anthesis (R 2 = 0. 69), whereas only a low performance for all of sensors and methods was observed at dough ripeness. No relationships with ears were observed. Active and passive sensors performed comparably, with slight advantages observed for the passive spectrometer. The results indicate that tractor-based proximal sensing in combination with optimized spectral indices or PLSR models may represent a suitable tool for plant breeders to assess relevant morphological traits, allowing for a better understanding of plant architecture, which is closely linked to the physiological performance. Further validation of PLSR models is required in independent studies. Organ specific phenotyping represents a first step toward breeding by design...|$|R
