And the study also shows {{that there is a}} significant growth level both on number of transactions and value. This dissertation examines the present B 2 C e-commerce participation and does a trend analysis of that. The model developed consists of five distinct traits for analysis of local B 2 C participation. Those are namely Personal Characteristics, Market Characteristics, Organizational Influences, <b>Vendor</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Systems</b> Characteristics and Buyer Decisions on current B 2 C e-commerce participation. The model only tested the direct relationships B 2 C participation and the selected traits and not all the relationships that the selected traits have with each other. Accordingly seven hypotheses were developed to test by survey questionnaire. Out of the responses received from the survey it suggest that {{people are more likely to}} purchase from the web if they perceive a higher degree of trust in e-commerce, higher level of education, and have more experience in using the web. (That belongs to the personal characteristics of the individual). Customer's participation is likely to be influenced by the level of market characteristics as well. Which mainly consists of price, promotion and product quality (including the service delivery). Site quality, technical trustworthiness, vendor reputation, and dispute settlements, all part of <b>Vendor</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Systems</b> Characteristics and Organizational Influences have positive impact on user participation. Presently the local B 2 C participants are more focused on purchasing services and they would like to see more active participation by the Sri Lankan government. Study also shed light on the importance of marketing and having proper local directory service to find local vendors. They are not overly concerned about the non-availability of laws but and mostly driven by the respective vendor's reputatio...|$|R

This paper describes an effort to establish a set of guidelines and a test methodology for industry to help minimize performance degradation when deploying commercial off-the-shelf antivirus products with ICS. The effort is being performed for industry through a collaborative effort between the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Energy’s National SCADA Test Bed at Sandia National Laboratories. A survey was conducted of end-users and vendors who are currently using or recommending the use of antivirus software with their ICS. Information gathered from industry includes system configurations, needs and priorities for performance, as well as current practices and problems using antivirus software on <b>control</b> <b>system</b> workstations and servers. Antivirus software vendors are also providing input to this study. Parallel to the survey, NIST is conducting a series of performance impact tests using commercially available antivirus software packages and control software within its Industrial Control Security Testbed. The results of the survey and testbed work are being compiled into a documented set of guidelines and a test methodology for industry. The test methodology will be presented as a general set of test procedures {{to be used by}} industry as a starting point when developing <b>control</b> <b>system</b> specific performance impact tests. A set of laboratory-based tests that demonstrate use of the test methodology and provide example performance data is also being developed in support of this effort...|$|R

The Mu Service Analyzer performs black box and white box {{testing of services}} based on their exposed software interfaces, using denial-of-service simulations, service-level traffic variations (to generate invalid inputs) and the replay of known vulnerability triggers. All these techniques exercise input validation and error handling and are {{used in conjunction with}} valid protocol monitors and SNMP to characterize the effects of the test traffic on the software system. The Mu Service Analyzer allows users to establish and track system-level reliability, availability and security metrics for any exposed protocol implementation.

Pogosta zahteva naročnika je enostavno prilagajanje procesa trenutnim željam in potrebam, kar zajema izdelavo lastnih tehnoloških programov in receptur. Enako pomembna je sledljivost šaržam, možen mora biti vpogled v postopek in pogoje v katerih je bila ta izdelana. Rešitve glede receptur in arhiviranja nudijo proizvajalci programske opreme za razvoj nadzornih sistemov sami, vendar so te relativno toge in zahtevajo doplačilo v obliki nakupa dodatnih licenc. Zato sem razvili lastne rešitve s pomočjo orodij, ki so na voljo v osnovnem Siemensovem programskem paketu SIMATIC WinCC. V urejevalniku skript VBS sem napisal skupek skript, ki s pomočjo gradnikov ADO omogočajo delo z bazami receptov in arhivov. Take baze so ločene od nadzornega sistema, tako da njihova uporaba ni omejena samo na nadzorni sistem, kar odpira možnost obdelave podatkov tudi na drugih računalnikih in sistemih.
