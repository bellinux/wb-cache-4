Here, we developed a method for combining structure-based computational protein design with library-based enzyme screening, in which inter-residue correlations favored by the design are encoded into a defined-sequence library. We validated this approach by engineering a glucose 6 -oxidase enzyme for use in a proposed pathway to convert D-glucose into D-glucaric acid. The most active variant, identified after only one round of diversification and screening of only 10, 000 wells, is approximately 400 -fold more active on glucose than is the wild-type enzyme.

This enables engineered regions to be obscured when the cell enters a new environment. DNAi is based on type-IE CRISPR biochemistry and a synthetic CRISPR array defines the DNA target(s). When the input is on, plasmid DNA is degraded 10 [superscript 8]-fold. When the genome is targeted, this causes cell death, reducing viable cells by a factor of 10 [superscript 8]. Further, the CRISPR nuclease can direct degradation to specific genomic regions (for example, engineered or inserted DNA), which could be used to complicate recovery and sequencing efforts.

40|$|Biological {{conversion}} of substrate sugars {{to a variety}} of products is an increasingly popular option for chemical transformation due to its high specificity and because of significant interest in the use of renewable feedstocks. However, pathway optimization through metabolic engineering is often needed to make such molecules economically at a relevant scale. Employing effective methods to search and narrow the immense pathway parameter space is essential to meet performance metrics such as high titer, yield and productivity with efficiency. This review focuses on two practices that increase the likelihood of finding a more advantageous pathway solution: implementing a screen to identify high producers and utilizing modular pathway design to streamline engineering efforts. While screens seek to couple product titer with a high-throughput measurement output, modular design aims to rationally construct pathways to allow parallel optimization of various units. Both of these methodologies have proven widely successful in metabolic engineering, with combinations of them resulting in synergistic enhancements to pathway optimization.

40|$|M 13 {{bacteriophage}} is a well-characterized {{platform for}} peptide display. The {{utility of the}} M 13 display platform {{is derived from the}} ability to encode phage protein fusions with display peptides at the genomic level. However, the genome of the phage is complicated by overlaps of key genetic elements. These overlaps directly couple the coding sequence of one gene to the coding or regulatory sequence of another, making it difficult to alter one gene without disrupting the other. Specifically, overlap of the end of gene VII and the beginning of gene IX has prevented the functional genomic modification of the N-terminus of p 9. By redesigning the M 13 genome to physically separate these overlapping genetic elements, a process known as “refactoring,” we enabled independent manipulation of gene VII and gene IX and the construction of the first N-terminal genomic modification of p 9 for peptide display. We demonstrate the utility of this refactored genome by developing an M 13 bacteriophage-based platform for targeted imaging of and drug delivery to prostate cancer cells in vitro. This successful use of refactoring principles to re-engineer a natural biological system strengthens the suggestion that natural genomes can be rationally designed for a number of applications.
