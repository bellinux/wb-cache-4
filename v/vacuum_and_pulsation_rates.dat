For this reason, three different pulsation control units, one with conventional components (PCU 1), one with PIC (PCU 2) and one with PLC (PCU 3) were used. All of the three units were designed to control a selenoid valve system and connected to a mobile milking machine performed milking for measurement of pulsation characteristics.

Six multiparous Maghrebi camels in late lactation and once daily milked were used. The best combination of setting for camel's milking was high <b>vacuum</b> <b>and</b> low <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> (48  kPa/ 60  cpm). Milk yield and average and peak milk flow rate were the highest, while milking time was the shortest using this combination of setting (3. 05 [*]±[*] 0. 30  kg, 1. 52 [*]±[*] 0. 21  kg/min, 2. 52 [*]±[*] 0. 21  kg/min, and 3. 32 [*]±[*] 0. 31  min, respectively).

40|$|In the Hong Kong rocky intertidal, the {{demography}} of the acorn barnacle Tetraclita japonica {{is largely}} determined by regular, intense mortality {{events in the}} summer and subsequent pulses of recruitment in late summer. During 2 consecutive summers from 2000 to 2001, 34 to 52 and 98 to 99 % of T. japonica were killed on the mid- and high shore, respectively, with younger cohorts suffering higher mortality in the mid-shore. Recruitment of T. japonica occurs in late summer; as a result, the population in the high shore consists of a single cohort of new recruits, while the mid-shore supports 2 cohorts (new recruits and adult survivors). To investigate how thermal stress affects acorn barnacle populations, air and rock temperatures and sub-lethal physiological measures (body temperature, sinus <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> haemolymph osmolality) of T. japonica were taken on the mid- and high shore during daytime, low spring tides in June-July 2001. Mean body temperature increased gradually after emersion, reaching a maximum of ∼ 48 °C at noon, 6 to 8 °C higher than the adjacent rock surface. T. japonica entered a heat-induced coma when body temperatures reached 45 °C. Osmolality of the haemolymph <b>and</b> sinus <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> increased with body temperature as a result of water loss and possibly altered haemolymph pressure; both were greater in high than in mid-shore individuals, with barnacles on horizontal surfaces being hotter than those on vertical surfaces. Body temperature <b>and</b> sinus <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> differed between shore levels, but were similar at spatial scales of 1 to 20 m at the same tidal height. Haemolymph osmolality, however, varied over this distance, probably due to individual variation in the amount of mantle water trapped before emersion and possible micro-habitat differences. Heat and desiccation stress, therefore, {{play an important role in}} determining the life history of T. japonica by limiting their distribution and abundance and influencing the demography of the population at different spatial scales. © Inter-Research 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{demonstrate}} the capability of magnetic particle imaging (MPI) to assess the hemodynamics in a realistic 3 D aneurysm model obtained by additive manufacturing. MPI was compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dynamic digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The aneurysm model was of saccular morphology (7 mm dome height, 5 mm cross-section, 3 - 4 mm neck, 3. 5 mm parent artery diameter) and connected to a peristaltic pump delivering a physiological flow (250 mL/min) <b>and</b> <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> (70 /min). High-resolution (4 h long) 4 D phase contrast flow quantification (4 D pc-fq) MRI was used to directly assess the hemodynamics of the model. Dynamic MPI, MRI, and DSA were performed with contrast agent injections (3 mL volume in 3 s) through a proximally placed catheter. 4 D pc-fq measurements showed distinct pulsatile flow velocities (20 - 80 cm/s) as well as lower flow velocities and a vortex inside the aneurysm. All three dynamic methods (MPI, MRI, and DSA) also showed a clear pulsation pattern as well as delayed contrast agent dynamics within the aneurysm, which is most likely caused by the vortex within the aneurysm. Due to the high temporal resolution of MPI and DSA, {{it was possible to}} track the contrast agent bolus through the model and to estimate the average flow velocity (about 60 cm/s), which is in accordance with the 4 D pc-fq measurements. The ionizing radiation free, 4 D high resolution MPI method is a very promising tool for imaging and characterization of hemodynamics in human. It carries the possibility of overcoming certain disadvantages of other modalities like considerably lower temporal resolution of dynamic MRI and limited 2 D characteristics of DSA. Furthermore, additive manufacturing is the key for translating powerful pre-clinical techniques into the clinic...|$|R

Aiming {{to study the}} principle structure and working characteristics of the pump, two patterns of valve and piston distribution were designed.

The {{results show that the}} pressure <b>and</b> flow <b>pulsation</b> of piston type pump are much smaller than the valve type, even though the piston type is large in scale and works at low flow rate. Compared with a valve distribution tri-linear-motor reciprocating plunger pump(VDTLMP), as the flow rate of the piston distribution double linear motor reciprocating plunger pump(PDDLMP) is decreased from 36. 7 L/min to 21. 2 L/min theoretically, the pressure pulsation amplitude is decreased from 46 % to 2 %, <b>and</b> the flow <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> is also decreased from 0. 266 to 0. 007.

For this purpose, 707 lactating cows of Holstein Friesian, were considered. The average farm size in the three areas studied was 4. 6 ha. Among the surveyed farms, 71 % free stall. The study of the machine operating parameters to milk cows revealed that the pulse frequency (FP), the <b>vacuum</b> level (NV) <b>and</b> <b>pulsation</b> ratio (PR) are nonconforming respectively in 87 %, 78 % and 58 % of cases. The study of the hygienic conditions revealed that 39 % of milking machines (MAT) are of poor cleanliness and 51 % of their pipes are in medium condition. Regarding milking practices, the most used method for cleaning teats is the collective mop with water (39 %), without wiping (67 %).

In line with results previously reported for sucrose, pulsation-induced taste enhancement peaked around TFP for both MSG and NaCl and did not require perception of tastant <b>pulsation.</b> TFP <b>and</b> <b>pulsation</b> effects were independent of the taste transduction mechanism (G-protein-coupled receptor for MSG versus ion-channel for NaCl).

This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of the udder and teats, milk yield in relation to <b>pulsation</b> <b>rates</b> (90, 120 <b>and</b> 150 cycles/min), milk partitioning in the mammary gland, composition of the spontaneously removed and residual milk fractions and milking efficiency. Forty-one healthy Martina Franca jennies in the third month of lactation and routinely milked twice daily were used in three studies. Udder characteristics were evaluated by direct measurements and ultrasonographic scanning. Residual milk was obtained by milking after an oxytocin administration (40 IU i. m.). The prevalent shapes were 'bowl' for udders and 'conical' for teats. After milking the udder characteristics decreased within a range from- 11 · 6 % (udder depth) to- 25 · 7 % (diameter of teat at the base). The internal structures of the udder resulted as several pockets of ducts empting directly into the teat. The <b>pulsation</b> <b>rate</b> of 120 cycles/min improved (P< 0 · 05) the milk yield in comparison to the 90 and 150 cycles/min, reduced the residual milk fraction, thus improved (P< 0 · 05) milking efficiency. Residual milk composition had higher (P< 0 · 05) fat content and somatic cell count than the spontaneously removed milk fraction.
