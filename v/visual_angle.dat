25|$|The {{smallest}} detectable <b>visual</b> <b>angle</b> {{produced by}} a single fine dark line against a uniformly illuminated background is also much less than foveal cone size or regular visual acuity. In this case, under optimal conditions, the limit is about 0.5 arc seconds or only about 2% of the diameter of a foveal cone. This produces a contrast of about 1% with the illumination of surrounding cones. The mechanism of detection {{is the ability to}} detect such small differences in contrast or illumination, and does not depend on the angular width of the bar, which cannot be discerned. Thus as the line gets finer, it appears to get fainter but not thinner.|$|E
25|$|The principal, {{anterior}} median, {{eyes have}} high resolution (11 min <b>visual</b> <b>angle),</b> but {{the field of}} vision is narrow, from 2 to 5°. The central region of the retina, where acuity is highest, {{is no more than}} six or seven receptor rows wide. However, the eye can scan objects off the direct axis of vision. As the lens is attached to the carapace, the eye's scanning movements are restricted to its retina through a complicated pattern of translations and rotations. This dynamic adjustment is a means of compensation for the narrowness of the static field of vision. It is analogous to the way most primates move their eyes to focus images of interest onto the fovea centralis. Such movements within the jumping spider's eyes are visible from outside when the attention of the spider is directed to various targets.|$|E

Human Factors engineers define three zones (i. e. "cones") of visual location: 1) "Easy Eye Movement" (foveal vision); 2) "Maximum Eye Movement" (peripheral vision with saccades), and 3) "Head Movement" (head movement required). Instrument display <b>visual</b> <b>angles</b> were measured to determine how well conventional aircraft (T- 34, T- 38, F- 15 B, F- 16 XL, F/A- 18 A, U- 2 D, ER- 2, King Air, G-III, B- 52 H, DC- 10, B 747 -SCA) and the MQ- 9 ground control station (GCS) complied with these standards, and how they compared with each other. Methods: Selected instrument parameters included: attitude, pitch, bank, power, airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, heading, turn rate, slip/skid, AOA, flight path, latitude, longitude, course, bearing, range and time. Vertical and horizontal <b>visual</b> <b>angles</b> for each component were measured from the pilot s eye position in each system. Results: The vertical <b>visual</b> <b>angles</b> of displays in conventional aircraft lay within the cone of "Easy Eye Movement" for all but three of the parameters measured, {{and almost all of}} the horizontal <b>visual</b> <b>angles</b> fell within this range. All conventional vertical and horizontal <b>visual</b> <b>angles</b> lay within the cone of "Maximum Eye Movement".

Discussion: Most instrument displays in conventional aircraft lay within the cone of "Easy Eye Movement", though mission-critical instruments sometimes displaced less important instruments outside this area. Many of the MQ- 9 GCS systems lay outside this area. Specific training for MQ- 9 pilots may be needed to avoid increased response time and potential error during flight...|$|R

2500|$|After {{the death}} of Maximilian III in 1618, Archduke Leopold V was {{appointed}} imperial representative of Tyrol and of the Upper Provinces. Like his predecessor Maximilian, Leopold V put his trust in Father Scheiner. Scheiner’s [...] "Oculus hoc est: Fundamentum opticum," [...] containing many {{new insights into the}} physiological nature of the eye, was published in Innsbruck in 1619. The book had been written earlier in Ingolstadt. Oculus is subdivided into three parts: the first part treats the anatomy of the eye, the second part the refraction of the light ray inside the eye, and the third part deals with the retina and the <b>visual</b> <b>angle.</b> Scheiner once again chooses the way of observation and experiment. Like Kepler before him, he found that the retina is the seat of vision and that the optic nerve transmits the images from the retina to the brain. Scheiner was rebuked once more for going from Innsbruck to Hall in a heavily loaded coach drawn by six horses! Father General Vitelleschi wrote him a letter. Archduke Leopold V and Father Scheiner carried on a sizeable correspondence from 1620 until 1632. One of Scheiner’s letters to Leopold from 1626 informs the Archduke that Galilei is not to hear of Scheiner’s work concerning the sunspots.|$|E
2500|$|Visual acuity {{depends upon}} how {{accurately}} light {{is focused on}} the retina, the integrity of the eye's neural elements, and the interpretative faculty of the brain. [...] "Normal" [...] visual acuity (in central, i.e. foveal vision) is frequently considered to be what was defined by Herman Snellen as the ability to recognize an optotype when it subtended 5 minutes of arc, that is Snellen's chart 6/6 meter, 20/20 feet, 1.00 decimal or 0.0 logMAR. In young humans, the average visual acuity of a healthy, emmetropic eye (or ametropic eye with correction) is approximately 6/5 to 6/4, so it is inaccurate to refer to 6/6 visual acuity as [...] "perfect" [...] vision. 6/6 is the visual acuity needed to discriminate two contours separated by 1 arc minute- 1.75mm at 6 meters. This is because a 6/6 letter, E for example, has three limbs and two spaces in between them, giving 5 different detailed areas. The ability to resolve this therefore requires 1/5 of the letter's total size, which in this case would be 1 minute (<b>visual</b> <b>angle).</b> The significance of the 6/6 standard can best be thought of as the lower limit of normal or as a screening cutoff. When used as a screening test, subjects that reach this level need no further investigation, even though the average visual acuity with a healthy visual system is typically better.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{elucidate}} the effect of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) on the straylight domain of visual function. PCO is heterogeneous with regard to morphology and severity; both aspects contribute to its functional effect. The isolated impact of capsule areas with specific morphology and severity on straylight was studied in-vitro by recording forward light-scatter. Forward light-scatter by four different capsule types, i. c. anterior capsule (AC), clear posterior capsule (PC), fibrotic and regeneratory PCO, was recorded at several <b>visual</b> <b>angles</b> with a goniometer, using different wavelengths. Angular (theta(a)) and wavelength dependencies (lambda(b)) were studied by determining exponents a and b. Recorded straylight values of isolated capsule areas varied between 10 x below to 10 x above the value normal for the human eye, depending on the capsule's condition (clear to opacified). The angular dependence of light scattered by clear PCs was weaker, whereas in the other capsule types it was stronger than in the normal eye. On average, the wavelength dependence of light scattered by different capsule types was similar, but the variation was considerable. At the smallest <b>visual</b> <b>angles,</b> increased angular and decreased wavelength dependence was found, especially in fibrotic and regeneratory PCO. It was concluded that the range of straylight values found in-vitro in lens capsules properly corresponded to that found previously in in-vivo pseudophakics. Surprisingly, the wavelength dependence of PCO indicated that small-particle light-scattering is important in PCO. Refractile effects were more important at small <b>visual</b> <b>angles,</b> as indicated by the combined stronger angular and weaker wavelength dependence.

The bee-achromatic disc could be learned and detected by the bees whenever it subtended 5 ° or 10 °, but not if it subtended 30 °. The chromatic disc was learned well and detected at all three <b>visual</b> <b>angles.</b> However, at 5 ° the maximum level of correct choices was ca. 75 % with the achromatic disc whilst it was ca. 90 % with the chromatic one. Thus, the presence of chromatic contrast enhances considerably the level of correct choices for the same amount of green contrast. The lower threshold of achromatic target de-tection lies between 3. 7 ° and 5 °; the upper threshold between 15 ° and 10 °. At the upper threshold, detection switches from chromatic-based to achromatic-based. Thus, in the context of target detection, the achromatic green contrast channel specialises in the detection of objects of reduced angular size, whilst the chromatic channels are specialised for objects of large angular size. We suggest that achromatic detectors with a centre-surround organisation are involved in the task of de-tecting achromatic targets.
