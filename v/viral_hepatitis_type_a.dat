40|$|The {{chimpanzee}} is {{the only}} animal model for investigating the pathogenesis of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>types</b> <b>A</b> through E in humans. Studies of the host response, including microarray analyses, have relied on the close relationship between these two primate species: chimpanzee samples are commonly tested with human-based reagents. In this study, the host responses to two dissimilar viruses, hepatitis E virus (HEV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), were compared in multiple experimentally infected chimpanzees. Affymetrix U 133 + 2. 0 human microarray chips {{were used to assess}} the entire transcriptome in serial liver biopsies obtained {{over the course of the}} infections. Respecting the limitations of microarray probes designed for human target transcripts to effectively assay chimpanzee transcripts, we conducted probe-level analysis of the microarray data in conjunction with a custom mapping of the probe sequences to the most recent human and chimpanzee genome sequences. Time points for statistical comparison were chosen based on independently measured viremia levels. Regardless of the viral infection, the alignment of differentially expressed genes to the human genome sequence resulted in a larger number of genes being identified when compared with alignment to the chimpanzee genome sequence. This probably reflects the lesser refinement of gene annotation for chimpanzees. In general, the two viruses demonstrated very distinct temporal changes in host response genes, although both RNA viruses induced genes that were involved in many of the same biological systems, including interferon-induced genes. The host response to HCV infection was more robust in the magnitude and number of differentially expressed genes compared to HEV infection...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesIn Saudi Arabia, <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> {{ranked the}} second most common {{reportable}} viral disease in 2007, with almost 9000 new cases diagnosed in that year. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the incidence trends of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> seropositivity among the population served by the National Guard Health Affairs (NGHA) hospitals in the central, eastern, and western Saudi Arabia regions. MethodsThe surveillance system at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh receives weekly reports of laboratory confirmed hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cases from all NGHA-served regions. In this study the <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> surveillance data for the period from January 2000 through December 2007 were analyzed. ResultsBetween 2000 and 2007, a total of 14 224 seropositive cases of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> were reported to the surveillance system. The average annual incidence of seropositivity per 100 000 served population was highest for HBV (104. 6), followed by HCV (78. 4), and lowest for HAV (13. 6). Saudis had higher HBV and HAV incidence, but lower HCV incidence compared to non-Saudis. Over the eight years (2000 – 2007), the incidence of all three <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>types</b> showed <b>a</b> 20 – 30 % declining trend. Only HAV incidence followed a clear seasonal cyclic pattern.

40|$|Autoantibodies {{directed}} against liver plasma membrane antigens {{have recently been}} described in patients with acute <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> <b>type</b> <b>A</b> (AVH-A). To further investigate this phenomenon, the antibody against one such liver membrane antigen, liver specific membrane lipoprotein (LSP), was assayed in six marmosets orally inoculated with hepatitis A virus (HAV). Using a sensitive radioimmunoassay technique, anti-human LSP antibodies were detected in five of six animals. Two peaks of 125 I-HLSP binding were observed: a minor peak at 20 days post-inoculation (dpi) in two animals, and a major peak at 38 - 45 dpi in five animals. There was no correlation between 125 I-HLSP binding and liver histology score, ALT level, IgG concentration, anti-HAV P/N ratio, or E rosette lymphocyte count. A statistically significant correlation was observed, however, between 125 I-HLSP binding and IgM anti-HAV antibody P/N ratios. 125 I-HLSP binding was blocked by both marmoset and human LSP, but not by a marmoset kidney protein prepared in an identical manner. In summary, marmosets infected with HAV are a suitable animal model for the further investigation of anti-LSP autoantibody formation in AVH-A...|$|E

30|$|Hepatitis is the {{inflammation}} of liver characterized by {{symptoms such as}} jaundice, extreme fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Three main <b>hepatitis</b> <b>types</b> <b>A,</b> B and C are caused by infection with hepatitis A, B and C viruses, respectively. Globally, {{it is estimated that}} approximately 1.5 million people die each year from various forms of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (WHO 2015 c), mostly by hepatitis B and C. Infection rate is very high among people in developing countries and 90  % infected individuals are children. Although, hepatitis A does not cause chronic liver disease, it can lead to high mortality due to acute liver failure. Hepatitis B is the most severe form of hepatitis and WHO estimates that worldwide 240 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus and 780, 000 people die every year due to acute or chronic illness (WHO 2015 d). In case of hepatitis C, approximately 130 – 150 million people globally are chronically infected and half million people die each year from hepatitis C-related liver diseases (Lozano et al. 2012). Effective vaccines are available against <b>hepatitis</b> <b>types</b> <b>A</b> and B.

In my beachelor thesis was covered years from 2000 to 2004. Now I continue with this diploma thesis where I want the 10 year results join together {{to show how the}} situation is developing. The intravenous drug users are the aimed group. These drug users belong to a high-risk group in which <b>hepatitises</b> <b>types</b> <b>A,</b> B or C are spread the most thanks to their high-risk behaviour. These days researches and epidemiologic researches show that the intravenous drug users belong among the main high-risk groups endangered by infectious disease. <b>Viral</b> <b>hepatitises</b> represent a serious problem, mainly <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> C, because {{there is no way of}} protection. This hepatitis is occuring without any symptoms of this disease by 50 ? 70 % people. By 70 ? 80 % it passes into a chronic stadium. It is possible to protect yourself by <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>A</b> vaccination. This <b>hepatitis</b> doesn´t change into a chronic stadium. It is easily spread by infected water or food. In our republic there occured several epidemics. Hepatitises started to spread among drug users and then they spread also among the rest of population. The last epidemic occured in 2008. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> B represents high risks for the perceptive population. There is a vaccine and population have a chance to protect against it. In the Czech Republic there is vaccination carried out within special vaccination of people who have high-risk job, for example in health service. Children of HBsAg positive mothers are vaccinated after they are born. From 2001 hepatitis vaccination was put into regular vaccination of children aged under 1 year in our republic. Also 12 year old children are vaccinated from 2001. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> B often becomes chronic and the mortality is 1 ? 2 %. Intravenous using of drug is important high-risk factor. It is one of the ways of transfering <b>hepatitises</b> <b>type</b> B and C. Next monitored indicators are the age of the clients, achieved level of education, basic drug, the age of the first usage of any drug, the age of intravenous application of drug and occurrence of <b>hepatitises</b> <b>type</b> <b>A,</b> B, C by clients. According to my research I used quantitative research which allows me to analyse problem of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitises</b> by clients from Psychiatric Hospital in Červený Dvůr. The gained information was worked out by secondary analysis of medical data. The monitored group has 2499 clients in years 2000 ? 2009. The aim of this thesis is to get general knowledge about prevalence of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitises</b> by clients of Psychiatric Hospital in Červený Dvůr from 2000 to 2009 and to consider their progress. The methodical procedure: there will be used a content analysis of medical data given by Psychiatric Hospital in Červený Dvůr. The result of this thesis is that it indicates and covered the develop of drug scene. Concerning the age the main group consists of 20 ? 24 year old men and women, next large group consists of clients aged 25 ? 29.

A total of 33 apps were included (from 232 that were identified), among which there were 10 duplicates. Most of these apps were uploaded under the medical category. Three had ratings less than 3. 9 	stars (out of 5). Only 6 apps had exceeded 1000 downloads. A total of 12 apps were aimed at health professionals, while 4 focused on patients (7 for both of them). The participation of health professionals in the development of apps was 56. 6...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the three}} <b>types</b> of <b>viral</b> <b>{{hepatitis}}</b> agents—A, B and non-A, non-B—the hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been best characterized by immunologic and recombinant DNA technologies. The indefinite persistence of hepatitis B virus infection in 85 % to 90 % of perinatally infected infants and in about 10 % of those infected {{later in life}} accounts for a worldwide epidemiologic reservoir of more than 200 million carriers who are at a high risk {{for the development of}} δ-infection, chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Active immunization with a safe and effective vaccine, derived from the plasma of carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), is envisaged to avoid <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> B and its chronic sequelae. In addition to serologic and immunohistochemical markers of hepatitis B virus infection, hybridization assays using cloned HBV DNA have provided new insight into the biology of this virus, its persistence and its oncogenic potential in humans and in animal models. Genetic similarities have been recognized between HBV and the antigenically distinct non-A, non-B agents implicated in some cases of transfusion-associated chronic hepatitis. Structurally this unique group of HBV and HBV-like agents are DNA viruses with functional attributes of integration and replication analogous to the retroviruses...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied a}} total of 55 {{patients}} with acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>A</b> (7 patients), B (20 patients) and non-A, non-B (28 patients) on light microscopic differences of their liver biopsies and their clinical evaluations. We found that the frequency and degree of some histological features seem to be characteristic to each <b>type</b> of <b>hepatitis.</b> In the liver parenchyma, the degree of necrosis was observed to be more severe in <b>type</b> <b>A</b> and B, extending necrosis was observed in type B and non-A, non-B, and reticuloendothelial reaction was more prominent in type B and non-A, non-B. In the portal area, bile duct lesions were frequently seen in type B and non-A, non-B. Although some predominant findings in each <b>type</b> <b>hepatitis</b> were observed, we could not find any specific differences which separate the three <b>types</b> of <b>hepatitis</b> histologically. Clinically and biochemically acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>A</b> showed {{the high degree of}} liver dysfunction and more rapid resolution than other types of B and non-A, non-B. On the other hand, acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> non-A, non-B showed relatively mild liver dysfunction than other <b>types</b> of <b>A</b> and B but slowly resolved during the convalescent stage and some of them showed progression to chronicity...|$|R
40|$|To analyze interleukin- 2 -dependent immunoregulatory {{function}} in hepatitis B virus infection {{and in other}} forms of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> levels of soluble interleukin- 2 receptors (sIL- 2 R) were measured by an enzyme-linked assay in sera from patients with acute and chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> of different etiology. Increased sIL- 2 R levels were detected in the early phase of acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>A</b> and <b>type</b> B, but not during acute non-A, non-B hepatitis. Among 46 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, levels of sIL- 2 R were significantly increased only in cases with chronic active hepatitis, while they were about normal in chronic persistent hepatitis or in healthy carriers of the infection. These differences were independent of virus replication, being maintained when patients were stratified according to HBeAg/anti-HBe status and to serum HBV-DNA. Nine patients with chronic active <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> B and high sIL- 2 R levels at presentation were followed prospectively for two to eight years, and in HBeAg-positive patients, the behavior of receptor levels closely paralleled disease activity. These results, which may reflect increased shedding of IL- 2 R by activated T lymphocytes in patients with active destruction of HBV infected hepatocytes, indicate the usefulness and potential prognostic importance of serum sIL- 2 R determination in patients with chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis had much lower sIL- 2 R levels, although their liver disease was similar to hepatitis B cases, suggesting that different pathogenetic mechanisms operate in these patients...|$|R
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay for {{the detection}} of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to hepatitis A virus is described. The test uses the principle of binding of IgM antibodies to anti-IgM-coated microtiter plates to determine whether the IgM antibodies attached have specificities for hepatitis A virus. In three patients with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>A</b> followed up to 12 months, IgM antibodies to hepatitis A virus could be demonstrated from the onset of illness and during the following 2 to 3 months. When acute-phase sera from 48 patients with acute hepatitis were tested, IgM antibodies to hepatitis A virus could only be demonstrated in 18 patients previously classified as <b>type</b> <b>A,</b> whereas 30 patients with type B and non-A non-B hepatitis were negative. IgM antibodies to hepatitis A virus could not be demonstrated in 108 normal sera nor in 55 sera containing rheumatoid factor. These results indicate that the {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} for IgM antibodies to hepatitis A virus is useful in the serodiagnosis of acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>A</b> on a single serum sample taken during the acute phase of illness...|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis: In {{patients}} with hepatocellular carcinoma {{who do not}} have cirrhosis, the clinicopathologic characteristics and long-term postresectional outcomes must be clarified and liver transplantation may also have a role in future treatment strategy. Design Case series. The mean (SD) follow-up time was 52. 4 (33. 8) months. Setting A tertiary care medical center. Patients From a prospective database, 445 {{patients with}} hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent hepatectomy were classified into 2 groups 9 ̆ 7 those without cirrhosis (n = 3 D 223) and those with cirrhosis (n = 3 D 222). Clinicopathologic factors and postresectional outcomes were compared between these groups based on the new American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union Internationale Contre le Cancer TNM (sixth edition) staging system and the patient selection criteria for undergoing transplantation. Main Outcome Measures Postresectional disease-free and overall survival rates. Results :Compared with patients with cirrhosis, patients without cirrhosis were younger, had a lower rate of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> C infection, and had more advanced TNM stage III disease.

40|$|Hepatitis B {{surface antigen}} (HB, Ag) was not {{detected}} in sewage {{by means of}} a sensitive affinity chromatography method combined with radioimmunoassay. The antigen was also absent from the feces and urine of 23 patients with HB, Ag an-tigenemia; this observation indicates that HB, Ag is rarely discharged into sewage. The absence of HB, Ag from feces is ascribed to antagonists of an enzymatic nature or to carboxypeptidase A. which destroys the antigen. Antagonists with similar effects were produced by three species of Pseudomonas but were not produced by various other bacteria. HB, Ag was also destroyed by two subtilisin enzymes. When hepatitis B sera were incubated with these enzymes or with the antagonists, small spherical particles. tubules, and the coats of Dane particles disappeared first, and Dane cores disappeared later. Although sewage or activated sludge did not affect the stability of HB, Ag, the results indicate that even Dane cores are not excreted in feces and that sewage plays a negligible role in the spread of HB, Ag, Dane cores. and <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> B. <b>Hepatitis</b> B surface antigen (HB s Ag) is closel...|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) -specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response during acute and chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> target cells that express HBV-encoded antigens {{in the context}} of the appropriate HLA restriction element must be available for each subject studied. Since HBV is not infectious for human cells in vitro, such target cells must be produced by DNA-mediated gene transfer into cultured human primary cells or cell lines. For this purpose, we have developed a panel of Epstein-Barr virus-based episomal expression vectors containing each of the HBV open reading frames under the transcriptional control of the simian virus 40 early promoter. Transfection of Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B-cell lines with this panel of recombinants consistently leads to stable expression of the HBV envelope, nucleocapsid, and polymerase proteins. The HBV X gene product is transiently expressed following transfection, but stable expression of this protein cannot be maintained on a long-term basis. To assess the suitability of this system for the identification of HBV-specific CTL in humans, a panel of EBO-HBV transfectants of defined HLA haplotype was used to monitor the HBV-specific CTL response in a patient with acute <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> B. Transfectants that stably express the HBV nucleocapsid (core) antigen were found to serve as excellent targets for the detection of HLA class I-restricted CTL that recognize endogenously synthesized HBV core antigen in this patient; they were also successfully used to stimulate the specific expansion of these CTL in vitro...|$|R
