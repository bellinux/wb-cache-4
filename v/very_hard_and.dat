5|$|The largest {{category}} of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M2N, and M4N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned {{in the gaps}} in a metallic cubic or hexagonal close-packed lattice. They are opaque, <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500°C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by KID, with direction by Takumi Nakazawa, planning and scenario writing by Kotaro Uchikoshi, character design by Yuu Takigawa, and music by Takeshi Abo. Nakazawa and Uchikoshi were appointed to their respective positions as they had worked on the previous game in the Infinity series, , which had been well received. As Ever 17 was to be released on consoles, it was required to be finished {{two months before the}} planned August release, meaning that after the scenario's completion in May, there was only time for debugging until late June. Uchikoshi and Nakazawa described this as a tight development schedule, and said that the game was only possible through the staff working <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> a lot of things being worked on at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based {{superalloys}} consume {{most of the}} produced cobalt. The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E

In 1999, Abkhazia officially declared their independence, which was recognized by almost no other nations.|$|E
25|$|Mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda) {{consist of}} both ambush predators (‘spearers’) and foragers (‘smashers’). Spearers hide in sandy burrows and capture evasive prey, whereas smashers search for prey {{away from their}} burrows and {{typically}} hammer hard-shelled, sedentary prey. Zebra mantis shrimp (Lysiosquillina maculata) ambush evasive prey primarily at night while hidden in burrows, striking <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> fast (mean peak speed 2.30 m s–1 and mean duration 24.98 ms).|$|E

25|$|Sanchin is the {{foundation}} for all other kata, and is {{generally considered to be}} the most important kata to master. When new students came to Miyagi, he would often train them for three to five years before introducing them to sanchin. He would make them train <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> many of them quit before learning sanchin. Those that remained would focus almost exclusively on sanchin for two to three years. Miyagi's sanchin training was very harsh, and students would often leave practice with bruises from him checking their stance.|$|E
25|$|A {{widely used}} old {{adhesive}} that is orange or very dark brown in appearance. Once dried, the adhesive is <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> becomes increasingly more brittle over time. Shellac does not break down easily with commercially available products. Additionally, the resin has naturally-occurring dyes that can stain ceramic pink or black. The solvent that works best on this resin is Industrial methylated spirit or (IMA). Shellac is prepared by dissolving flakes of shellac in hot alcohol. The properties of shellac make it vulnerable to climatic conditions and inclined to deteriorate over time. Damage can even occur to shellac under the hot light of photography.|$|E
30|$|Hardness {{is defined}} as the sum of {{concentration}} of their ions expressed in mg/L of CaCO 3. Hardness increases from metallic ions dissolved in water. Hardness is used as an indicator of the rate of scale formation in hot water heaters in low-pressure boilers. USGS hardness (Handa 1964) shows four categories of hardness: soft, slightly <b>hard,</b> moderately <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard.</b> Scaling <b>and</b> deposition problems in air-conditioning plants are associated with the total hardness of water. Total hardness of more than 180  mg CaCO 3 /L can be treated as <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> water <b>and</b> can lead to scaling problems in air-conditioning plants (Hem 1970).|$|R

25|$|However, Clark {{remained}} belligerent in his {{attacks on}} the Trudeau government, angrily clashing with the prime minister in Parliament. He hired experienced staffers such as Lowell Murray, Duncan Edmonds, and William Neville, who shaped his policies and ran his office efficiently. He improved his party's standing in national opinion polls. Clark worked <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> gradually earned the respect of most people, including his own caucus, by presenting a series of well thought out speeches and questions in Parliament.

25|$|No {{satisfactory}} explanation can as yet {{be given}} for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine {{the proportion of the}} two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though {{it is not possible to}} formulate a rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.|$|E

Taylor had romantic affairs, and there were unsubstantiated rumors about Stanwyck having had affairs as well. After the divorce, they acted together in Stanwyck's last feature film, The Night Walker (1964). She never remarried and cited Taylor as {{the love of her}} life, according to her friend and Big Valley co-star Linda Evans.

25|$|Sword {{production}} in China is attested from the Bronze Age Shang Dynasty. The technology for bronze swords reached its high {{point during the}} Warring States period and Qin Dynasty. Amongst the Warring States period swords, some unique technologies were used, such as casting high tin edges over softer, lower tin cores, or the application of diamond shaped patterns on the blade (see sword of Goujian). Also unique for Chinese bronzes is the consistent use of high tin bronze (17–21% tin) which is <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> breaks if stressed too far, whereas other cultures preferred lower tin bronze (usually 10%), which bends if stressed too far. Although iron swords were made alongside bronze, {{it was not until}} the early Han period that iron completely replaced bronze.|$|E
25|$|Without exception, all Canna {{species that}} have been {{introduced}} into Europe {{can be traced back}} to the Americas, and it can be asserted with confidence that Canna is solely an American genus. If Asia and Africa provided some of the early introductions, they were only varieties resulting from C. indica and C. glauca cultivars {{that have been}} grown for a long time in India and Africa, with both species imported from Central and South America. Since cannas have <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> durable seed coverings, it is likely that seed remains would survive in the right conditions and been found by archaeologists in the Old World if Canna had been grown there from antiquity. If the soils of India or Africa had produced some of them, they would have been imported before the 1860s into European gardens.|$|E

25|$|Jagannathan {{was born}} Devendra Kula Vellalar family in 1926. Her first {{encounter}} with social injustice and poverty was by looking at her mother Nagammal who had to toil <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> had to work {{even when she was}} in advanced stage of pregnancy. Despite being from a poor family she managed university education and was soon involved with the Gandhian Sarvodaya Movement. It was through Sarvodaya that she Sankaralingam, who was much later to be her husband. Sankaralingam hailed from a wealthy family, yet gave up his college studies in 1930 in response to Gandhi's call for non-co-operation movement and civil disobedience. At one stage Krishnammal even shared a stage with Gandhi and also met Martin Luther King. Sankaralinga later joined the Quit India Movement in 1942 and spent years in jail before India gained its independence in 1947. Having decided only to marry in independent India Sankaralingam and Krishnammal married in 1950. She would later head the Salt Satyagraha march in Vedaranyam, this time not in protest, but to commemorate the platinum jublee of the event in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Polishing wheels {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of types to fulfil a wide range of needs. The most common {{materials}} used for polishing wheels are wood, leather, canvas, cotton cloth, plastic, felt, paper, sheepskin, impregnated rubber, canvas composition, and wool; leather and canvas are the most common. Wooden wheels have emery or other abrasives glued onto them and are used to polish flat surfaces and maintained good edges. There are many types of cloth wheels. Cloth wheels that are cemented together are <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> used for rough work, whereas other cloth wheels that are sewn and glued together are not as aggressive. There are cloth wheels that are not glued or cemented, instead these are sewed and have metal side plates for support. Solid felt wheels are popular for fine finishes. Hard roughing wheels can be made by cementing together strawboard paper disks. Softer paper wheels are made from felt paper. Most wheels are run at approximately 7500 surface feet per minute (SFM), however muslin, felt and leather wheels are usually run at 4000 SFM.|$|E
25|$|Glass was a {{desirable}} material for mirrors. Because {{the surface of}} glass is naturally smooth, it produces reflections with very little blur. In addition, glass is <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> scratch resistant. However, glass by itself has little reflectivity, so people began coating it with metals to increase the reflectivity. Metal-coated glass mirrors are said by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder to have been invented in Sidon (modern-day Lebanon) {{in the first century}} AD, although no archeological evidence of them date from before the third century. According to Pliny, the people of Sidon developed a technique for creating crude mirrors by coating blown glass with molten lead. Glass mirrors backed with gold leaf are mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History, written in about 77 AD. Because there were few ways to make a smooth piece of glass with a uniform thickness, these ancient glass-mirrors were made by blowing a glass bubble, and then cutting off a small, circular section, producing mirrors that were either concave or convex. These circular mirrors were typically small, from only a fraction of an inch to as much as eight inches in diameter. These small mirrors produced distorted images, yet were prized objects of high value. These ancient glass mirrors were very thin, thus very fragile, because the glass needed to be extremely thin to prevent cracking when coated with a hot, molten metal. Due to the poor quality, high cost, and small size of these ancient glass mirrors, solid metal-mirrors primarily of steel were usually preferred until the late nineteenth century.|$|E
