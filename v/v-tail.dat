5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds, and an all-moving <b>V-tail.</b> The cockpit was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed {{on the underside of the}} fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E
25|$|Prototype with a <b>V-tail.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{also featured}} a 120 degree <b>V-tail</b> arrangement and retractable landing gear. The construction was mostly of wood, with sandwiched layers of balsa and hardwoods, including tulipwood stringers covered with doped fabric.|$|E
50|$|<b>V-Tails</b> {{are very}} popular in Europe, {{especially}} for gliders. In the US, the T-Tail is more common. <b>V-Tails</b> {{have the advantage of}} being lighter and creating less drag. They also are less likely to break at landing or take-off due to the tail striking something on the ground like an ant mound or a rock.|$|R
50|$|Wagstaff is an instrument-rated {{pilot who}} flies {{herself to her}} airshow performances. She has owned a Beechcraft Baron and a Cirrus SR22, and {{currently}} flies a <b>V-Tailed</b> Beechcraft K-35 with her two dogs and parrot.|$|R
50|$|In modern day, light jet general {{aviation}} aircraft {{such as the}} Cirrus Vision, Eclipse 400 or the unmanned aerial drone Global Hawk often have the power plant placed outside the aircraft to protect the passengers and make certification easier. In such cases <b>V-tails</b> are used to avoid placing the vertical stabilizer in the exhaust of the engine, which would disrupt {{the flow of the}} exhaust, reducing thrust and increasing wear on the stabilizer, possibly leading to damage over time.|$|R
25|$|In 2011 Winters {{completed}} work on {{a single}} seat, twin-engined design with an inverted <b>V-tail,</b> inspired by the Ultraflight Lazair. The new aircraft is marketed as the Blue Yonder EZ Fun Flyer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Avions Pierre Robin started design of an ultra-lightweight two-seat light {{aircraft}} intended {{to meet the}} requirements of French flying clubs for a low-cost light trainer, as existing American training aircraft were becoming increasingly expensive, which was not helped by an unfavourable exchange rate, which resulted in a competition to supply a new light trainer, which could be mass-produced for supply to subsidised French flying clubs. Robin won the competition in 1983 with their ATL design, a single-engined low-winged monoplane with a fixed undercarriage and a <b>V-tail.</b> The ATL's fuselage was of Glass-reinforced plastic construction, with a wooden wing, while the <b>V-tail</b> is a conventional all-metal construction.|$|E
25|$|The Fairchild MX-2223 design {{called for}} a {{non-metallic}} fuselage with swept wings and a <b>v-tail.</b> Radar reflectors were located in the fuselage and on pods positioned on the wing tips to simulate the radar return of a bomber.|$|E
50|$|The Nomad is {{of mixed}} construction, with a {{monocoque}} aluminium fuselage, a wooden cantilever wing with one spar and wooden tail surfaces. The wing and tail are all covered with doped aircraft fabric covering. The wing employs a NACA 23-018 airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a NACA 23-012 at the wing tip. The original design had a conventional cruciform tail, but in 1939 this {{was replaced with}} one of the first <b>V-tails</b> used on any aircraft and the first employed on a sailplane. The landing gear is a monowheel.|$|R
50|$|To meet a {{requirement}} {{to use as}} an engined testbed for Turbomeca turbojets, Fouga combined two CM.8 fuselages. It used the port and starboard outerwings with a new wing centre section to join the two fuselages. The <b>V-tails</b> fitted to each fuselage were joined at the top in a W configuration. The type was designated the Fouga CM.88-R Gemeaux I and first flew 6 March 1951, it was fitted with two Turbomeca Piméné turbojets, {{one on top of}} each fuselage. Further variants were produced as the engine fit was changed.|$|R
50|$|In August 1945, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), {{soon to be}} {{renamed the}} United States Air Force, issued a {{proposal}} for a supersonic interceptor capable of 700 mi/h km/h speeds and reaching an altitude of 50000 ft in four minutes. Several companies responded, among which was Consolidated-Vultee, which submitted its design on 13 October 1945. This design featured swept wings and <b>V-tails,</b> as well as a powerful propulsion system. Besides the ducted rocket, four 1,200 lbf kN rockets were positioned at the exhaust nozzle, along with the 1,560 lbf kN 19XB turbojet produced by Westinghouse.|$|R
25|$|The H-101 {{differs from}} the Libelle in having a <b>V-tail,</b> showing its ancestry to the V-tailed Hütter H-30 GFK. Four {{flush-fitting}} air brakes were fitted to the trailing edges of the wings, replacing the more conventionally sited air brakes of the Standard Libelle. The Salto's air brakes are hinged at their midpoints so that half the surface projects above the wing and half below.|$|E
25|$|The SB-5 is a {{cantilever}} shoulder-wing monoplane with a plywood monocoque fuselage {{which has}} an outer fibre glass skin, a single spar wooden wing with plywood skinning, and a <b>V-tail.</b> Its wing, with a constant chord centre section and tapered outer panels, has 2.50° of dihedral and Schempp-Hirth airbrakes at 50% chord. The pilot has an enclosed cockpit with a Plexiglass canopy and the landing gear is a non-retractable, unsprung monowheel with a tailskid.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} design featured four fins (or planes) and rudders set radially to the envelope: two horizontal fins, and two below the envelope in an inverted <b>V-tail</b> configuration; however, {{in some cases}} the two lower fins were replaced with a single central fin that carried a larger rudder. The fins were identical in size and shape, and were constructed of spruce, aluminium, and steel tubing, braced with wire and covered with doped fabric.|$|E
50|$|The first {{aircraft}} built was the Wee Bee in 1948. The Wee Bee {{is listed}} in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's lightest aircraft, weighing 210 lbs kg when empty. It had a two-cylinder engine and tricycle landing gear. The pilot flew in a prone position lying atop the fuselage. The Honey Bee was the second plane, completed in 1952. It had a single seat in an enclosed cabin. The Queen Bee was the last and {{the largest of the}} three. It was completed in 1960 and seated four. The Queen Bee and the Honeybee had <b>V-tails.</b>|$|R
25|$|MQ-1B Block 10 / 15: Current {{production}} aircraft include updated avionics, datalinks, and countermeasures, modified <b>v-tail</b> planes {{to avoid damage}} from ordnance deployment, upgraded AN/AAS-52 Multi-Spectral Targeting System, wing deicing equipment, secondary daylight and infrared cameras in the nose for pilot visual in case of main sensor malfunction, and a 3ft (0.91m) wing extension from each wingtip. Some older MQ-1A aircraft have been partially retrofitted with some Block 10 / 15 features, primarily avionics and the modified tail planes.|$|E
25|$|The Vision SF50 is made {{entirely of}} {{composite}} material (another {{first in the}} production jet industry) and is a low-wing cantilever monoplane powered by a single Williams FJ33 turbofan mounted above the rear fuselage. It has a <b>v-tail</b> and a retractable tricycle landing gear. The enclosed cabin is 5.1ft (1.56 m) wide and is 4.1ft (1.24 m) high with room for seven. Access to the cabin is through a clamshell door on the left hand side. The SF50 is designed for 12,000 flight hours.|$|E
25|$|Gloster {{produced}} several design {{proposals in}} the hope of satisfying the requirement. P.228, drawn up in 1946, was essentially a two-seat Meteor with slightly swept wings. A similar design was also offered to the Royal Navy as the P.231. The later-issued P.234 and P.238 of early 1947 had adopted many of the features that would be distinctive of the Javelin, including the large delta wing and tailplane. The two differed primarily in role; P.234 was a single-seat day fighter with a <b>V-tail,</b> while P.238 was a two-seat night fighter with a mid-mounted delta tailplane.|$|E
25|$|Three initial design {{concepts}} were {{developed for the}} Model 45, including one with the Bonanza's signature <b>V-tail,</b> but the final design that emerged in 1948 incorporated conventional tail control surfaces {{for the benefit of}} the more conservative military (featuring a relatively large unswept vertical fin that would find its way onto the Travel Air twin-engine civil aircraft almost ten years later). The Bonanza's fuselage with four-passenger cabin was replaced with a narrower fuselage incorporating a two-seater tandem cockpit and bubble canopy, which provided greater visibility for the trainee pilot and flight instructor. Structurally, the Model 45 was much stronger than the Bonanza, being designed for +10g and −4.5g, while the Continental E-185 engine of 185 horsepower (hp) at takeoff (less than a third of the power of the T-6's engine) was the same as that fitted to contemporary Bonanzas.|$|E
500|$|The {{flight control}} {{surfaces}} were controlled by a central management computer system. Raising the wing flaps and ailerons {{on one side and}} lowering them on the other provided roll. The <b>V-tail</b> fins were angled 50 degrees from the vertical. Pitch was mainly provided by rotating these <b>V-tail</b> fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart. Yaw was primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction. [...] Test pilot Paul Metz stated that the YF-23 had superior high angle of attack (AoA) performance compared to legacy aircraft. Deflecting the wing flaps down and ailerons up on both sides simultaneously provided for aerodynamic braking. [...] To keep costs low despite the novel design, a number of [...] "commercial off-the-shelf" [...] components were used, including an F-15 nose wheel, F/A-18 main landing gear parts, and the forward cockpit components of the F-15E Strike Eagle.|$|E
500|$|The program {{begin in}} 1977, with a {{reported}} budget of USD $24,000,000; {{the design of}} the aircraft was closely based on that of Have Blue, except scaled down. Intended for launch from Lockheed DC-130 Hercules drone launcher aircraft, the original configuration of the Senior Prom vehicle included winglets and a ventral fin; the aircraft was later modified to include a <b>V-tail</b> and more slender wings, closer in configuration to the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter. Radar-absorbent material was applied to the airframe as part of its stealth configuration; in addition to the faceting of the design, similar to that of Have Blue and the F-117, the [...] "sawtooth" [...] wing profile bore similarities to the B-2 stealth bomber's planform.|$|E
500|$|In the {{reference}} design, each LFBB {{consists of three}} engines installed in a circular arrangement at the aft of the vehicle. Each engine is a Vulcain engine with reduced expansion ratio. An additional three turbofan air-breathing engines, installed in the nose section, provide power for fly-back. The fuselage is [...] long, with an outer tank diameter of , specifically designed to match the existing Ariane 5 core stage and to reduce manufacturing costs. A low-wing <b>V-tail</b> canard configuration was selected, with a wingspan of approximately [...] and an area of [...] The aerofoil {{was based on a}} transonic profile from the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE 2822). The gross lift-off mass (GLOW) of each booster is , with [...] upon separation and [...] dry mass. In comparison, the GLOW for EAP P241 is [...]|$|E
500|$|While superficially {{similar to}} the later F-117, the Have Blue prototypes were smaller aircraft, about one quarter {{the weight of the}} F-117, with a wing sweep of 72.5° and inward-canted {{vertical}} tails (inverse <b>V-tail).</b> Radar-absorbent material (RAM), developed in a Lockheed laboratory, were applied to the aircraft's flat surfaces – for the windscreen, special coatings were applied to give them metallic characteristics. The aircraft's gross weight of 9,200–12,500lb (4,173–5,669kg) enabled the aircraft to use the landing gear from the Northrop F-5 fighter. The aircraft's powerplants were two [...] General Electric J85-GE-4As of the T-2C Buckeye. Because stealth took precedence above all else, the aircraft was inherently unstable. As a result, a quadruple redundant fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system was integrated into the aircraft to give it normal flying characteristics. The flight control system was borrowed from the F-16. The overwing engine inlet was covered by a low-RCS grid; during takeoffs, when more air is needed, blow-in doors were constructed at the upper fuselage to admit additional airflow.|$|E
2500|$|The unusual {{aspects of}} the design were the {{butterfly}} or <b>V-tail</b> and engine layout that led to its popular nickname, [...] "Twin Quad." [...] The four engines were buried in the wings, with each pair of engines connected to a single propeller via clutches and a common gear box. The engines were horizontally opposed eight-cylinder air-cooled Lycoming GSO-580s (GSO denoting Geared Supercharged and Opposed, with each engine featuring a built-in reduction gear box {{in addition to the}} common propeller gear box). The engines were rated at 400 horsepower at 3,300 rpm. The tail was unusual because unlike the vertical and two horizontal surfaces found on most aircraft, the Twin-Quad's was a two-surface <b>V-tail</b> similar to the tail fitted to Beechcraft's other new product at the time, the Model 35 Bonanza. The <b>V-tail</b> configuration was flight-tested on a twin-engine Beech AT-10.|$|E
2500|$|The BZ-1 has a {{retractable}} monowheel landing gear, a <b>V-tail</b> and {{was built}} from aluminium. At {{the time of}} its completion in 1983 the designer intended to add water ballast tanks to allow the carriage of [...] of water. The BZ-1 had its first flight on September 13, 1984.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature was the Y-shaped empennage. [...] Two stabilizers pointed upward at an angle, {{similar to those}} on a <b>V-tail</b> aircraft, and a short vertical stabilizer pointed downward. [...] However, unlike conventional V-tails, there was no pitch/yaw control mixing on the Lear Fan. [...] The downward-pointing rudder also served to protect the propeller from ground strikes during takeoff and landing.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "flying" [...] boom is {{so named}} because flight control surfaces, small movable {{airfoils}} that are often in a <b>V-tail</b> configuration, are used to move the boom by creating aerodynamic forces. They are actuated hydraulically and controlled by the boom operator using a control stick. The boom operator also telescopes the boom to make the connection with the receiver's receptacle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} from aluminium {{and has a}} <b>V-tail.</b> The constant-chord wing is made up from [...] eight aluminum honeycomb-sandwich structural panels and has large flaps, using up , or 70%, of the [...] wingspan. The wing uses a NACA 65 (3)-618 airfoil, the same profile as the HP-8. Some HP-10s were finished with Helisoar-produced fiberglass Hoerner wingtips. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel.|$|E
2500|$|The Eclipse 400 [...] {{was first}} {{publicly}} unveiled on 23 July 2007 at AirVenture as the Eclipse Concept Jet (ECJ). The aircraft {{was intended to}} compete with the Cirrus Vision SF50, the Piper PA-47 PiperJet, the Epic Victory, and the Diamond D-Jet in the single-engine jet market. The Eclipse 400 design featured one engine, four seats and a <b>V-tail</b> similar to the Cirrus Jet.|$|E
2500|$|The XFV was {{powered by}} a [...] Allison YT40-A-6 {{turboprop}} engine driving three-bladed contra-rotating propellers. The tail surfaces were a reflected cruciform <b>v-tail</b> (forming an x) that extended {{above and below the}} fuselage. The aircraft had [...] an ungainly appearance on the ground with a makeshift, fixed landing gear attached. Lockheed employees derisively nicknamed the aircraft the [...] "pogo stick" [...] (a direct reference to the rival Convair XFY's name).|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was of a}}ll-metal construction, except for its fiberglass nose cone. The wing was of a [...] span, employed a NACA 63-618A airfoil and featured large dive brakes. The wing was a three-piece design, with a centre section and two wing tips. Due to its large wing area it was nicknamed [...] "Aluminum Overcast". The tail was a conventional low tail, in contrast to Prue's favoured <b>V-tail</b> on earlier designs. The landing gear was a retractable monowheel.|$|E
2500|$|The Scimitar {{stemmed from}} a number of designs from Supermarine for a naval jet aircraft, {{initially}} to a requirement for an undercarriage-less fighter aircraft to land on flexible [...] "sprung" [...] rubber decks. which would allow for a lighter and simpler structure. Supermarine's design to meet this requirement was the Type 505, featuring a thin, straight wing and a <b>V-tail</b> (or [...] "butterfly tail") to keep the tail surfaces away from the jet exhausts, and to be powered by two Rolls-Royce Avon turbojets, mounted side-by-side in the fuselage. In 1948, the Admiralty had second thoughts about the undercarriage-less fighter and Supermarine reworked their design by including a nosewheel undercarriage, becoming the Type 508. The Vickers-Supermarine Type 508 was the first Scimitar ancestor and shared the layout of the Type 505, i.e. a twin-engined straight-winged type with a <b>V-tail.</b> Pitch control was by moving the whole tail, with elevators for additional pitch control when working in tandem and to replace the rudder on a conventional tail when working differentially. Ailerons were fitted to the wings for lateral control and leading and trailing edge flaps were also fitted to the wings. An order for three Type 508s was placed in November 1947, to Specification N.9/47.|$|E
2500|$|Another, {{but more}} conventional, design aspect {{was that the}} belly was made strong enough to sustain minimal damage {{in the event of}} a [...] "wheels-up" [...] landing, with {{built-in}} integral landing keels or [...] "skids." [...] The wing measured [...] from tip to tip and the fuselage was [...] long. [...] With the top of the <b>V-tail</b> almost [...] above the ground and a design maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 20,000lbs, the Model 34 is to date the largest and heaviest Beechcraft civil design, with only the smaller XA-38 Grizzly military aircraft outweighing it.|$|E
2500|$|The Eolo's {{fuselage}} was a wood framed, ply skinned semi-monocoque of elliptical cross-section. [...] Behind {{a pointed}} nose the pilot sat under a long, one piece canopy which extended rearwards {{almost to the}} wing leading edge where it was smoothly blended into the fuselage. It had a <b>V-tail</b> with surfaces at 110°; these were straight tapered and ended in salmons, like the wings. [...] The elevators were equipped with trim tabs. [...] The glider had a monowheel undercarriage, equipped with a brake, which retracted behind two doors. [...] There was also a sprung tailskid and a small protective nose skid.|$|E
2500|$|GE Aviation will {{manufacture}} {{the engines}} for the V-280, with the prototype (air vehicle concept demonstrator, or AVCD) using the General Electric T64. [...] The specific engine {{for the model}} performance specification (MPS) is unknown, but has funding from the Army's future affordable turbine engine (FATE) program. The <b>V-tail</b> structure and ruddervators, made by GKN, will provide high levels of maneuverability and control to the airframe. [...] It will be made {{of a combination of}} metals and composites. Features in the interior include seats that wirelessly charge troops’ radios, night-vision goggles, and other electronic gear and windows that display three-dimensional mission maps.|$|E
