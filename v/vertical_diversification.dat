50|$|In {{corporate}} portfolio models, diversification {{is thought}} of as being vertical or horizontal. Horizontal diversification is {{thought of as}} expanding a product line or acquiring related companies. <b>Vertical</b> <b>diversification</b> is synonymous with integrating the supply chain or amalgamating distributions channels.|$|E
50|$|Diversification {{is an area}} {{included}} in the Ansoff Matrix strategy, where the most risk for a business is situated. This {{is due to the}} use of a new product being introduced to a new market, so there are no already existing target markets or competition. There are two types of diversification, vertical and horizontal. Horizontal diversification is when a new product is introduced but doesn’t contribute to the already existing product line. Meaning horizontal diversification focuses more on product that the business has knowledge about, whereas <b>vertical</b> <b>diversification</b> focuses more on the introduction of new product onto new markets, where the business could have less knowledge of the ne market. A benefit of horizontal diversification is that it is an open platform for a business to expand and build away from the already existing market. A disadvantage of using a Diversification strategy is that the benefits could take a while to start showing, which could lead the business to believing that the strategy doesn’t work. Another disadvantage or risk is, {{it has been shown that}} using the horizontal diversification method has become harmful for stock value, but using the <b>vertical</b> <b>diversification</b> had the best effects.|$|E
50|$|The {{approach}} {{acknowledges the}} issues of the lead user or the <b>vertical</b> <b>diversification,</b> takes up and enhances various elements of design thinking, and - deviating from previous approaches - always takes the use of socio-technical products as its premise. Training, detailed information (market research, roles or persona and user journeys) and interdisciplinary cooperation should allow product developers to become aware of how and for what the development is going to be used, and to regard its usage from all relevant perspectives. This form of consideration helps to establish a useful diversity in the early phases of the product development that is not influenced by hierarchies and battles for position.Additionally, UPD follows a normative process - in contrast to design thinking etc. that consider its procedures as non-binding guidelines that don't limit innovation potentials.Based on the stringent usage-centred inclusion of all potential requirements from various perspectives, the engineers try to ensure technical feasibility, market acceptance and unique selling propositions. Considering the separate usage phases from various perspectives is an important aspect. The phases are subsequently used for scenarios to form role-based use cases that are weighted by quality and quantity criteria. Thus, the so-called main use cases emerge, which are needed for accomplishing a minimum of acceptance. It is necessary to identify all possible use cases, all perspectives and scenarios to identify the market acceptance as well as beneficial potentials by combining all detected variables. Simultaneously, product demands on the user should be minimised in order to create accessible and low-threshold solutions.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{maintains}} that transaction cost analysis provides a well grounded theoretical foundation for strategic management research. The paradigmatic issues involve vertical integration theory, {{the evolution of}} vertical integration in the American enterprise, diversification and the multidivisional structure as an adaptation to <b>vertical</b> integration and <b>diversification</b> strategies. ^ The thesis also {{maintains that}} the study of vertical financial ownership requires a study of market inadequacies and a comparative institutional assessment of governance structures. A comprehensive synthesis concerning the isomorphic nature of vertical financial ownership and vertical contracting is provided. I submit that task programmability, nonseparability, and asset specificity are critical variables in explaining and predicting organizational form. ^ In contrast to orthodox microeconomics, where history does not matter, this thesis maintains {{that the study of}} history is an essential ingredient of institutional analysis. The combination of institutional economics with history and organization theory, it is argued, provides a richer and more relevant {{understanding of the nature of}} the firm. The study of entrepreneurs groping with the agency problems inherent in the distribution and service of technologically complex goods, provides a wealth of insights in understanding our institutions of capitalism. ^ This thesis provides a transaction cost analysis of <b>vertical</b> integration, <b>diversification</b> and multidivisional structure. Transaction cost economics views both the adoption of the vertical integration strategy and the implementation of the multidivisional structure in terms of information processing advantages and in terms of mitigating agency problems. ^ A triangulation of theoretical, historical, and statistical methodology is employed. The enterprise is viewed as having resource allocations efficiency relative to contracting and the external capital market. An eclectic model of the multidivisional organization, derived from the economic and organizational theory literature is empirically tested. The model illustrates the central premise of the thesis that pluralism increases empirical content and should be valued by those concerned with progress in the emerging field of strategic management. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt is {{frequently}} suggested that export diversification contributes to an acceleration {{of growth in}} developing countries. Horizontal export diversification into completely new export sectors may generate positive externalities {{on the rest of}} the economy as export oriented sectors gain from dynamic learning activities due to contacts to foreign purchasers and exposure to international competition. <b>Vertical</b> <b>diversification</b> out of primary into manufactured exports is also associated with growth since primary export sectors prevalently do not exhibit strong spillovers. Yet there have been remarkably few empirical investigations into the link between export diversification and growth. This paper attempts to examine the hypothesis that export diversification is linked to economic growth via externalities of learning-by-doing and learning-by-exporting fostered by competition in world markets. The diversification-led growth hypothesis is tested by estimating an augmented Cobb-Douglas production function on the basis of annual time series data from Chile. Based on the theory of cointegration three types of statistical methodologies are used: the Johansen trace-test, a multivariate error-correction model and the dynamic OLS procedure. Given structural changes in the Chilean economy, time series techniques considering structural breaks are applied.

We will review how horizontal institutional differentiation has been jumpstarted with the introduction of private universities and other structural changes in the system.

If parasitoids are specialists on herbivore niches rather than on herbivore taxa, then alternating escape of herbivores into novel niches and delayed resource tracking by parasitoids could fuel diversification at both trophic levels. We used DNA barcoding to identify parasitoids that attack larvae of seven Pontania sawfly species that induce leaf galls on eight willow species growing in subarctic and arctic–alpine habitats in three geographic locations in northern Fennoscandia, and then applied distance- and model-based multivariate analyses and phylogenetic regression methods to evaluate the hierarchical importance of location, phylogeny and different galler niche dimensions on parasitoid host use. We found statistically significant variation in parasitoid communities across geographic locations and willow host species, but the differences were mainly quantitative due to extensive sharing of enemies among gallers within habitat types. By contrast, the divide between habitats defined two qualitatively different network compartments, because many common parasitoids exhibited strong habitat preference. Galler and parasitoid phylogenies did not explain associations, because distantly related arctic–alpine gallers were attacked by a species-poor enemy community dominated by two parasitoid species that most likely have independently tracked the gallers’ evolutionary shifts into the novel habitat. Our results indicate that barcode- and phylogeny-based analyses of food webs that span forested vs. tundra or grassland environments could improve our understanding of <b>vertical</b> <b>diversification</b> effects in complex plant–herbivore–parasitoid networks. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the vast deposit of {{resources}} and human endowments in ECOWAS region, gains from trade have really been marginal in the region. ECOWAS members have poor performance in export of dynamic products; they remained commodity dependent in its exports, leading to transfer of economic gains across border. Over 90 % of the region’s export is primary products with very little value-added which accentuated from commodity price and demand inelasticity resulting in terms of trade losses and volatile foreign earnings. Based on these facts, the study tries to investigate the impact of export diversification and composition on GDP growth and GDP per capita respectively. This was achieved using econometric analyses involving co-integration technique and a panel least square technique {{for the period of}} 1975 - 2009 and 1990 - 2007 respectively in 15 ECOWAS states. The study was deemed significant, as export diversification and manufacturing value-added index induced a positive and significant impact on per capita income growth. The study found high skewness of ECOWAS to commodity export in the period observed but a <b>vertical</b> <b>diversification</b> of product base would emanates more spill-over and surplus gains from the regions endowments. The conclusive finding centred on that fact that it is not how much that is exported that matters but very important is what is exported as regions with less specialization and more diversified exports generally experienced higher economic growth rates and contributed much more to overall exports. Notable recommendation for ECOWAS policy makers is the need to develop domestic processing capability and see export as originating from domestic sufficiency. ...|$|E
