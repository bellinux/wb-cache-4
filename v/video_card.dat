5|$|PCs with a DVI {{interface}} {{are capable}} of video output to an HDMI-enabled monitor. Some PCs include an HDMI interface and may also be capable of HDMI audio output, depending on specific hardware. For example, Intel's motherboard chipsets since the 945G and NVIDIAâ€™s GeForce 8200/8300 motherboard chipsets {{are capable of}} 8-channel LPCM output over HDMI. Eight-channel LPCM audio output over HDMI with a <b>video</b> <b>card</b> was first seen with the ATI Radeon HD 4850, which was released in June 2008 and is implemented by other video cards in the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series. Linux can drive 8-channel LPCM audio over HDMI if the <b>video</b> <b>card</b> has the necessary hardware and implements the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). The ATI Radeon HD 4000 series implements ALSA. Cyberlink announced in June 2008 that they would update their PowerDVD playback software to allow 192kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding in Q3-Q4 of 2008. Corel's WinDVD 9 Plus currently has 96kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{an eighth}} dual-GPU <b>video</b> <b>card,</b> the single-GPU GTX 275 {{is in the}} {{computer}} because, {{out of all the}} video cards in the Fastra II, the GTX 275 is the only one the Fastra II's BIOS can fully initialize. The total amount of GPUs is 13. The video cards together bring 12 teraflops of computing power. Four of the six GTX 295 video cards have 2 PCBs, while the other two have only 1 PCB.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{benchmarks}} on {{its official}} website, the Fastra II is {{faster and more}} power efficient than its competitors, including the Fastra I and the Tesla C1060 <b>video</b> <b>card.</b> The benchmarks were performed on the Fastra II, the Fastra I, a 512-core cluster (consisting of Opteron CPUs), an Nvidia Tesla C1060 workstation card on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The Fastra II is over three {{times faster than the}} Fastra I in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the Fastra II consumes more power than the Fastra I, it's nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the Fastra I, and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees Celsius when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius at full load.|$|E

5000|$|As of 2016, {{the primary}} {{suppliers}} of the GPUs (video chips or chipsets) used in <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> are AMD and Nvidia. In {{the third quarter}} of 2013, AMD had a 35.5% market share while Nvidia had a 64.5% market share, according to Jon Peddie Research. In economics, this industry structure is termed a duopoly. AMD and Nvidia also build and sell <b>video</b> <b>cards,</b> which are termed graphics add-in-board (AIBs) in the industry. (See Comparison of Nvidia graphics processing units and Comparison of AMD graphics processing units.) In addition to marketing their own <b>video</b> <b>cards,</b> AMD and Nvidia sell their GPUs to authorized AIB suppliers, which AMD and Nvidia refer to as [...] "partners". The fact that Nvidia and AMD compete directly with their customer/partners complicates relationships in the industry. The fact that AMD and Intel are direct competitors in the CPU industry is also noteworthy, since AMD-based <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> may be used in computers with Intel CPUs. Intel's move to APUs may weaken AMD, which until now has derived a significant portion of its revenue from graphics components. As of the second quarter of 2013, there were 52 AIB suppliers. These AIB suppliers may market <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> under their own brands, or produce <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> for private label brands or produce <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> for computer manufacturers. Some AIB suppliers such as MSI build both AMD-based and Nvidia-based <b>video</b> <b>cards.</b> Others, such as EVGA, build only Nvidia-based <b>video</b> <b>cards,</b> while XFX, now builds only AMD-based <b>video</b> <b>cards.</b> Several AIB suppliers are also motherboard suppliers. The largest AIB suppliers, based on global retail market share for graphics cards, include Taiwan-based Palit Microsystems, Hong Kong-based PC Partner (which markets AMD-based <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> under its Sapphire brand and Nvidia-based <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> under its Zotac brand), Taiwan-based computer-maker Asustek Computer (Asus), Taiwan-based Micro-Star International (MSI), Taiwan-based Gigabyte Technology, Brea, California, USA-based EVGA (which also sells computer components such as power supplies) and Ontario, California USA-based XFX.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Duke Nukem 3D in 1996, id Software {{released}} the much anticipated Quake. Like Doom, Quake was influential and genre-defining, featuring fast-paced, gory gameplay, but used 3D polygons instead of sprites. It was centered on online gaming and featured multiple match types still found in first-person shooter games today. It was the first FPS game to have a following of player clans (although the concept had existed previously in MechWarrior 2 (Netmech) with its Battletech lore as well as amongst MUD players), and would inspire popular LAN parties such as QuakeCon. The game's popularity and use of 3D polygonal graphics also helped to expand the growing market for <b>video</b> <b>card</b> hardware; and the additional support and encouragement for game modifications attracted players who wanted to tinker with the game and create their own modules. According to creator John Romero, Quakes 3D world was inspired by the 3D fighting game Virtua Fighter. Quake was also intended to expand the genre with Virtua Fighter influenced melee brawling, but this was eventually dropped from the final game.|$|E
5|$|The goal of Lost Coast was to {{demonstrate}} the new high-dynamic-range rendering implemented into the Source game engine. Valve first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in RGBA color space, allowing for multisample anti-aliasing and pixel shaders to be used, but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged. The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, {{and the other with}} overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing and consumed twice as much <b>video</b> <b>card</b> memory, making it infeasible. The third method, shown at the E3 convention in 2005, used floating point data to define the RGB color space, allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing, and was only compatible with Nvidia video cards, leaving ATI cards unable to run high dynamic range. The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR in a different way to the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.|$|E

50|$|VIVO {{is found}} {{predominantly}} on high-end ATI <b>video</b> <b>cards,</b> {{although a few}} high-end NVIDIA <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> also have this port. VIVO on these graphics cards typically supports Composite, S-Video, and Component as outputs, and composite and S-Video as inputs. Many other <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> only support component and/or S-Video outputs to complement Video Graphics Array or DVI, typically using a component breakout cable and an S-Video cable.|$|R

5000|$|... 24-bit {{graphics}} <b>cards</b> and <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> {{were also}} available. Graphics cards were designed primarily for 2D artwork production, workstation use, and later, gaming. <b>Video</b> <b>cards</b> {{are designed for}} inputting and outputting video signals, and processing and manipulating video.|$|R
25|$|Electro Body {{was noted}} for its low system requirements. The game {{supported}} every <b>video</b> <b>card</b> on the Polish market, including the Hercules Graphics Card, CGA, EGA and VGA cards; it also supported numerous audio devices, including the PC speaker, Covox Speech Thing or the Sound Blaster. A special release of the game came with a Covox device included in the box.|$|E
25|$|VLC, {{like most}} {{multimedia}} frameworks, {{has a very}} modular design which {{makes it easier to}} include modules/plugins for new file formats, codecs, interfaces, or streaming methods. VLC 1.0.0 has more than 380 modules. The VLC core creates its own graph of modules dynamically, depending on the situation: input protocol, input file format, input codec, <b>video</b> <b>card</b> capabilities and other parameters. In VLC, almost everything is a module, like interfaces, video and audio outputs, controls, scalers, codecs, and audio/video filters.|$|E
25|$|DirectShow 6.0, {{released}} {{as part of}} DirectX Media introduced the Overlay Mixer renderer designed for DVD playback and broadcast video streams with closed captioning and subtitles. The Overlay Mixer uses DirectDraw 5 for rendering. Downstream connection with the Video Renderer is required for window management. Overlay Mixer also supports Video Port Extensions (VPE), enabling it to work with analog TV tuners with overlay capability (sending video directly to a <b>video</b> <b>card</b> via an analog link rather than via the PCI bus). Overlay Mixer also supports DXVA connections. Because it always renders in overlay, full-screen video to TV-out is always activated.|$|E
5|$|Overheating {{caused by}} the lack of space between the <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> forces {{researchers}} using the FASTRA II to keep the side panel door open, so that the <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> can get regular air, decreasing the overall temperature inside the case.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of modern <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> are built with either AMD-sourced or Nvidia-sourced graphics chips. Until 2000, 3dfx Interactive {{was also an}} important, and often groundbreaking, manufacturer. Most <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> offer various functions such as accelerated rendering of 3D scenes and 2D graphics, MPEG-2/MPEG-4 decoding, TV output, {{or the ability to}} connect multiple monitors (multi-monitor). <b>Video</b> <b>cards</b> also have sound card capabilities to output sound - along with the video for connected TVs or monitors with integrated speakers.|$|R
50|$|HYDRA Engine is a {{brand name}} for a multi-GPU {{solution}} developed by Lucid Logix. Similar to nVidia's SLI and ATI's Crossfire-technologies, Hydra allows linking several <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> together producing a single output and higher performance. Unlike SLI and CrossFire however, Hydra allows <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> from different chip manufactures to be linked together. Lucid claims it can do so with near to linear scaling of performance, i.e. two <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> equals twice the performance. The technology consists of both hardware on the motherboard and device drivers.|$|R
25|$|Direct3D 10.1 is an {{incremental}} update of Direct3D 10.0 which shipped with, and required, Windows Vista Service Pack 1. This release mainly sets {{a few more}} image quality standards for graphics vendors, while giving developers more control over image quality. It also adds support for cube map arrays, separate blend modes per-MRT, coverage mask export from a pixel shader, ability to run pixel shader per sample, access to multi-sampled depth buffers and requires that the <b>video</b> <b>card</b> supports Shader Model 4.1 or higher and 32-bit floating-point operations. Direct3D 10.1 still fully supports Direct3D 10 hardware, {{but in order to}} utilize all of the new features, updated hardware is required.|$|E
25|$|Like all thin clients, {{when using}} X across a network, {{bandwidth}} limitations can impede {{the use of}} bitmap-intensive applications that require rapidly updating large portions of the screen with low latency, such as 3D animation or photo editing. Even a relatively small uncompressed 640x480x24bit 30fps video stream can easily outstrip the bandwidth of a 100Mbit/s network for a single client. In contrast, modern versions of X generally have extensions such as MESA allowing local display of a local program's graphics to be optimized to bypass the network model and directly control the <b>video</b> <b>card,</b> for use of full-screen video, rendered 3D applications, and other such applications.|$|E
25|$|Conceived and co-designed by Nick Bruty, MDK was Shiny's first PC game, and was {{notable for}} using {{software}} rendering, requiring a Pentium or equivalent microprocessor, rather than necessitating any GPU enhancements, despite its large 3D levels and complex polygon-based enemies. As the developers were attempting things {{never before seen}} in a PC game, they had to write their own programming language from scratch. Additionally, when in sniper mode, the player {{has the ability to}} zoom up to 100x, but the developers chose not to employ any of the standard solutions to pop-up, such as clipping or fogging. They also worked to ensure the game ran at a minimum of 30fps at all times on all machines. The game's original system requirements were a 60MHz Pentium, 16MB of RAM, 17MB of hard drive storage, an SVGA compatible <b>video</b> <b>card,</b> and a Sound Blaster or equivalent sound card; modest specs even {{by the standards of the}} time.|$|E
50|$|HyperMemory was a brand for ATI's {{method of}} using the {{motherboard}}'s main system RAM as part of {{or all of the}} <b>video</b> <b>card's</b> framebuffer memory on their line of Radeon <b>video</b> <b>cards</b> and motherboard chipsets. It relies on new fast data transfer mechanisms within PCI Express.|$|R
50|$|Video Immersion is {{the name}} of a set of {{computer}} graphics processing technologies, used by ATI Technologies in their Radeon <b>video</b> <b>cards.</b> It is the brand name ATI uses to refer to the video compression acceleration feature in their R100, R200, and R300 <b>video</b> <b>cards.</b> <b>Video</b> Immersion is present in R100 based cards, and ATI introduced Video Immersion II with the R200.|$|R

25|$|The 256-element free Boolean algebra {{on three}} {{generators}} is deployed in computer displays based on raster graphics, which use bit blit to manipulate whole regions consisting of pixels, relying on Boolean operations to specify how the source region should {{be combined with}} the destination, typically {{with the help of}} a third region called the mask. Modern video cards offer all 223=256 ternary operations for this purpose, with the choice of operation being a one-byte (8-bit) parameter. The constants SRC = 0xaa or 10101010, DST = 0xcc or 11001100, and MSK = 0xf0 or 11110000 allow Boolean operations such as (SRC^DST) (meaning XOR the source and destination and then AND the result with the mask) to be written directly as a constant denoting a byte calculated at compile time, 0x60 in the (SRC^DST) example, 0x66 if just SRC^DST, etc. At run time the <b>video</b> <b>card</b> interprets the byte as the raster operation indicated by the original expression in a uniform way that requires remarkably little hardware and which takes time completely independent of the complexity of the expression.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{data was}} simply passed one-way from a central {{processing}} unit (CPU) to a graphics processing unit (GPU), then to a display device. However, as time progressed, it became valuable for GPUs to store at first simple, then complex structures of data to be passed back to the CPU that analyzed an image, or a set of scientific-data represented as a 2D or 3D format that a <b>video</b> <b>card</b> can understand. Because the GPU has access to every draw operation, it can analyze data in these forms quickly, whereas a CPU must poll every pixel or data element much more slowly, as the speed of access between a CPU and its larger pool of random-access memory (or in an even worse case, a hard drive) is slower than GPUs and video cards, which typically contain smaller amounts of more expensive memory that is much faster to access. Transferring {{the portion of the}} data set to be actively analyzed to that GPU memory in the form of textures or other easily readable GPU forms results in speed increase. The distinguishing feature of a GPGPU design is the ability to transfer information bidirectionally back from the GPU to the CPU; generally the data throughput in both directions is ideally high, resulting in a multiplier effect on the speed of a specific high-use algorithm. GPGPU pipelines may improve efficiency on especially large data sets and/or data containing 2D or 3D imagery. It is used in complex graphics pipelines as well as scientific computing; more so in fields with large data sets like genome mapping, or where two- or three-dimensional analysis is useful especially at present biomolecule analysis, protein study, and other complex organic chemistry. Such pipelines can also vastly improve efficiency in image processing and computer vision, among other fields; as well as parallel processing generally. Some very heavily optimized pipelines have yielded speed increases of several hundred times the original CPU-based pipeline on one high-use task.|$|E
