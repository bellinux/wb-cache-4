40|$|A commercially {{available}} cryogenic direct- acting solenoid valve has been modified to incorporate a rapid-chill feature. The {{net effect of}} the modifications is to divert some of the cryogenic liquid {{to the task of}} cooling the remainder of the cryogenic liquid that flows to the outlet. Among the modifications are the addition of several holes and a gallery into a valve-seat retainer and the addition of a narrow <b>vent</b> <b>passage</b> from the gallery to the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Several {{instruments}} {{including the}} Cahn Microbalance the Knudsen Cell, the micro-CVCM, and the vacuum Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) {{were used in}} the testing of a graphite epoxy (GR/EP) composite that is proposed for use as a rigidizing element of an inflatable deployment system. This GR/EP will be cured in situ. The purpose of this testing is to estimate the gaseous production resulting from the curing of the GR/EP composite, to predict the resulting pressure, and to calculate the required venting. Every test was conducted under vacuum at 125 C for 24 hours. Upon comparison of the results, the ASTM E- 595 was noted to have given readings that were consistently lower than those obtained using the other instruments, which otherwise provided similar results. The GR/EP was tested using several different geometric arrangements. This paper describes the analysis evaluating the molecular and continuum flow of the outgassing products issuing from the exit port of the ASTM E- 595 system. The effective flow conductance provided by the physical dimensions of the <b>vent</b> <b>passage</b> of the ASTM E- 595 system and that of the material sample among other factors were investigated to explain the reduced amount of outgassing released during the 24 -hour test perio...|$|E
40|$|A flueric beam-deflection {{amplifier}} and {{a method}} of controlling the same are described. Either a single or a series of cascaded fluid amplifier units are provided and each one of which may include the usual power nozzle, control nozzles, outlet <b>passages</b> and <b>vent</b> <b>passages.</b> All <b>vent</b> <b>passages</b> of each fluid amplifier unit lead to an enclosed vent outlet chamber which {{is connected to the}} ambient environment or to a return manifold through a variably restricted passage. To control the fluid amplifier unit, power and control stream pressures are first established, after which the restricted passage is reduced to regulate the input bias, the gain and the input impedance of the fluid amplifier unit...|$|R
40|$|Contaminants from an instrument's self-generated sources or {{from sources}} {{external}} to the instrument may degrade its critical surfaces and/or create an environment which limits the instrument's intended performance. Analyses {{have been carried out}} on a method to investigate the required purging flow of clean, dry gas to prevent the ingestion of external contaminants into the instrument container volume. The pressure to be maintained and the required flow are examined in terms of their effectiveness in preventing gaseous and particulate contaminant ingestion and abatement of self-generated contaminants in the volume. The required venting area or the existing volume venting area is correlated to the volume to be purged, the allowable pressure differential across the volume, the external contaminant partial pressure, and the sizes of the ambient particulates. The diffusion of external water vapor into the volume while it was being purged was experimentally obtained in terms of an infiltration time constant. That data and the acceptable fraction of the outside pressure into the volume indicate the required flow of purge gas expressed in terms of volume change per unit time. The exclusion of particulates is based on the incoming velocity of the particles and the exit flow speed and density of the purge gas. The purging flow pressures needed to maintain the required flows through the <b>vent</b> <b>passages</b> are indicated. The purge gas must prevent or limit the entrance of the external contaminants to the critical locations of the instrument. It should also prevent self- contamination from surfaces, reduce material outgassing, and sweep out the outgassed products. Systems and facilities that can benefit from purging may be optical equipment, clinical facilities, manufacturing facilities, clean rooms, and other systems requiring clean environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{life of a}} {{space system}} may be {{critically}} dependent on the lubrication {{of some of its}} moving parts. The vapor pressure, the quantity of the available lubricant, the temperature and the exhaust <b>venting</b> conductance <b>passage</b> are important considerations in the selection and application of a lubricant. In addition, the oil additives employed to provide certain properties of low friction, surface tension, antioxidant and load bearing characteristics, are also very important and need to be known with regard to their amounts and vapor pressures. This paper reports on the measurements and analyses carried out to obtain those parameters for two often employed lubricants, the Apiezon(TM) -C and the Krytox(TM) AB. The measurements were made employing an electronic microbalance and a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) modified to operate in a vacuum. The results have been compared to other data on these oils when available. The identification of the mass fractions of the additives in the oil and their vapor pressures {{as a function of the}} temperature were carried out. These may be used to estimate the lubricant life given its quantity and the system vent exhaust conductance. It was found that the Apiezon(TM) -C has three main components with different rates of evaporation while the Krytox(TM) did not indicate any measurable additive...|$|R
40|$|Larval fish drift and {{distribution}} patterns were {{studied in the}} Lohajang River, {{a tributary of the}} Jamuna River (Bangladesh) during the monsoon seasons (June-October) of 1992, 1993 and 1994. Larval fish drift pulsed with peaks related to water levels of the Jamuna River In all three years Indian carps Catl catla, Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala were associated with e first pulses but were absent from drift samples after September. Hilsa species and other non-identified fish species were found throughout the monsoon season. The highest larval fish densities were found in the upper strata of the river, near the shore. Drift densities for these fishes were temporally homogeneous within days. Water turbidity probably influenced vertical and horizontal distribution patterns and the absence of diel distribution patterns. The results were used for the design and construction of a major regulator for the water management of Lohajang River and its surrounding floodplains. The regulator consisted of three main vents for water regulation and two side <b>vents</b> for <b>passages</b> of drifting fish larvae. In 1998 / 99 the impact of the regulator on drifting larvae was measured indicating a mortality rate of 10 % for larvae passing through the fish gates and mortality rates of 11. 8 % and 44 % for larvae passing through the main gates if operated in respectively overshot and undershot mode. This impact is discussed in relation to declining yields of riverine fish and the construction of fish passes in the floodplains of Bangladesh and it was concluded that improvement of existing regulators to wards operating in overshot mode could be more cost effective then the construction of new fish passes. Key words: larval fish drift, Indian carps, Hilsa spp., diel and spatial distributio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{three different}} methods {{which can be}} used to quantify passive ventilation inside small livestock trailers. Accomplishing this is crucial to determine whether animal welfare ventilation standards are met during road transport. High-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are conducted for a detailed livestock trailer containing 48 sheep and coupled to a generic towing vehicle. An initial correlation study shows that the observed airflow patterns share the general flow structure with an equivalent but simplified geometry which has previously been validated. Further analysis of the detailed geometry shows that twice as much air flows through the upper deck of the trailer compared to the lower deck which is due to a tailboard <b>vent</b> allowing easier <b>passage</b> to the low-pressure wake. Ventilation is analysed using the net flow rate through vent openings {{along the side of the}} trailer; it is found to be below the regulatory threshold for vehicle speeds of up to 17. 9 m/s on the lower deck and 8. 9 m/s on the upper one. One drawback of this analysis method is that it does not consider ventilation efficacy within the interior. In order to address this, two additional methods are proposed to identify ventilation rates using (i) passive scalars and (ii) a particle tracking algorithm. The former method suggests that the greatest residence time is 30. 0 s with the latter indicating a value of 19. 5 s; both of these occur in the vicinity of one animal muzzle, in a stagnant airflow region of the lower deck. All three analysis methods are compared to EU-specified regulatory ventilation rates in the form of a ventilation coefficient. Overall, ventilation is shown to be significantly better on the upper deck of the trailer, satisfying current livestock transport regulations at moderate to high vehicle speeds, whereas ventilation is markedly less on the lower deck and potentially below the regulatory threshold...|$|R
