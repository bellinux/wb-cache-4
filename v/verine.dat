5000|$|Adaptive {{management}} as a systematic process for improving environmental management {{policies and practices}} is the traditional application however, the adaptive management framework can also be applied to other sectors seeking sustainability solutions such as business and community development. Adaptive {{management as}} a strategy emphasizes the need to change with the environment and to learn from doing. Adaptive management applied to ecosystems makes overt sense when considering ever changing environmental conditions. The flexibility and constant learning of an adaptive management approach is also a logical application for organizations seeking sustainability methodologies.Businesses pursuing sustainability strategies would employ an adaptive management framework {{to ensure that the}} organization is prepared for the unexpected and geared for change. By applying an adaptive management approach the business begins to function as an integrated system adjusting and learning from a multi-faceted network of influences not just environmental but also, economic and social (Dunphy, Griffths, & Benn, 2007). The goal of any sustainable organization guided by adaptive management principals must be to engage in active learning to direct change towards sustainability (<b>Verine,</b> 2008). This [...] "learning to manage by managing to learn" [...] (Bormann BT, 1993) will be at the core of a sustainable business strategy.|$|E
50|$|The Latin of the panegyrics {{is that of}} a Golden Age Latin base, {{derived from}} an {{education}} heavy on Cicero, mixed with a large number of Silver Age usages and a small number of Late and Vulgar terms. To students of Latin in Late Antiquity, Cicero and Virgil represented the paragons of the language; as such, the panegyrists made frequent use of them. Virgil's Aeneid is the favorite source, the Georgics the second favorite, and the Eclogues a distant third. (Other poets are much less popular: there are infrequent allusions to Horace, and one complete borrowing from Ovid.) When drawing from Cicero's body of work, the panegyrists looked first to those works where he expressed admiration and contempt. As a source of praise, Cicero's panegyric of Pompey in support of the Manilian law (De Imperio Cn. Pompei) was quite popular. It is echoed thirty-six times in the collection, across nine or ten of the eleven late panegyrics. Cicero's three orations in honor of Julius Caesar were also useful. Of these, the panegyrists were especially fond of the Pro Marcello; across eight panegyrics there are more than twelve allusions to the work. For vilification, the Catiline and <b>Verine</b> orations were the prominent sources (there are eleven citations to the former and eight to the latter work).|$|E
40|$|A membrane-bound monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) activity, {{previously}} {{demonstrated in}} intact human erythrocytes [Boyer, Somma, <b>Vérine,</b> L'Hôte, Finidori, Merger and Arnaud (1981) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 53, 143 - 148], {{has now been}} purified to apparent homogeneity by a five-step procedure involving solubilization in CHAPS and sequential chromatographies on Sephacryl S- 400, DEAE-Trisacryl, Zn(2 +) -chelating Sepharose and Superose 12 columns. The purified protein has a molecular mass of 68 +/- 2 kDa, as determined by SDS/PAGE and gel filtration, suggesting that the enzyme behaves as a monomer. The concentration-dependence of MAGL activity with monooleoylglycerol, the preferred substrate showed kinetics typical of an interfacial lipolytic enzyme displaying optimal activity on emulsified substrate particles; apparent Km values were 0. 27 mM and 0. 49 mM for the sn- 1 (3) - and sn- 2 -isomers respectively. MAGL had no, or negligible, activity towards tri-oleoylglycerol, di-oleoylglycerol, oleoylcholesterol, oleoyl-CoA and phosphatidylcholine; it was inhibited by di-isopropylfluorophosphate, PMSF and diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate, suggesting that MAGL is a serine hydrolase. MAGL activity was not modified by bile salt or apolipoprotein C-II, whereas a dose-dependent inhibition was observed with apolipoprotein A-I...|$|E

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that ethynyl oestradiol markedly decreases lipase activity in the liver (Valette, <b>Verine,</b> Salers & Boyer, 1977). These observations, along with reports of oestrogen receptors in the liver (Chamness, Costlow & McGuire, 1975) suggest that oestrogens exert considerable influence over the hepatic metabolism of lipids. Previous investigations (DeLorimier, Gordon, Lowe & Carbone, 1965; Gallagher, Mueller & Kappas, 1966) {{have suggested that the}} extent of the hepatic changes could be correlated with the molecular nature of the hormonal compound and might depend particularly on the 17 =aalkyl-substitutedgroup in synthetic oestrogens. The influence of the ethynyl function in the 17 =apositionof oestradiol- 17 =b the oestrogen-induced changes observed in hepatic lipases and serum levels of triglycerides has therefore been examined. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (220 - 240 g) were allowed free access to food and received oestradiol- 17 ß or ethynyl oestradiol (6 µg) by s. c. injection in 0 - 1 ml olive oil daily for 21 days. Controls received olive oil alone. The animals were killed and bled by decapita¬ tion. The liver was immediately excised, rinsed and homogenized at 4 °C with three 1 min passes in a glass-Teflon homogenizer in a solution (10 ml/g) containing 0 - 25 M-sucrose, 2 - 5...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{pluridisciplinary}} team of linguists {{and computer}} scientists {{collected more than}} 88, 000 French authentic SMS in Montpellier ([URL] {{within the context of}} a vast international project ([URL] coordinated by the CENTAL (UCL, Belgium). After semi-automatic treatment using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the anonymized text messages were made available to the research community and the general public as a corpus, entitled 88 milSMS ([URL] TEI/XML version: [URL] (Panckhurst et al. 2014, 2016 a, 2016 b). In this article, we examine the usage of emoji (e 絵, “picture”; moji 文字, “character”) in 88 milSMS. We have observed three main situations (partly inspired by Marcoccia & Gauducheau, 2007, Wilson, 1993) : 1. redundant addition: an emoji is used as well as written text, but it is not required in order to understand the SMS (within the context of the exchange); 2. necessary addition: an emoji is used as well as written text, and its inclusion is necessary in order to avoid misinterpretation; 3. lexical replacement: an emoji is used instead of a word. Emoji are more often used in addition (redundantly or necessarily, sometimes as ‘softeners’ (adoucisseurs, Détrie & <b>Verine,</b> 2014)) than for lexical replacement, denoting a reference/referential function (Referenzfunktion, Dürscheid & Siever, 2017). Emoji positioning appears in descending order: at the end, somewhere within the SMS and finally at the onset. Part-of-speech tagging (POS) and NLP software are used to annotate SMS containing emojis in order to investigate the grammatical environment. This allows more in-depth analysis of linguistic functions and to check sociolinguistic factors. In future research, it will be essential to diachronically compare our results with more recent data, emanating from: Swiss Whatsup ([URL] (Ueberwasser & Stark, 2017), Belgian Vos Pouces ([URL] (Cougnon et al., 2016) projects. Intercultural variation, crossplatform differences in graphical rendering (Miller et al., 2016) and ‘emoji semiotics’ (Danesi, 2017) will also be explored. This will enable one to visualize evolving mediated digital discourse several years down the track. Keywords: French SMS, emoji, 88 milSMS, mediated digital discourse (MDD) ...|$|E

The article draws chiefly on rectors’ reports to the Irish hierarchy in the Salamanca Archive, held in St. Patrick’s College, Maynooth, Co. Kildare, Ireland and on the papers of Alexander McCabe, rector of the College from 1935 - 49, held in the National Library of Ireland [...] A summer house (Casona de <b>Verines)</b> was purchased in the early 1920 s and thereafter the holidays were spent in Pendueles, Asturias. This article augments the small body of work that has been published to date on the 20 th century history of the Irish College, Salamanca, it documents the Irish presence in Asturias, adding further details to our knowledge of the evacuation of the students on the outbreak of the Spanish civil war. It recounts some of the impressions and experiences of Alexander McCabe as an eye witness to the civil war in Spain as documented in his reports and personal diaries. Two photographs showing the summer house (c. 1930 s) and a group photo of the students in 1916 are here published for the first time...|$|R
