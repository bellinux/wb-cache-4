40|$|In {{an attempt}} to manage the risk of {{mismatch}} between the actual claims and the anticipated claim amounts in motor insurance pool, we introduce a few new concepts of motor loss rate-linked securities such as motor loss rate options and motor loss rate swaps. These hybrid derivatives can transfer the motor insurance loss rate risks to the capital markets. For the valuation of the motor loss rate-linked securities, we assume that motor insurance aggregate claims follow a compound Poisson distribution. An Esscher transform is chosen for a risk adjusted measure change. Using the Fourier transform of the risk neutral distribution of increment of loss process and its inversion, we derive integral expressions {{of the price of}} a ratchet option and a fixed-for-floating plain <b>vanilla</b> <b>swap</b> on the motor loss rate. As illustrations, some numerical examples are given under a few specified assumptions on the distribution of the discounted losses and the parameters...|$|E

40|$|Consider a {{frictionless}} market trading {{a finite}} number of co-maturing European call and put options written on a risky asset plus an instrument with path-dependent payoff known as a weighted variance swap, e. g. a <b>vanilla</b> variance <b>swap</b> or a corridor variance swap. The question we ask is: Do the traded prices admit an arbitrage opportunity? We determine necessaryand sufficient model-free conditions {{for the price of a}} continuously monitored weighted variance swap to be consistent with absence of arbitrage. We discuss in detail the types of arbitrage that may arise when the determined conditions are not satisfied. In particular we find that prices of European call/puts are not enough for the upper bound price of the <b>vanilla</b> variance <b>swap</b> to be finite. We show that given an extra piece of information, namely the price of an additional asset, a finite bound can be explicitly determined. ...|$|R
40|$|Once upon a {{time there}} was a {{classical}} financial world in which all the Libors were equal. Standard textbooks taught that simple relations held, such that, for example, a 6 months Libor Deposit was replicable with a 3 months Libor Deposits plus a 3 x 6 months Forward Rate Agreement (FRA), and that Libor was a good proxy of the risk free rate required as basic building block of no-arbitrage pricing theory. Nowadays, in the modern financial world after the credit crunch, some Libors are more equal than others, depending on their rate tenor, and classical formulas are history. Banks are not anymore “too big to fail”, Libors are fixed by panels of risky banks, and they are risky rates themselves. These simple empirical facts carry very important consequences in derivative’s trading and risk management, such as, for example, basis risk, collateralization and regulatory pressure in favour of Central Counterparties. Something that should be carefully considered by anyone managing even a single plain <b>vanilla</b> <b>Swap.</b> In this qualitative note we review the problem trying to shed some light on this modern animal farm, recurring to an analogy with quantum physics, the Zeeman effect. ...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDIn {{this thesis}} we study {{a range of}} related {{commercial}} banking problems in discrete and continuous time settings. The ﬁrst problem is about a capital allocation strategy that optimizes the expected future value of a commercial bank’s total non-risk-weighted assets (TNRWAs) in terms of terminal time utility maximization. This entails ﬁnding optimal amounts of Total capital for investment in different bank assets. Based on the optimal capital allocation strategy derived for the ﬁrst problem, we derive stochastic models for respectively the bank’s capital adequacy and liquidity ratios {{in the second and}} third problems. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) introduced these ratios in an attempt to improve the regulation of the international banking industry in terms of capital adequacy and liquidity management. As a fourth problem we derive a multi-period deposit insurance pricing model which incorporates the optimal capital allocation strategy, the BCBS’ latest capital standard, capital forbearance and moral hazard. In the ﬁfth and ﬁnal problem we show how the values of LIBOR-in-arrears and vanilla interest rate swaps, typically used by commercial banks and other ﬁnancial institutions to reduce risk, can be derived under a specialized version of the affine interest rate model originally considered by the bank in question. More speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst problem we assume that the bank invests its Total capital in a stochastic interest rate ﬁnancial market consisting of three assets, viz., a treasury security, a marketable security and a loan. We assume that the interest rate in the market is described by an affine model, and that the value of the loan follows a jump-diffusion process. We wish to ﬁnd the optimal capital allocation strategy that maximizes an expected logarithmic utility of the bank’s TNRWAs at a future date. Generally, analytical solutions to stochastic optimal control problems in the jump setting are very difficult to obtain. We propose an approximation method that exploits a similarity between the forms of the control problems of the jump-diffusion model and the diffusion model obtained by removing the jump. With the jump assumed sufficiently small, the analytical solution of the diffusion model then serves as a proxy to the solution of the control problem with the jump. In the second problem we construct models for the bank’s capital adequacy ratios in terms of the proxy. We present numerical simulations to characterize the behaviour of the capital adequacy ratios. Furthermore, in this chapter, we consider the approximate optimal capital allocation strategy subject to a constant Leverage Ratio, which is a speciﬁc non-risk-based capital adequacy ratio, at the minimum prescribed level. We derive a formula for the bank’s TNRWAs at constant (minimum) Leverage Ratio value and present numerical simulations based on the modiﬁed TNRWAs formula. In the third problem we model the bank’s liquidity ratios and we monitor the levels of the liquidity ratios under the proxy numerically. In the fourth problem we derive a multi-period deposit insurance pricing model, the latest capital standard a la Basel III, capital forbearance and moral hazard behaviour. The deposit insurance pricing method utilizes an asset value reset rule comparable to the typical practice of insolvency resolution by insuring agencies. We perform numerical computations with our model to study its implications. In the ﬁnal problem, we specialize the affine interest rate model considered previously to the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) interest rate dynamic. We consider ﬁxed-for-ﬂoating interest rate swaps under the CIR model. We show how analytical expressions for the values of both a LIBOR-in-arrears swap and a <b>vanilla</b> <b>swap</b> can be derived using a Green’s function approach. We employ Monte Carlo simulation methods to compute the values of the swaps for different scenarios. We wish to make explicit the contributions of this project to the literature. A research article titled “An Optimal Portfolio and Capital Management Strategy for Basel III Compliant Commercial Banks” by Grant E. Muller and Peter J. Witbooi [1] has been published in an accredited scientiﬁc journal. In the aforementioned paper we solve an optimal capital allocation problem for diffusion banking models. We propose using the solution of the Brownian motions control problem of [1] as the proxy in problems two to four of this thesis. Furthermore, we wish to note that the methodology employed on the ﬁnal problem of this study is actually from the paper [2] of Mallier and Alobaidi. In the paper [2] the authors did not present simulation studies to characterize their pricing models. We contribute a simulation study in which the values of the swaps are computed via Monte Carlo simulation methods...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in Turkish derivatives markets demonstrate the increasing importance of risk management {{not only for}} individual banks {{but also for the}} entire system. In this context, this study analyzes the counterparty credit risk of OTC derivatives. The analysis is based on a hypothetical portfolio that is characterized by key aspects of the instruments banks hold. Thus, the portfolio consists of <b>vanilla</b> <b>swaps,</b> which dominate banks’ transactions. By simulating market risk factors, we come up with proxy risk exposure figures for the whole banking system. After a proper adjustment, these figures have been compared with the risk weighted assets, which includes credit risk,as well as with the capital. Consequently, we observe that the counterparty credit risk resulting from the use of OTC derivatives is relatively small for the Turkish banking system. Nevertheless, in light of the new regulatory framework introduced by Basel III, the importance of credit and market liquidity risk for the OTC instruments in trading portfolios is expected to increase in the near future. ...|$|R

40|$|In 1996, the Australian {{electricity}} {{market was}} liberalised and the National Electricity Market Man-aging Company (NEMMCO) {{was established to}} manage the pool of electricity used by generators and retailers. Although the electricity market is new, the contracts traded over the counter and on exchange range from <b>vanilla</b> <b>swaps</b> to exotic options and other more complex contracts compared to capital mar-kets. Nevertheless, there is no standard methodology for pricing such contracts {{as is the case}} of products in nancial markets, where closed-form solutions of Black and Scholes type are commonly used. There has been substantial research aiming to produce a benchmark pricing methodology for forward electricity contracts. However, the forward pricing problem based on spot electricity prices remains unsolved because the underlying asset (electricity) is not storable (economically) and cannot be traded from one period to the next. In this paper, we 8 ̆ 5 rst examine the characteristics of NSW electricity pool prices and look at the relationship between the spot price average and the forward price. We then apply the theory of trading claims on non-tradeable assets (real options) to electricity. The resulting forward price depends on the volume underlying the contract, the spot price weekly averages for previous periods, the market price of risk and the interest rate. In conclusion, this paper sets up a new methodology for pricing electrcity forwards, where the resulting prices are more intuitive in capturing the market parameters as well as the characteristics of the undelying contract. ...|$|R

However, the cyber-insurance market suffers from the problem of information asymmetry, lack of product diversity, illiquidity, high transaction cost, and so on.

The pricing of credit default swaps can be signicantly aected by the correlation between market, reference credit, and counterparty default risk.

40|$|The {{credit risk}} of a {{portfolio}} is often managed via measures of counter-party exposure, such as potential future exposure (PFE) and expected exposure (EE), with these measures playing {{an important role in}} setting economic and regulatory capital levels. For the sake of risk measurement and risk management these exposure measures should be computed under the real-world probability measure. However, due to the similarity of these exposure calculations to those used in calculating credit valuation adjustments, some have begun to compute them under the risk-neutral measure instead. This is problematic, as the magnitudes of PFEs and EEs differ under different equivalent martingale measures and their associated numéraires. Working with the Hull-White (HW) model of the short rate, the effect of a change of measure on the PFE and EE profiles of <b>vanilla</b> interest rate <b>swaps</b> and European swaptions is shown under three common measures: the money-market account measure, the T-forward measure and the Linear Gaussian Markovian (LGM) measure. A modified Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm, which allows for substantial computational savings, is then introduced in order to approximate contract level exposures under each of the aforementioned probability measures. Finally, a change of measure is implemented within the modified LSM algorithm in order to approximate exposure profiles under the real-world measure. The modified LSM algorithm is particularly useful for computing exposure profiles of contracts without closed-form valuation formulae, which would otherwise take significantly longer to compute via a standard Monte Carlo approach...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we take a}} look at {{the rise}} of interest rate basis spreads in the market following the liquidity and credit crunch of 2008. We show that post 2008 the valuation of all interest rate instruments of a single yield curve for a particular currency is no longer a feasible approach and the assumption of no arbitrage between di erent tenors is no longer applicable. Following that a closer look is taken into the cause of such widening basis spreads and the impact they have had on the market with a focus on reconstituting the no arbitrage argument and looking at a post crisis multiple curve framework following an axiomatic approach as introduced by Henrard [37] and further explored by Bianchetti and Morini [6, 50]. A bottom-up market approach is taken by Ametrano [2] and the two approaches are shown to be equivalent in result. An analogy is made to quanto style cross currency swap adjustments observed by the aforementioned authors as well as Michaud and Upper [47], and Tuckman and Por rio [57]. We proceed to look at the approaches taken by authors such as Henrard [36, 37] in ex- tending the Black and Stochastic Alpha Beta Rho models to include basis spreads and Kijima et al. [42] who extend a model introduced by Boenkost and Schmidt [11] and put forward a quadratic Gaussian model and a Vasicek model. Mercurio [46] puts forward an extension to the LIBOR Market Model (also referred to as the Brace-Gatarek-Musiela model) under both forward measures and spot measures. Finally we consider the rise of using overnight index swaps in construction OIS discount curves and their application in the valuation of interest rate derivatives in the presence of collateral as well as reconciling the spread between OIS and <b>vanilla</b> interest rate <b>swaps</b> with credit risk measures.
