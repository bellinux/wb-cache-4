50|$|An individual's self-interest {{and choice}} {{often leads to}} a <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> rate less than the social optimum as {{individuals}} do {{not take into account}} the benefit to others. In addition, prevalence dependent behavior suggests how the introduction of a vaccine may affect the spread of a disease. As the prevalence of a disease increases, people will demand to be vaccinated. As prevalence decreases, however, the incentive, and thus demand, will slacken and allow the susceptible population to increase until the disease can reinvade. As long as a vaccine is not free, either monetarily or through true or even perceived side effects, demand will be insufficient to pay for the vaccine at some point, leaving some people unvaccinated. If the disease is contagious, it could then begin spreading again among non-vaccinated individuals. Thus, it is impossible to eradicate a vaccine-preventable disease through voluntary vaccination if people act in their own self-interest.|$|E

Method: One thousand 16 - to 18 -year-old girls {{were invited to participate}} in an HPV vaccination program: 500 previously uninvited, and 500 unresponsive to previous invitations. Girls randomly received either a standard invitation letter or a letter including the offer of vouchers worth £ 45 (€ 56; $ 73) for undergoing 3 vaccinations.

40|$|Objectives: To test two {{hypothesized}} {{models of}} how anticipated affect, cognitive risk estimate and vaccination intention might influence <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> against seasonal influenza.

Following logistic regression to determine eligible variables, two mediation models of cognitive risk estimate, anticipated affect, vaccination intention and <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> against seasonal influenza were tested using structural equation modeling. Results: Mediation analyses found that anticipated worry if not vaccinated influenced seasonal influenza <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> through its effects on either perceived probability of influenza infection (β= 0. 45) or intention (. β= 0. 45) while anticipated regret if not vaccinated influenced <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> through its effect on intention (β= 0. 45) only; anticipated regret if vaccinated impeded <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> indirectly through its effect on vaccination intention (β= - 0. 26) or directly (β= - 0. 20); perceived probability of influenza infection influenced <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> through its effect on intention (β= 0. 20) or directly (β= 0. 22); and finally, intention influenced <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> directly (β= 0. 58).

40|$|Intramuscular {{injection}} of naked plasmid DNA is known (1 - 3) to elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against the encoded antigen.

40|$|Background: Older {{adults and}} {{individuals}} with underlying chronic diseases are {{at increased risk}} of developing influenza-related complications and are target groups for seasonal influenza vaccination in many countries. In Germany, an annual national information campaign is conducted to increase influenza <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> in the target groups. However, data are lacking on knowledge and attitudes toward influenza vaccination among older adults and those with chronic diseases. The present study aimed to (i) estimate influenza <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> for the 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 seasons, (ii) assess knowledge and attitudes about influenza vaccination, and (iii) identify factors associated with <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> in two risk groups. Methods: Between March and June 2014, we conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey in adults (≥ 18 years) living in Germany using computer-assisted telephone interviewing. We calculated weighted vaccination coverage rates in two at-risk groups. Group 1 comprised participants aged 18 – 59 years with underlying chronic diseases. Group 2 comprised participants aged 60 +, irrespective of underlying disease. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify associations between influenza <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> and sociodemographic characteristics, and to evaluate attitudes and knowledge. Results: In total, 1, 519 interviews were conducted. Seasonal influenza <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> in people with underlying chronic diseases aged 18 – 59 years was 24 % in 2012 / 2013 and 23 % in 2013 / 2014. In older adults, uptake was 50 % and 49 % in 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 respectively. There were considerable vaccination-related knowledge gaps among respondents. For example, about half of the participants who aged ≥ 60 years and/or suffered from underlying chronic diseases believed that influenza vaccination could cause influenza. The most commonly stated reasons for not being immunized were mistrust of the vaccination (22 %) and the perception that influenza is not dangerous (21 %). For both groups, <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> was independently associated with sex, perceived severity of influenza, perceived vaccination effectiveness, and the perceived likelihood or severity of vaccination side effects. For older adults, additional factors influencing <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> were age, underlying chronic diseases, and recent advice through physician consultation. Conclusions: Influenza vaccination coverage rates in Germany remain low. Individual perceptions regarding harms and benefits are crucial in the decision-making process.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundInfluenza {{vaccination}} {{of healthcare}} workers (HCW) {{is important for}} protecting staff and patients, yet vaccine coverage among HCW remains below recommended targets. Psychological theories of behavior change may help guide interventions to improve vaccine uptake. Our objectives were to: (1) review the effectiveness of interventions based on psychological theories of behavior change to improve HCW influenza vaccination rates, and (2) determine which psychological theories {{have been used to}} predict HCW influenza <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake.</b> MethodsMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, The Joanna Briggs Institute, SocINDEX, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for studies that applied psychological theories of behavior change to improve and/or predict influenza <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> among HCW. ResultsThe literature search yielded a total of 1810 publications; 10 articles met eligibility criteria. All studies used behavior change theories to predict HCW vaccination behavior; none evaluated interventions based on these theories. The Health Belief Model was the most frequently employed theory to predict influenza <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake</b> among HCW. The remaining predictive studies employed the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Risk Perception Attitude, and the Triandis Model of Interpersonal Behavior. The behavior change framework constructs were successful in differentiating between vaccinated and non-vaccinated HCW. Key constructs identified included: attitudes regarding the efficacy and safety of influenza vaccination, perceptions of risk and benefit to self and others, self-efficacy, cues to action, and social-professional norms. The behavior change frameworks, along with sociodemographic variables, successfully predicted 85 – 95 % of HCW influenza <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake.</b> ConclusionVaccination is a complex behavior. Our results suggest that psychological theories of behavior change are promising tools to increase HCW influenza <b>vaccination</b> <b>uptake.</b> Future studies are needed to develop and evaluate novel interventions based on behavior change theories, which may help achieve recommended HCW vaccination targets...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Annual {{vaccination}} {{against influenza}} (flu) {{is recommended for}} all UK National Health Service (NHS) staff to help {{reduce the risk of}} contracting the virus and transmitting it to patients. However, despite flu campaigns and <b>vaccination</b> promotion, <b>uptake</b> remains low. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate staff attitudes to flu vaccination to see how this may influence their decision to be vaccinated. METHODS: An online survey was sent to staff members across 6 NHS trusts, asking if staff had been vaccinated in the preceding flu season (2013 - 2014); the survey included questions about beliefs and attitudes to the vaccination, scored on a 5 -point Likert scale. RESULTS: 3059 NHS staff members responded to the survey (86 % in the 26 - 59 age group, 77 % female and 84 % hospital based). 68 % of respondents reported being vaccinated in the preceding year. Using a stepwise regression model, the survey response retained as a positive predictor of having been vaccinated was people working in healthcare should have the flu vaccination every year (p< 0. 001), and the responses retained as negative predictors were the flu vaccination will make me unwell (p< 0. 001) and the flu vaccination was too much trouble for me (p< 0. 001). Analysis by staff group showed a significant difference in the response to the flu vaccination will make me unwell between groups (p= 0. 01), with doctors having a greater tendency to disagree with this statement than other staff members. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that addressing NHS staff beliefs around the need for vaccination, while ensuring that practical barriers to having the vaccination are removed, may help to increase uptake. An emphasis on alleviating the concerns of particular staff groups regarding adverse effects of the vaccine may also be of benefit in improving uptake, to protect patients as well as staff...|$|R
40|$|Background Despite {{the fall}} in MMR uptake between 1998 and 2004, some general {{practices}} managed to sustain remarkably high MMR coverage. Methods The aim {{of the study was}} to identify general practice factors associated with high MMR vaccine coverage. The study population included 257 general practices in Cumbria and Lancashire in 2005. Practice level MMR coverage data for 2002 – 04 were obtained from the child health information systems of eight Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and linked to information on practice structure, census indicators for deprivation and ethnicity data at lower level super output area and information from a questionnaire survey of practice nurses. Results Mean MMR uptake was 86. 4 % with a range from 59 to 98 %. Twenty-eight per cent (74 / 257) practices achieved the Department of Health higher target payment level of 90 %. The uptake was not associated with practice size, the number of general practitioners (GPs) or practice nurses. There was no correlation between uptake and deprivation or the percentage of non-white population. There was a strong negative association between MMR uptake and barriers to housing and services (r 20. 230, P, 0. 001). On the basis of a questionnaire response rate of 75. 9 %, having a strategic approach to MMR with clear objectives was associated with MMR uptake of 90 % or above (odds ratio, 3. 76, 1. 26 – 12. 04). There was no association between immunization by GP, practice nurse or health visitor. Conclusions There are no easily identifiable characteristics of high-uptake MMR practices although having a strategic approach to MMR is important. Practices in rural areas should endeavour to ensure easy access to child <b>vaccination.</b> High <b>uptake</b> can be achieved by practices in deprived areas. Further research is needed to identify practice system factors associated with high MMR uptake...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn 2013, Prince Edward Island was {{the first}} {{province}} to introduce HPV vaccine universally to grade six boys in a school-based program. Because uptake rates in boys are unknown {{in this type of}} <b>vaccination</b> program, <b>uptake</b> of HPV <b>vaccination</b> in boys was measured and compared with uptake rates in girls and then analyzed with factors such as county, urban–rural location of the school, and school board to identify where the vaccine program could be improved. MethodsHPV vaccination records from the provincial childhood immunization registry in PEI were merged with Department of Education data containing all grade six girls and boys in PEI. Vaccine uptakes between years and between sexes were compared using two sample tests of proportions. Logistic regression modeling which accounted for the hierarchical nature of the data was used to analyze associations between factors and uptake rates. ResultsAlthough uptake was high in boys and girls, a significantly greater proportion of girls (85 %) received all three doses of the HPV vaccine compared to boys (79 %; p= 0. 004). The odds of grade six girls being fully vaccinated for HPV were 1. 5 times greater than of grade six boys, and the odds of students in the English Language School Board receiving all three doses were more than twice as great as the odds of French Language School Board students. ConclusionsHPV vaccination for boys in PEI has had a successful launch, almost reaching the Canadian Immunization Committee recommendations of > 80 % for the early years of a program. PEI has a highly organized Public Health Nursing program that is involved in all childhood and school-based vaccinations in PEI and in this context very high coverage rates were obtained. Areas to target for improving uptake include the boys and the students in the French Language School Board...|$|R
