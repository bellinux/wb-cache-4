5|$|AI {{behavior}} in Halo Wars 2 drew some criticism. Some reviewers described the pathfinding of units as substandard, and others considered the enemy AI {{to be too}} easy and not <b>very</b> <b>smart</b> on the normal difficulty setting. IGN reviews editor Dan Stapleton disliked that bases had to placed in predetermined locations; he {{found it to be}} limiting and said it constrained build order freedom. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer Fraser Brown was also concerned about the restrictions on base building initially, however he became fond of the idea after playing the game for some time.|$|E

25|$|West {{continued}} to write plays, including The Wicked Age, Pleasure Man, and The Constant Sinner. Her productions aroused controversy, which ensured that {{she stayed in}} the news, which also often resulted in packed houses at her performances. Her 1928 play, Diamond Lil, about a racy, easygoing, and ultimately <b>very</b> <b>smart</b> lady of the 1890s, became a Broadway hit, and cemented West's image in the public's eye. This show had an enduring popularity and West successfully revived it many times {{throughout the course of}} her career. With Diamond Lil being a hit show, Hollywood naturally came courting.|$|E
25|$|In {{southern}} Saskatchewan {{there was}} one main group of plains Indians who were called Assiniboine. They moved around the area that is modern day Willow Bunch. This band {{is thought to have}} arrived 11,000 years ago, just after the last glacier retreated. Like most bands at the time, this group moved where their food went. They depended on the bison for almost everything. They used the bison to make clothing, build their shelter and to make tools. Since they moved around a lot they made a <b>very</b> <b>smart</b> way of transporting their tipis. The poles of the tipis would make a sled of sort that was called a travois and would be pulled by dogs. This carried all that they needed and transported their home at the same time.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a stable}} {{population}} of woodland caribou throughout {{a large portion}} of the Gwich’in Settlement Area and are an important food source for Gwich’in although they harvest them less than other caribou. Gwich’in living in Inuvik, Aklavik, Fort McPherson, and Tsiigehtchic harvest woodland caribou but not as much as other caribou. The Gwich'in prefer to hunt Porcupine caribou or the barren-ground Blue Nose herd, who travel in large herds, when they are available. Many hunters claimed that woodland caribou that form very small groups, are wilder, both hard to see and hard to hunt. They are <b>very</b> <b>smart,</b> cunning and elusive. However, at times due to their natural curiosity, they may freeze, standing as if they were trying to hide unlike the Porcupine of Bluenose caribou that will outrun a hunter.|$|E

500|$|He {{prefers to}} receive {{the ball in the}} air, because he can always beat smaller players in the air but they can take {{advantage}} of better acceleration and quicker reactions on the ground. According to David Pleat, a major factor in Birmingham's 2011 League Cup win was [...] "telling him to do what he does best and flick the ball on with his head from direct diagonal balls played from both wings". Nevertheless, he is technically competent, scoring goals with his feet and providing assists for others. A 2009 feature in Mundo Deportivo assessed Žigić as one of those few tall players with a good touch on the ball, and in 2010, German international defender Per Mertesacker described him as [...] "technically a good player and <b>very</b> <b>smart</b> tactically".|$|E

It was so disliked that Kit Harington joked that when he annoys Benioff and Weiss, they threaten to release the episode on YouTube. Weiss said of the viewing: [...] "Watching them watch the pilot was a deeply humiliating, painful experience, because these are <b>very</b> <b>smart</b> individuals, and it just clearly wasn’t working for any of them on a very basic level." [...] For example, it was never established that the two major characters, Jaime and Cersei Lannister were in fact brother and sister, a major plot point.|$|E

[...] epitomizing the [...] "hip exclusivity" [...] of the burgeoning counterculture.

500|$|After {{staying with}} the show for eight seasons, Gray ran into trouble when she {{requested}} the producers of the show to adjust her contract {{to allow her to}} direct, as did the contracts of male co-stars Duffy and Hagman.

Gray stated in an interview with TV Guide, [...] "The producers said, 'But you're doing so well.' I thought, 'Oh, look out! I'm on the warpath now.' It was a struggle, though, because it was a man's show. And they fired me. When I finally told Larry, he went with me into the office and said, 'If she doesn't come back, I don't come back. I can't be playing J.R. Ewing without Sue Ellen.' He was very loyal and, honestly, a <b>very</b> <b>smart</b> businessman. He knew that truly, it was a huge relationship to the show."
