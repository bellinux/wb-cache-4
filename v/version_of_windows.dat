5|$|Beginning with Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Bristol Ridge, Windows 10 is {{the only}} <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> that Microsoft will officially support on newer CPU microarchitectures. Terry Myerson stated that Microsoft {{did not want to}} make further {{investments}} in optimizing older versions of Windows and associated software for newer generations of processors. These policies were criticized by the media, who especially noted that Microsoft was refusing to support newer hardware (particularly Intel's Skylake CPUs, which was also originally targeted by the new policy with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted) on Windows 8.1, a <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> that is still in mainstream support until January 2018.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{announced}} that Windows Server 2008 R2 {{would be the}} last <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> Server to support the Itanium (support started with XP), and that it would also discontinue development of the Itanium versions of Visual Studio and SQL Server.|$|E
5|$|Before Windows Server 2012 was finalized, two test builds {{were made}} public. A public beta <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> Server 2012 was {{released}} {{along with the}} Windows 8 Consumer Preview on February 29, 2012. The release candidate of Windows Server 2012 was released on May 31, 2012, along with the Windows 8 Release Preview.|$|E
50|$|Starting with Windows Vista and Windows 7 (and the {{corresponding}} <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>WIndows</b> Server), Windows Desktop Gadgets may {{appear on the}} desktop. These gadgets are discontinued in newer <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> and Windows Server, starting with Windows 8.|$|R
50|$|GDI+ is {{included}} with all <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> from Windows XP. The GDI+ dynamic library {{can also be}} shipped with an application and used under older <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> from Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 onwards.|$|R
50|$|For device drivers {{passing the}} WHQL tests, Microsoft creates a {{digitally}} signed certification file that, when {{included in the}} driver installation package allows installation on 64-bit <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> and prevents 32-bit <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> Vista and all <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> XP from displaying a warning message that the driver has not been certified by Microsoft (see Windows XP screenshot on the right).|$|R
5|$|In {{the monthly}} {{hardware}} {{survey conducted by}} the video game distribution platform Steam, approximately 34.05% of all devices surveyed ran a <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> 10 (either 32-bit or 64-bit architecture) as of January 2016, in comparison to 42.08% using Windows 7. On 64-bit architecture only, Windows 10 was used by 32.77%, behind 34.31% on Windows 7 64-bit.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{announced}} the Cairo project in 1991; the Cairo specification included similar object-oriented user interface features for a coming consumer <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> NT. Although {{the project was}} ultimately abandoned, some elements were integrated into other projects. By 1994, Microsoft and NeXT were collaborating on a Windows NT port of OpenStep; the port, however, was never released.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} visual and feature distinctions, the {{underlying}} CE versions {{can be used to}} differentiate WM6.0 from WM 6.1. The <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> CE in WM 6.0 is 5.2.*, with the final number being a 4 digit build ID (e.g. 5.2.1622 on HTC Wing). In WM 6.1, the CE version is 5.2.* with a 5 digit build number (e.g. 5.2.19216 on Palm Treo 800w).|$|E
50|$|The {{support of}} EFS is not {{available}} in Basic, Home, and MediaCenter <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows,</b> and must be activated after installation of Professional, Ultimate, and Server <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> or by using enterprise deployment tools within Windows domains.|$|R
2500|$|In Windows Server 2003 and earlier, {{the folder}} name [...] "Start Menu" [...] has a {{different}} name on non-English <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows.</b> For example, on German <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> XP it is [...] "Startmenü". Windows installers generally use the Windows API {{to find out the}} real names and locations of the Start menu and Desktop folders. However, since <b>Windows</b> Vista, all <b>Versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> use the same English named folders and only display different names in the Windows Explorer.|$|R
5000|$|In Windows Server 2003 and earlier, {{a folder}} like the [...] "Start Menu" [...] had a {{different}} name on non-English <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows.</b> For example, on German <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> XP it is [...] "Startmenü". However, since <b>Windows</b> Vista, all <b>Versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> use the same English named folders and only display different names in the Windows Explorer. In Windows 10 the user can switch to another display language {{and the names of}} the special folders will change.|$|R
5|$|Server Manager {{has been}} {{redesigned}} {{with an emphasis}} on easing management of multiple servers. The operating system, like Windows 8, uses the Metro-based user interface unless installed in Server Core mode. Windows Store is available in this <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> but is not installed by default. Windows PowerShell in this version has over 2300 commandlets, compared to around 200 in Windows Server 2008 R2.|$|E
5|$|The {{enterprise}} <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> 10 offers {{additional security}} features; administrators {{can set up}} policies for the automatic encryption of sensitive data, selectively block applications from accessing encrypted data, and enable Device Guarda system which allows administrators to enforce a high security environment by blocking the execution of software that is not digitally signed by a trusted vendor or Microsoft. Device Guard is designed to protect against zero-day exploits, and runs inside a hypervisor so that its operation remains separated from the operating system itself.|$|E
5|$|There is no upgrade path to Windows 10 for devices running Windows RT. Windows 10 Mobile, {{based on}} Windows Phone, was {{unveiled}} {{for use on}} future tablets and smartphones with ARM architecture. Subsequently, Microsoft {{announced that it would}} also support the desktop <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> 10 on ARM architecture devices (particularly laptops), with emulation of the IA-32 architecture to enable compatibility with existing software.|$|E

5000|$|Backward {{compatibility}} in Wine {{is superior}} to that <b>of</b> <b>Windows,</b> as newer <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> can force users to upgrade legacy Windows applications. In many cases, Wine can offer better legacy support than newer <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> with [...] "Compatibility Mode". Wine can run 16-bit Windows programs on a 64-bit operating system, which uses an x86-64 (64-bit) CPU. 64-bit <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> Microsoft <b>Windows</b> cannot run 16-bit Windows programs.|$|R
5000|$|The Registry can be {{manipulated}} {{in a number of}} ways from the command line. The [...] and [...] utility tools are included in Windows XP and later <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows.</b> Alternative locations for legacy <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> include the Resource Kit CDs or the original Installation CD <b>of</b> <b>Windows.</b>|$|R
5|$|Unlike its predecessor, Windows Server 2012 has {{no support}} for Itanium-based computers, and has four editions. Various {{features}} were added or improved over Windows Server 2008 R2 (with many placing {{an emphasis on}} cloud computing), such as {{an updated version of}} Hyper-V, an IP address management role, a new <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> Task Manager, and ReFS, a new file system. Windows Server 2012 received generally good reviews in spite of having included the same controversial Metro-based user interface seen in Windows 8.|$|E
5|$|Windows Media Center was discontinued, and is uninstalled when {{upgrading}} from {{a previous}} <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows.</b> Upgraded Windows installations with Media Center will receive the paid app Windows DVD Player free of charge for a limited, but unspecified, time. Microsoft had previously relegated Media Center and integrated DVD playback support to a paid add-on beginning on Windows 8 due {{to the cost of}} licensing the required DVD decoders, and the increasing number of PC devices that have no optical drives.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} that {{as part of}} a partnership with Qualcomm, it planned to support the PC <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> 10 on Qualcomm Snapdragon systems-on-chip in 2017, beginning with a focus on laptops. Unlike Windows RT, these devices will support the use of an x86 processor emulator to support Win32 desktop applications, along with universal apps. On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled Windows 10 S, an edition of Windows 10 designed for low-end mobile devices targeting the education market (which have led critics to compare the product line to Chrome OS). Similarly to Windows RT, it restricts software installation to applications obtained via Windows Store, but it may be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee to remove these restrictions.|$|E
25|$|Internal release <b>versions</b> for <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> 9x are 4.x. Previous MS-DOS based <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> used <b>version</b> numbers <b>of</b> 3.2 or lower. Windows NT, {{which was}} aimed at {{professional}} users such as networks and businesses, used a similar but separate version number between 3.1 and 4.0.|$|R
50|$|XPS is {{supported}} on several <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows.</b>|$|R

5|$|On January 21, 2015, Microsoft {{announced}} {{the release of}} their first Interactive whiteboard, Microsoft Surface Hub (part of the Surface family). On July 29, 2015, Microsoft released the next version of the Windows operating system, Windows 10. Its server sibling, Windows Server 2016, was released in September 2016. In Q1 2015, Microsoft was the third largest maker of mobile phones selling 33 million units (7.2% of all), while a large majority (at least 75%) {{of them do not}} run any <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows</b> Phone – those other phones are not categorized as smartphones by Gartner – in the same time frame 8 million Windows smartphones (2.5% of all smartphones) were made by all manufacturers (but mostly by Microsoft). Microsoft's share of the U.S. smartphone market in January 2016 was 2.7%.|$|E
5|$|While Microsoft largely {{failed to}} {{participate}} in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications. Later in 1997, Microsoft Office 97 as well as Internet Explorer 4.0 were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival Netscape, and by agreement with Apple Computer, Internet Explorer was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Windows,</b> was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.|$|E
