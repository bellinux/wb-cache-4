40|$|PURPOSE. To {{report the}} retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> {{deviation}} according to structural RNFL loss in RNFL thickness maps. METHODS. Retinal nerve fiber layer defect {{is defined in}} RNFL thickness maps by the degree of RNFL loss. A 20 % to 70 % degree of RNFL loss was set with a 1 % interval as the reference level for determining the boundary of RNFL defects. Each individual RNFL thickness map was compared with a normative database map and the region below the reference level was identified as an RNFL defect. The RNFL <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> was calculated by summing the volumes of each pixel inside RNFL defect. The RNFL <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> deviation was calculated by summing {{the differences between the}} normative database and the subject&# 39;s RNFL measurements. To evaluate the glaucoma diagnostic ability, the areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUCs# were calculated. RESULTS. Retinal nerve fiber layer <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> and RNFL <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> deviation # 0. 984 and 0. 986, respectively# had significantly greater AUCs than all circumpapillary RNFL thickness parameters #all P ? 0. 001 #. In the early stage of RNFL loss #under 31 % loss of RNFL), RNFL <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> deviation showed better diagnostic performance than the RNFL <b>defect</b> <b>volume.</b> In multivariate analysis, RNFL <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> and RNFL <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> deviation were significantly associated with the mean deviation in visual field tests.

40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Hyperpolarized (HP) gas {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) is an advanced imaging technique that provides high-resolution regional information on lung function without using ionizing radiation. Before this modality {{can be considered for}} assessing clinical or investigational interventions, baseline repeatability needs to be established. We assessed repeatability of lung function measurement using HP helium- 3 MRI (HP (3) He MRI) in a small cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined repeatability of HP (3) He MR images of five patients with CF in four scanning sessions over a 4 -week period. We acquired images on a Philips 3. 0 Tesla Achieva MRI scanner using a quadrature, flexible, wrap-around, (3) He radiofrequency coil with a fast gradient-echo pulse sequence. We determined ventilation <b>volume</b> and ventilation <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> using an advanced semiautomatic segmentation algorithm and also quantified ventilation heterogeneity. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences in}} total ventilation <b>volume,</b> ventilation <b>defect</b> <b>volume,</b> ventilation <b>defect</b> percentage, or mean ventilation heterogeneity (repeated-measures analysis of variance, P =. 2116, P =. 2825, P =. 2871, and P =. 7265, respectively) in the patients across the four scanning sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that total ventilation <b>volume,</b> ventilation <b>defect</b> <b>volume,</b> ventilation <b>defect</b> percentage, and mean ventilation heterogeneity as assessed by HP gas MRI in CF patients with stable health are reproducible over time. This repeatability and the technique 2 ̆ 7 s capability to provide noninvasive high-resolution data on regional lung function without ionizing radiation make (3) He MRI a potentially useful outcome measure for CF-related clinical trials...|$|R

40|$|Variable energy Doppler {{broadening}} spectroscopy {{has been}} used to study open-volume defects formed during the fabrication of indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films grown by electron-beam evaporation on n-GaN. The films were prepared at room temperature, 200 and 300 °C without oxygen and at 200 °C under different oxygen partial pressures. The results show that at elevated growth temperatures the ITO has fewer open volume sites and grows with a more crystalline structure. High temperature growth, however, is not sufficient in itself to remove open <b>volume</b> <b>defects</b> at the ITO/GaN interface. Growth under elevated temperature and under partial pressure of oxygen is found to further reduce the vacancy type defects associated with the ITO film, thus improving the quality of the film.

40|$|The {{depth profile}} of open <b>volume</b> <b>defects</b> has been {{measured}} in Si implanted with He at an energy of 20 keV, {{by means of}} a slow-positron beam and the Doppler broadening technique. The evolution of defect distributions has been studied as a function of isochronal annealing in two series of samples implanted at the fluence of 5 × 1015 and 2 × 1016 He cm- 2. A fitting procedure has been applied to the experimental data to extract a positron parameter characterizing each open volume defect. The defects have been identified by comparing this parameter with recent theoretical calculations. In as-implanted samples the major part of vacancies and divacancies produced by implantation is passivated by the presence of He. The mean depth of defects as seen by the positron annihilation technique is about five times less than the helium projected range. During the successive isochronal annealing the number of positron traps decreases, then increases and finally, at the highest annealing temperatures, disappears only in the samples implanted at the lowest fluence. A minimum of open <b>volume</b> <b>defects</b> is reached at the annealing temperature of 250 °C in both series. The increase of open <b>volume</b> <b>defects</b> at temperatures higher than 250 °C is due to the appearance of vacancy clusters of increasing size, with a mean depth distribution that moves towards the He projected range. The appearance of vacancy clusters is strictly related to the out diffusion of He. In the samples implanted at 5 × 1015 cm- 2 the vacancy clusters are mainly four vacancy agglomerates stabilized by He related defects. They disappear starting from an annealing temperature of 700 °C. In the samples implanted at 2 × 1016 cm- 2 and annealed at 850 – 900 °C the vacancy clusters disappear and only a distribution of cavities centered around the He projected range remains. The role of vacancies in the formation of He clusters, which evolve in bubble and then in cavities, is discussed...|$|E

DesignCross-sectional study of 489 women aged 50 – 80 years. Parity, use of HRT and OC was assessed by questionnaire; knee cartilage <b>volume</b> and <b>defects</b> by magnetic resonance imaging and knee joint space narrowing (JSN) and osteophytes by X-ray. ResultsParity was associated with a deficit in total knee cartilage volume [adjusted β=− 0. 69 ml, 95 % confidence interval (CI) − 1. 34, − 0. 04]. Increasing parity was associated with decreasing cartilage volume in both the tibial compartment and total knee (both P trend < 0. 05). Parity was also associated with greater cartilage defects in the patella compartment [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2. 87, 95 % CI= 1. 39, 5. 93] but not other sites. There was a consistent but non-significant increase in knee JSN (OR= 2. 78, 95 % CI= 0. 75, 10. 31) and osteophytes (OR= 1. 69, 95 % CI= 0. 59, 4. 82) for parous women.

To mitigate these upstream instabilities, a convergent radial flow in the die entrance has been created. In fact, the ultimate objective of the present work is to examine the effect of the clearance width of radial flow on the appearance and development of gross melt fracture defect. So, capillary rheometer experiments were performed with linear polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) oil. As for the influence of radial flow width on the morphology of gross melt fracture defect, extrudate photographs show that this imperfection can be mitigated since its frequency is higher and amplitude smaller when the gap of radial flow decreases. Such results may be related both to shear and elongational components of radial flow.
