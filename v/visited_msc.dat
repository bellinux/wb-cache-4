50|$|The <b>visited</b> <b>MSC</b> (V-MSC) is the MSC where a {{customer}} is currently located. The visitor location register (VLR) {{associated with this}} MSC will have the subscriber's data in it.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} that the phone call is not answered. If the subscriber is busy on another call (and call waiting is not being used) the <b>Visited</b> <b>MSC</b> routes the call to a pre-determined Call Forward Busy (CFB) number. Similarly, if the subscriber does not answer the call after a period of time (typically 30 seconds) then the <b>Visited</b> <b>MSC</b> routes the call to a pre-determined Call Forward No Reply (CFNRy) number. Once again, the operator may decide to set this value by default to the voice mail of the mobile so that callers can leave a message.|$|E
5000|$|Now {{with the}} MSRN number, the GMSC {{knows how to}} route the call to reach the roaming cell phone. Then, the call is made using ISUP (or TUP) {{signaling}} between the GMSC and the <b>visited</b> <b>MSC.</b> The GMSC will generate an ISUP IAM message with the MSRN as the called party number (and NOT the MSISDN as the called party number).|$|E
5000|$|On 4 January 2013, the [...] docked at the port's Carmel terminal, {{making it}} the largest {{container}} ship ever to <b>visit</b> Haifa. <b>MSC</b> Chicago has a capacity of 9,200 containers. The previous record ship <b>visit</b> was the <b>MSC</b> Maeva (capacity of 8040 containers) which had visited two months before.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States and Canada, callers pay {{the cost}} of {{connecting}} to the Gateway MSC of the subscriber's phone company, regardless of the actual location of the phone. As mobile numbers are given standard geographic numbers according to the North American Numbering Plan, callers pay the same to reach fixed phones and mobile phones in a given geographic area. Mobile subscribers pay for the connection time (typically using in-plan or prepaid minutes) for both incoming and outgoing calls. For outgoing calls, any long distance charges are billed as if they originate at the GMSC, {{even though it is}} the <b>visiting</b> <b>MSC</b> that completes the connection to the PSTN. Plans that include nationwide long distance and/or nationwide roaming at no additional charge over [...] "local" [...] outgoing calls are popular.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigate}} the health impact from an environmental policy implemented in northern Mexico. I use panel data from MxFLS (Mexican Family Life Survey) that is collected {{on an individual}} level. The individuals are all over 15 years old and are analysed {{in two or three}} different periods (2002, 2005 - 2006 and 2009 - 2012). Health is measured in a subjective form where individuals rank their current health status from 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good). The impact of the policy is measured by using an interaction term that interacts two dummy variables representing the area where the policy was implemented (city of Torreon) and the post period (2005 to 2012). The results indicate that the policy has been successful on a subjective level. However, these results were not supported by the more objective measures of health, namely self-reported illnesses, hospitalizations and doctor <b>visits.</b> <b>MSc</b> in Economic...|$|R
50|$|If the {{subscriber}} {{does not}} respond to the paging request, either due to being out of coverage, or their battery has gone flat/removed, then the <b>Visited</b> <b>MSC</b> routes the call to a pre-determined Call Forward Not Reachable (CFNRc) number. Once again, the operator may decide to set this value by default to the voice mail of the mobile so that callers can leave a message.|$|E
50|$|When {{the call}} {{arrives at the}} <b>Visited</b> <b>MSC,</b> the MSRN is used to {{determine}} which of the phones {{in this area is}} being called, that is the MSRN maps back to the IMSI of the original phone number dialled. The MSC pages all the mobile phone masts in the area that the IMSI is registered in order to inform the phone that there is an incoming call for it. If the subscriber answers, a speech path is created through the Visiting MSC and Gateway MSC back to the network of the person making the call, and a normal telephone call follows.|$|E
5000|$|The gateway MSC (G-MSC) is the MSC {{that determines}} which [...] "visited MSC" [...] (V-MSC) the {{subscriber}} {{who is being}} called is currently located at. It also interfaces with the PSTN. All mobile to mobile calls and PSTN to mobile calls are routed through a G-MSC. The term is only valid {{in the context of}} one call since any MSC may provide both the gateway function and the <b>visited</b> <b>MSC</b> function, however, some manufacturers design dedicated high capacity MSCs which do not have any base station subsystems (BSS) connected to them. These MSCs will then be the gateway MSC for many of the calls they handle.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, only Missile N-11 {{suffered}} a malfunction due to pogo and the combustion instability issue {{had occurred in}} static firings, but not any actual flights. All Titan II failures save for N-11 were caused by gas generator restrictions, broken plumbing, or faulty welds. The trouble appeared to be with Aerojet, and a <b>visit</b> of <b>MSC</b> officials to their Sacramento, California plant in July revealed a number of extremely careless handling and manufacturing processes. A systematic effort {{to improve the quality}} control of the LR-87 engines was launched, which included extensive redesigns of components to improve reliability as well as fixes to the gas generator restriction issue.|$|R
