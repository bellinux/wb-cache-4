40|$|With the {{development}} of the <b>vehicle</b> industry, controlling <b>stability</b> has become more and more important. Techniques of evaluating <b>vehicle</b> <b>stability</b> are in high demand. As a common method, usually GPS sensors and INS sensors are applied to measure <b>vehicle</b> <b>stability</b> parameters by fusing data from the two system sensors. Although prior model parameters should be recognized in a Kalman filter, it is usually used to fuse data from multi-sensors. In this paper, a robust, intelligent and precise method to the measurement of <b>vehicle</b> <b>stability</b> is proposed. First, a fuzzy interpolation method is proposed, along with a four-wheel vehicle dynamic model. Second, a two-stage Kalman filter, which fuses the data from GPS and INS, is established. Next, this approach is applied to a case study vehicle to measure yaw rate and sideslip angle. The results show the advantages of the approach. Finally, a simulation and real experiment is made to verify the advantages of this approach. The experimental results showed the merits of this method for measuring <b>vehicle</b> <b>stability,</b> and the approach can meet the design requirements of a <b>vehicle</b> <b>stability</b> controller...|$|R

40|$|The Static Stability Factor (SSF) is {{a measure}} of the {{rollover}} risk for vehicles during cornering or an evasive maneuver. This factor depends on the lateral and vertical location of the vehicle gravity center; this location is in turn influenced by many vehicle systems such as the suspension, tires and the chassis wheel among others. These systems allow the displacement of the vehicle body and its center of gravity, which modifies substantially the SSF factor calculation. Most of the models of <b>vehicle</b> <b>stability</b> are usually developed in two dimensions, which do not consider longitudinal aspects of the vehicle.
