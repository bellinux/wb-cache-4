The Jiles-Atherton model (J-A model) is the mostly used model to describe the hysteresis characteristics of the flux-gate core. But the parameters of J-A model are difficult to identify. In this paper, Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA) is proposed to identify the parameters of the J-A model. In order to enhance the performance of the identification, a Modified Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (MFOA) is applied to extract the parameters of the flux-gate core. The effectiveness of MFOA is verified through five typical test functions. The influence of <b>variation</b> <b>factor</b> h on the performance of MFOA is discussed. The impact of <b>variation</b> <b>factor</b> h on parameters extraction of hysteresis loop is studied.

In the present contribution, we develop a methodology to deduce ink thickness variations from spectral measurements of multi-chromatic halftone patches located within the printed page. For this purpose, we extend the Clapper-Yule spectral reflectance prediction model by expressing the transmittance of the colorants composed of superposed inks {{as a function of}} the ink transmittances and of fitted ink layer thicknesses. We associate to each ink an ink thickness <b>variation</b> <b>factor.</b> At print time, this ink thickness <b>variation</b> <b>factor</b> can be fitted in order to minimize a difference metric between predicted reflection spectrum and measured reflection spectrum. The ink thickness variations deduced from multi-chromatic halftones allow to clearly distinguish between normal ink volume, reduced ink volume or increased ink volume.

A random stratified sampling plan including 100 sampling points was used and three potential <b>variation</b> <b>factors</b> of nutrient stocks were tested: age of stand, type of stand (broad-leaved or coniferous trees) and type of soil.

The modified Reynolds equation is solved for the fluid film pressure and then the bearing characteristics, such as obtaining the load carrying capacity and the squeeze film time. According to the results evaluated, the micropolar fluid as a lubricant improves the squeeze film characteristics and results in a longer bearing life, whereas the viscosity <b>variation</b> <b>factor</b> decreases the load carrying capacity and squeezes film time.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a general strategy for factorial linear model analysis for experimental and observational studies. It satisfactorily {{deals with a}} number of issues that have previously caused problems in such analyses. The strategy developed here is an iterative, four-stage, model comparison procedure as described in Brien (1989); it is a generalization of the approach of Nelder (1965 a,b). The approach is applicable to studies characterized as being structure-balanced, multitiered and based on Tjur structures unless the structure involves <b>variation</b> <b>factors</b> when it must be a regular Tjur structure. It covers a wide range of experiments including multiple-error, change-over, two-phase, superimposed and unbalanced experiments. Examples illustrating this are presented. Inference from the approach is based on linear expectation and variation models and employs an analysis of variance. The sources included in the analysis of variance table is based on the division of the factors, {{on the basis of the}} randomization employed in the study, into sets called tiers. The factors are also subdivided into expectation <b>factors</b> and <b>variation</b> <b>factors.</b> From this subdivision models appropriate to the study can be formulated and the expected mean squares based on these models obtained. The terms in the expectation model may be nonorthogonal and the terms in the variation model may exhibit a certain kind of nonorthogonal variation structure. Rules are derived for obtaining the sums of squares, degrees of freedom and expected mean squares for the class of studies covered. The models used in the approach make it clear that the expected mean squares depend on the subdivision into expectation and <b>variation</b> <b>factors.</b> The approach clarifes the appropriate mean square comparisons for model selection. The analysis of variance table produced with the approach has the advantage that it will reflect all the relevant physical features of the study. A consequence of this is that studies, in which the randomization is such that their confounding patterns differ, will have different analysis of variance tables. Thesis (Ph. D.)

For simple circumstances of analysis auto-covariances of a single image are considered instead of cross-covariances of stereo ones. First the mean and variance of sample auto-covariances are derived with parameters, window width and positional lag.

For the CouBa approach the successive basin configu-rations are objectively deduced based on the 3 D domain modifications.

A typical progression is that the AvA values increase until a sub-basin ceases to be connected to the coastal zone. This disconnection is often preceded by a lowered AvA...|$|E

A statistical characterization is presented of received signal amplitude when the subject’s body is standing and walking, transmitted from the body to a receiver, Rx, off the body, with various orientations of the subject’s body {{with respect to the}} receiver, and various distances from the receiver. Two locations of the transmitter, Tx, on the human body are considered. The Lognormal distribution provides a good fitting model with and without movement. Further, the stability is characterized based on a measure of channel response variance, which is called here the channel <b>variation</b> <b>factor</b> and can characterize the channel coherence time.
