50|$|<b>Vitreous</b> <b>floaters</b> - {{deposits}} of various size, shape, consistency, refractive index, and motility within the eye's normally transparent vitreous humor which can obstruct vision.

5000|$|Asteroid {{hyalosis}} is a degenerative {{condition of}} the eye involving small white opacities in the vitreous humor. It is known to occur in humans, dogs, cats and chinchillas. [...] Clinically, these opacities are quite refractile, giving the appearance of stars (or asteroids) shining in the night sky—except that ocular asteroids are often quite mobile. Ocular asteroids must be distinguished from the more common typical <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters,</b> which are usually fibrillar or cellular condensates. The cause of asteroid hyalosis is unknown, {{but it has been}} associated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and, in certain animals, tumors of the ciliary body. [...] In dogs, asteroid hyalosis is considered to be an age related change. [...] The asteroid bodies are made up of hydroxylapatite, which in turn consists of calcium and phosphates or phospholipids. [...] While asteroid hyalosis does not usually severely affect vision, the floating opacities can be quite annoying, and may interfere significantly with visualization and testing of the retina. [...] While treatment of asteroid hyalosis is usually unnecessary, vitrectomy may occasionally be indicated, for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.|$|E

50|$|Therapy is not {{required}} or indicated in posterior vitreous detachment, unless there are associated retinal tears, which need to be repaired. In absence of retinal tears, the usual progress is that the vitreous humor will continue to age and liquefy and floaters will usually become less and less noticeable, and eventually most symptoms will completely disappear. Prompt examination of patients experiencing <b>vitreous</b> humor <b>floaters</b> combined with expeditious treatment of any retinal tears has been suggested as {{the most effective means}} of preventing certain types of retinal detachments.|$|R
25|$|While {{surgeries}} {{do exist}} to correct for severe cases of floaters, {{there are currently}} no medications (including eye drops) that can correct for this <b>vitreous</b> deterioration. <b>Floaters</b> are often caused by the normal aging process and will usually disappear as the brain learns to ignore them. Looking up/down and left/right will cause the floaters to leave the direct field of vision as the vitreous humour swirls around due to the sudden movement. If floaters significantly increase in numbers and/or severely affect vision, {{then one of the}} below surgeries may be necessary.|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} effect of Nd:YAG laser on <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters.</b> METHODS:According to the {{criteria}} of the study,the 35 eyes of 35 patients with floaters determined by slitlamp with front mirror and type B ultrasound scan were enrolled. The Nd:YAG laser was used to destroy the <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters</b> {{in order to make}} them easier to be absorbed. The changes of <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters,</b> visual acuity, IOP, the results of slitlamp examination, type B ultrasound scan and complications were observed before and after the treatments several times. RESULTS:There were 11 eyes with high or moderate myopia in the 35 eyes. In all patients,the spotted vision improved respectively 2 h after the laser procedure. After Nd:YAG laser treatment,the spotted vision disappeared in 3 eyes(9 %) within 24 h,and in 11 eyes(31 %) within 7 d, and in 27 eyes(77 %) within 30 d, and the effective rate was 77 % after 30 d. The second laser treatment performed 7 d after the first laser treatment in 2 eyes(6 %).

40|$|It {{is common}} for healthy {{children}} with specific visual complaints to be seen for eye exami-nations. After a complete eye examination has ruled out pathologic conditions {{as the cause of}} these complaints, it is appropriate for the clinician to explore the possibility that normal entoptic or physio-logic visual phenomena might have provoked the child’s report of vision problems. Some of these normal visual experiences are frequent causes of children’s complaints of vision problems, such as phys-iologic diplopia, relaxation of the near synkinesis during reading, and <b>vitreous</b> body <b>floaters.</b> Some complaints are common, even though the underlying entoptic or physiologic phenomenon may be speculative or obscure, such as the report that objects look bigger or smaller than they actually are.

25|$|Floaters {{present at}} birth usually remain lifelong, while those that appear later may {{disappear}} within weeks or months. They are not uncommon, {{and do not}} cause serious problems for most persons; they represent {{one of the most}} common presentations to hospital eye services. A survey of optometrists in 2002 suggested that an average of 14 patients per month per optometrist presented with symptoms of floaters in the UK. However, floaters are more than a nuisance and a distraction to those with severe cases, especially if the spots seem to constantly drift through the field of vision. The shapes are shadows projected onto the retina by tiny structures of protein or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the <b>vitreous</b> humour. <b>Floaters</b> can even be seen when the eyes are closed on especially bright days, when sufficient light penetrates the eyelids to cast the shadows. It is not, however, only elderly persons who are troubled by floaters; they can also become a problem to younger people, especially if they are myopic. They are also common after cataract operations or after trauma.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Traditionally {{acceptable}} {{methods of}} anesthesia for vitrectomy surgery are quite varied. However, {{each of these}} methods has its own potential for complications that can range from minor to severe. The surgery procedure of vitrectomy for symptomatic <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters</b> is much simpler, mainly reflecting in the nonuse of sclera indentation, photocoagulation, and the apparently short surgery duration. The use of 27 -gauge cannulae makes the puncture of the sclera minimally invasive. Hence, retrobulbar anesthesia, due to its rare but severe complications, seemed excessive {{for this kind of}} surgery. Method: Three cases of 27 -gauge, sutureless pars plana vitrectomy for symptomatic <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters</b> with topical anesthesia are reported. Results: The vitrectomy surgeries were successfully performed with topical anesthesia (proparacaine, 0. 5 %) without operative or postoperative complications.

All patients underwent visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit lamp, mydriatic fundus, B ultrasonic examination, and recorded {{the form of a}} vitreous opacity excluded pathological fundus lesions. All the patients were divided into two groups: Group A(45 years old), 185 cases(258 eyes), the morphology of vitreous opacity was Weiss ring, translucent flocculent clouds or dense fibrous membrane. Patients in 30 - 45 years old were eliminated because of the untypical opacity factor. The treatment was done by the same physician. Vision changes was analyzed before and after the treatment. RESULTS: Questionnaire survey was done. According to the scores of the questionnaires, patients were divided into 3 groups: no improvement(1 - 2 points), partial improvement(3 - 5 points), significant improvement(6 - 10 points).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Primary <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters</b> can {{be highly}} bothersome in some patients. In the case of {{persistently}} bothersome floaters, pars plana vitrectomy {{may be the most}} effective treatment. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the incidence of complications, and patient satisfaction, after pars plana vitrectomy for disabling primary vitreous opacities. METHODS: We included a total of 110 eyes that underwent pars plana vitrectomy between February 1998 and August 2010. Fifty-seven eyes (51. 8 %) underwent 20 -gauge vitrectomy, whereas 53 eyes (48. 2 %) underwent 23 -gauge vitrectomy. In a retrospective manner, we assessed intraoperative and postoperative complications. There was a considerable range of time between surgery and questionnaire (range: 4 - 136 months). Patient satisfaction was assessed by a questionnaire based on a modified NEI VFQ- 25 questionnaire. RESULTS: A retinal detachment occurred in 10. 9 % of cases, and the incidence did not differ significantly between the 20 -gauge and 23 -gauge vitrectomy groups. In 4. 5 % of the eyes, a retinal detachment developed within the first 3 months, and 6. 4 % occurred later in the postoperative period. Cystoid macular edema occurred in 5. 5 %, and an epiretinal membrane was seen postoperatively in 3. 6 % of cases. Development of glaucoma requiring glaucoma surgery, a macular hole, and postoperative scotoma, each occurred in 0. 9 % of cases. No cases of endophthalmitis occurred. Eighty-five percent of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the results of the vitrectomy. Eighty-four percent of all patients were completely cured from their troublesome <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters,</b> and an additional 9. 3 % of patients were less troubled by <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters.</b> Ten patients (9. 3 %) were dissatisfied, and six of these patients (5. 6 %) had a serious complication that resulted in permanent visual loss. CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana vitrectomy is an effective approach to treat primary <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters,</b> resulting in a high rate of patient satisfaction. Postoperative complications may be more frequent than previously reported, so patients should be well-informed about the complication rate before reaching informed consent about this surgical intervention. Additional preventive measures should be considered to reduce this complication rate...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the degree of}} psychological distress in symptomatic vitreous floater patients and to evaluate whether these psychological factors {{are associated with the}} severity of discomfort associated with <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters.</b> Methods. We recruited 61 patients with symptomatic <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters</b> and 34 controls. The degree of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) was evaluated using optical coherence tomography. We measured the level of depression, perceived stress, state, and trait anxiety and the degree of floater-associated discomfort with self-administered questionnaire. We compared psychological parameters between floater patients and control. We also compared clinical and psychological characteristics among different floater-associated discomfort severity groups. Results. Symptomatic vitreous floater patients showed higher rate of complete PVD and higher psychological distress compared to the control. On multiple logistic regression analysis, complete PVD (p= 0. 001), depression (p= 0. 001), and younger age (p= 0. 037) were significantly associated with symptomatic floaters.

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{structure}} changes of vitreous and retina after YAG laser ablation {{in patients with}} physiological <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters.</b> METHODS: The selected 40 patients of physiological <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters,</b> before YAG laser ablation, were checked for best corrected visual acuity, non-contact intraocular pressure, took their anterior segment photos, measured their foveola thickness(FT) and retinal nerve fiber layer(RNFL) by OCT. The YAG laser ablation was completed by one experienced surgeon. After the YAG laser ablation, all patients were checked for non-contact intraocular pressure and gave pranoprofen eye drops tid for 3 d. At 2 d, 1 wk, 1 and 3 mo after the surgery, they were reviewed for best corrected visual acuity, non-contact intraocular pressure. At 3 mo later anterior segment photos were taken. At 1 wk, 1 and 3 mo after the surgery, FT and RNFL were measured again. RESULTS: The postoperative 2 d, 1 wk, 1 and 3 mo, best corrected visual acuity, non-contact intraocular pressure of the patients had no significant difference with preoperative(P > 0. 05). The preoperative anterior segment photos showed obvious single or sheet opacity of vitreous, the postoperative 3 mo photos showed that vitreous opacities decreased or disappeared, no other abnormal changes were found. The preoperative OCT data showed that FT was 214. 60 ± 9. 35 μm, the postoperative 1 wk, 1 and 3 mo FT were 213. 75 ± 9. 07 μm, 213. 40 ± 8. 83 μm, 213. 85 ± 9. 22 μm. The preoperative RNFL were upper 130. 26 ± 14. 23 μm, lower 133. 15 ± 14. 46 μm, nasal 82. 48 ± 13. 50 μm, temporal 75. 40 ± 11. 89 μm; The postoperative 1 wk RNFL were upper 130. 02 ± 14. 02 μm, lower 132. 99 ± 14. 05 μm, nasal 82. 35 ± 13. 07 μm, temporal 75. 42 ± 11. 66 μm. The postoperative 1 mo RNFL were upper 130. 28 ± 14. 43 μm, lower 133. 08 ± 13. 99 μm, nasal 82. 31 ± 13. 72 μm, temporal 75. 45 ± 12. 03 μm. The postoperative 3 mo RNFL were upper 130. 43 ± 14. 30 μm, lower 133. 22 ± 14. 20 μm, nasal 82. 27 ± 13. 11 μm, temporal 75. 46 ± 11. 91 μm.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters</b> on intraocular straylight. METHODS: Records of bilaterally phakic patients with unilateral complaint of floaters as the main symptom were identified from an electronic database. Patients who underwent straylight measurements on both affected and unaffected eyes using a C-Quant straylight meter were selected. Data were collected on age, sex, visual acuity, straylight measurements, and optical coherence tomography. The unaffected eye served as a control. RESULTS: Fifteen cases were included (7 women and 8 men; mean age, 54. 3 years; age range, 24 - 71 years). Visual acuity was not correlated with the complaint of floaters. Average straylight value in eyes with floaters was 1. 426 log(s) (± 0. 23 SD) with a median value of 1. 52 log(s). The mean value for fellow eyes was 1. 275 (± 0. 23 SD) with a median of 1. 25 log(s). The differences between both groups using a Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test was statistically significant at P = 0. 0009. On optical coherence tomography, most patients had a confirmed or probable posterior vitreous detachment. However, in four patients, a posterior vitreous detachment was absent in the affected eyes. <b>Vitreous</b> <b>floaters</b> were inconsistently imaged by optical coherence tomography, {{with only a few}} patients presenting appreciable condensations close to the retinal surface. These were present in both affected and unaffected eyes. CONCLUSION: Intraocular straylight is significantly increased in eyes affected by floaters. No correlation was seen with vision or optical coherence tomography appearance. Straylight is an independent objective measure of visual perception that seems to be closely correlated to complaints expressed by patients experiencing floaters...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{report a}} case of rapid {{cataract}} progression after Nd:YAG vitreolysis for <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters.</b> Case Report: A 55 -year-old man presented with acute onset of blurred vision following Nd:YAG vitreolysis for symptomatic floaters in the left eye. His initial best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20 / 1, 000 in the left eye. Ocular examinations showed frost-like opacities of the lens and a suspected break of the posterior capsule in the left eye. There were no detectable retinal lesions. Cataract surgery was then arranged. Posterior capsular rupture and vitreous loss occurred during surgery, which required a subsequent pars plana vitrectomy. After the surgery, BCVA in the left eye gradually improved to 20 / 20 and was maintained during a 1 -year follow-up period. Conclusion: Crystalline lens injuries and rapid cataract progression may occur following Nd:YAG vitreolysis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} in detail the optics of the shadow cast by vitreous opacities and its effects {{in the perception of}} related entoptic phenomena. The optics of the eclipse {{has been used as a}} model. The various parameters affecting the shadow, i. e. the diameter of the opacity, its distance from the retina and the overall distance between the pupillary plane and the retina, have been taken into account in the calculations. A mathematical function has been derived and curves defining the density of the penumbra have been plotted for various distances of an opacity from the retina. An area of uniform partial illumination of the retina behind the opacity has been defined, outside of which the density of the penumbra falls rapidly. It is concluded that the sensation of 'cloud' or 'smoke' reported by the patient stems from this uniform area of penumbra behind the opacity, whose extent depends on the above mentioned parameters. Thus, the optics of the eclipse explains this entoptic phenomenon. Of course, 'clouds' can also be due to semi-transparent <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters...</b>|$|E
30|$|Intravitreal {{injections}} Prior to {{the primary}} endpoint at month 6, the study eyes of group 1 received 42 intravitreal injections of sirolimus, and the fellow eyes (from nine patients) received 20 intravitreal injections, raising the number of injections in this group {{to a total of}} 62 injections. The adverse events encountered with intravitreal injections of sirolimus were rare and scattered. The most commonly reported adverse event in this group was <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters.</b> Other ocular adverse events included single instances of changed refraction resulting in blurred vision, post-injection subconjunctival hemorrhage, forehead rash (above the study eye), ocular pain and redness, and progression of pre-existing cataract and glaucoma that required combined cataract extraction and glaucoma surgery with Ahmed valve implantation in the study eye. The ocular pain, redness, and subconjunctival hemorrhage were all considered related to the injection procedure rather than sirolimus. No other ocular adverse event was considered related to either the injection procedure or the study drug. Systemic adverse events included one event each of upper respiratory infection, tooth abscess, and sciatic pain secondary to disc prolapse. No systemic adverse event was considered related to the study drug. All systemic and ocular adverse events in this group were mild to moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Pharmacologic vitreolysis is a {{strategy}} used to treat anomalous posterior vitreous detachment, by weakening vitreoretinal adhesion with an intravitreal drug. Pharmacologic vitreolysis facilitates surgery, and abnormalities of the vitreoretinal interface including vitreomacular traction (VMT) and early stage macular hole (MH) could be resolved. Ocriplasmin is a recombinant protease, active against fibronectin and laminin, which are important components of the vitreoretinal interface. Ocriplasmin has been approved for symptomatic treatment of VMT and MH with visible traction, and it functions by dissolving the proteins that link the vitreous to the macula, thereby creating a complete posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Areas covered: This paper reviews the current knowledge and status of investigations {{regarding the use of}} ocriplasmin for pharmacologic vitreolysis and its safety. Expert opinion: Ocriplasmin is a non-specific enzyme; therefore, it dissolves vitreal proteins as well as possibly proteins associated with visual function in the retina, choroid, and lens. Ocular adverse events (OAEs) of ocriplasmin include transient visual loss, intraocular inflammation, <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters,</b> lens opacification, zonular instability of the lens, and intraocular hemorrhage. The prevalence of the OAEs is very low; however, on rare occasions, they can result in widespread retinal dysfunction. Research into the acute and long-term safety of ocriplasmin is required...|$|E

40|$|Aging {{involves}} anatomical, {{physiological and}} neurological {{changes in the}} body. It occurs naturally and is sometimes, accelerated by preventable factors such as economic stress and psychological difficulties; and by diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cancer. The eye, {{as part of the}} body, is also affected by this aging process, resulting in changes in its anatomy, physiology and neurological system. These changes include a decrease in corneal sensitivity, a decrease in the anterior chamber depth, atrophy of the dilator fibers of the iris and senile miosis. Others include reduction in lens transparency, presence of <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters</b> and slow response to light stimuli. The eye is also known to lose its ability to focus on near objects, develops opacities of the crystalline lens, risk increased intraocular pressure, visual field loss, reduction in tear production, and experiences increased glare on exposure to very bright light. Pathological changes such as age related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes mellitus and hypertensive retinopathy in people with hypertension, have also been reported to occur.

40|$|PurposeTo {{assess the}} risks of vitrectomy {{for the removal of}} primary and {{secondary}} vitreous opacities. DesignRetrospective, nonrandomized, interventional case series. MethodsWe reviewed the results of 116 consecutive cases of vitrectomy for <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters.</b> Eighty-six cases were primary and 30 cases were secondary floaters. Main outcome measures were the incidence of iatrogenic retinal breaks and postoperative rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. ResultsWe found iatrogenic retinal breaks in 16. 4 % of operations. There was no statistically significant difference in risk between cases of primary and secondary floaters. Intraoperative posterior vitreous detachment induction was found to increase significantly the risk of breaks. Retinal detachment occurred in 3 cases (2. 5 %), all after operations for primary floaters. One case of complicated retinal detachment ended with a low visual acuity of hand movements. Cataract occurred in 50 % of phakic cases. Transient postoperative hypotony was found after 5. 2 % of our operations, and transient postoperative high intraocular pressure was encountered in 7. 8 %. An intraoperative choroidal hemorrhage occurred in 1 case, which resolved spontaneously. The mean visual acuity improved from 0. 20 to 0. 13 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution units. ConclusionsThe risk profile of vitrectomy for floaters is comparable with that of vitrectomy for other elective indications. Retinal breaks are a common finding during surgery and treatment of these breaks is crucial for the prevention of postoperative retinal detachment. Patients considering surgery for floaters should be informed specifically about the risks involved...|$|E
40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is one of}} the most common causes of severe vision loss in the western world. Both animal and human studies have established that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this process. Ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) is a monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) directed toward all isoforms of VEGF-A that was specifically designed to target wet AMD. The human antibody fragment is produced by an E. coli expression system and has a molecular weight of 48 kD allowing for excellent retinal penetration. The most common ocular complaints of patients receiving ranibizumab injections in randomized clinical trials were transient conjunctival hemorrhage, <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters,</b> intraocular inflammation, increased intraocular pressure and eye pain. The rates of serious adverse events such as retinal detachment, cataract and endophthalmitis were similar to those that have been reported with other intravitreal injections and patients should always be treated under strict aseptic conditions to reduce this risk. There were no significant non-ocular events found during any study so far and the risk of thromboembolic events was less than 4 &#x 0025; and not different than sham. The MARINA, ANCHOR and PIER studies validated the safety and efficacy of ranibizumab amongst a large population with different choroidal neovascular membrane lesion types against sham or standard of care treatment. These studies recommended monthly intravitreal ranibizumab for patients. However, the PIER study reported that an alternative dosing of every three months is acceptable but less effective than monthly injections...|$|E
40|$|To {{establish}} the {{maximum tolerated dose}} (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), safety profile, and anti-tumor efficacy of RAF 265. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, phase-I, dose-escalation trial of RAF 265, an orally available RAF kinase/VEGFR- 2 inhibitor, in patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, pharmacodynamics (PD) and tumor response assessment were conducted. We evaluated metabolic tumor response by 18 [F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET), tissue biomarkers using immunohistochemistry (IHC), and modulators of angiogenesis. RAF 265 has a serum half-life of approximately 200  h. The MTD was 48  mg once daily given continuously. Among 77 patients, most common treatment-related adverse effects were fatigue (52 %), diarrhea (34 %), weight loss (31 %) and <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters</b> (27 %). Eight of 66 evaluable patients (12. 1 %) had an objective response, including seven partial and one complete response. Responses occurred in BRAF-mutant and BRAF wild-type (WT) patients. Twelve of 58 (20. 7 %) evaluable patients had a partial metabolic response. On-treatment versus pretreatment IHC staining in 23 patients showed dose-dependent p-ERK inhibition. We observed a significant temporal increase in placental growth factor levels and decrease in soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (sVEGFR- 2) levels in all dose levels. RAF 265 is an oral RAF/VEGFR- 2 inhibitor that produced antitumor responses, metabolic responses, and modulated angiogenic growth factor levels. Antitumor activity {{occurred in patients with}} BRAF-mutant and BRAF-WT disease. Despite low activity at tolerable doses, this study provides a framework for the development of pan-RAF inhibitors and modulators of angiogenesis for the treatment of melanoma...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the refractive accuracy of intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation after phacovitrectomy. Eye Hospital Zonnestraal and Department of Ophthalmology Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Retrospective comparative case series. Refraction results 1 month after phacovitrectomy or phacoemulsification {{were compared with}} predicted refractions calculated using the IOLMaster 500 and the Haigis formula. Indications for vitrectomy were macular pucker, macular hole, <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters,</b> vitreous hemorrhage, and vitreomacular traction. Enrolled eyes had an axial length (AL) between 20. 13 mm and 29. 43 mm. The phacovitrectomy group comprised 133 eyes (133 patients) and the phacoemulsification group, 132 eyes (132 patients). The refractive outcomes after phacovitrectomy (- 0. 06 diopter [D] ± 0. 50 [SD]) and phacoemulsification (- 0. 08 ± 0. 47 D) were comparable (P =. 74). The final postoperative refraction was within ± 1. 00 D of the preoperative refractive target in 94. 9 % and 94. 6 % of phacovitrectomy cases and phacoemulsification cases, respectively. Subgroup analysis found no increased risk for refractive surprises after gas tamponade or in eyes with an AL of 26. 00 mm or greater. Standard IOL power calculation used in regular phacoemulsification surgery was accurate in phacovitrectomy procedures in eyes {{with a wide range}} of AL and a wide range of vitrectomy indications.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} levels of {{inflammatory}} and angiogenic cytokines in undiluted vitreous from treatment-naïve patients with macular edema secondary to nonischemic branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), with flow cytometric bead array (CBA) and to correlate the results with subjective and multiple spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) parameters. Methods: A total of 43 eyes from 43 patients (mean age 69. 7 years, 23 male) were divided into groups of new, "fresh" (n = 28; mean duration after onset 4. 1 months) and older BRVO (n = 15; 11. 6 months). Because of macular edema, these patients underwent an intravitreal therapy combining a single-site 23 g core vitrectomy with bevacizumab and dexamethasone. Undiluted vitreous was then analyzed for interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), and vascular endothelial growth factor isoform A (VEGF-A) levels with CBA and correlated with visual acuity (VA), clinical parameters of BRVO (type and perfusion status), and morphologic parameters, such as central macular thickness, central retinal thickness, thickness of the neurosensory retina, thickness of the serous retinal detachment, and the disruption of the ellipsoid line (photoreceptor inner and outer segments) and the external limiting membrane, as measured with SD-OCT. Twenty-eight undiluted vitreous samples from patients with idiopathic, nonuveitis <b>vitreous</b> <b>floaters</b> served as the controls. Results: The mean IL- 6 was 23. 2 pg/mL (standard deviation, ± 48. 8), MCP- 1 was 602. 6 (± 490. 3), and VEGF-A was 161. 8 (± 314. 3), and this was {{higher than in the}} control group, which had a mean IL- 6 of 6. 2 ± 3. 4 pg/mL (P = 0. 17), MCP- 1 of 253. 2 ± 73. 5 (P < 0. 0000001), and VEGF-A of 7. 0 ± 4. 9 (P < 0. 003). In all BRVO samples, IL- 6 correlated positively with MCP- 1 and VEGF-A (correlation coefficient r = 0. 79 and r = 0. 46, respectively). VEGF-A was the only cytokine to correlate significantly with SD-OCT parameters (thickness of the neurosensory retina r = 0. 31; disruption of the ellipsoid line r = 0. 33). In the older BRVO group, there was a positive correlation between cytokines (IL- 6 with MCP- 1, r = 0. 77; Il- 6 with VEGF-A, r = 0. 68; MCP- 1 and VEGF-A, r = 0. 68), whereas only IL- 6 correlated with MCP- 1 in the fresh group (r = 0. 8). Conclusion: The inflammatory markers and VEGF-A were elevated in the vitreous fluid of patients with BRVO, and these correlated with one another.
