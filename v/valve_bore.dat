50|$|Sun :The Sun was {{launched}} in 1927 as a direct replacement for the 1b MTB engine. Like the Star, the bevel drive was moved inside the crankcase, and banjo drive was used {{with a choice of}} either piston valve or slide <b>valve.</b> <b>Bore</b> and stroke were 0.75 inches. While the slide valve variant was only available as a kit, the piston valve version was available as a complete engine or kit. The Sun continued after the war as a piston valve kit only and last appeared in the Stuart catalogue in 1989/1990.|$|E
50|$|The 1956 Opel Kapitän was {{the next}} vehicle from the company with a straight-6 engine. This was a 2605 cc unit with 12 {{overhead}} <b>valves.</b> <b>Bore</b> and stroke were now oversquare for high power output at 85.0 mm (3.3 in) by 76.5 mm (3 in). A single Opel-designed carburetor and 7.8:1 compression yielded 91 PS (90 hp/67 kW) and 186 N·m (137 lb·ft).|$|R
40|$|Abundant worm borings {{were found}} in some brachiopod shells (Clitambonites, Estlandia, Nicolella) from the Ordovician (Caradoc) oil shale in North Estonia. 9 of 21 brachiopod genera (43 %) have been bored. Excluding the size and {{thickness}} of valves, no common morphological feature discriminates the brachiopods with borings from those without them. The Trypanites are host-specific, {{and the frequency of}} <b>bored</b> <b>valves</b> varies from 6. 5 % in Bekkerina to 51 % in Estlandia. The worm larvae preferred hosts with thick lamellose shells, such as those of the clitambonitids, especially Clitambonites schmidti. The boring organisms were size-selective; they preferred large adult specimens. The majority of the borings are oriented, and living hosts were preferred to dead shells. Some clitambonitidine brachiopods, like C. schmidti tolerated a large number of the borer's shafts in their <b>valves.</b> Few <b>bored</b> <b>valves</b> have the blister-like shell-repair structures in their interior...|$|R
50|$|Like all {{contemporary}} World Rally Cars, the car {{is heavily}} modified from the production version, with which it shares only the basic shape and {{some parts of the}} bodyshell. The car features four wheel drive, rather than the front wheel drive of the road car. The engine used in the 2007 Focus WRC is based on Ford's 2.0 Litre Duratec from other models in the Focus range as rallying rules do not permit the standard 2.5 Litre engine of the Focus ST or road going RS. As with most rally cars, the 2.0 Litre engine is heavily modified and performance was increased using a turbocharger. Also the 2009 Ford Focus WRC uses a Ford 1998cc Pipo built l4 Duratec WRC engine (Four Cylinders, 16 <b>Valves,</b> <b>Bore</b> 85 mm and Stroke 88 mm), Pi electronic engine Management system, Garrett Turbocharger (with required 34 mm inlet restrictor), air intercooler, and a catalytic converter.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of utilizing the NSI- 1 squib in place cartridge assembly 2270 for {{the function of}} both events required for the Space Shuttle Gas Sampler Valve/Bottle Assembly 3270 was determined. Additionally, it was a requirement that the closure disk of the NSI- 1 squib and explosive residue therefrom be retained from the valve cavity {{in so far as}} possible to prevent any significant particulate from scratching the <b>valve</b> <b>bore</b> and causing sample leakage following the postfire 2 event...|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach to the}} problem of eliminating the tetrode kink was introduced by Hivac in 1935. It was found by J.H Owen Harries that if the separation of the anode from the screen grid were varied, a critical separation could be found (about 3 cm) where the kink in the tetrode's anode characteristic disappeared, and the amplification of the valve became particularly distortion-free. Both fidelity and efficiency exceeded those of the available pentodes of the time. A range of tetrodes of this type were introduced, aimed at the domestic receiver market, some having 2V directly heated filaments, intended for low-power battery-operated sets, others with 4V or higher, indirectly heated cathodes for mains operation. Output powers ranged from 0.5W to 11.5W [...] Confusingly, several of these new <b>valves</b> <b>bore</b> the same type number as existing pentodes with almost identical characteristics. Examples include Y220 (0.5W, 2V filament), AC/Y (3W, 4V heater), AC/Q (11.5W, 4V heater), etc.|$|R
5000|$|The alto bugle is a {{voice that}} was created during the two piston era in the 1970s. These {{instruments}} were loosely based on the alto horns used in marching bands and brass bands in a bell-front marching configuration. Alto bugles are still manufactured today in a three <b>valve</b> configuration. <b>Bore</b> size for the alto bugle typically ranges from [...]468"-.470" [...] As an alto voice in G, {{it has the same}} bottom end of its range as the soprano family.|$|R
50|$|Teredina shells {{consist of}} 2 short, hooked valves {{with a pair}} of furrows and each valve with {{transverse}} ridges. The overall body was long and clud-shaped. Teredina used the ridges on each <b>valve</b> to <b>bore</b> into drift wood by rocking back and forth; its long body shape allowed for large intestines for it to carry bacteria capable of breaking down the cellulose in the wood. Petrified drift wood with Teridina burrows {{can be found in the}} Cretaceous rocks of Vancouver Island.|$|R
5000|$|The drive {{package on}} the Royal Star Venture {{includes}} a liquid-cooled [...] (referred to as 1,300 cc) V4 engine fed by four carburettors - one per cylinder - primed by a manually operated push-pull choke. It has four valves per cylinder, overhead camshafts, and shim-over bucket <b>valves.</b> <b>Bore</b> x stroke is 79 x 66 mm (3.11 x 2.60 in) with a compression ratio of 10:1. The five-speed, overdrive transmission {{is part of}} the engine case and the engine and transmission share the same oil. The drive shaft and final drive assembly are built into {{the left side of the}} double-sided swing arm. Swing arm motion is damped by a mono shock mounted in the center of the frame. The clutch is of the wet plate design and is hydraulically activated by the left hand lever.The gear selection lever is typically mounted on the left side and is the rocker-style, heel-and-toe type sitting above a spring-loaded, hinged foot board. The rear brake pedal on the opposite (right) side also sits above a spring-loaded, hinged foot board. There are foot boards fitted for the pillion passenger that are also hinged but not spring-loaded, so they can be upright when not in use or dropped to the horizontal position for riding.|$|R
5000|$|The 1E is a 1.0 L (999 cc) {{carbureted}} 12 <b>valve</b> SOHC engine. <b>Bore</b> was 70.5 mm {{and stroke}} was 64.0 mm. Compression ratio was 9.0:1. It appeared in 1985. Output ranged at about [...] at 6,000 rpm, while torque is 75 lbf·ft (102 N·m) at 3,500 rpm.|$|R
50|$|The affinities of Aplacophorans {{have long}} been uncertain. Molecular and fossil {{evidence}} seemed to put Aplacophorans in the clade Aculifera, as a sister group to Polyplacophora. The discovery of Kulindroplax in 2012, a fossil aplacophoran with a polyplacophoran-like armour, strongly supports this hypothesis, and shows that aplacophorans evolved from progenitors that <b>bore</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
40|$|The sound {{produced}} by the trombone {{may be seen as}} the coupling of the input pressure from the lips (the product of the volume velocity output from a pressure-controlled <b>valve</b> and the <b>bore’s</b> characteristic impedance) with the instrument mouthpiece, bore and bell.

50|$|This design {{also has}} {{operational}} advantages, there are significantly fewer potential leak paths within the double {{block and bleed}} section of the pipeline. Because the <b>valves</b> are full <b>bore</b> with an uninterrupted flow orifice they have got a negligible pressure drop across the unit. The pipelines where these valves are installed can also be pigged without any problems.|$|R
5000|$|The 1SZ-FE is 1.0 L (997 cc). 4 <b>valve</b> per cylinder. <b>Bore</b> is 69 mm {{and stroke}} is 66.7 mm, with a {{compression}} ratio of 10.0:1. Output is [...] at 6000 rpm with 95 Nm of torque at 4000 rpm. It features VVT-i, off-set type crankshaft which reduces friction losses and narrow-angle valves. Engine weight of 68 kg {{was achieved by}} using cast-iron cylinder block produced by cold-box method.|$|R
5000|$|Louis Coatalen {{designed}} the Cossack as a twin overhead camshaft 60° V-12, with four <b>valves</b> per cylinder, <b>bore</b> of 110 mm and stroke of 130 mm. Output from the Cossack was [...] @ 2,000rpm, with a running weight of 1,372.5 lb, driving a large diameter propeller through a 2:1 reduction gear. Construction of the Cossack was largely of aluminium alloy with cast-iron cylinder blocks and integral heads {{in groups of}} three.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{analyzes}} the first evidences of predation observed on recent brackishostracod {{populations of the}} Lagoon of Venice. The study of ninety-nine samples andalmost 1300 specimens allowed extraction of 12 <b>bored</b> <b>valves.</b> The bioerosion structures(Oichnus simplex Bromley) are concentrated in the central area of the valves. Boreholediameter shows a negative but not significant correlation with the dimensions of thepredated valves, whereas the number of bored shells is significantly correlated with theostracod density. Predation affects the most abundant species of this environment (mainlyadults and the last juvenile instars) ...|$|R
5000|$|A tuba {{with its}} tubing wrapped for placing the {{instrument}} on the player's lap is usually called a concert tuba {{or simply a}} tuba. Tubas with the bell pointing forward (pavillon tournant) instead of upward are often called recording tubas because of their popularity {{in the early days}} of recorded music, as their sound could more easily be directed at the recording microphone. When wrapped to surround the body for cavalry bands on horseback or marching, it is traditionally known as a hélicon. The modern sousaphone, named after American bandmaster John Philip Sousa, resembles a hélicon with the bell pointed up (in the original models as the J. W. Pepper prototype and Sousa's concert instruments) and then curved to point forward (as developed by Conn and others). Some ancestors of the tuba, such as the military bombardon, had unusual <b>valve</b> and <b>bore</b> arrangements compared to modern tubas.|$|R
50|$|Bass {{trombone}} {{music is}} written in bass clef, and some tenor trombone music is in tenor clef on older scores or marches. Bass trombone music was historically written in concert pitch bass clef due to bass trombones originally being pitched in the key of G. As instrument technology modernized, {{the need for a}} bass trombone in G diminished with the introduction of the Bb bass trombone with F rotary <b>valve.</b> The larger <b>bore</b> and open wrap of the F valve gave the Bb bass trombone a lower available playing register than the straight G bass trombone.|$|R
50|$|In the 3 years {{leading up}} to 1913 William Brough had been {{developing}} a flat-twin engine in-line with the frame. It was very similar to the ABC engines of that period. This 497cc engine had overhead <b>valves,</b> 70mm <b>bore</b> and 64.5mm stroke, and had a magneto fitted above and a 2-speed gearbox below. By the end of 1914 it had replaced all other engines in the Brough range, and using it only 3-models were planned for 1915. The three models were the HS - which was fitted with a two-speed countershaft gear operated by dog clutches, with chain drive to the gearbox, and John Bull rubber belt drive to the rear wheel over an adjustable pulley allowing the top gear range to be varied. No clutch or kick-start was provided. The second model was the HB, which was fitted with a Sturmey-Archer 3-speed hub gearbox and handle starter. The third model was the HTT, which was very similar to the HS but fitted with a specially tuned engine with high-compression, lightweight steel pistons, different camshafts, and special front cylinder lubrication.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation {{based on the}} method of characteristics is employed to study the dynamic response of ball valves and check <b>valves</b> following full <b>bore</b> rupture of high pressure gas pipelines. The study, performed {{in conjunction with the}} hypothetical rupture of a 145 km pipeline containing methane at 133 bar, includes simulating the effects of valve proximity to the rupture plane and the delay in closure on the total amount of inventory released prior to pipeline isolation. The accompanying pressure oscillations and surges are also accounted for. The results are in turn used to recommend guidelines regarding the appropriate choice of emergency shutdown valve depending on the failure scenario...|$|R
5000|$|The 1GZ-FE is a 5.0 L (4996 cc) V12 48-valve DOHC engine with {{variable}} <b>valve</b> timing (VVT-i). <b>Bore</b> is 81 mm {{and stroke}} is 80.8 mm, with a compression ratio of 10.5:1. Official output as per Japanese Manufacturers' Agreement is [...] at 5200 rpm although true power output {{is estimated to}} be around [...] Peak torque of 481 Nm is at 4000 rpm with over 400 Nm available from as little as 1200 rpm. The fuel injection system is controlled by two ECUs, one for each bank of cylinders. The engine is capable of running on a single bank of 6 cylinders should a malfunction occur.|$|R
50|$|There {{were further}} company changes and by December 1921 adverts for the Quadrant {{motorcycle}} listed {{the company name}} as March, Newark and Co Ltd, Quadrant Works, Birmingham. In 1922 Quadrant's London agent Clifford Wilson entered the International Six Days trial on his 654cc Quadrant, he got a gold medal, and best in class. Introduced in 1922 was a side <b>valve</b> 490cc single (<b>bore</b> 70mm, stroke 100mm), earlier models having a side exhaust, and rear inlet valve. In 1924 two models were offered, the 490 cc side-valve and a hefty 624 cc side-valve with bore and stroke of 85x110. The Quadrant range included outdated side-valve motorcycles, updated in 1927 with the launch of a 490 cc overhead-valve model, {{but it did not}} sell well and the company was wound up in 1928.|$|R
5000|$|The Walter Minor is {{a family}} of four- and six-cylinder {{inverted}} inline air-cooled engines, developed under auspices of ing. Šimůnek and used on light aircraft. First produced in 1929, the Minor engines' family has an advanced design for the period and sports steel cylinders, aluminum heads and overhead <b>valves,</b> with identical <b>bore</b> and stroke of 105 mm and 115 mm, respectively. Typical power ratings varied from 105 hp to 160 hp. [...] After Walter concentrated on the turbine powerplants only, the production of piston engines has been transferred to the Avia company that further developed the family, bringing fuel injection, as the Avia M-137 and M-337.

5000|$|In {{addition}} {{to the length of}} the instrument, which dictates the fundamental pitch, tubas also vary in overall width of the tubing sections. Tuba sizes are usually denoted by a quarter system, with [...] designating a normal, full-size tuba. Larger rotary instruments are known as kaisertubas and are often denoted [...] Larger piston tubas, particularly those with front action, are sometimes known as grand orchestral tubas (examples: the Conn 36J Orchestra Grand Bass from the 1930s, and the current model Hirsbrunner HB-50 Grand Orchestral, which is a replica of the large York tubas owned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra). Grand orchestral tubas are generally described as [...] tubas. Smaller instruments may be described as [...] instruments. No standards exist for these designations, and their use is up to manufacturers who usually use them to distinguish among the instruments in their own product line. The size designation is related to the larger outer branches, and not to the bore of the tubing at the <b>valves,</b> though the <b>bore</b> is usually reported in instrument specifications. ( [...] Tuba may make different sounds when dented in different spots of the instrument.)The quarter system is also not related to bell size, at least across manufacturers. The largest tuba is the contrabass tuba (Besson) and is the lowest.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} experimental work and simulations of pressure surges resulting from fast closing valves and activation of an emergency release coupling (ERC) in ship-to-ship LNG transfer. The first part {{presents the results of}} an ambient water flow test with a fast closing 4 -inch full <b>bore</b> <b>valve</b> in combination with a 4 -inch flexible multi-composite hose. High amplitude pressure surges up to 4 times the working pressure occur upstream of the valve. Pressure surge amplitudes strongly depend on valve closing time and flow rate. The propagation speed in the upstream hose is lowered considerably due to the hose flexibility. Furthermore the temporarily deformation of the hose results in loss of energy and acoustic damping of the pressure surge amplitudes. The measurement results are compared to the results of modeling. Acoustic damping and propagation speed of sound show a non-linear behavior of the hose, due to a varying internal pressure, which is not captured in the present modeling techniques. The second part of the paper {{describes the}} results of a full scale flow test on an 8 -inch ERC (KLAW make) for LNG ship-to-ship transfer (Figure 1). The ERC in the test is located downstream of an 8 -inch 15 -meter long multi-composite flexible hose. The test is intended to investigate operational and mechanical integrity, spill rate and the impact of pressure transients and shock loads on the ERC including upstream hose and downstream piping...|$|R
40|$|Boring {{behaviour}} and drilling mechanism {{were investigated}} by visual observations. In this study, of {{two kinds of}} holes (the outer and inner holes) which are formed by drilling of boring gastropod Lunatia fortunei (Naticidae), the diameters of the outer holes are broader and larger {{than those of the}} inner holes, and their holes look like the crater in shape, as seen in all <b>valves</b> of bivalves <b>bored</b> by Naticidae species. Two kinds of glands (the accessory boring gland and accessory salivary gland) on the foots of boring gastropods have been investigated. Of them, it has been confirmed that only the accessory salivary glands on the foots secreted sulphuric (acidic) components in the mucus (secretion), while the accessory boring glands on the foots did not secrete their components. In this study, we confirmed that L. fortunei possess the accessory boring gland on the foot, as seen in most species in Naticidae. Accoeding to the results of the experiment of the blue litmus paper tests of the mucus (secretions) secreted from the accessory boring gland the color of the blue litmus paper did not turn red in color because chemical components of mucus (secretion) secreted from the accessory boring gland on the foot of L. fortunei (boring gastropod) were not acidic components. It is supposed that the mucus, which is secreted from the accessory boring gland, contained gelatin-like substances or enzymes without acidic components, as already reported in Naticidae species. Therefore, these substances may be involved in softening the surface of the valve...|$|R
