40|$|Parliament {{and protest}} don’t fit easily together, says John Warhurst THE {{substantial}} minority of Australian parliamentarians {{opposed to the}} war in Iraq were caught in the middle this week. They faced not only a personal dilemma but also a role dilemma and an institu tional dilemma. They {{would have been better off}} not being MPs if they wanted to protest. At least their dilemmas would have been fewer. In one sense the idea that Parliament and protest don’t mix is counter-intuitive. Surely both the parliamentarians and the institutions of parliament itself are in a privileged position. Parliament regularly attracts protests such as the ‘National Convergence’ against President Bush. Apart from the problem that Parliament House in Canberra is a long way from our capital cities it has lots of advantages as a site for protests. Media coverage is always intense. Parliament is home to our federal parliamentarians, many of them newsworthy in themselves. The Press Gallery journalists are on hand. So protest is generously reported. Other arguments could be advanced for the centrality of parliament to protest. President Bush spoke to parliamentarians, of course. They were closer to him than any of the general citizenry. They surely had the best chance to respond. As the political heart of the national capital, Parliament House offers protesters a more appropriate location than the streets of Melbourne or Sydney. In terms of democratic theory what better place is there to protest than where the people’s representatives gather? But in other important senses Parliament is not the best place for protest. This is not just because it was always going to be difficult for critics to get anywhere near the US president for the sort of measured and sensible discussion of the issues that would have been best suited to the occasion. First, Parliament House itself as a place to protest is inappropriate. The rules of life in parliament’s two chambers are designed to squeeze behaviour into strict parliamentary forms. It is a controlled environment. MPs are meant to respect the parliamentary rules. These rules apply to what they can wear, what they can say and when they can say it. Parliament House is supposed to be a dignified, formal environment. These restrictions certainly apply to the public too, even on normal occasions, much less yesterday when they were kept well away. Visitors are not supposed to make any protest at all, either by word or deed. If you break the rules in the <b>Visitors</b> <b>Gallery,</b> as some do occasionally by shouting out a comment or two about the action below, the attendants immediately eject you. The activity of Parliament is not meant to be a sport in which the spectators get involved. Spectators are meant to be seen but not heard. These rules are even tighter when a special guest such as President Bush addresses parliament. The public, other than a few selected guests, are excluded altogether. Even the staff of Parliament not directly involved were not wanted. They were encouraged to vanish. Protesters outside the building were even prevented from using loudspeakers - for reasons of dignity rather than security. This makes such visits by foreign leaders very strange events indeed. They are unparliamentary in the sense that they are not about debate. Other than being an address to assembled parliamentarians they could be held anywhere. Other parliamentary events where there is no reply and where parliamentarians listen respectfully in silence, such as the governor-general’s address, at least are subject to a later response. When gathered on a rare occasion to hear a visiting dignitary it is as if MPs are in a church listening to a sermon. They are a captive audience. Parliamentarians who want to protest have various options, none of them fully satisfactory as those involved probably realised. One avenue is to attempt to try to manipulate the process inside parliament. One early idea was for anti-war MPs to turn their backs on Bush, just as Aboriginal protesters had once turned their backs on John Howard. Labor’s Harry Quick suggested armbands. But would the gesture be understood? Some suggested wearing anti-war badges. But would they be noticed? Labor’s Tanya Plibersek suggested presenting Bush with a bound selection of anti-war parliamentary speeches. But could she get close enough to the President to present them? The Greens invited as their official guests the family and legal representatives of the two Australians held in Guantanamo Bay. A second option is for parliamentarians to join protesters outside parliament. On this occasion several MPs, including Quick, Greens’ Senator Bob Brown, Democrat Senator Lyn Allison and Labor’s Carmen Lawrence, were scheduled to speak to the National Convergence early in the morning before taking their places inside. This makes more sense if the MPs then go inside to continue the battle. But if that is not possible, and they are forced to sit silently, then it smacks of a token gesture. Thirdly, there was the option of not turning up at all. Surely empty seats, if there were enough of them, would make an impact. But would this be seen as not fulfilling the role that parliamentarians were elected for? Independent Peter Andren was the first to reveal this intention. Others to do so included Democrats Brian Greig and John Cherry and Independent Meg Lees. These options and dilemmas for parliamentarians all served only to demonstrate how ill fitted Parliament as an institution is in which to conduct a protest.
