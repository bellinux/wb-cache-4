40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The diesel engine currently accounts for 32 per cent of the new passenger car sales in Europe. In the US, diesel-power is responsible for 94 per cent of all freight movement. Comparing European Stage III standard petrol and diesel passenger car emissions, diesel NOx emissions are still considered a concern. This thesis investigates the mechanisms by which oxides of nitrogen are formed during diesel combustion. It reviews the current methods of controlling NOx emissions, such as retarding fuel injection timing, exhaust gas re-circulation (EGR), water injection and exhaust after-treatment. Modelling using a phenomenological model, is used to demonstrate the extended Zeldovich mechanism and formation trends, the effects of EGR and {{the significance of the}} Zeldovich mechanism rate constants. Modified Zeldovich rate constants are proposed to improve the correlation to measured data. Clearly, EGR is currently the most effective method of reducing NOx emissions from passenger car diesel engines. The way EGR works in suppressing NOx formation is reviewed in detail. Experimentation on a 1. 8 litre inline 4 -cylinder 4 -valve per cylinder DI diesel with a <b>variable</b> <b>nozzle</b> turbine (VNT) <b>turbocharger</b> was used to demonstrate the concept of "additional" EGR on this small automotive engine. "Additional" EGR is the concept whereby a proportion of the EGR is added to the total charge, so that the volumetric efficiency increases as EGR is introduced. By using "additional" EGR, the benefits of lower NOx emissions combined with reduced particulates emissions and improved fuel consumption were clearly demonstrated at two test conditions. The reasons for achieving lower NOx emissions when using a VNT turbocharger and EGR have been explained. Finally, several methods of calculating EGR proportion were used and compared against true mass flow. The use of a CO 2 balance was found to be the most accurate method.

50|$|Initially the Fortuner {{was sold}} with 4 {{different}} types of 2 petrol engines and 2 diesel engines. All variants were offered in RWD or 4WD configuration, with 5-speed manual transmission and a 4 or 5-speed automatic transmission. Its high body model has been criticized as unstable, and not aerodynamic when running at higher speeds. In August 2012, the 2.5 L common-rail turbodiesel 2KD-FTV and the 3.0 L common-rail turbodiesel 1KD-FTV engine was upgraded to include a <b>variable</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>turbocharger</b> (VNT) to increase power and torque about 60%, also reducing fuel consumption up to 30%. With this VNT equipment, now Fortuner can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in about 11 seconds (less than 10 seconds for 3.0 L engine). It was launched to commemorate Pertamina's successful expedition from Jakarta, Indonesia to Venice, Italy (a distance of roughly 20,000 kilometers) using a group of Fortuners.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, all Daytonas {{received}} an interior restyling, featuring a more modern-feeling cockpit style wraparound dashboard. Also in 1990, a <b>Variable</b> <b>Nozzle</b> <b>Turbocharger</b> (VNT Turbo IV) borrowed from Shelby's 1989 vnt csx, was {{offered in the}} Shelby model producing the same [...] as the Turbo II but, it eliminated turbo lag and improved driveability. Also for 1990 a 3.0 L SOHC V6 from Mitsubishi was made available, {{as well as a}} redesigned interior {{similar to that of the}} Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible. In addition, 1990 saw the introduction of a standard driver's side airbag to the Daytona. This was in keeping with Chrysler's decision to offer a driver's side airbags across most models. In 1991, the 2.2 liter turbo was dropped in favor of the new 2.5L [...] "High Torque Turbo." [...] Although sporting a lesser 152 hp, this power-plant offered 210 ft. lbs. of torque, exceeding that of the Turbo II. Also new was the addition of an IROC model with either the 3.0 v6 or the turbocharged 2.5 L engine. Visually, Iroc models differed from lesser models, having a ground effects kit and alloy wheels, among other differences. The Iroc Decals where added in halfway through 1991 even though all Shelby Daytona's from 1991 where considered to be an [...] "IROC", which could be revealed if one looked up their VIN # online. There are no difference between a 91 Shelby and Iroc besides the decals and the J in the vin sequence. On 1991 model Daytona Shelbys the vin had the sequence `G74J` and the Iroc's had the sequence G743. Over the years people have added the wrong shelby or iroc decals to their cars, one way to correct this is to check the vin sequence to determine what model it is.|$|E
