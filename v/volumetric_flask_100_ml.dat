40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} for assessing the formation of hydrocarbon gaseous compounds during bioleaching of copper sulphide ores with mesophilic microorganisms. Three different mineral samples were used: a pyrite concentrate, a chalcopyrite concentrate and a copper sulphide ore rock from El Teniente mine, Chile, containing 1. 2 % copper. Mineral samples were bioleached in 250 <b>ml</b> shake <b>flasks</b> containing <b>100</b> <b>ml</b> of basal medium inoculated either with a pure strain of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans or a natural bacteria consortium obtained from the acid leaching of the El Teniente copper ore in columns. Each sealed shake flask system was fed with a flow of synthetic air and the exit stream was passed through a column containing an adsorbent material and next through a water trap to avoid back-contamination with air from the environment. Compounds present in the adsorbent material after 90 days of bioleaching were analysed using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry technique with a procedure that detects 162 different hydrocarbon gaseous compounds. Experimental results permitted to identify the formation of significant amounts of five different types of hydrocarbon gaseous compounds: di-,tri- and penta-methyl benzene, 11 th-ethyl alkane and branched alkanes. The number of formed gaseous hydrocarbon compounds increased in experiments conducted with the natural bacterial consortium, where their formation appears to be enhanced {{by the presence of}} heterotrophic microorganisms. This work provides the first experimental evidence of the formation of hydrocarbon gaseous compounds in bioleaching...|$|R
