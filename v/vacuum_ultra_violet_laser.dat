An essentially new type of reflectometer has been developed for the present work, which gives accurate and reliable results at near normal incidence. Reflectivity results were obtained for a range of crystals with natural (111) faces that had been subjected to widely different surface treatments. It is concluded that the reflectivity spectra are largely independent of surface treatment and represent the intrinsic optical properties of orthorhombic sulphur. Reflectivity spectra have been determined for Germanium specimens to check the reliability of the instrument and experimental technique. The Kramers-Kronig relation has been used to analyse the reflectivity data and values of the optical constants n and k have been derived for photon energies up to 14 eV [...] A discussion is given of the general nature of the Kramers-Kronig analysis, and a suitable procedure for processing the sulphur data chosen. The internal consistency of the calculations has been confirmed by the use of sum rules. Where possible, the computed data have been compared to experimental results. The absorption coefficient in particular shows good correlation with experimental single crystal and thin film work. An interesting feature of the absorption is the "window" at 8 eV. which may enable thin films of sulphur to be used as band pass filters in this region. The relation that exists between certain functions of the optical constants and band structure is indicated. The generated values of the complex part of the dielectric constant, E 2, are analysed and the results tentatively interpreted in terms of band structure. The difficulties of such an interpretation are brought out, but the information obtained is in substantial agreement with a qualitative scheme proposed by Gibbons.

By analyzing the temporal evolution of electron yields from ionization of two transient species, assigned to CTTS and its first excited state, both their ultrafast population and relaxation dynamics were determined. For ionization a femtosecond laser probe photon of 3. 55 eV photon energy is used. Comparison with resonant one photon excitation studies shows that the highly excited initial states populated in the present wotk exhibit similar relaxation characteristics.

The application for these devices is dominantly seen to be in wafer scale testing for optical integrated circuits, though the planar surface may offer benefits in other areas such as 3 dimensional optical circuits. Wafer scale testing is critical to reducing production costs and increasing production yield. In this thesis a method that allows testing of individual optical components within a complex optical integrated circuit is described. The method is based on diffractive grating couplers,which {{can be used to}} efficiently couple light from an optical fibre to a silicon waveguide. In this work gratings are fabricated by the introduction of lattice disorder,induced by ion implantation of germanium opposed to the typical surface relief structure typically used. The lattice damage alters the crystalline structure of silicon, hence causing a change in the refractive index. Coupling performance determined empirically, showed a 5. 5 dB loss between the fibre and planar waveguide modes,which is not dissimilar to the performance of typical uniform surface relief gratings currently used. Gratings fabricated using this method can be erased via localised laser annealing after device testing is completed.

Here we show that zinc oxide (ZnO) can be prep ared using only room - temperature processes, using the molecular thin film precursor zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), follow ed by <b>vacuum</b> <b>ultra</b> - <b>violet</b> light treatment to elicit degradation of the organic components and transformation of the deposited film to oxide mate rial. The degradation mechanism was assessed by studying {{the influence of the}} atmosphere during the reaction: i t was particularly sensitive to oxygen pressure in the chamber and optimal degradation conditions were established as 3 mbar with 40 % oxygen in nitrogen. The morphology of the film was relatively unchanged during the reaction, but detailed analysis of its composition using both scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) revealed that a 40 nm thick layer containing ZnO results from the 100 nm thick precursor after complete reaction. Our methodology represent s a simple route for the fabrication of oxides and multilayer structures that can be easily integrated into current molecular thin film growth setups, without the n eed for a high temperature step...|$|R
40|$|For Earth {{re-entry}} at velocities between 8 and 11. 5 km/s, {{the accuracy}} of NASA's computational uid dynamic and radiative simulations of non-equilibrium shock layer radiation is assessed through comparisons with measurements. These measurements were obtained in the NASA Ames Research Center's Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) facility. The experiments were aimed at measuring the spatially and spectrally resolved radiance at relevant entry conditions for both an approximate Earth atmosphere (79 % N 2 : 21 % O 2 by mole) {{as well as a}} more accurate composition featuring the trace species Ar and CO 2 (78. 08 % N 2 : 20. 95 % O 2 : 0. 04 % CO 2 : 0. 93 % Ar by mole). The experiments were configured to target a wide range of conditions, of which shots from 8 to 11. 5 km/s at 0. 2 Torr (26. 7 Pa) are examined in this paper. The non-equilibrium component was chosen to be the focus of this study as it can account for a significant percentage of the emitted radiation for Earth re-entry, and more importantly, non-equilibrium has traditionally been assigned a large uncertainty for vehicle design. The main goals of this study are to present the shock tube data {{in the form of a}} non-equilibrium metric, evaluate the level of agreement between the experiment and simulations, identify key discrepancies and to examine critical aspects of modeling non-equilibrium radiating flows. Radiance pro les integrated over discreet wavelength regions, ranging from the <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Ultra</b> <b>Violet</b> (VUV) through to the Near Infra-Red (NIR), were compared in order to maximize both the spectral coverage and the number of experiments that could be used in the analysis. A previously defined non-equilibrium metric has been used to allow comparisons with several shots and reveal trends in the data. Overall, LAURA/HARA is shown to under-predict EAST by as much as 40 % and over-predict by as much as 12 % depending on the shock speed. DPLR/NEQAIR is shown to under-predict EAST by as much as 50 % and over-predict by as much as 20 % depending on the shock speed. The one standard deviation scatter in the EAST results was calculated to be 31 %. An estimate for the upper bound of the absolute error in wall-directed heat flux was calculated. Below 9 km/s, where the relative difference is large, the absolute error in radiative heat flux due to non-equilibrium models is estimated to be less then 1 W/sq cm. At the highest shock speed of 11 km/s, the error in non-equilibrium is estimated to be less than 20 W/sq cm...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{separation}} and detection of standard resin acids (RAs), {{commonly found in}} pulp mill effluent and known to bioaccumulate in fish bile, was optimized using cyclodextrin modified electrokinetic capillary electrophoresis (CD-EKC) with <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> (UV) and <b>laser</b> induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. Optimal separation conditions were found with RA standards using UV detection at 214 nm, with a 72 mM sodium borate buffer pH 9. 25, containing 35 mM beta-cyclodextrin sulfobutyl ether (SPCD), 15 mM of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MECD) and a 37 cm capillary with an internal diameter of 50 pm. This resulted in a 12 -min separation and the identification of 9 peaks, with a LOD of 10 ppm. To enable increased sensitivity, RAs were derivatized using the fluorescent label 4 -BrMMc. A method for extracting resin acids from spiked fish bile and pulp mill effluent was developed, the extracted samples were derivatized, separated and identified using CD-EKC with LIF detection. The method of extraction and derivatization using CD-EKC was applied to biological samples of contaminated effluent and fish bile. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis describes {{the establishment of a}} laser damage facility in the <b>ultra</b> <b>violet.</b> The <b>laser</b> is a pulsed excimer laser (25 n sec) capable of an output energy of 1 Joule at wavelengths of 193, 245, 308, 337 and 351 nm. The problems involved in making reliable damage threshold measurements are addressed, such as energy calibration, beam attenuation, damage detection and temporal and spatial beam profiling. A computer controlled frame store and video system enabling single shot spatial profiling and peak fluence measurements to be performed is described. Such a system is essential if reliable results are to be obtained from lasers whose spatial output cannot be described by a Gaussian. Using the damage facility, work has been performed on single crystal Caf 2 laser windows ascertaining the bulk and surface damage thresholds as a function of crystal purity, surface finishing and polishing procedures. The results of a T. E. M. study give an insight into the fundamental damage mechanism of this material to be electron avalanche breakdown. The role of transient primary defects in the bulk breakdown of CaF 2 has been investigated using dye laser probe techniques, and indicate that the presence of U. V. generated self trapped excitons, acting as sinks for the conduction band electrons, greatly enhances the damage threshold. Work on coatings using a LIMA (Laser-induced ion mass analyser) is reported and the potential of this machine as a laser damage diagnostic tool is explored...|$|R
