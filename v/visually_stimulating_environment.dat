40|$|Every year, law {{enforcement}} officials, emergency personnel, and other workers stopped in traffic outside their vehicles are struck by inattentive drivers. Until now, most {{efforts to prevent}} these types of accidents have been geared toward making these at-risk parties more conspicuous to oncoming motorists. In contrast, this work proposes an alerting mechanism designed specifically to induce defensive behavior {{on the part of}} the at-risk officers (or other roadside personnel), once a hazardous situation has been detected. The immediate objective of this research was to produce an effective alarm prototype for a high noise, low-light operation environment such as a dimly lit highway shoulder. Based on fieldwork and background research, four such prototypes were engineered and evaluated for user response speed and subjective preference. Two of these alarm prototypes were auditory sirens and two were haptic vibrations, one placed at the waist, and one at the wrist. Haptic vibrations, which we hypothesized would be more salient in a loud and <b>visually</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>environment,</b> proved to induce statistically significantly faster responses than the auditory alarms and were wel...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{described}} 1. {{the investigation}} undertaken {{to trace the}} strategies used by children in selecting books to borrow, use or browse in two children’s public libraries, and 2. map the information seeking patterns adopted by the selected children. The sample comprised 43 children who used the Bayan Budiman Children’s Library, Petaling Jaya and the Kuala Lumpur Children’s Library. The children were randomly chosen, aged between 7 and 12 and comprised those who entered the library with the observed behaviour of selecting books to browse, use or borrow. Two stages were used to collect data; 1. observing the children’s behavior {{as they enter the}} library to the point when they pick up a book to browse, read or borrow for fifteen to twenty minutes and 2. interviewing those selected with a semi-structure questionnaire. Belkin, et al’s (1993) information search strategy (ISS) dimensions were used to transcribe children’s browsing and selecting behavior. Based on the observations and interviews respondent’s behaviour was mapped to illustrate the children’s choosing process. The findings indicated that 1. browsing was the most popular method used when choosing a book combined with various strategies such as looking for a book by an author or series, finding a book by subjects, visually or physically scanning and recognizing the physical composition of the book; 2. children based their selection on the storyline, illustrations, cover designs and typography of the books; and 3. the searching behaviour is likely to be non-linear in nature. The majority of the children faced no problems in choosing or locating a book as most are regular visitors. A few indicated being overwhelmed by the library’s large collection or, face initial confusion before they started to browse and interact with resources. Children used visual cues rather from textual information when searching for books, inferring that children libraries need to be supported with adequate and <b>visually</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>environment</b> to make book searching fun and fruitful...|$|E
40|$|We use {{visualisation}} {{technology to}} engage people with cultural heritage {{in much the}} same way that story and song have for millenia. The Internet has not yet lived up to its potential to distribute these high-fidelity, <b>visually</b> <b>stimulating</b> virtual <b>environments.</b> As such it is the responsibility of the cash-strapped museum sector to provide these experiences. This paper describes our approach of using the traditional stability of UNIX coupled with the low-cost of GNU/Linux on commodity hardware to provide an easy-to-use technology base for a non-IT sector. Unlike other clusters designed to provide for high-performance computing or highly available services, our cluster is designed for distributed rendering of graphics. We further demonstrate how we use chromium and distributed multi-headed X to address the dollar-cost of high-fidelity content production for cultural visualisation...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} {{changing}} needs of students, teachers and schools {{need to create}} a more <b>visually</b> <b>stimulating</b> learning <b>environment.</b> The modern needs of visual learners can be met through students creating hypermedia stacks that can be viewed and heard by both teachers and students alike. The visual images, sights, and sounds provided in these resources can {{have a positive impact on}} student learning, retention, motivation, attention, and achievement. This study investigates the effects of HyperStudio [...] a multimedia =uthoring tool [...] on the achievement of seventh grade social studies students. After approximately three weeks, the students (n= 17) who were instructed using HyperStudio did not achieve statistically significant higher scores on the post-test than the students (n= 17) whose instruction did not include HyperStudio. The study showed that the HyperStudio instruction method was not effective in raising the achievement level of the participating students. However, students in the experimental group had a more positive attitud...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a discussion of}} {{the pros and cons of}} instructivism and constructivism in the mathematics classroom, and endeavours to show why the latter is a preferable methodology to the former when considering the effective use of technology to enhance visualisation. The adoption of a constructivist approach to the teaching and learning of Mathematics has highlighted a shift from teacher dominance. <b>Visually</b> <b>stimulating</b> computer <b>environments</b> can allow students to become immersed in their own knowledge construction. However, it is not a trivial matter how to utilise this considerable technological capability most effectively for educational benefit, emphasising the importance of a teaching and learning methodology. It is necessary to encourage more exploratory approaches to learning, where students can be the initiators and controllers of their own learning. There is much empirical evidence that this approach significantly improves the understanding of higher order concepts. Knowledge is built up from personal experiences, and making these experiences more dynamic will assist in the development of cognitive structures. Computer-based attractive environments with visually compelling displays, together with facilities for interaction, can provide the setting for more dynamic, powerfu...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Erectile {{response}} in mammals is centrally and peripherally regulated by androgens. Severe hypogonadism in men usually results in loss of libido and potency. The present studies {{were designed to}} evaluate the possible influence of circulating androgens in the regulation of sexual function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15 men with severe hypogonadism (testosterone less than 2. 0 ng/ml) were recruited. The control group consisted of 20 patients with psychogenic erectile dysfunction. All subjects underwent nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) and rigidity monitoring during 2 consecutive nights, evaluation of cavernous artery flow using penile color duplex ultrasound (P-CDU), and real-time <b>visually</b> <b>stimulated</b> erection evaluation at baseline and after administration of 50 mg sildenafil or 3 mg apomorphine. NPT, P-CDU and <b>visually</b> <b>stimulated</b> erection were evaluated after 6 months of therapy with a 5 mg daily testosterone patch. RESULTS: NPT analysis in subjects with severe hypogonadism showed {{a significant decrease in}} sleep related erections. P-CDU showed a partial erectile response with an alteration of the parameters analyzed, and the <b>visually</b> <b>stimulated</b> erections test was pathological. Administration of 3 mg apomorphine and 50 mg sildenafil has no influence on erectile function. Testosterone treatment for 6 months induced normalization of NPT and P-CDU parameters, and of <b>visually</b> <b>stimulated</b> erection effects with the restoration of a normal response to pharmacological stimulation with apomorphine or sildenafil. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that testosterone has {{a key role in the}} central and peripheral modulation of erectile function even if the accurate testosterone plasma level threshold that may influence these processes remains to be established...|$|R
