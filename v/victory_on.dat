5|$|Nordmann was {{promoted}} to Major (major) on 18 June 1942. On 26 June 1942 Nordmann crashed his Messerschmitt Bf 109 F-2 (Werknummer 12825—factory number). The aircraft flipped during the landing and Nordmann suffered a basilar fractured skull, an injury typical of high-speed crashes. Although he flew again shortly after the crash his injury required hospitalization in August. Nordmann, who had been assisted by Hauptmann Joachim Müncheberg as a Geschwaderkommodore in training, temporarily replaced him during his absence. On 17 January 1943 Nordmann's Focke-Wulf Fw 190 {{was involved in a}} midair collision with Hauptmann Rudolf Busch, Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG 51. Busch was killed and Nordmann, severely injured, did not fly operationally again. In total, Nordmann claimed 78 aerial victories, 69 of which on the Eastern Front, flying over 800 combat missions.

5|$|A German <b>victory</b> <b>on</b> the Battle of Britain Day was unlikely. It {{could only}} have been {{possible}} if Park had made crass errors and had been caught on the ground.

Moreover, during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength. It {{would have been able to}} meet the Luftwaffe again on the morrow.|$|E
