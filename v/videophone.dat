5|$|Criminal mastermind the Hood (voiced by Ray Barrett) is telepathically {{linked to}} his half-brother, Kyrano (David Graham), the manservant on Tracy Island. Abusing this {{connection}} and inflicting severe psychological trauma on his sibling, he discovers that International Rescue – the Tracy family's newly formed life-saving organisation – {{is ready to}} start operations. Determined to steal the secrets of IR's Thunderbird machines, the Hood plots to have the Tracys called to a disaster situation of his own design. Travelling from his temple hideout in the Malaysian jungle to London International Airport, he plants a bomb next to the landing gear hydraulics of Air Terrainean's new Fireflash – an atomic-powered, hypersonic airliner departing for her maiden flight to Tokyo. One of the passengers is Kyrano's daughter, Tin-Tin. In an anonymous <b>videophone</b> call to London Tower, the Hood warns Commander Norman of Air Traffic Control that the motion-sensitive device will detonate from the impact of landing.|$|E

50|$|Another {{protocol}} used by <b>videophones</b> is H.324, which mixes {{call setup}} and video compression. <b>Videophones</b> that work on regular phone lines typically use H.324, but the bandwidth {{is limited by}} the modem to around 33 kbit/s, limiting the video quality and frame rate. A slightly modified version of H.324 called 3G-324M defined by 3GPP is also used by some cellphones that allow video calls, typically for use only in UMTS networks.|$|R

50|$|<b>Videophones</b> have {{historically}} employed {{a variety of}} transmission and reception bandwidths, which {{can be understood as}} data transmission speeds. The lower the transmission/reception bandwidth, the lower the data transfer rate, resulting in a more limited and poorer image quality. Data transfer rates and live video image quality are related, but are also subject to other factors such as data compression techniques. Some early <b>videophones</b> employed very low data transmission rates with a resulting sketchy video quality.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} types of {{connections}} used with real time exchanges. Plain old telephone service (POTS) uses standard analog telephone lines. <b>Videophones</b> are used with POTS lines and include a camera, display screen, and telephone. <b>Videophones</b> use telephone lines that are available in most homes, so are easy to set up; however small display screens make them problematic for individuals with vision problems. This can be solved by using a large screen or television as a screen.|$|R

25|$|A {{videoconference}} {{system is}} generally higher cost than a <b>videophone</b> and deploys greater capabilities. A videoconference (also {{known as a}} videoteleconference) allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished {{by the use of}} a multipoint control unit (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications. A separate webpage article is devoted to videoconferencing.|$|E
25|$|Back in the Capital, {{everything}} is still quiet. Leonid Gorbovsky, whose Tariel II has delivered scientific equipment to Rainbow, pays {{a visit to}} Matvei Vyazanitsyn, the general director of the planet, then returns to his ship, when the ominous news come. Camill contacts (via <b>videophone)</b> the nearest scientist village and issues a warning that the Wave Sklyarov saw is closely followed by another one of a new type. According to him, it cannot be stopped like the ones before and therefore the Rainbow world council must begin the evacuation of the planet immediately. At this moment the Wave reaches Camill's observation tower and he dies once again.|$|E

25|$|Jack's {{old friend}} is J.J. Wickham, {{known as the}} 'Sea Ranger' due to his use of an old Russian submarine. After a lengthy {{explanation}} he takes Jack to the Second Vertex, arriving just as Wolf does. Switchblade attempts to sabotage the mission by dropping the Second pillar into the bottomless abyss beneath the Vertex before it is inlaid, dooming the world and depriving the Americans of its reward, 'Heat' (believed to be a limitless power-source). However, Jack swings across the pit at the last moment, catches the pillar, and manages to place it in the Vertex just before Switchblade drops himself and Jack into the abyss. Wickham and the Adamsons escape, with Horus diving into the abyss after Jack. Wolf leaves with the Second Pillar, leaving Alby, who was brought with them, alone at the Vertex. Zoe, Sky Monster, Lily and Wizard, on board the Halicarnassus on an airfield in Botswana, had been in phone contact with Jack to help him avoid the traps at the Vertex and see the whole thing happen on the <b>videophone.</b> The surviving team members realize they must face the placing {{of the last four}} pillars and the arrival of the Dark Sun, three months away, without Jack.|$|E
