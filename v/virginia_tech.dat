5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the 2010 college football season, the annual poll by media members who cover ACC football predicted Florida State would win the Atlantic Division and <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> would win the Coastal Division. Florida State received 78 of a possible 98 first-place votes in its division, while <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> received 62. In a vote to predict the ACC champion, <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> received 50 votes from 98 possible. Florida State received 26 votes, and all other teams received a combined 20.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> and Clemson endured {{questions}} about their coaching staffs {{in the weeks and}} months prior to the Gator Bowl. <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> head coach Frank Beamer was interviewed by North Carolina prior to the end of the regular season, and he debated whether or not to accept that school's head football coaching job. On November 27, one week before Tech's selection by the Gator Bowl, Beamer announced that he would not be departing for North Carolina or any other school. Beamer also was considered for the vacant head-coaching position with the NFL's Washington Redskins, but he also declined that position. Other <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> football coaches were targeted by teams to fill vacant head-coaching positions. <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle was interviewed for a job at Toledo, but he declined the position. <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> defensive coordinator Bud Foster was interviewed for the head-coaching job at Virginia, but he likewise declined the job.|$|E

5|$|Cincinnati {{gained a}} 7–0 {{lead in the}} first quarter, but <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> scored 10 {{unanswered}} points to take a 10–7 lead into halftime. In the second half, <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> extended its lead as its defense kept the Bearcats scoreless. A Tech field goal {{in the third quarter}} was followed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, and the game ended with <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> on top, 20–7.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff merely needing {{to run down}} the clock to secure its lead and the win. Twocomplete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping the clock and forcing a Florida State punt. Only {{a minute and a}} half had run off the clock, and <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State committed a pass interference penalty that gave <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> 15automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. After that, a Florida State holding penalty gave <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled fouryards for the touchdown, and what had been a 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11points. The drive had taken just 55seconds off the clock, and it appeared that <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> still had a chance to make it a close game. As before, <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now Florida State 27, <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> 15.|$|E
5|$|Following the loss, <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> {{won five}} {{straight}} games {{to win the}} Coastal Division of the ACC, while Boston College stumbled, losing two games before defeating the Clemson Tigers to win the Atlantic Division and representation in the Championship Game. Most pre-game {{media coverage of the}} event cast the game as an opportunity for <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> to avenge its earlier loss. In addition, the winner of the game would be awarded an automatic bid to the Bowl Championship Series 2008 Orange Bowl game in Miami, Florida on January 3, 2008. Despite Boston College's earlier win over <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech,</b> spread bettors favored <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> by five points.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance during the game, <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> running back Darren Evans was named the game's most valuable player.

Cincinnati had six players selected in the draft, while <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> had one.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, however, Cincinnati's offense managed to begin moving the ball effectively. On Cincinnati’s first {{play of the}} second half, halfback Roger Stephens broke through the <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> {{defensive}} line for 26 yards, taking the ball inside <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> territory. Cincinnati's drive would overcome two 15-yard penalties and one five-yard penalty {{en route to a}} touchdown just a few plays later. On its next possession, Cincinnati's All-American Roger Stephens again broke off another long run, this time for 19 yards, setting up another Bearcats' touchdown. <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> countered with a long drive that reached the Cincinnati 23-yard line before an errant pass was intercepted by the Bearcats in the end zone. <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> managed a defensive stop, however, and marched down the field for a touchdown to climb within six points. Cincinnati sealed its victory, however, when Bearcats' halfback Harold Johnson intercepted a <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> pass late in the fourth quarter, returning {{it all the way to}} the <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> 25-yard line. That return set up a Cincinnati touchdown and put the Bearcats up by the game's final score, 18–6.|$|E
