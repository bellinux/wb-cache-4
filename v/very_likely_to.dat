5|$|By 1999, about 5 to 10 {{percent of}} all jobs in Israel were held by Russian speakers. The Ministry of Transport {{published}} booklets and manuals in Russian. It is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> find Russian-speaking doctors at hospitals.|$|E
5|$|The band plead {{not guilty}} on the charges. A Polish {{interpreter}} explained the court proceedings to the musicians over a speakerphone {{after which they}} entered their pleas in English. Spokane County Superior Court Judge Annette Plese set their trial date for December 18, though she said that date is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be postponed.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} sex and pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control. Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended. Women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse and in any sexual position. It is possible, although not <b>very</b> <b>likely,</b> <b>to</b> become pregnant during menstruation.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ashfall {{is likely}} to have major effects on these systems. Ash will clog intake structures, cause {{abrasion}} damage to pumps and block pipes, settling ponds and open filters. High levels of turbidity are <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> interfere with disinfection treatment and doses may have to be adjusted to compensate. It is essential to monitor chlorine residuals in the distribution system.|$|E
5|$|Many riders {{were named}} as contenders, {{including}} Ivan Basso, Levi Leipheimer, Armstrong, Damiano Cunego, Carlos Sastre, Gilberto Simoni, Danilo Di Luca, Marzio Bruseghin, and Denis Menchov. Before his collarbone injury, Armstrong {{was considered an}} overall favorite, {{and it was also}} noted that three time trials, including the insertion of an unusually long time trial mid-race, might favor him. Pre-race analysis noted that Armstrong, when on his best form, would be a rider <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> gain from having such a long race against the clock included in the Giro.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stars in}} Serpens {{have been found}} to have planets. The brightest, Omega Serpentis, located between Epsilon and Mu, is an orange giant with a planet of at least 1.7 Jupiter-masses. NN Serpentis, an eclipsing post-common-envelope binary {{consisting}} of a white dwarf and a red dwarf, is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have two planets causing variations in the period of the eclipses. Although it does not have a planet, the solar analog HD 137510 has been found to have a brown dwarf companion within the brown-dwarf desert.|$|E
50|$|All {{the species}} bear yellow flowers similar to small sunflowers. The name Verbesina <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> refers <b>to</b> the {{similarity}} of the foliage {{to that of the}} (unrelated) Verbena.|$|R

5|$|The {{collision}} of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, {{giving rise to}} many impacts {{over a period of}} a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have occurred in the past. This scenario may have occurred on Earth {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.|$|E
5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm {{can be much}} slower. A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions. If the ratio of a and b is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} the quotients are <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be small integers. The probability of a given quotient q is approximately ln|u/(u−1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E
5|$|Hydrus {{contains}} only faint deep-sky objects. IC 1717 was a deep-sky object {{discovered by the}} Danish astronomer John Louis Emil Dreyer in the late 19th century. The object at the coordinate Dreyer observed is no longer there, {{and is now a}} mystery. It was <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been a faint comet. PGC 6240, known as the White Rose Galaxy, is a giant spiral galaxy surrounded by shells resembling rose petals, located around 345 million light years from the Solar System. Unusually, it has cohorts of globular clusters of three distinct ages suggesting bouts of post-starburst formation following a merger with another galaxy. The constellation also contains a spiral galaxy, NGC 1511, which lies edge on to observers on Earth and is readily viewed in amateur telescopes.|$|E

50|$|Goulburn was {{appointed}} secretary and registrar {{of the records}} of New South Wales on 30 June 1820, <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> due <b>to</b> his brother's patronage. He was sworn-in as Colonial Secretary on 1 January 1821.|$|R
5|$|The North Pacific {{right whale}} appears {{to occur in}} two {{population}}s. The population in the eastern North Pacific/Bering Sea is extremely low, numbering about 30 individuals. A larger western population of 100–200 appears to be surviving in the Sea of Okhotsk, but very {{little is known about}} this population. Thus, the two northern right whale species are the most endangered of all large whales and two of the most endangered animal species in the world. Based on current population density trends, both species are predicted to become extinct within 200 years. The Pacific species was historically found in summer from the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the Gulf of Alaska in the east, generally north of 50°N. Today, sightings are very rare and generally occur in the mouth of the Sea of Okhotsk and in the eastern Bering Sea. Although this species is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be migratory like the other two species, its movement patterns are not known.|$|E
5|$|The Leges {{was written}} between 1114 and 1118 {{by an unknown}} Norman, who is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be the author of another legal work, the Quadripartitus, {{although}} some historians, including H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, argue that the two works were by different authors. The Leges was probably part of a project including the Quadripartitus, the two works {{being part of a}} planned work in four volumes to cover not only the laws of the writer's own time, but previous laws of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs, as well as how to handle legal cases. As part of both works, the author has included the Charter of Liberties, which was King Henry's coronation charter promising not to follow the administrative and legal policies of his predecessor, King William II. About a third of the material in the Leges is also in the Quadripartitus. There is evidence that the author of the two works {{had been a member of}} the household of Gerard, who had been chancellor under Kings William I and William II before becoming Archbishop of York under Henry I. The work was likely composed at Winchester.|$|E
5|$|However, South Vietnamese {{officers}} were often reluctant to absorb heavy casualties. On several occasions, Cao's forces {{were in an}} excellent position to trap and wipe out whole battalions of Viet Cong, but he would fail to close the trap on one pretext or another and allow the enemy to escape. This behavior initially mystified Vann, who was attempting to build Cao into an aggressive commander. Unknown to Vann, Diem would reprimand or demote any officer who lost too many men, no matter how successful the operation. Diem {{was more interested in}} using the military to protect his regime than to take on the Viet Cong. His solution was to fill the ARVN with Catholic political cronies and friends like Cao, Lê Quang Tung, and Tôn Thất Đính, who had little military ability, but were <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> help stop a coup attempt. After a skirmish on a highway that resulted in a small number of South Vietnamese casualties along with several trucks destroyed, Cao was called to Saigon and reprimanded by Diem. Upon his return, Vann and his group of advisers were forced to end the joint planning sessions that had been so successful earlier, and action essentially wound down in their region. Cao used the excellent military intelligence network they had developed to find areas devoid of the Viet Cong, and planned operations only in those areas. In many other cases, operations were executed on paper only, in order to report an increasing tempo of operations that did not actually exist.|$|E
