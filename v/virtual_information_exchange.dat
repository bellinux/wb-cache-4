40|$|The factor {{time within}} {{building}} projects is on high pressure {{because of the}} increasing need for faster delivery of buildings. Within fast track, complex building projects the design process is an important key. Through case analyses offart-hack design processes {{it became obvious that}} process and people aspects score mostly low in these types of projects. Improvement in terms of collaboration and communication is needed as well as better tools and high professional skills of design team members to collaborate and communicate effectively. Solutions can be found in integral design methods with an increased level of interaction facilitated by electronic media. In this paper, design communication facilitated by project websites within fast-track, integral design processes is analyzed and modeled. The paper discusses communication aspects like information richness, behavior, and culture and it summarizes project web features. Special attention is given to electronic mediated communication of design teams to increase the interactivity of such team. A process model for integral design is presented. It consists of a chain of design team meetings linked by <b>virtual</b> <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> sessions (VIS). VIS can be used by design teams, to enhance the interactivity of the team through freguent, asynchronous exchange of design information. The paper ends with a description of the changes in management of design teams using the process model...|$|E

Whilst <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is reported as a critical benefit, the simple act of staying in touch with friends may provide stronger motivator for consumers. This exploratory study finds that a propensity to see value in virtual communities is more directly related to a respondentâ€™s enjoyment of networking than it is to their liking to share opinions. Therefore, marketers may need to tread lightly in their attempts to construct vibrant communities of advocates based on product oriented communications.

Effective control of rumor spreading is of theoretical and practical significance. This paper takes {{the first step to}} understand how the blockchain technology can help limit the spread of rumors. Specifically, we develop a new paradigm for social networks embedded with the blockchain technology, which employs decentralized contracts to motivate trust networks as well as secure <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> contract. We design a blockchain-based sequential algorithm which utilizes <b>virtual</b> <b>information</b> credits for each peer-to-peer <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> We validate the effectiveness of the blockchain-enabled social network on limiting the rumor spreading. Simulation results validate our algorithm design in avoiding rapid and intense rumor spreading, and motivate better mechanism design for trusted social networks...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project explores {{the use of}} virtual support groups by women {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} in South Africa. Through a content analysis of the online forums and eight in-depth interviews with women of various backgrounds (age, race and socio-economic status) it becomes evident that women use these <b>virtual</b> spaces for <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> sense of belonging, search for meaning and most significantly support. Various factors within the illness experience of breast cancer influence the initial use, continuation, breaks and withdrawal from of these online forums. The analysis of online forums is framed around concepts of lay consultation, gender, adaptation theory and social capital to conceptualise and make sense of these virtual interactions. The virtual groups allow women to read and write on breast cancer according to their perceptions and experiences, thereby lessening the dominant medical power to create space for their personal voices. The interactions on the forums foster a sense of empowerment, social support and social engagement critical to their wellbeing and adaptation to the condition. This study also brings attention to the lack of studies about virtual groups within the South African context which is increasingly becoming significant as more and more individuals use virtual groups as part of health lay interaction and consultation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of {{operational}} and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> on supply chain performance and the moderating role of information quality in relation to both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> The study was conducted using manufacturing companies located in the Northern region of Malaysia. Hierarchical multiple regressions were applied to test the hypotheses developed for the study. It was found that operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is significantly related to supply chain performance. The impact of strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is greater as opposed to operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> <b>Information</b> quality does not moderate the relationship between both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and supply chain performance.

40|$|Coordinationâ€“or the <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> among {{physicians}} and hospital staffâ€“is necessary for desirable patient outcomes in healthcare delivery. However, coordination {{is difficult because}} healthcare delivery processes are information intensive, complex and require interactions of hospitals with autonomous physicians working in multiple operational systems (i. e. multiple hospitals). We examine how three important variables distinctive of the healthcare operations contextâ€“use of IT for dissemination of test results (ITDR) (i. e. Electronic Health Records systems) by {{physicians and}} hospital staff, social interaction ties among them, and physician employmentâ€“influence <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and patient perceptions of their care. Drawing from the literature on process inter-dependencies and coordination, vertical integration and social exchange, we develop and test research hypotheses linking ITDR, social interaction ties and physician employment to <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship, and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship to provider-patient communication. Using a paired sample of primary survey data and secondary archival data from CMS HCAHPS for 173 hospitals in the U. S.

40|$|Title: <b>Information</b> <b>exchange</b> with {{professionals}} in dementia decision-making: views of informal caregivers Background: Worldwide, {{there are an}} estimated 24 million people with dementia. The majority lives at home and are largely dependent of informal caregivers. Informal caregivers are increasingly involved in care decisions for persons with dementia. Barriers to make such decisions include lack of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and support. This creates unnecessary stress in informal caregivers. Shared decision-making, when facilitated by professionals, can support adequate <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> enabling informal caregivers to make care decisions. Aim and research question: In order to gain insight into the role of {{professionals in}} <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> informal caregiversâ€™ views on professionals regarding <b>exchanging</b> <b>information</b> in care decisions should be examined. This insight might result in indications for adequate <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> between informal caregivers and professionals. Method: This qualitative study was conducted using the principles of the Grounded Theory approach. The study population consisted of informal caregivers of persons with dementia from the Netherlands who were part of a dementia care network. The software Atlas. ti was used. Results: Informal caregiversâ€™ views on professionals regarding <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in decision-making are depended on the nature of involvement. Professionals were considered to be either actively or passively involved. Informal caregivers were positive about <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of actively involved professionals. The <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of passively involved professionals was too often not consistent with their needs. Conclusion: The <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of professionals was too often not appropriate. Many decisions were discussed by informal caregivers with members of the care network, but these decisions were not indisputably based on shared decision-making. Decisions were mainly based on good sense and gut feeling. Recommendations: Improvement of expertise for professionals regarding dementia and support during the process of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in decision-making, to ensure informal caregivers are equal partners in decision-making...|$|R

This paper investigates the interactions between gender, social capital and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in rural Uganda. Within the framework of farmer-to-farmer models, we conceptualise the informal information diffusion process to comprise social capital accumulation and <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> We assume that each agent participates in <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> with a fixed (predetermined) level of social capital and examine how endowments of social capital influence <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> paying close attention to gender differences.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about conceptualizing {{relationship}} alignment in small firm relationships from an <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> perspective. The thesis has a theoretical focus {{but is also}} informed by three case studies. The thesis is based on five papers dealing with <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> with different focus: inter-organizational <b>information</b> systems, <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> patterns, social <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> coordination of <b>information,</b> concepts for relationship alignment. The context in which <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is examined is small firm relationships. While there are research of information technology in such context on strategic issues of IT alignment, {{there is still a}} great need to find out how the small firm relationship can be aligned from the perspective of â€˜working together' with an information focus rather than technology focus. The thesis examine and criticize three sets of theoretical bodies; Social exchange theory, relational theory, and information systems theory in order to understand how relationship alignment may be articulated in a differentiated style. The main conclusion drawn from this work is that relationship alignment between small firms could be expressed by a relationship alignment conceptualization that consists of three different aspects of <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> The three aspects of the concept are: presence which is the social dimension of <b>exchanging</b> <b>information,</b> formality which has a transaction focus, and mediation, an information technology concept for <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> GodkÃ¤nd; 2006; 20070912 (dan_h...|$|R
