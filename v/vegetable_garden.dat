5|$|Between 1872 and 1880, Giovanni and Antonio Rossi, cousins born in Italy, began {{operating}} a <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden</b> on the property.

His son, Joe Vallerga, later built a grocery store on part of the site, and the Vallerga family continued to own the property until the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Obama's {{predecessors}} Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush {{supported the}} organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food, and Obama extended their efforts toward healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden</b> since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady, and installing bee hives, on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{regularly}} {{supplied the}} islandswith food from Britain, and visiting vessels brought bags of earth {{that allowed the}} development of a <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden.</b> Smith supported the islands with several gunvessels, including the converted hoys , , and , the fireship , and the Musquito-class floating battery , which he had had purpose-built for the defence of the islands.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of household accounts referring to a gardener and the purchase of some seeds. Philip Moreton, who ran the estate for his older brother Edward in the mid-17th century, left {{a considerable amount of}} information on the layout and planting of the area of garden within the moat, {{to the west of the}} house. He writes of a herb garden, <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden,</b> and a nursery for maturing fruit trees until they were ready to be transferred to the orchard at the south and east of the house, probably where the orchard is today.|$|E
5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden</b> clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, some farmers {{cultivated}} the first <b>vegetable</b> <b>gardens,</b> but growing <b>vegetables</b> {{did not become}} common until the early 19th century, when the Napoleonic Wars resulted in the merchant ships staying away. Resident Danes, who brought the tradition of <b>vegetable</b> <b>gardens</b> with them, were usually the first to start growing <b>vegetables.</b> Popular early <b>garden</b> <b>vegetables</b> included hardy varieties of cabbage, turnip, rutabaga, and potato. They were generally prepared in Iceland as boiled accompaniments to meats and fish, and sometimes mashed with butter.|$|R

5|$|The next lock is Conegar Lock, {{which was}} also called Stoke Conegar or Coneygear Lock. Just above it are some hatches which {{supplied}} water to the adjacent water meadows. They were built of dressed stone, and are the best-preserved of the original hatches. There is no modern sluice at Conegar Lock, and the change in level has resulted in fast-flowing rapids which have cut back the channel above the lock. A little further south at Fish House Bay, the navigation crossed the Barton River diagonally, as the mill stream made its {{way back to the}} main river. A footbridge on the eastern bank carried the towpath over the Barton River, but the navigation below this point is dry, with its line occupied by a <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1792 {{over the}} 25 {{days of the}} first {{landfall}} in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden.</b> Its purpose was {{as a source of}} food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels. This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until recently, was last sighted by Lady Jane Franklin in the 1840s. Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman William Bligh's expedition, presumably planted by Bligh's gardener David Nelson. Delahaye's journal reports that he planted celery, chervil, chicory, cabbages, grey romaine lettuce, different kinds of turnip, white onion, radishes, sorrel, peas, black salsify and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow. Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people, referred to today as the Lyluequonny, that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating. Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees planted by Bligh’s expedition in 1792.|$|E
