50|$|In 1998, US West Wireless (later Qwest Wireless) was {{launched}} as a standalone brand {{with its own}} network based in the then-US West 14-state region. Qwest Wireless maintained its own network elements, device inventory, billing, and service—offering combined billing and eventually, discounts for customers who purchased other, qualifying Qwest services. At its largest, Qwest Wireless had roughly one million customers, but {{due to a lack}} of network availability outside the 14-state Qwest region, the service suffered from slow growth. This lack of on-network coverage was only partially offset by Qwest Wireless' advanced network features, most notably One Number Service (ONS). ONS allowed customers to receive calls to their home phone number on the wireless. If the calls were not answered, the calls then rang normally on the home phone. Also available was Voice Messaging Link (VML), allowing the wireless and wireline phones to share a single <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Before the BBS {{era of the}} 1980s phone {{phreaking}} {{was more}} of a solitary venture as it was difficult for phreaks to connect with one another. In addition to communicating over BBSs phone phreaks discovered <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>boxes</b> and party lines as ways to network and keep in touch over the telephone. It was rare for a phone phreak to legally purchase access to <b>voice</b> <b>mail.</b> Instead, they would usually appropriate unused boxes that were part of business or cellular phone systems. Once a vulnerable mailbox system was discovered, word would spread around the phreak community, and scores of them would take residence on the system. They would use the system as a [...] "home base" [...] for communication with one another until the rightful owners would discover the intrusion and wipe them off. Voice mailboxes also provided a safe phone number for phreaks to give out to one another as home phone numbers would allow the phreak's identity (and home address) to be discovered. This was especially important given that phone phreaks were breaking the law.|$|R

This study examined the opinions of 357 Indiana chief executive officers regarding <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> systems [...] based on a random sample of the 4, 697 members of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce as of November 18, 1992. A 100 percent response rate was achieved. The CEOs generally did not like calling into systems. The study concluded that 20 percent of Indiana businesses have <b>voice</b> <b>mail.</b> The major advantage [...] as cited by CEOs [...] to calling into systems was that they can leave detailed messages at anytime. The major disadvantage was that <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> is cold and impersonal [...] CEOs want to speak to a real person. The CEOs who have <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> gave major advantages and disadvantages of their internal systems as well as a rating.

40|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>mail</b> is a {{computer-aided}} {{telephone system}} which {{is capable of}} storing and forwarding spoken messages. The <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> market has been and is still focused on larger companies since they comprise a sizable amount of the installed base of voice processing systems (Radisich, 1994). Consequently, all <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> research has been centered on the large company and concentrates on advantages or disadvantages found in these substantial companies. This study focused on the implementation and diffusion of a relatively new communication technology and its consequences in an unresearched arena [...] the small company. Also a comparatively new methodology {{in the field of}} communications research, grounded theory, was used to explore the impact of a new technology, thus possibly advancing the credibility of this research methodology. The results of this pilot study on <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> in a small company found diffusion to be extremely successful, {{even to the point of}} surprising some of the subjects with their total acceptance of the technology. The study results indicated that the small company can benefit from <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> usage in similar ways to the large company, especially if the company has travelers or off-site locations. The results implied that there are some ways that <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> can assist in the small company where it has not previously had a reported effect in the large company [...] -as a negotiating, organizing, and delegating tool. The results of the study could provide insights for other small companies concerned with successful usage of the <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> technology in similar environments. Several concepts on novel uses of <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> surfaced as a result of this study. These concepts could provide hypothesis for empirical testing to further <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> investigation. The study concluded that <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> is a communication technology that is an accepted and beneficial tool which offered several major advantages that the subject small company was able to successfully utilize.

Descriptors: <b>Voice</b> <b>Mail</b> / <b>Voice</b> Messaging / PhoneMail Faculty <b>Voice</b> <b>Mail</b> / Faculty Office Hours and <b>Voice</b> <b>Mail</b> / <b>Voice</b> <b>Mail</b> Faculty Office Hours the writer addressed the problem of limited faculty office hours available for student help. Based on interviews with several faculty members and students, the writer determined that students {{found it difficult to}} meet with the faculty because of either limited faculty office hours or time conflicts. The writer used a project planning model as the means of reaching a solution to the problem. The goal of the project was to provide an alternative method of faculty office hours by using a <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> procedure. The writer used the college 2 ̆ 7 s voice messaging technology to develop a <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> procedure that allowed students to send messages to the faculty. The faculty could call <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> at any time to listen to and respond to student questions. The students could periodically check for answers to their questions and retrieve them. The system was defined by a systems definition team and implemented by the <b>voice</b> <b>Mail</b> Systems Administrator. The systems definition team completely tested the new <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> procedure and corrected any errors encountered. A training guide was developed and a faculty test group was trained on the procedure. The system was operational during a four week period to ascertain its success or failure. On completion of the test period, the faculty and the students were provided with survey forms to record their evaluation and comments. Based on the analysis of the faculty and student surveys, the Director of Information Services recommended that the new procedure be made available to the entire faculty...|$|R

50|$|Unified {{communications}} {{is sometimes}} confused with unified messaging, {{but it is}} distinct. Unified communications refers to both real-time and non-real-time delivery of communications based on the preferred method and location of the recipient; unified messaging culls messages from several sources (such as e-mail, <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> and faxes), but holds those messages only for retrieval at a later time. Unified communications allows for an individual to check and retrieve an e-mail or <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> from any communication device at any time.
