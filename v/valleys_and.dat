40|$|We {{investigate}} charge, <b>valley,</b> <b>and</b> spin transports in normal/ferromagnetic/normal silicene junc- tion. We {{show that}} the charge, <b>valley,</b> <b>and</b> spin conductances in this junction oscillate with {{the length of the}} ferromagnetic silicene. It is also found that the current through this junction is <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> spin polarized due to the coupling between <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> spin degrees of freedom, <b>and</b> the <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> spin polarizations can be tuned by local application of a gate voltage. In particular, we find fully <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> spin polarized current by applying the electric field. We also obtain the condition for observing the fully <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> spin polarized current. Comment: 4 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

5|$|Several ice ages {{shaped the}} land through glacial erosion, {{creating}} u-shaped <b>valleys</b> <b>and</b> depositing boulder clays, {{especially on the}} western seaboard. The last major incursion of ice peaked about 18,000 years ago, leaving other remnant features such at the granite tors on the Cairngorm mountain plateaux.|$|E
5|$|The {{geological}} features {{near the}} headwaters of Catawissa Creek primarily include anthracite and ridges of sandstone. The valleys {{in this part of}} the watershed are narrow and steep.

5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight <b>valleys</b> <b>and</b> plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{a quarter}} of the Welsh {{population}} were born outside Wales, mainly in England; about 3% were born outside the UK. The proportion born in Wales varies across the country, with the highest percentages in the south Wales <b>valleys</b> <b>and</b> the lowest in mid Wales and parts of the north-east. In both Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil, 92% were Welsh-born, compared to only 51% and 56% in the border counties of Flintshire and Powys. Just over 1.75 million Americans report themselves to have Welsh ancestry, as did 440,965 Canadians in Canada's 2006 census.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, {{where she}} {{is also known as}} Beira, Queen of Winter, she is {{credited}} with making numerous mountains and large hills, which are said to have been formed when she was striding across the land and accidentally dropped rocks from her creel or wicker basket.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the habitat requirements– such as humidity, temperature, soil {{composition}} and water content– of B.nothofagi. However, as the species seems to only occur together with N.fusca, it should largely conform to their demands.

The species {{is more likely to be}} found inland than in the coastal regions.|$|E
