50|$|Taiwan {{is one of}} {{the pacific}} islands located on the Pacific <b>Volcano</b> <b>Zone.</b> In its history, the island had {{frequent}} geothermal and volcano activities. Geothermal activity causes Taiwan’s subterranean strata to jostle one another under conditions of extreme high pressure and heat. Many famous gem mines were born in this way. For example, Taiwan’s Hualien county (花蓮) produces high quality and quantity marble (大理石) and opal (貓眼石).|$|E

The lavas ofVNH are typical andesites of active continental margin, belonging to calcoalcaline series.

40|$|Romania {{is one of}} the European {{countries}} with the most vigorous natural seepage of methane, uprising from pressurised natural gas and petroleum reservoirs through deep faults. The largest seepage zone is represented by large mud volcanoes, with CH 4 > 80 % v/v, occurring on the Berca-Arbanasi hydrocarbon-bearing faulted anticline, in the Carpathian Foredeep. Smaller mud volcanoes have been identified {{in other areas of the}} Carpathian Foredeep, in the Transylvanian Depression and on the Moldavian Platform. New surveys carried out in Transylvania allowed us to discover the richest N 2 mud <b>volcano</b> <b>zone</b> in the world (N 2 > 90 % v/v), with a remarkably high He content and a helium isotopic signature which highlights a contribution of mantle-derived source. The large mud volcanoes are generally quiescent, with rare explosive episodes and provide a methane flux in the order of 102 - 103 t km− 2 y− 1. Independently from mud volcanism, a remarkable dry macroseepage, however, has been found, with a degassing rate up to three orders of magnitude higher than that of mud volcanoes (i. e. 103 - 105 t km− 2 y− 1). The total gas flux from all investigated macroseepage zones in Romania is estimated in the range of 1500 - 2500 t y− 1. The emission from microseepage, pervasively occurring throughout the hydrocarbon-prone basins, has yet to be assessed and added to the total gas output to the atmosphere...|$|E

Pacaya Volcano is {{an active}} {{composite}} volcano located in southern Guatemala, about 30 km from the nation's capital, Guatemala City. This volcano has variable eruptive styles ranging from non-explosive to moderately explosive. Volcanic rocks from Pacaya are mostly basaltic to basaltic andesite and tend to be porphyritic, containing approximately 25 - 35 % crystals, dominantly plagioclase. Previous data from olivine-hosted melt inclusions in Pacaya's tephras suggest relatively low magmatic water contents for a subduction <b>zone</b> <b>volcano,</b> particularly compared to neighboring composite volcanoes along the Central American Volcanic Arc. The goal {{of this research was}} to use plagioclase phenocrysts in basaltic andesite lavas from Pacaya as a secondary method to verify the unusually low magmatic water contents reported previously.

Phenocrysts were analyzed using the electron microprobe at Northern Illinois University. Plagioclase crystallization temperatures were obtained using a geothermometer.
