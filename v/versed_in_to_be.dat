40|$|We provide formal {{semantics}} {{for a large}} {{subset of}} the Lua programming language, in its version 5. 2. We validate our model by mechanizing it and testing it against the test suite of the reference interpreter of Lua, confirming that our model accurately represents the language. In addition, we set us an ambitious goal: to target both a PL semanticist [...] -not necessarily <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> Lua [...] -, and a Lua developer [...] -not necessarily <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> semantic frameworks. <b>To</b> the former, we present the peculiarities of the language, and how we model them in a traditional small-step operational semantics, embedded within Felleisen-Hieb's reduction semantics with evaluation contexts. The mechanization is, naturally, performed in PLT Redex, the de facto tool for mechanizing reduction semantics. To the reader unfamiliar with such concepts, we provide, to our best possible within the space limitations, a gentle introduction of the model. It is our hope that developers of the different Lua implementations and dialects understand the model and consider it both for testing their work and for experimenting with new language features...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Multichannel signal {{processing}} using digital {{signal processing}} techniques has received increased attention due <b>to</b> its importance <b>in</b> different information technology applications such as multimedia technology and telecommunications. Our objective <b>in</b> this paper <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide a review for the reader who may be well <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> DSP, and <b>to</b> introduce some existing fuzzy (or fuzzy related) filtering techniques for multichannel (and color in particular) images, for the reader who is just beginning in this field of artificial intelligence. We present a general formulation based on fuzzy concepts, which allows the use of adaptive weights in the filtering structure, and we discuss different filter designs. Some examples illustrate the strong potential of fuzzy nonlinear filters for multichannel signal applications, such as color image processing. c○ 2003 Yang’s Scientific Research Institute, LLC.

Once, when Sun Quan was away on a campaign, they {{took advantage of the}} situation to set their plans into motion. At the time, the various chiefs of the counties <b>in</b> Danyang <b>were</b> scheduled <b>to</b> meet Sun Yi in the commandery capital. Before the meeting, Sun Yi asked his wife, Lady Xu (徐氏), who <b>was</b> <b>versed</b> <b>in</b> divination, <b>to</b> predict the events of the meeting. Lady Xu predicted ill luck and advised her husband to postpone the meeting, but Sun Yi wanted to settle the meeting quickly because the Chiefs had been waiting for some time since they arrived, so he hosted a banquet for them. Sun Yi often carried a sword with him when he travelled around, but he became tipsy after the feast so he was unarmed when he saw the guests off. Just then, Bian Hong attacked him from behind. The scene was thrown into disarray and no one came to Sun Yi's rescue so Sun died at the hands of Bian Hong. Bian Hong escaped to the hills after murdering Sun Yi, but was later killed by Gai Lan and Dai Yuan.|$|R
