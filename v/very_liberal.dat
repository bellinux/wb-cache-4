5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the Dade County vote, Fort Lauderdale, Gainesville, and Palm Beach, Florida, and Austin, Texas, all {{rejected}} ordinances to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development overturned its own rules they had set {{earlier in the year}} to allow unmarried and same-sex couples federally financed housing. Newsweek reported that a county government employee who had worked in her position for 15years had been fired. An openly gay aide to future U.S. senator Paula Hawkins had also been dismissed. Despite the success of the Dade County campaign, activists worked quietly in liberal towns of Aspen, Colorado, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, Iowa City, Iowa, Wichita, Kansas, and the <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> Eugene, Oregon to pass gay rights ordinances.|$|E
5|$|Seattle's {{political}} culture is <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> and progressive for the United States, with over 80% {{of the population}} voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a socialist councilor, Kshama Sawant. For {{the first time in}} United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991. The majority of the current city council is female.|$|E
5|$|The War Department envisaged {{that the}} Manhattan Project would be {{superseded}} by a statutory authority. Legislation {{to create it}} was drafted by two War Department lawyers, Kenneth C. Royall and William L. Marbury. Their draft bill ran into strong opposition, particularly from the influential Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control. Section 10 assigned the patent for any invention related to atomic energy to the commission.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{the fourth}} {{consecutive}} Liberal loss at the 2014 election, Chapman suffered a 1.5-point two-party swing but still {{finished with a}} 68.7 percent two-party vote in her <b>very</b> safe <b>Liberal</b> seat of Bragg.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{study done}} by Mark D. Watts et al. found that <b>very</b> little <b>liberal</b> bias {{occurred}} during {{elections in the}} 80s and 90s, but that public perceptions of bias are associated with media discussion {{of the issue of}} news bias.|$|R

5|$|The Chancery came to {{prominence}} after {{the decline of}} the Exchequer, dealing with the law of equity, something more fluid and adaptable than the common law. The early Court of Chancery dealt with verbal contracts, matters of land law and matters of trusts, and had a <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> view when setting aside complaints; poverty, for example, was an acceptable reason to cancel a contract or obligation. Complaints were normally brought via a bill or petition, which had to show that the common law did not provide a remedy for the problem. The Chancery writs were in French, and later English, rather than the Latin used for common law bills. In the reign of Edward III, the Court found a fixed home at Westminster Hall, where it sat almost continually until its dissolution. Before this, justice was difficult to dispose because the Lord Chancellor had to travel with the King wherever he went.|$|E
5|$|The May-Johnson bill soon {{ran into}} difficulties. Although the Interim Committee was {{discharged}} in November, it met {{one more time}} in December to discuss amendments to the May-Johnson bill. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative Senate bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control of atomic energy. In 1946, several major revisions were made to the McMahon bill in order to appease the more conservative elements in the Senate. The resulting bill passed both the Senate and the House without major modifications. On August 1, 1946, Truman signed the McMahon bill into law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.|$|E
25|$|President Carter's {{proposed}} {{program for}} the reform of the Electoral College was <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> for a modern president during this time, and in {{some aspects of the}} package, it went beyond original expectations.|$|E
5000|$|There are <b>very</b> few <b>liberal</b> {{political}} parties in Algeria. Ahd 54 and the Algerian Natural Law Party may be considered liberal. The main Berber party, the Rally for Culture and Democracy (Rassemblement pour la Culture et la Démocratie) could be considered to embrace some liberal values.|$|R

50|$|He {{was elected}} to {{parliament}} in the 1953 election as a Progressive Conservative for the riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. In his maiden speech to Parliament in November he accused the <b>very</b> conservative <b>Liberal</b> government led by Louis St. Laurent of being socialists. His criticisms {{were based on the}} government being corporatistic and taking an interest in private business activities.|$|R

25|$|All {{of these}} Representatives won over 75% of their districts' {{respective}} votes in both 2004 and 2006. National Journal's neutral rating system placed {{all of their}} voting records in 2005 and 2006 somewhere between <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> and extremely liberal.|$|E
25|$|Only {{during the}} Early Modern Age, lower-class males started {{to use at}} least one surname; married lower-class women usually took up their spouse's surname, since they rarely ever used one beforehand. After the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, Portuguese {{authorities}} realized the benefits of enforcing the use and registry of surnames. Henceforth, they became mandatory, although the rules for their use were <b>very</b> <b>liberal.</b>|$|E

50|$|Ignazio Marino (campaign website) — Marino, {{well-known}} {{surgeon and}} senator, {{stepped into the}} leadership race on 4 July. He {{was supported by the}} <b>very</b> socially <b>liberal</b> wing of the party regarding ethical issues, disgruntled Dalemiani (as Marino himself is) and some Veltroniani led by Goffredo Bettini, a senator who was the closest aide to Veltroni during his leadership and who was not interested in supporting Franceschini.|$|R
50|$|It was {{originally}} {{expected to be}} a <b>very</b> safe <b>Liberal</b> seat; northern Sydney has been the power base for the Liberals and their predecessors for over a century. However, it was held by independents from 1981 to 1991—most notably Ted Mack from 1981 to 1988. The Liberals did not take the seat until 1991, but have held it with virtually no difficulty since then.|$|R
25|$|The central {{government}} funds were deemed insufficient by the Hainan authorities {{for the construction}} of the island's other infrastructures (water works, power stations, telecommunications, etc.) and had taken a <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> interpretation of the economic and trade regulations for Hainan and thirteen coastal cities; the regulations did not mention on prohibiting the re-selling of second-hand goods. Some of the proceeds, from unsold units, were later retrieved by the {{central government}} to re-finance the special district.|$|E
25|$|As in Louisiana, the Spanish {{government}} {{took advantage of}} the system already in place, adapting it to its own purposes. Panton, Leslie & Company, under <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> terms from the Spanish point of view, held their monopoly as long as the Spanish controlled Florida; their influence with the Indians was essential to Spanish policy in its relations with the various tribes, and an important means of maintaining Spanish interests in the region before the surrender of the whole country to the United States.|$|E
25|$|The Davis {{campaign}} {{tried to}} run against the recall Yes/No vote instead of against the candidates that were trying to replace him. Davis tried to depict the recall as a $66 million waste of money that could allow a candidate with {{a very small percentage}} of the vote to become Governor—potentially someone who was <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> or conservative. There are no primaries in a recall election. Davis {{tried to run}} “outside the recall circus” and to make himself appear gubernatorial and hard at work for California, and who had made improvements to education and healthcare. Early August polls showed that over 50% supported the recall.|$|E
50|$|Rosenblatt was <b>very</b> {{active in}} <b>liberal</b> politics. He {{worked in the}} McCarthy primary campaigns for {{president}} in New Hampshire and California in 1968 and {{in a series of}} Vietnam protest activities in Washington.|$|R

50|$|First {{created for}} the 1950 state election, the {{district}} was based in the south-western suburbs of Brisbane, covering areas that previously belonged to the abolished district of Oxley. At first taking in a wide sweep of then-outer suburban areas such as Sunnybank, Runcorn and Kuraby, {{it came to be}} based in the Chelmer peninsula and the Centenary Suburbs from the 1960 election onwards, and was a <b>very</b> safe <b>Liberal</b> seat for its entire existence.|$|R
25|$|In 1807, Napoleon I of France {{temporarily}} recreated a Polish {{state as}} the satellite Duchy of Warsaw, after a successful Greater Poland Uprising of 1806 against Prussian rule. But, after the failed Napoleonic Wars, Poland was again {{split between the}} victorious powers at the Congress of Vienna of 1815. The eastern part was ruled by the Russian tsar as Congress Poland, which had a <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> constitution. However, over time the Russian monarch reduced Polish freedoms, and Russia annexed the country in virtually all but name. Meanwhile, the Prussian controlled territory of Poland came under increased Germanization. Thus, in the 19th century, only Austrian-ruled Galicia, and particularly the Free City of Kraków, allowed free Polish culture to flourish.|$|E
25|$|Rashid Rida popularized {{the term}} 'Salafī' to {{describe}} a particular movement (i.e., Islamic modernism) that he spearheaded. That movement sought to reject the ossification of the madhhabs, and rethink through the standard issues of fiqh and modernity, at times in <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> ways. A young scholar {{by the name of}} Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani read an article by Rida, and then took this term and used it {{to describe a}}nother, completely different movement. Ironically, the movement that Rida spearheaded eventually became Modernist Islam and dropped the 'Salafī' label, and the legal methodology that al-Albānī championed – with a very minimal overlap with Rida's vision of Islam – retained the appellation Salafī'. Eventually, al-Albānī's label was adopted by the Najdī daʿwah as well, until it spread in all trends of the movement. Otherwise, before this century, the term 'Salafī' was not used as a common label and proper noun. Therefore, the term 'Salafī' has attached itself to an age-old school of theology, the Atharī school.|$|E
25|$|The German Students Association exerted great influence, {{which was}} at first {{patriotic}} and later political. After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of Liberalism and the movement in favor of German national unity. The historians Friedrich Christoph Schlosser and Georg Gottfried Gervinus were the guides of the nation in political history. The modern scientific schools of medicine and natural science, particularly astronomy, were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school. The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American liberal arts colleges into research universities, in particular for the then-newly established Johns Hopkins University. Heidelberg's professors were important supporters of the Vormärz revolution {{and many of them}} were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. During the late 19th century, the university housed a <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and a circle of colleagues around them.|$|E
50|$|The Conservatives, led by Arthur Meighen, {{adopted the}} {{name in the}} hope of making {{permanent}} the war-time Unionist coalition of Conservatives and pro-conscription Liberals (known as Liberal-Unionists). <b>Very</b> few <b>Liberals</b> stayed with the party, and some Conservatives balked at the move. MP John Hampden Burnham quit the government caucus to sit as an Independent Conservative and then resigned from the House of Commons in an attempt to win a by-election on the issue.|$|R
50|$|Bass Hill {{was lost}} by the Labor Party {{for the only}} {{time in the history of}} the district. In a <b>very</b> close result, <b>Liberal</b> Party {{candidate}} Michael Owen won the contest by 103 votes after the distribution of preferences.|$|R
50|$|Perrottet won {{preselection}} in November 2010 {{with the}} backing of right wing powerbroker David Clarke. Clarke battled against Alex Hawke, Federal Member for Mitchell, to gain control of preselections. He was elected to the <b>very</b> safe <b>Liberal</b> seat with a swing of 12.2 per cent and won the seat with 80.8 per cent of the vote on a two party preferred basis following the resignation of previous Liberal MP Michael Richardson. His main opponent was Ryan Tracey, representing Labor.|$|R
25|$|The {{conclave}} itself {{assembled in}} the Sistine Chapel on 31 August. From {{the beginning of the}} conclave, it was clear that there were only three possible winners. Domenico Serafini, a Benedictine and assessor at the Holy Office, won the support of the Curia to continue Pius X's anti-modernist campaign as his chief priority. However, many other cardinals, such as Carlo Ferrari and Desiré Merciér, believed that a Pope with a different focus was needed and supported the Archbishop of Pisa Pietro Maffi, considered <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> but tainted by being close to the House of Savoy. Giacomo della Chiesa, Archbishop of Bologna, stood intermediate between Maffi and Serafini, but in the early ballots he was equal with Maffi and seemed to be winning some support from conservative factions. Della Chiesa drew ahead by five votes after the fourth ballot, and once it became clear Maffi had no hope whatsoever of gaining two-thirds of the votes, Serafini became Della Chiesa's opponent. By 3 September 1914, on the tenth ballot, all of Maffi's supporters had switched to Della Chiesa, who was elected pope. He took the name Benedict XV.|$|E

[...] As of 2007, Josephine County Sheriff volunteers man a sub station in Cave Junction, and the Sheriff's Office has plans to begin a pilot program in the City Hall building, staffed by volunteers, that will include three temporary holding cells {{and the ability to}} take incident reports.|$|E
500|$|On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon {{introduced}} an alternative bill on atomic energy, {{drafted by the}} Senate Military affairs Committee, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon Bill. [...] This was initially a <b>very</b> <b>liberal</b> bill regarding the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson Bill also provided for civilian control. The McMahon Bill attempted to address the controversial aspects of the May-Johnson Bill. The number of commissioners was reduced to five, and they would serve full-time. No exemption was provided for serving military officers. An amendment specified that they have staggered terms of five years.|$|E
50|$|Weber {{was afraid}} of too much bureaucracy. In 1912, he heard that {{officials}} of the government were working together with officials of large corporate companies. Weber {{wanted to create a}} large, left-wing, political party combining social democrats and left-wing liberals to counter the bureaucratic threat. The social democrats were willing to talk with Weber, as they were eager to lose their isolation in the German society and politics. The plan failed because <b>very</b> few <b>liberals</b> prepared to help Weber.|$|R
50|$|Derby was two member {{seat and}} <b>very</b> safely <b>Liberal.</b> Since the 1832 general {{election}} {{there had been}} only two occasions when the Conservatives had taken {{one of the two}} seats for the borough. Harcourt had been unopposed at his 1880 by-election and held a substantial majority over the sole Conservative candidate who had stood at the general election of 1885. Against this electoral background it is unsurprising that the Tories chose not to stand a candidate against Harcourt this time.|$|R
40|$|Background. Gays, {{lesbians and}} bisexuals (i. e. non-heterosexuals) {{have been found}} to be at much greater risk for many {{psychiatric}} symptoms and disorders, including depression. This may be due in part to prejudice and discrimination experienced by non-heterosexuals, but studies controlling for minority stress, or performed in <b>very</b> socially <b>liberal</b> countries, suggest that other mechanisms must also play a role. Here we test the viability of common cause (shared genetic or environmental etiology) explanations of elevated depression rates in non-heterosexuals...|$|R
