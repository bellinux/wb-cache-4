50|$|Much to {{the dismay}} of some pharmacologists, the {{synthesis}} and isolation of pure <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> proved to be a difficult challenge for chemists; <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> was suspected to be a nearly ideal anesthetic as its structure was the combination of an alkene and an <b>ether.</b> In practice, <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> proved to have favorable properties that allowed its brief usage as an anesthetic; on the other hand, it left many unimpressed.

Here we show that overaccumulation of LCBs in yeast results in their conversion to a hitherto undescribed LCB derivative, an LCB <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether.</b> The LCB <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> is predominantly formed from phytosphingosine (PHS) as revealed by conversion of odd chain length tracers C 17 -dihydrosphingosine and C 17 - PHS into the corresponding LCB <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> derivative. PHS <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> formation depends on ongoing acetyl-CoA synthesis, and its levels are elevated when the LCB degradative pathway is blocked by deletion of the major LCB kinase, LCB 4, or the LCB phosphate lyase, DPL 1.

50|$|To {{modulate}} the reactivity between monomer {{and growing}} polymeric chain is another approach to enhance sequence control.

5000|$|In ionic curing process, an ionic photoinitiator {{is used to}} {{activate}} the functional group of the oligomers {{that are going to}} participate in cross-linking. Typically photopolymerization is a very selective process and it is crucial that the polymerization takes place only where it is desired to do so. In order to satisfy this liquid neat oligomer can be doped with either anionic or cationic photoinitiators that will initiate polymerization only when radiated with light. Monomers, or functional groups, employed in cationic photopolymerization include: styrenic compounds, <b>vinyl</b> <b>ethers,</b> N-vinyl carbazoles, lactones, lactams, cyclic ethers, cyclic acetals, and cyclic siloxanes. The majority of ionic photoinitiators fall under the cationic class, anionic photoinitiators are considerably less investigated. [...] There are several classes of cationic initiators including: Onium salts, organometallic compounds and pyridinium salts. [...] As mentioned earlier, one of the drawbacks of the photoinitiators used for photopolymerization is that they tend to absorb in the short UV region. [...] Photosensitizers, or chromophores, that absorb in a much longer wavelength region can be employed to excite the photoinitiators through an energy transfer. [...] Other modifications to these types of systems are free radical assisted cationic polymerization. In this case, a free radical is formed from another specie in solution that reacts with the photoinitiator in order to start polymerization. Although there are a diverse group of compounds activated by cationic photoinitiators, the compounds that find most industrial uses contain epoxides, oxetanes, and <b>vinyl</b> <b>ethers.</b> One of the advantages to using cationic photopolymerization is that once the polymerization has begun it is no longer sensitive to oxygen and does not require an inert atmosphere to perform well.|$|E
