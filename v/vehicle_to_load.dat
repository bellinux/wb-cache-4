40|$|Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) harness {{advanced}} {{communications and}} computation technologies {{in order to}} make transportation systems more efficient. This work is concerned with the application of ITS to commercial vehicle operations and freight mobility; it identifies and·investigates potential uses. of real-time information for the efficient management of carrier operations. In truckload and less-than-truckload operations, carriers typically know only a portion of the loads that must be moved more than a few hours before the moves must take place. Therefore, the assignment of an available driver to a load takes place in real-time or shortly after the request is received. The load acceptance decision made by a carrier must also be executed in real-time, and may {{have a significant impact on}} the carrier's ability to accept other loads requested in the near future. In this context, <b>vehicle</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> assignments as well as the sequence in which loads are to be served may be revisited as demands unfold and traffic network conditions change. Because of the speed with which decisions must be made, the number of possible choices and the fact that the system is changing dynamically and often, unpredictably, locall...|$|E
40|$|Master of Science in Engineering - EngineeringThe most {{significant}} benefit of co-disposal of tailings {{based on the}} “Paste and Thickened Tailings Disposal” concept is the improved ability to “design” {{the properties of the}} co-disposed tailings material to suit the surrounding environment. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} gain a better understanding of the relationship between the key slurry material characteristics and the flow behaviour of co-disposed tailings upon deposition, for the case of montmorillonite clay-based kimberlite tailings. A fundamental understanding of this relationship will enable the successful manipulation and exploitation of the co-disposed tailings rheology for optimal tailings disposal and the minimisation of associated financial, environmental and social risks. The key material characteristics selected for investigation were the vehicle solids concentration, suspension pH and <b>vehicle</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> ratio. The yield stress was selected as the key rheological property representing both the vehicle component rheology and co-disposed tailings rheology. Two yield stress measurement techniques were used, namely (1) direct yield stress measurement with the vane method and (2) indirect yield stress measurement with the slump test method. The correlation between these two methods was investigated as a secondary objective of this study. It was concluded that the suspension pH strongly influences the degree of microscopic particle interaction of the vehicle component and that manipulation of the suspension pH could move the material between interactive and noninteractive states. It was further concluded that increasing load mass percentage leads to a significant increase in the co-disposed material yield stress. It is believed that the load component mainly affects the co-disposed material yield stress through its contribution to the total solids concentration, which in turn results in an exponential increase in the material yield stress. The findings of this study showed remarkable flexibility in the manipulation of the various input parameters to produce the same yield stress value. It is therefore now possible to maintain a constant yield stress value as required by the environmental depositional requirements through various combinations of the input parameters and so keep the integrity of the deposition site intact. The correlation obtained in this study between the vane and slump test yield stress measurement techniques was fairly poor. The slump test only provided an accurate prediction of the yield stress when the material was in a highly interactive state. It is recommended that future research focuses on the thixotropic nature of the vehicle component as a function of suspension pH, the accuracy of the correlation between the vane and slump measured yield stress and the effect of the load on the bulk rheology of the co-disposed material...|$|E

40|$|The general {{unloading}} phase of amphibious operations is examined with {{particular emphasis on}} the queueing problems that arise. A model is structured and a computer simulation is provided. Variables considered are the number of transfer vehicles and their speed and payload, the number and capacity of loading and unloading points, and the ship-to-shore distance. Basic relationships between the variables are examined and an approximating formula is developed for computing the _time required to unload a given tonnage of cargo. Applications in operational planning, system modification, and total system design are outlined. The impact on system performance of various assumed distributions of travel time and loading time is discussed. For systems employing mixed fleets of transfer vehicles, some basic decision rules are developed as <b>to</b> which <b>vehicles</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> or unload first.

40|$|A {{rule-based}} {{procedure for}} determining real-time signals timings at a signalized intersection is described. It incorporates {{the effects of}} the traffic interference caused by on-line loading/ unloading of transit vehicles at the intersection. This procedure generates a number of short-term alternative real-time phase sequences for various levels of transit priority, based on a number of decision rules. It then evaluates these signal sequences and selects the one with the least overall cost to all traffic. The procedure is illustrated in terms of a simulated application to a critical intersection in Toronto's Queen Street corridor using real data. The preliminary simulation tests indicate the potential reduction in total compared to fixed-time operation, which results largely from selectively ushering transit <b>vehicles</b> <b>to</b> their <b>loading</b> positions at strategic times and serving cross-street traffic while the transit vehicles are loading. ...|$|R

40|$|Damage {{tolerance}} {{performance is}} critical to composite structures because surface impacts at relatively low energies {{may result in a}} significant strength loss. For certification, damage tolerance criteria require aerospace <b>vehicles</b> <b>to</b> meet design <b>loads</b> while containing damage at critical locations.

Due to the complexity of predicting both the impact damage and the residual properties, damage tolerance is demonstrated primarily by testing. A portable, spring-propelled, impact device was developed which allows the impact damage response to be investigated on large specimens, full-scale components, or entire vehicles. During impact, both the force history and projectile velocity are captured. The device was successfully used to demonstrate the damage tolerance performance of the NASA Composite Crew Module.
