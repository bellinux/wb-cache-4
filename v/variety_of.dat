This, in turn, is extended to generalized <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> finite ordered algebras, which corresponds to Steinby's generalized variety theorem. Also, families of tree languages and classes of ordered algebras that are definable by ordered (syntactic or translation) monoids are characterized...|$|R
