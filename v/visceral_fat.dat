25|$|It {{is common}} {{for there to be}} a {{development}} of <b>visceral</b> <b>fat,</b> after which the adipocytes (fat cells) of the <b>visceral</b> <b>fat</b> increase plasma levels of TNF-α and alter levels of a number of other substances (e.g., adiponectin, resistin, and PAI-1). TNF-α has been shown not only to cause the production of inflammatory cytokines, but also possibly to trigger cell signaling by interaction with a TNF-α receptor that may lead to insulin resistance. An experiment with rats fed a diet with 33% sucrose has been proposed {{as a model for the}} development of metabolic syndrome. The sucrose first elevated blood levels of triglycerides, which induced <b>visceral</b> <b>fat</b> and ultimately resulted in insulin resistance. The progression from <b>visceral</b> <b>fat</b> to increased TNF-α to insulin resistance has some parallels to human development of metabolic syndrome. The increase in adipose tissue also increases the number of immune cells present within, which play a role in inflammation.

25|$|Fat {{cells have}} an {{important}} physiological role in maintaining triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, as well as determining insulin resistance. Abdominal fat has a different metabolic profile—being more prone to induce insulin resistance. This explains {{to a large degree}} why central obesity is a marker of impaired glucose tolerance and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (even in the absence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension). Studies of female monkeys at Wake Forest University (2009) discovered that individuals suffering from higher stress have higher levels of <b>visceral</b> <b>fat</b> in their bodies.

Recent studies have demon-strated that RLPs are correlated with cardiovascular risk. We assessed the relationship between obesity and RLP and evaluated the factors related to RLP in children and adolescents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We measured BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, body fat mass, total abdominal <b>fat,</b> <b>visceral</b> and subcutaneous <b>fat</b> areas, fasting glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and RLP cholesterol in 135 children and adolescents (67 boys and 68 girls).

Each group was subdivided in two groups; control and trauma. Diets were supplemented for five consecutive weeks body weight increase per week was calculated. At end of the dietary treatments, single dose (2 mL kg - 1 body weight) of turpentine was injected in the dorso-lumber region. Intravenous glucose tolerance test (iv GTT) was performed, insulinogenic index and insulin sensitivity was measured.

40|$|Abstract Background Substantial {{evidence}} suggests that weight gain in early life is associated with increased adiposity and other metabolic disorders later in life. It is, however, unknown whether physical activity (PA) may modify these associations. We aimed to examine whether objectively measured PA at 30  years modified the associations between conditional weight gain in infancy (0 – 2 y) and childhood (2 – 4 y) with fat mass index (FMI) and <b>visceral</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> measured at age 30  years. Methods Prospective birth cohort study in Pelotas, Brazil, including 1874 participants with weight data at birth, two and four years of age, and measures of FMI, <b>visceral</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> and PA at {{a mean age of}} 30. 2  years. At age 30, time spent (min/day) in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was measured objectively using a wrist-worn accelerometer worn for four to seven consecutive days [...] Multiple linear regression analyses was performed to assess the associations between conditional weight gain and outcome variables at 30  years, adjusting for covariates. We examined whether PA modified the association between conditional weight gain and the outcomes of interest by introducing an interaction term (conditional weight gain × PA) in the models. Results Conditional weight gain in infancy and childhood were both positively associated with later FMI (infancy weight gain: β[*]=[*] 0. 68, 95 % CI: 0. 48, 0. 88; P[*]<[*] 0. 001; childhood weight gain: β[*]=[*] 0. 91, 95 % CI: 0. 70, 1. 11; P[*]<[*] 0. 001). A formal test for interaction suggested that MVPA at 30  years of age modified the association between childhood relative weight gain and later FMI (β[*]=[*]− 0. 006, 95 % CI: - 0. 011, − 0. 001; P[*]=[*] 0. 029), suggesting stronger associations between weight gain and FMI in those with lower levels of MVPA. Conditional weight gain in childhood was also positively associated with <b>visceral</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> (β[*]=[*] 0. 24, 95 % CI: 0. 15, 0424, P[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Obesity is {{characterized}} by a low grade chronic inflammation state.

This work presents novel methods fitted to in vivo investigations of mice model of obesity, allowing (i) automated detection of adipose tissue in abdominal regions of interest, (ii) quantification of <b>visceral</b> and subcutaneous <b>fat.</b> For each mouse, 1000 slices (100 μm thickness, 160 μm resolution) were acquired in 2 sec using a Toshiba medical CT (135 kV, 400 mAs).

40|$|Obesity {{is thought}} to lead to {{sympathetic}} overactivity as a compensatory adjustment to weight gain. However, most of the experimental support for the hypothesis has been derived from white cohorts. Our previous study in blacks indicated that sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) is closely correlated with body mass index only in women, whereas, in black men, SNA is elevated and dissociated from adiposity (Abate et al., Hypertension 38 : 379 – 383, 2001). To further determine whether total and regional adiposity are determinants of SNA in blacks, we performed a prospective weight loss study in 12 normotensive obese black men and 9 obese black women. SNA, body mass index, and abdominal fat mass were measured before and 16 wk after hypocaloric diet. The major new findings are that, in obese black men, the dietary-induced weight loss of 11. 3 ± 0. 8 kg resulted in reduction in plasma leptin, insulin, and <b>visceral</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> but {{had no effect on}} SNA (from baseline of 26 ± 4 to 28 ± 3 bursts/min, P = not significant). In contrast, in black women, weight loss of 8. 0 ± 0. 9 kg caused similar reductions in plasma leptin, insulin, and <b>visceral</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> and led to a reduction in SNA by 40 % (from baseline of 22 ± 2 to 13 ± 3 bursts/min, P < 0. 05). In conclusion, these new data from this prospective study provide strong support for a major adiposity-independent sympathetic activity in black men and adiposity-related sympathetic activity in black women...|$|R
25|$|While {{there are}} {{studies that show}} the health and medical {{benefits}} of weight loss, a study in 2005 of around 3000 Finns over an 18-year period showed that weight loss from dieting can result in increased mortality, while those who maintained their weight fared the best. Similar conclusion is drawn by other studies, and although other studies suggest that intentional weight loss has a small benefit for individuals classified as unhealthy, it is associated with slightly increased mortality for healthy individuals and the slightly overweight but not obese. This may reflect the loss of subcutaneous fat and beneficial mass from organs and muscle in addition to <b>visceral</b> <b>fat</b> {{when there is a}} sudden and dramatic weight loss.|$|E
25|$|Insulin {{is a major}} {{regulator}} of endocannabinoid (EC) {{metabolism and}} insulin treatment {{has been shown to}} reduce intracellular ECs, the 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), which correspond with insulin-sensitive expression changes in enzymes of EC metabolism. In insulin-resistant adipocytes, patterns of insulin-induced enzyme expression is disturbed {{in a manner consistent with}} elevated EC synthesis and reduced EC degradation. Findings suggest that insulin-resistant adipocytes fail to regulate EC metabolism and decrease intracellular EC levels in response to insulin stimulation, whereby obese insulin-resistant individuals exhibit increased concentrations of ECs. This dysregulation contributes to excessive <b>visceral</b> <b>fat</b> accumulation and reduced adiponectin release from abdominal adipose tissue, and further to the onset of several cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.|$|E

40|$|Leptin, a {{pleiotropic}} hormone regulating {{food intake}} and metabolism, {{plays an important}} role in the regulation of inflammation and immunity. We previously demonstrated that serum leptin levels are profoundly increased in mice which received azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as tumor-initiator and -promoter, respectively, in a colon carcinogenesis model. In this study, we attempted to address underlying mechanism whereby leptin is up-regulated in this rodent model. Five-week-old male ICR mice were given a single intraperitoneal injection of AOM (week 0), followed by 1 % DSS in drinking water for 7 days. Thereafter, the weights of <b>visceral</b> <b>fats</b> and the serum concentration of leptin were determined at week 20. Of interest, the relative epididymal fat pad and mesenteric fat weights, together with serum leptin levels in the AOM and/or DSS-treated mice were markedly increased compared to that in untreated mice. In addition, leptin protein production in epididymal fat pad with AOM/DSS-treated mice was 4. 7 -fold higher than that of control. Further, insulin signaling molecules, such as protein kinase B (Akt), S 6, mitogen-activate protein kinase/extracellular signaling-regulated kinase 1 / 2, and extracellular signaling-regulated kinase 1 / 2, were concomitantly activated in epididymal fat of AOM/DSS-treated mice. This treatment also increased the serum insulin and IGF- 1 levels. Taken together, our results suggest that higher levels of serum insulin and IGF- 1 promote the insulin signaling in epididymal fat and thereby increasing serum leptin, which may play an crucial role in, not only obesity-related, but also -independent colon carcinogenesis...|$|R

However, only DUP promoted a reduction in insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR. It is important to emphasize that there was no statics difference between LP and DUP groups; however, it appears that there may be bigger changes in the DUP than LP group in some of the metabolic syndrome risk factors in obese adolescents with regard to the effect size (ES). Both periodization models presented a large effect on muscular endurance.

However, it is unclear how the capacity of angiogenesis in each adipose depot is affected by over-nutrition. Therefore, we investigated the angiogenic capacity (AC) of subcutaneous and <b>visceral</b> <b>fats</b> in lean and obese mice. Methods: We compared the AC of epididymal fat (EF) and inguinal fat (IF) using an angiogenesis assay in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and diet-resistant (DR) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD).

Results: DIO mice showed {{a significant increase in the}} AC of EF only at 22 weeks of age compared to DR mice. The expression levels of genes related to angiogenesis, macrophage recruitment, and inflammation were significantly higher in the EF of DIO mice than in those of LFD mice and DR mice, while expression levels of genes related to macrophages and their recruitment were higher in the IF of DIO mice than in those of LFD and DR mice.

40|$|Metabolic {{flexibility}} {{is defined as}} the ability of an organism to adapt from fuel oxidation to fuel availability. It is well established that obesity results in loss of metabolic flexibility, however, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, it is critical to understand the mechanism underlying metabolic flexibility to tackle the epidemic of obesity. An energy-restricted diet will lead to weight loss. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms behind the improvement in metabolic flexibility with weight loss following an energy-restricted diet. In investigation 1, I compared the effects of an energy-restricted diet and a control diet over 12 weeks on overweight and obese volunteers to elucidate the underlying mechanism of metabolic flexibility. The results demonstrated that weight loss is associated with significant reductions in body fat composition, waist circumference, hip circumference, <b>visceral</b> <b>fats,</b> blood pressure, and an improvement in postprandial insulin sensitivity. This translates into an improvement in metabolic health and metabolic flexibility. However, the underlying mechanism remained unclear.
