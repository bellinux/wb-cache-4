60|$|I was unharmed {{except for}} a <b>slight</b> <b>bruise</b> upon my {{forehead}} where it had struck the stone flagging as I fell.|$|R
5000|$|... 111 109 was {{involved}} in an accident in the station of Wels, Austria, crashing with the ÖBB 1042 560. The driver suffered only <b>slight</b> <b>bruises,</b> however 111 109 was dismantled on-site on August 29, 1981 and not rebuilt later.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, Molly, my dear, only I got a <b>slight</b> <b>bruise</b> {{on the leg}} in the engine-shed to-day, and I had to go up an' show it to the doctor, d'ye see, before comin' home, {{which has}} made me later than usual." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} unless {{some of those}} steers take it into their heads to climb the rocks {{the same way we}} did," [...] {{answered}} Andy. He was suffering from a <b>slight</b> <b>bruise</b> on his left leg where he had brushed some of the roughest of the rocks.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Much better. It {{is only a}} <b>slight</b> <b>bruise,</b> and {{has been}} well looked to, and is almost easy now. It made me giddy and faint in a moment. It had hurt me before; but at last it {{overpowered}} me all at once.' 'May I stay with you until some one comes? Would you like it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{he said at}} last, {{feeling his}} left leg {{as if he were}} not {{absolutely}} easy in his mind about that, 'no, not hurt, thank you. Not much, that is,' he added with the air of one who thinks it best to qualify too positive a statement. 'Left leg. Shin. <b>Slight</b> <b>bruise.</b> Nothing to signify.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{altogether}} mere fatigue, sir, for her mule stumbled to-day, and {{she fell}} from the saddle. She fell lightly, and was up again without assistance, and rode from us laughing; but she complained towards evening of a <b>slight</b> <b>bruise</b> in the side. She spoke of it more than once, as we followed your party up the mountain.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{the wound}} itself {{might have been}} very well made by a light rapier, {{but there was a}} <b>slight</b> <b>bruise</b> on the flesh {{on each side of the}} wound, such a mark as might be made by the handle or guard of a dagger, and {{sufficiently}} plain to leave no doubt in my mind that it was so made." ...|$|R
50|$|On December 6, 1999, 13-year-old student, Seth Trickey, shot 4 classmates. 12-year-old Savana Knowles, {{was shot}} near her right ear, the slug exited without hitting vital organs. 13-year-old Billy Railey, {{was shot in}} his right leg. 13-year-olds Cody Chronister and Brad Schindel were also wounded. Another student {{received}} <b>slight</b> <b>bruising.</b> The victims were taken to area hospitals, there were no fatalities.|$|R
40|$|Hyperspectral imaging {{technology}} {{was employed to}} detect <b>slight</b> <b>bruises</b> on Korla pears. The spectral data of 60 bruised samples and 60 normal samples were collected by a hyperspectral imaging system. To select the characteristic wavelengths for detection, several chemometrics methods were used on the raw spectra. Firstly, principal component analysis (PCA) {{was conducted on the}} spectra ranging from 420 to 1000 nm of all samples. Considering that the reliability of the first two PCs was more than 90 %, five characteristic wavelengths (472, 544, 655, 688 and 967 nm) were selected by the loading plot of PC 1 and PC 2. Then, each of the wavelength variables was considered as an independent classifier for bruised/normal classification, and all classifiers were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Two wavelengths (472 and 967 nm) with the highest values under the curve (0. 992 and 0. 980) were finally selected for modeling. The classifying model was built by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and the bruised/normal classification accuracy of the modeling set (45 damaged samples and 45 normal samples) and prediction set (15 damaged samples and 15 normal samples) was 98. 9 % and 100 %, respectively, which {{is similar to that of}} the PLS-DA model based on the whole spectral range. The result shows that it is feasible to select characteristic wavelengths for the detection of <b>slight</b> <b>bruises</b> on pears by the methods combining the PCA and ROC analysis. This study can lay a foundation for the development of an online detection system for <b>slight</b> <b>bruise</b> detection on pears...|$|R
60|$|It was found, indeed, {{that she}} had escaped almost miraculously, with a {{contusion}} on the head, a sprained ankle, and some <b>slight</b> <b>bruises.</b> After her wound was stanched, she {{was taken to a}} neighbouring cottage, until a carriage could be summoned to convey her home; and when this had arrived, the cavalcade which had issued forth so gayly on this enterprise, returned slowly and pensively to the Hall.|$|R
5000|$|On the Tuesday an inquest {{was held}} at the Harrow public house. The Times reported: [...] "The body of the {{deceased}} presented the appearance of a fine healthy woman of ordinary stature, possessing rather pleasing features, {{with the exception of a}} <b>slight</b> <b>bruise</b> on the side of the head, there was nothing to indicate that she had met a violent death. Both arms, however, bore marks of having been tightly gripped, evidently inflicted while the poor creature was being held under the water." ...|$|R
60|$|He did not return; {{for at the}} end of {{the next}} half-hour, when they laid before her the half-conscious, {{breathing}} body of her husband, safe and unharmed, but for exhaustion and some <b>slight</b> <b>bruises,</b> she learned that the worst fears of the workmen had been realized. In releasing him, a second cave had taken place. They had barely time to snatch away the helpless body of her husband, before the strong frame of his rescuer, Cyrus Hawkins, was struck and smitten down in his place.|$|R

6000|$|... "But a kind fate intervened, and by {{a miracle}} I escaped with but <b>slight</b> <b>bruises.</b> The ship was moving slowly at the time, and as I lunged {{overboard}} into the darkness beneath I shuddered at the awful plunge I thought awaited me, for all day the fleet had sailed thousands of feet above the ground; but to my utter surprise I struck upon a soft mass of vegetation not twenty feet from {{the deck of the}} ship. In fact, the keel of the vessel must have been grazing the surface of the ground at the time.|$|R

60|$|And yet if he {{had seen}} a man insult her,--{{if he had}} seen her at that moment in peril of the {{slightest}} danger, the <b>slightest</b> <b>bruise,</b> he would have rushed forward like a madman, and died, saving her from that bruise. And he knew that: and with the strange self-contradiction of human nature, he soothed his own conscience by the thought that he loved her still; and that, therefore--somehow or other, he cared not to make out how--he had done her no wrong. Then he blustered again, for the benefit of his men. He would teach these monks of Crowland a lesson. He would burn the minster over their heads.|$|R
