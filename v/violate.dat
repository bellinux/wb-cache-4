The general formalism for the differential cross section and polarization observables of electromagnetic deuteron disintegration is extended to incorporate parity <b>violating</b> contributions. Formal expressions for the additional structure functions are derived. Results are presented for these parity <b>violating</b> structure functions for quasifree kinematics neglecting final state interaction and twobody effects.

From the latest upper limits of B(B^+_u→π^+ℓ^+ℓ^-) and B(B^ 0 _d→ℓ^+ℓ^-), we have derived new upper bounds on the relevant R-parity <b>violating</b> couplings products, which {{are stronger than}} the existing ones. Using the constrained parameter space, we present the R-parity <b>violating</b> effects on the branching ratios and the forward-backward asymmetries of these decays. We find that B(B^ 0 _d→ℓ^+ℓ^-) and B(B^+_u →ρ^+ℓ^+ℓ^-) could be enhanced several orders by the R-parity <b>violating</b> sneutrino and squark exchanges, respectively. The R-parity <b>violating</b> effects on the dilepton invariant mass spectra of B^+_u→π^+ℓ^+ℓ^-, ρ^+ℓ^+ℓ^- and the normalized forward-backward asymmetry A_FB(B^+_u→π^+ℓ^+ℓ^-) and A_FB(B^+_u →ρ^+ℓ^+ℓ^-) are studied in detail.

30|$|In {{the first}} analysis, we {{investigate}} the products and conduct a bivariate correlation analysis between the occurrence {{frequency of the}} products {{and the number of}} <b>violated</b> constraints.

We assume that the degree of correlation is related to the degree of the learners’ understanding. If the number of <b>violated</b> constraints has a negative correlation to the frequency, then the high number of <b>violated</b> constraints will be followed by the lower number of actions. It means that the high number of <b>violated</b> compositions of sentence cards has a small number of learners’ actions.
