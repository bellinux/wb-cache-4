5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are among}} the least studied of all lemurs, and {{little is known about}} them. Only the pale fork-marked lemur (P.pallescens) has been studied {{relatively}} well, primarily by Pierre Charles-Dominique, Jean-Jacques Petter, and Georges Pariente during two expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in Kirindy Forest. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large baobab trees) or abandoned nests built by giant mouse lemurs (Mirza coquereli) during the day. Some of the abandoned nests they sleep in are leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30sleeping sites may be used {{over the course of a}} year, each for a <b>variable</b> <b>length</b> of time.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of aphthous stomatitis, {{accounting}} for about 80–85% of all cases. This subtype is termed minor aphthous ulceration (MiAU), or minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MiRAS). The lesions themselves may be referred to as minor aphthae or minor aphthous ulcers. These lesions are generally less than 10mm in diameter (usually about 2–3mm), and affect non-keratinized mucosal surfaces (i.e. the labial and buccal mucosa, lateral borders of the tongue and the floor of the mouth). Usually several ulcers appear at the same time, but single ulcers are possible. Healing usually takes seven to ten days and leaves no scar. Between episodes of ulceration, there is usually an ulcer-free period of <b>variable</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E

40|$|The SAS DATA step {{supports}} {{quite a few}} {{statements and}} functions. Many of these are usually accompanied with acceptable default values. Due {{to the nature of}} SAS programming, however, the function defaults are sometimes overly generous. This is particularly true of length specifications for both the numeric and character variables. With the default of 8 bytes for numeric variables (the equivalent of double-float notation in other languages) and the default <b>length</b> of character <b>variables</b> sometimes as long as 200 bytes, the potential for shortening <b>variable</b> <b>lengths</b> is quite high. Some standard SAS functions and procedures enable you to shorten <b>variable</b> <b>lengths</b> quite easily. Shorter <b>variable</b> <b>lengths</b> mean shorter observation lengths, and shorter observation lengths enable faster I/O processing...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{investigate}} how logging costs change when pulpwood is cut into 3. 0 meter lengths compared to bucking in <b>variable</b> <b>lengths</b> of 3. 0 to 5. 5 meters. An in-depth analysis was performed on data provided by Sveaskog’s Växjö office for 41 different tracts, representing a total cut volume of 41 114 m 3 fub.

The corresponding numbers in thinning were 190. 30 SEK/m 3 fub and 157. 58 SEK/m 3 fub respectively.

25|$|The {{adjective}} Cartesian {{refers to}} the French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes who published this idea in 1637.

The concept of using a pair of axes was introduced later, after Descartes' La Géométrie was translated into Latin in 1649 by Frans van Schooten and his students.

25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} {{we wish to}} {{transmit}} sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign <b>variable</b> <b>length</b> codes, so that receiving a '1' tells {{us to look at}} another bit unless we have already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It is easy to see that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|E
