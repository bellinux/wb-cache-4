5|$|Barmouth Bridge (Welsh: Pont Abermaw), {{also known}} as Barmouth <b>Viaduct,</b> is a {{single-track}} largely wooden railway <b>viaduct</b> that carries the Cambrian Coast Railway across the River Mawddach estuary {{on the coast of}} Cardigan Bay, Wales. It sits between Morfa Mawddach and Barmouth in Gwynedd and caters for rail, foot and cycle traffic.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2009 the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) {{replaced}} the <b>viaduct</b> {{that carries the}} route over St. Paul's Avenue and Conrail line. The St. Paul's <b>Viaduct</b> was built in 1928 and determined structurally deficient. The $271.9 million replacement was completed in September 2011. In addition to replacing the St. Paul's Avenue <b>viaduct,</b> the approaches to US1-9 Truck between Route 7 and the Tonnele Circle were improved.|$|E
5|$|I-805 {{continues}} northward through San Diego, {{where it}} intersects SR94, the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway. As the freeway continues through downtown San Diego, it meets SR15, {{the continuation of}} I-15. It then intersects El Cajon Boulevard before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue. The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for {{his involvement in the}} construction of several roads and highways in Southern California. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley <b>Viaduct,</b> a towering reinforced concrete <b>viaduct</b> built in 1972, spanning over Mission Valley and the San Diego River. The <b>viaduct</b> is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over I-8, which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the <b>viaduct</b> perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical stack interchange. The San Diego Trolley traffic also runs under the <b>viaduct</b> on the valley floor.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Snow Hill tunnel re-opened and {{the former}} LCDR City Branch {{formed the basis of}} the new Thameslink route. Network Rail began a major upgrade of the route in 2009. A key {{objective}} of the Thameslink Programme was allowing more trains to travel between central London and Brighton, which was prevented by a bottleneck between London Bridge and Blackfriars on a <b>viaduct</b> through the historic Borough Market. Network Rail initially suggested widening the <b>viaduct</b> and demolishing part of the market, but the public backlash against this plan prompted Network Rail to consider permanently routing all Thameslink trains to/from Brighton via Herne Hill, avoiding London Bridge and the market. This would have required the grade separation of the two lines through Herne Hill, which would have been achieved by constructing a new <b>viaduct</b> immediately to the east of the existing <b>viaduct</b> and using a fly-over to connect {{the southern end of the}} new <b>viaduct</b> to the line between Tulse Hill and North Dulwich (taking the tracks over the Chatham Main Line and towards Tulse Hill). This proposal was rejected in 2004 because of its environmental impact on Herne Hill and the larger number of interchanges offered on the London Bridge route; the Borough Market <b>viaduct</b> was widened instead. From December 2008 to May 2012, Thameslink trains serving Herne Hill did not run most weekends or after 22:30 every week-night because of construction work on the Thameslink route through central London as part of the Thameslink Programme.|$|E
5|$|On February 25, 1937, the Port Richmond–Tower Hill <b>viaduct</b> was completed, {{becoming}} the largest grade crossing elimination {{project in the}} United States. The <b>viaduct</b> {{was more than a}} mile long, and spanned eight grade crossings on the North Shore Branch of the SIRT. The opening of the <b>viaduct</b> marked the final part of a $6,000,000 grade crossing elimination project on Staten Island, which eliminated thirty-four grade crossings on the north and south shores of Staten Island.|$|E
5|$|The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) began a {{rehabilitation}} {{program for the}} lower and upper levels of the highway in 2005. The renovation work for the 12thStreet and 14thStreet viaducts was completed in 2010. Renovation of the upper roadway, including the Hoboken Avenue <b>Viaduct,</b> and Conrail <b>Viaduct</b> on the lower roadway {{is expected to be}} completed by 2016.|$|E

50|$|<b>Viaducts</b> are {{commonly}} used in many cities that are railroad centers, such as Chicago, Atlanta, Birmingham, London and Manchester. These <b>viaducts</b> cross the large railroad yards that are needed for freight trains there, and also cross the multi-track railroad lines that are needed for heavy railroad traffic. These <b>viaducts</b> keep highway and city street traffic from having to be continually interrupted by the train traffic. Likewise, some <b>viaducts</b> carry railroads over large valleys, or they carry railroads over cities with many cross-streets and avenues.|$|R

50|$|As Salt Lake City won the {{bid for the}} 2002 Winter Olympics in 1995, I-15 was reconstructed. As part of the reconstruction, SR-268 and SR-269's <b>viaducts</b> {{into the}} city were set to be reconstructed and shortened. Mayor Corradini wanted to revitalize an {{industrial}} portion of Salt Lake City with her Gateway project. A part of her project included demolishing the almost mile-long <b>viaducts</b> of SR-269, as she felt a freeway bridge passing over the area {{she was trying to}} revitalize would be a hindrance to the project. The pair of <b>viaducts</b> were demolished in late-1998-early-1999, replaced with much shorter <b>viaducts</b> in 2000.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of the use of seismic isolation devices on the overall 3 D seismic response of curved highway <b>viaducts</b> with an emphasis on expansion joints. Furthermore, an evaluation of {{the effectiveness of}} the use of cable restrainers is presented. For this purpose, the bridge seismic performance has been evaluated on four different radii of curvature, considering two cases: restrained and unrestrained curved <b>viaducts.</b> Depending on the radius of curvature, three-dimensional non-linear dynamic analysis shows the vulnerability of curved <b>viaducts</b> to pounding and deck unseating damage. In this study, the efficiency of using LRB supports combined with cable restrainers on curved <b>viaducts</b> is demonstrated, not only by reducing in all cases the possible damage, but also by providing a similar behavior in the <b>viaducts</b> despite of curvature radius. Keywords—Nonlinear dynamic response, seismic design, seismic isolation, unseating prevention system. I...|$|R
50|$|Beam bridges are {{not limited}} to a single span. Some <b>viaducts</b> such as the Feiyunjiang Bridge in China have {{multiple}} simply supported spans supported by piers. This is opposed to <b>viaducts</b> using continuous spans over the piers.|$|R

The columns were painted by Greek immigrant Tom Stefopoulos between 1948 and 1952. In 1999, the <b>viaduct</b> was demolished but the columns were spared due to the efforts of the architectural group Rigga. For the next five years, attempts to restore the columns were unsuccessful and they remained in storage beneath the Fremont Bridge.|$|E

There will be operational improvements at several intersections {{on the upper}} roadway, replacing all overpasses. It will replace the deck and rehabilitate the superstructure of the Conrail <b>Viaduct.</b> The total project cost is estimated at $180–200million {{and is expected to}} be completed by 2016.|$|E
50|$|The Windward <b>Viaducts</b> are a pair {{of highway}} <b>viaducts</b> that pass {{along the edge of}} the Ko‘olau Range between the Tetsuo Harano Tunnels and the Hospital Rock Tunnels on the island of O‘ahu in the State of Hawaii. The <b>viaducts</b> are located on Interstate H-3, which connects Kaneohe with the Interstate H-1 and Interstate H-201 freeways at Hālawa near Pearl Harbor. These {{structures}} are among the longest bridges in Hawaii and are considered an engineering marvel.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the total}} 51.03 km route length, 10.92 km was {{constructed}} underground while 40.11 km is elevated. A large portion (78.6%) {{of the route}} length is constructed on 9.3 m-wide <b>viaducts,</b> which is used in both dense urban districts as well as rural areas with steep slopes. Two types of <b>viaducts,</b> single-tracked and double-tracked, are used. Single-tracked <b>viaducts</b> were constructed with a standard span of 30 m with mobile cranes. Double-tracked <b>viaducts</b> were constructed using the Advanced Shoring Method for either 35 m or 60 m spans. A 4 m noise barrier wall is used on all <b>viaducts,</b> and floating track beds are used for environmentally-sensitive zones. During construction, some residents in Xinzhuang expressed concern over the 7 to 9-story high elevated track and its stability during potential earthquakes. The Bureau of High Speed Rail responded that due to a base that penetrates 20 - 30 m into the ground, the tracks could withstand earthquake shake intensity over 5 without a problem. By July 2011, {{the last of the}} line's elevated support pillars were erected and by August 2011, construction of the elevated <b>viaducts</b> were completed.|$|R
50|$|Two more <b>viaducts</b> {{existed at}} the north end of Edwardsville which were {{demolished}} shortly after the Beeching cuts of the 1960s. The main reason for their demolition was subsidence and the <b>viaducts</b> had been strengthened with huge wooden supports for a number of years.|$|R
5|$|The Vatican City State Railway {{branches}} {{off from}} the Rome to Viterbo railway line at the Roma San Pietro railway station and crosses Gelsomino valley via a 143.12 metre long masonry <b>viaduct</b> of eight 15.30 metre arches (bearing the Fasces and the Savoy Coat of Arms), which crosses Viale Vaticano (which it interrupts) and Via Aurelia. The Via delle Cave and the Via del Gelsomino are also interrupted by the <b>viaduct</b> and thus merge with the Via Aurelia.|$|E
5|$|Then, the High Line passes {{under the}} Chelsea Market, a food hall, at 15th Street. A spur {{connecting}} the <b>viaduct</b> to the National Biscuit Company building splits off at 16th Street; this spur is {{closed to the}} public. The Tenth Avenue Square, an amphitheater located on the <b>viaduct,</b> is at 17th Street, where the High Line crosses over Tenth Avenue from southeast to northwest. At 23rd Street, there is the 23rd Street Lawn, a lawn where visitors can rest. Then, between 25th and 26th Streets, a ramp takes visitors above the <b>viaduct,</b> with a scenic overlook facing east at 26th Street. The Philip Falcone and Lisa Maria Falcone flyover, as it is called, is named after two major donors to the park; this ramp was based on plans for a Phase 1 flyover that was never built.|$|E
5|$|A second station, {{later called}} Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road), opened in 1874 with the {{building}} of the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. This station was some distance east of the centre of the town and was approached on the Charlton <b>Viaduct.</b>|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} earnest on 18 April 2013 after {{completion}} of remedial and preparatory works such as land acquisition, removal of vegetation, demolition of certain structures and remedial works on old mines in Midlothian, for which over £54 million was spent by Network Rail. The first task was the excavation of the track alignment through Monktonhall and the clearing of the site for Shawfair station. Construction of the line's first bridge, Rye Haugh Bridge at Millerhall, were underway on 6 August 2013 as part of works to deviate the line out of Edinburgh from Newcraighall before it returns to the original alignment. The 23-arch Newbattle <b>Viaduct</b> (or Lothianbridge <b>Viaduct)</b> was used by lorries removing spoil from the construction site which eased traffic on local roads.|$|E
5|$|During {{planning}} and construction, and {{for about half}} a year after opening, the road had no official name and {{was known as the}} Diagonal Highway, Newark–Jersey City <b>Viaduct,</b> or High-Level <b>Viaduct.</b> On May 3, 1933, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Eugene W. Hejke of Jersey City naming the road the General Casimir Pulaski Memorial Skyway after Casimir Pulaski, the Polish military leader who helped train and lead Continental Army troops in the American Revolutionary War. An official ceremony was held on October 11, 1933, including the unveiling of signs with an abbreviated designation, Gen. Pulaski Skyway.|$|E
