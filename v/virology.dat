5|$|Like biochemistry, the {{overlapping}} disciplines of bacteriology and <b>virology</b> (later combined as microbiology), situated {{between science and}} medicine, developed rapidly in the early 20th century. Félix d'Herelle's isolation of bacteriophage during World War I initiated {{a long line of}} research focused on phage viruses and the bacteria they infect.|$|E
5|$|His {{rigorous}} {{mathematical analysis}} {{of the structure of}} self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer <b>virology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms can {{be found}} almost {{anywhere}} on Earth. Bacteria and archaea are almost always microscopic, while a number of eukaryotes are also microscopic, including most protists, some fungi, {{as well as some}} micro-animals and plants. Viruses are generally regarded as not living and therefore not considered as microorganisms, although a subfield of microbiology is <b>virology,</b> the study of viruses.|$|E
5|$|She {{then worked}} {{for five years}} in the Metropolitan Police {{forensic}} science laboratory as a forensic scientist. After studying for her degree in immunology part-time, Carey decided to continue academic research and returned to the University of Edinburgh to pursue doctoral studies. Carey was awarded her Doctorate (PhD) by research thesis on the <b>virology</b> of the maedi-visna virus which affects sheep, in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article {{describing}} a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants, {{and the discovery}} of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, about 5,000 virus species have been described in detail, although there are millions of types. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most abundant type of biological entity. The study of viruses is known as <b>virology,</b> a sub-speciality of microbiology.|$|E
5|$|At the airport, Cole {{leaves a}} last message telling the {{scientists}} that in following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys {{they are on}} the wrong track, and that he will not return. He is soon confronted by Jose, an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goines' father's <b>virology</b> lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{breakthroughs}} in <b>virology</b> were made {{while he was}} there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the transmission of the influenza virus. His own research was on the canarypox virus, which he used in developing a chick embryo assay for the isolation and quantification of animal viruses. Dale offered Burnet a permanent position but he declined {{and returned to the}} Hall Institute. Following his productive work in London, the Rockefeller Institute agreed to fund a new virus research laboratory in Melbourne for Burnet. He brought back a set of viruses from the National Institute to begin the basis of research in Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Sonnabend {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{physicians}} to notice among his gay male patients the immune deficiency that would later be named AIDS. His background in microbiology, <b>virology,</b> infectious diseases and prior experience of working with immunocompromised transplant patients helped him to conduct some of the earliest research into AIDS, independently of government agencies that were slow to react and often at his own expense, and in 1983 he was founding editor one of the first AIDS journals, AIDS Research (renamed AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses in 1986, after Sonnabend was fired from the journal).|$|E
5|$|The last {{cases of}} {{smallpox}} {{in the world}} occurred in an outbreak of two cases (one of which was fatal) in Birmingham, UK in 1978. A medical photographer, Janet Parker, contracted the disease at the University of Birmingham Medical School and died on September 11, 1978, after which Professor Henry Bedson, the scientist responsible for smallpox research at the university, committed suicide. All known stocks of smallpox were subsequently destroyed or transferred to two WHO-designated reference laboratories with BSL-4 facilities—the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Russia's State Research Center of <b>Virology</b> and Biotechnology VECTOR.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur and Edward Jenner {{were the}} first to develop {{vaccines}} to protect against viral infections. The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s, when the science of <b>virology</b> gained momentum. In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. There were epidemics of poliomyelitis that were only controlled following the development of a vaccine in the 1950s. HIV {{is one of the most}} pathogenic new viruses to have emerged in centuries. Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They drive evolution by transferring genes across species, play important roles in ecosystems and are essential to life.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} viruses to cause devastating {{epidemics}} in human societies {{has led to}} the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory. Smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are only two centres in the world that are authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the State Research Center of <b>Virology</b> and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded. As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable to the virus.|$|E
5|$|When Burnet {{returned}} to Australia, {{he continued his}} work on <b>virology,</b> including the epidemiology of herpes simplex. He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of psittacosis and Q fever. After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban {{in order to prevent}} human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named Coxiella burnetii in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.|$|E
5|$|The work of Pasteur and Koch did not {{accurately}} reflect the true {{diversity of the}} microbial world because of their exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical relevance. It {{was not until the}} work of Martinus Beijerinck and Sergei Winogradsky late in the 19th century that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed. Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques. While his work on the Tobacco Mosaic Virus established the basic principles of <b>virology,</b> it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation {{of a wide range of}} microbes with wildly different physiologies. Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes. He was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. French-Canadian microbiologist Felix d'Herelle co-discovered bacteriophages and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{several other}} {{long-established}} general journals in the field, {{such as the}} Journal of <b>Virology</b> from the American Society for Microbiology and the Society for General Microbiology's Journal of General <b>Virology</b> (which both first appeared in 1967), <b>Virology</b> is a commercial journal which has never been associated with an academic society. It was originally published by Academic Press, and then under the Academic Press imprints of purchasers Harcourt, Brace & World and Elsevier.|$|E
25|$|Institute of Human <b>Virology</b> and Cancer Biology (IHVCB).|$|E
25|$|<b>Virology</b> is a peer-reviewed {{scientific}} {{journal in}} <b>virology.</b> Established in 1955 by George Hirst, Lindsay Black and Salvador Luria, {{it is the}} earliest English-only journal to specialise in the field. The journal covers basic research into viruses affecting animals, plants, bacteria and fungi, including their molecular biology, structure, assembly, pathogenesis, immunity, interactions with the host cell, evolution and ecology. Molecular aspects of control and prevention are also covered, as well as viral vectors and gene therapy, but clinical <b>virology</b> is excluded. As of 2013, the journal is published fortnightly by Elsevier.|$|E

25|$|<b>Virology</b> is {{concerned}} with identification of viruses in specimens such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
25|$|Veterinary <b>virology</b> is {{the study}} of viruses in {{non-human}} animals. It is an important branch of veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Li Ka-shing donated C$28million to the University of Alberta {{to found}} the Li Ka-shing Institute of <b>Virology.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Virology</b> is {{the study}} of viruses – submicroscopic, {{parasitic}} particles of genetic material contained in a protein coat – and virus-like agents. It focuses on the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and evolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy. <b>Virology</b> {{is considered to be a}} subfield of microbiology or of medicine.|$|E
25|$|George Hirst, Lindsay Black and Salvador Luria saw {{the need}} for a journal that united basic science {{research}} across all viruses, regardless of their host species. They established <b>Virology</b> in 1955, and the journal first appeared in May of that year. It was the first English-only journal to focus on <b>virology,</b> and is the oldest United States-based journal in the specialism. Hirst was the founding editor-in-chief, with Black and Luria being co-editors. Between them, they covered the major disciplines of viruses infecting animals (Hirst), plants (Black) and bacteria (Luria).|$|E
25|$|Texas A's College of Veterinary Medicine conducts {{research}} in genetics, physiology and pharmacology, animal husbandry, <b>virology,</b> bacteriology, {{and a number}} of other disciplines. Also, clinical research is performed by clinicians in the college veterinary hospitals.|$|E
25|$|Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry has 20 departments, seven divisions, eight {{research}} groups, and 31 centres and institutes. The faculty is {{internationally known}} {{for research in}} diabetes, obesity, <b>virology,</b> cardiology, cancer and spinal injury rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophages) was first recognized by Frederick Twort in 1911, and, independently, by Félix d'Herelle in 1917. As bacteria could be grown easily in culture, {{this led to}} an explosion of <b>virology</b> research.|$|E
25|$|The hub of {{the complex}} is the Katz Group Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research (formerly HRIF West), an eight-storey {{building}} that provides the main entrance to the complex and becomes the critical link between Medical Sciences Building and Heritage Medical Research Centre. The Katz Group Centre is a teaching and research facility. It {{is home to the}} Li Ka Shing Institute of <b>Virology,</b> led by scientific director Lorne Tyrrell, MD, PhD, and includes some of the world's top virologists, including Michael Houghton, PhD, Canada Excellence Research Chair and Li Ka Shing Chair in <b>Virology,</b> who co-led the team that discovered the hepatitis C virus during his previous career in private industry. The facility is located on the corner of 89 Avenue and 114 Street in Edmonton, Alberta.|$|E
25|$|Areas of {{concentration}} include genome stability and tumorigenesis; regenerative medicine and biomedical device development; vascular, developmental, structural, and computational and systems biology; comparative effectiveness research; immunology and immunological approaches to cancer; and cancer <b>virology.</b> The school is also heavily {{involved with the}} advancement and orchestration of clinical research and clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|University faculty {{have been}} pioneers in such fields as {{astronomy}} (John Brashear), aviation (Samuel Pierpont Langley), <b>virology</b> (Jonas Salk), and psychology (Benjamin Spock), {{in addition to}} being given popular titles such as the Father of Radio Broadcasting (Reginald Fessenden), the Father of Project Management (David I. Cleland), the Father of CPR (Peter Safar), and the Father of Organ Transplantation (Thomas Starzl).|$|E
25|$|Education {{programmes}} {{have traditionally}} encompassed an initial bachelor's degree, which is presupposed {{for two years}} of further studies eventually earning the students a medicine master's examina. Many students choose to study on (for as much as) another 4 years to earn a PhD degree, at this time the students specialize in a certain areas such as nephrology, neurology, oncology or <b>virology.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Michael Houghton, Canada Excellence Research Chair and Li Ka Shing Chair in <b>Virology,</b> {{showed that}} a vaccine created from one strain of the {{hepatitis}} C virus can be effective against all known strains of the virus. Houghton was also the researcher who originally identified the hepatitis C virus. The discovery paves the way for developing a vaccine to prevent future hepatitis C infections.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, the World Health Organization {{declared}} smallpox an eradicated disease. This was {{the result}} of coordinated public health efforts, but vaccination was an essential component. Although the disease was declared eradicated, some pus samples still remain in laboratories in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta in the US, and in State Research Center of <b>Virology</b> and Biotechnology VECTOR in Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia.|$|E
25|$|Fuller {{hoped to}} gain {{traction}} for his ideas and nomenclature by dedicating Synergetics to H.S.M. Coxeter (with permission) and by citing page 71 of the latter's Regular Polytopes to suggest where his A & B modules (depicted above) might enter the literature (see Fig. 950.12). Dr. Arthur Loeb provided a prologue and an appendix to Synergetics discussing its overlap with crystallography, chemistry and <b>virology.</b>|$|E
25|$|In <b>virology,</b> {{the term}} {{may also be}} used when {{referring}} to mRNA synthesis from an RNA molecule (i.e., RNA replication). For instance, the genome of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA -) virus may be template for a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA +). This is because the positive-sense strand contains the information needed to translate the viral proteins for viral replication afterwards. This process is catalyzed by a viral RNA replicase.|$|E
25|$|In 1915 Tedder married Rosalinde Maclardy; {{they had}} two sons and a daughter. Following {{the death of his}} first wife in an {{aircraft}} crash in Egypt in January 1943, Tedder married Marie (Toppy) Black (née Seton) in October 1943. Tedder was the father of: Dick (killed in France 1940), John Michael (1926–1994; Late Purdie Professor of Chemistry, University of St. Andrews), Richard (Professor of <b>Virology</b> at UCL) and Mena.|$|E
25|$|MD Anderson enjoys {{university}} {{status by}} providing fellowship, internship and residency opportunities to Ph.D.s and medical professionals. The institution offers master's degrees and Ph.D.s to {{students enrolled in}} The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, which it operates with UT Health Science Center at Houston. Areas of study include: immunology, cancer biology, genes and development, molecular carcinogenesis, medical physics, biomathematics and biostatistics, experimental therapeutics, and <b>virology</b> and gene therapy.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopes {{are capable}} of imaging at a significantly higher resolution than light microscopes, owing to the smaller de Broglie wavelength of electrons. This enables the instrument to capture fine detail—even {{as small as a}} single column of atoms, which is thousands of times smaller than a resolvable object seen in a light microscope. Transmission electron microscopy is a major analytical method in the physical, chemical and biological sciences. TEMs find application in cancer research, <b>virology,</b> and materials science as well as pollution, nanotechnology and semiconductor research.|$|E
