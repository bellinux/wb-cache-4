5|$|Finland, the United States and Sweden are {{the most}} {{advanced}} in developing a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal. Countries <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> plans on disposing used fuel directly or after reprocessing, with France and Japan having an extensive commitment to reprocessing. The country-specific status of high-level waste management plans are described below.|$|E
5|$|Mole crickets <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> diets; {{some like}} the tawny mole cricket are herbivores, others are omnivores, feeding on larvae, worms, roots, and grasses, {{and others like}} the {{southern}} mole cricket are mainly predacious. As well as consuming roots underground, mole crickets leave their burrows at night to forage for leaves and stems which they drag underground before consumption.|$|E
5|$|Musicians {{and critics}} <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{appraisal}} of Tristano as a musician. Some describe his playing as cold {{and suggest that}} his innovations had little impact; others state {{that he was a}} bridge between bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than he should be because commentators found him hard to categorize and because he chose not to commercialize.|$|E

5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are found}} in all adult tetrapods; they <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> number and position. Mammals {{typically}} have four parathyroid glands, while other types of animals typically have six. The removal of parathyroid glands in animals produces a condition resembling acute poisoning with irregular muscle contractions.|$|E
5|$|The watershed's soils <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{permeability}} {{and ability}} to retain water. Clays that do not absorb much water dominate {{the eastern end of}} the watershed and the lands south of the creek. Northern areas of the watershed tend to be porous and less prone to rapid runoff.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E

50|$|Features {{recovered}} were postholes, hearths, middens, and plow marks. The postholes <b>varied</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> sizes, and 51 were recorded. Hearth {{remains were}} of ash and burnt stones and matrix concentrations. Middens were composed mostly of dumped ceramics.|$|R
5|$|Data {{obtained}} from the composition of soil samples collected on Apollo 15 show that most (about 90%) of the samples from the Apennine Front are brown-glass breccias, and approximately 60–70% {{obtained from}} the mare surface are basalt. Although the basalts seem to <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> texture, their ages appear to be approximately the same. Most of the samples obtained on the Apennine Front are KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, phosphorus) materials, anorthosites, recrystallized norite, or recrystallized breccia.|$|E
5|$|Economic historians <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{calculations}} {{of the gross}} domestic product of the Roman economy during the Principate. In the sample years of 14, 100, and 150 AD, estimates of per capita GDP range from 166 to 380 HS. The GDP per capita of Italy is estimated as 40 to 66% higher than in the rest of the Empire, due to tax transfers from the provinces and the concentration of elite income in the heartland.|$|E
5|$|Sliced apples turn {{brown with}} {{exposure}} to air {{due to the}} conversion of natural phenolic substances into melanin upon exposure to oxygen. Different cultivars <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> propensity to brown after slicing and the genetically engineered Arctic Apples do not brown. Sliced fruit can be treated with acidulated water to prevent this effect. Sliced apple consumption tripled in the US from 2004 to 2014 to 500 million apples annually due to its convenience.|$|E

5|$|The law {{established}} four {{tiers of}} coverage: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. All categories offer the essential health benefits. The categories <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> division of premiums and out-of-pocket costs: bronze plans {{have the lowest}} monthly premiums and highest out-of-pocket costs, while platinum plans are the reverse. The percentages of health care costs that plans are expected to cover through premiums (as opposed to out-of-pocket costs) are, on average: 60% (bronze), 70% (silver), 80% (gold), and 90% (platinum).|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{spin-off}} video games have also been made for the Final Fantasy series. These spin-off games <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> relation to the main series; the first, The Final Fantasy Legend games, were marketed as related in North America but {{were considered to be}} the first three games of the SaGa series in their native Japan, and later SaGa games released outside Japan bear no Final Fantasy branding. Dissidia Final Fantasy, on the other hand, is a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 games have been released as spin-offs of the main Final Fantasy series, many within their own sub-series.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E

5|$|Mole crickets {{have three}} life stages, eggs, nymphs, and adults. Most {{of their life}} in these stages is spent underground, but adults have wings and {{disperse}} in the breeding season. They <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> diet; some species are vegetarian, mainly feeding on roots, others are omnivores, including worms and grubs in their diet, while a few are largely predatory. Male mole crickets have an exceptionally loud song; they sing from a subsurface burrow that opens out into {{the air in the}} shape of an exponential horn. The song is an almost pure tone, modulated into chirps. It is used to attract females, either for mating, or for indicating favourable habitats for them to lay their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Organisms <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{ability to}} {{synthesize}} the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven non{{essential amino acids}}, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts. All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis depends on {{the formation of the}} appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.|$|E
5|$|Organisms <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{ability to}} take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA {{interference}} can be both systemic and heritable in plants and C. elegans, although not in Drosophila or mammals. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through plasmodesmata (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs {{tend to be more}} divergent in sequence and induce translational repression. This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA's polyadenine tail.|$|E

50|$|Jezails were {{generally}} handmade weapons, and consequently they widely <b>varied</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> construction. Jezails {{were seen as}} very personal weapons, and unlike the typical military weapons of the time which were very plain and utilitarian, jezails tended to be well crafted and were usually intricately decorated.|$|R
5|$|Players {{choose a}} course, a car, a {{transmission}} (automatic or six-speed manual), and a song. The cars <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> specifications: some {{have a high}} top speed, others excel at acceleration or turning, and others present a balance. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. The racetrack can be observed from the first-person perspective or, for the PlayStation version, from the third-person perspective. Namco's NeGcon controller {{can be used to}} play. Because the game is an arcade-style racing game, collisions do no damage, and merely slow the player down. There is a time limit, which ends the race if counted down to zero.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Cultivars <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> yield and the {{ultimate}} size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates. The UK's National Fruit Collection, which {{is the responsibility of}} the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000 cultivars of apple tree in Kent. The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection. The University of Reading's work is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are 38 countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work group.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came {{for the company to}} develop a new broiler, it turned to its {{equipment}} manufacturer, Nieco, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Duke Manufacturing. Burger King's goal was to maintain the company's trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform. The solutions that Nieco and Duke devised met that goal by using control features during cooking. The cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies <b>vary</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> methods; Nieco employed two chains, one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature, and another that had a flexible speed setting and variable temperature control. Duke's solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature, one heterogeneous product batch at a time. The first batch-style broiler was introduced in April 1999 and was tested in-store in central Wisconsin during the summer of 1999.|$|E
50|$|Pacifists {{rejected}} the LEP's notion of collective security and nationalists {{rejected the}} idea of America submitting to arbitration. The LEP's founders, on the other hand, though <b>varied</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> outlooks, expressed a long established ideal of the civilizing influence of the British Empire and American democracy.|$|R
