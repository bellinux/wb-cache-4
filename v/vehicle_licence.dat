25|$|Motor car {{licences}} {{issued in}} the United Kingdom distinguish between automatic and manual transmission vehicles, {{depending on whether}} or not a driving test was passed in a vehicle with manual transmission (unless a vehicle test was taken in the UK before such distinction was made). While a manual transmission <b>vehicle</b> <b>licence</b> permits the holder to drive a vehicle of either kind, an automatic transmission <b>vehicle</b> <b>licence</b> is solely for vehicles with automatic transmission. The licence also shows whether a driver requires glasses or contact lenses to meet the legal driving requirements, if known.|$|E
25|$|As a way {{of further}} {{promoting}} the island's new accessibility, the province issued <b>vehicle</b> <b>licence</b> plates from 1997 to 2006 that featured a likeness of the Confederation Bridge between the serial number.

25|$|<b>Vehicle</b> <b>licence</b> {{plates in}} Singapore {{are the same}} 520mm x 110mm size found in many European countries. Red licence plates {{indicate}} that the car may be driven only during off-peak times unless a daily fee is paid. Off peak times are from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. on weekdays and all day on Saturdays and Sundays. Since the end of January 2010, off-peak car usage is no longer restricted on Saturday, Sunday, and the days before public holidays. Off-peak licence plates cost less than regular ones. Standard licence plates in Singapore are usually black with silver or white lettering or the newer white front/yellow rear plate combination and Off-peak licence plates are white on red.|$|E
25|$|Scotland's bus network, {{like that}} of Great Britain outside London, is {{deregulated}} following an act of UK Parliament in 1986. This broke up the former national and city bus companies, formerly run by the local authorities since the 1930s, into private companies. The act also allowed buses to be operated by private companies and individuals for profit, provided they met the financial, background and maintenance requirements {{to qualify for a}} licence, set down by VOSA who administrate the system. A Public Service <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Licence</b> is then granted to allow a specified number of vehicles to be operated. Using this licence firms can then register their routes with the Local Traffic Commissioner for the area, in this case Scotland, indicating the exact route to be operated as well as the times and dates their buses will run. No requirements are set as to when and what routes buses can run, their age and what fares can be charged-this is decided by companies, often by the profitability of the route. Currently only one bus company, Lothian Buses in Edinburgh, remains under ownership and control of local councils in Lothian and Edinburgh.|$|E
500|$|UNCRO was criticised {{for several}} reasons. The Secretary-General's Report to the Council {{described}} {{the failures of}} UNPROFOR, but the new mission did not address them. There were insufficient troops, having been reduced from UNPROFOR levels by the new mission mandate, and inadequate human and material resources {{to carry out the}} mission tasks. As a result, fulfilment of the mission mandate was nearly impossible. While Croatian sources said that the [...] mission name was the only real difference from UNPROFOR, the RSK authorities were not satisfied with the UNCRO mission. Specifically, the RSK objected to the deployment of UNCRO troops along the international borders and to the mission name. Conversely, Croats were pleased that the mission acronym appeared to be an abbreviation of Croatia. In response, Czech UNCRO troops used <b>vehicle</b> <b>licence</b> plates bearing the new mission's acronym when operating in HV-controlled territory and UNPROFOR plates in areas held by the ARSK due to safety concerns.|$|E

2500|$|Vehicle Excise Duty, also {{commonly}} known as 'VED', 'vehicle tax', 'car tax' and 'road tax', is a vehicle road use tax levied as an excise duty which must be paid for most types of vehicle which are to be used (or parked) on the public roads in the United Kingdom. Motor vehicles used on public roads {{no longer need to}} display a current <b>vehicle</b> <b>licence</b> (tax disc) as proof of payment which will not be issued without prior proof that the vehicle has valid MOT and insurance.

2500|$|On 22 December 2014 a bin lorry {{collided}} with pedestrians {{in the city}} centre of Glasgow, Scotland, killing six and injuring fifteen others. The driver of the council-owned vehicle, Harry Clarke, said he had passed out at the wheel. A similar blackout {{had happened to him}} in the driving seat of a bus, although he had not disclosed the incident on his heavy goods <b>vehicle</b> <b>licence</b> renewal [...] application, despite such self-reporting being mandatory. Clarke was officially told he would not face further prosecution, effectively giving him immunity over the deaths and causing protests from victims' families at the way the case had been handled. In October 2015 it was reported that Clarke had been arrested on suspicion of driving without a licence in September 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} launch human rights {{watchdog}} Privacy International sent a formal complaint about {{the service to}} the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which cited more than 200 reports {{from members of the}} public who were identifiable on Street View images. Privacy International director Simon Davies said that the organization had filed the complaint due to the [...] "clear embarrassment and damage" [...] Street View had caused to many Britons. He said that Street View fell short of the assurances given by Google to the ICO in July 2008 that had enabled its launch, namely that privacy would be protected by blurring faces and <b>vehicle</b> <b>licence</b> plates, and asked for the system to be [...] "switched off" [...] while an investigation was completed. He said the few cases where Google's face blurring system had failed meant the data used by Street View would fall under UK Data Protection legislation, which requires that subjects give permission for the use of information concerning them.|$|E
