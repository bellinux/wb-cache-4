We focused on a new rotary compressor equipped with a mechanism to restrict the rolling motion of the piston, and performed the dynamics analysis. The new rotary compressor has a small pillar {{at the tip of}} the vane and constitutes a turning pair of vane and piston, and it limits the rolling motion of the piston. By means of limiting the piston rotation, the heat transfer to the suction process from the compression chamber will be suppressed, and we can expect higher compression efficiency.

Also, the belt set now confines the pressure and speed-squared forces like a pressure vessel and the potential speed of operation is very much higher. The result of all this is to raise both the operating pressure and the operating speed and this amounts to a 10 times increase in hydraulic packaging density and similar decrease in weight per unit power.|$|R

50|$|Discharge {{cavitation}} {{occurs when}} the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes {{the majority of the}} fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a venturi), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller <b>vane</b> <b>tips</b> and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.|$|R

In this paper, the friction torque characteristics of the balanced vane pump, especially the friction torque caused by the friction between a camcon-tour and vane tips are both experimentally and theoretically investigated. Although the friction force increaseswith vane thickness increasedue to increase in the vane force, themechanical effi-ciency of the vane pumpdoes not decreasewhen the cam lift becomes large as the vane thickness is increased. An important parameter 1 defined as the ratio to be obtained by dividing the cam lift by the vane thickness determines essentially the mechanical efficiency of the vane pump. The pumps with the same 1 have the same mechanical efficiencies, even if the cam lift or the vane thickness varies.
