40|$|Abstract- Brazing {{generally}} require cumbersome apparatus be it <b>induction,</b> <b>vacuum</b> or torch brazing. In torch brazing, metals {{are joined}} by using the oxyacetylene cylinder.

And thus Brazing was done by usual Shielded Metal Arc Welding, by developing the electrode composition for the joining process of three different kinds of metals and alloys, without using the oxyacetylene cylinder and other heavy brazing apparatus. The results show that this newly developed brazing method gave almost same appropriate welding results as it is given by the conventional brazing method.

In the present study, thermodynamic and kinetics of phosphorus evaporating from silicon melt has been investigated. Due to the phosphorus concentration in metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) being around 100 ppmw level, we believe that phosphorus vaporizes from silicon as gas species P and P- 2 in the vacuum refining process. A numerical model has been developed for phosphorus separation by IVR, and the mass transfer coefficients for three possible rate limiting steps are developed. Experiments have been carried out to verify the IVR model. Such key factors as vacuum pressure, temperature, and melt geometry have been investigated by comparing the experimental data with simulation curve. The effect of vacuum pressure on phosphorus removal can be divided in three regions: independent region, sensitive region, and inert region. Temperature shows nonlinear relationship with phosphorus evaporation. The melt geometry is defined as ratio of diameter to height of melt (d/h) and it is favorable to set d/h at around 4. The numerical results agree well with experimental data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The alloy systems studied are Ti 3 Al 2 V, Ti 5 Fe and Ti 3. 2 Fe 1 Cr 0. 6 Ni 0. 1 Mo (Ti 5 SS). The alloy mixtures were produced by blending Ti HDH powders with Al 40 V, 316 SS master alloy powders or elemental Fe powder. The blended powders were further consolidated using various methods: high <b>vacuum</b> sintering (HVS), <b>induction</b> sintering (IS), powder compact forging (PCF) and powder compact extrusion (PCE).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} obstetric {{practices}} of family physicians who attended fewer than 25 births per year (low-volume) with {{the practices of}} family physicians who attended more than 25 births per year (high-volume) and the practices of obstetricians. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using data from administrative databases. SETTING: Alberta. PARTICIPANTS: All physicians who provided intrapartum care between April 1, 1997, and March 31, 2000. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of delivery, size of hospitals where deliveries took place, characteristics of patients, and number of medical interventions. RESULTS: Of 1026 family physicians, 543 (53 %) were low-volume providers of intrapartum care. In 1997 - 1998, low-volume family physicians (LVFPs) attended 24 % of all vaginal and cesarean births attended by family physicians; by 1998 - 1999, that percentage had decreased to 9 %; and by 1999 - 2000, to 5 %. In contrast, the number of births attended by all family physicians remained relatively constant at 43 % during the 3 years. In hospitals that had fewer than 50 deliveries a year, LVFPs attended almost half the births. Although LVFPs did fewer medical <b>inductions,</b> <b>vacuum</b> extractions, and epidural anesthetics and more forceps extractions, episiotomies, and cesarean sections than high-volume family physicians (HVFPs), the differences between their practices were {{much smaller than the}} differences between all family physicians' practices and the practices of obstetricians (who treat higher-risk mothers and newborns).

Clean metal spray forming (CMSF) combines the electroslag refining process, cold walled induction guide and gas atomised spray forming.

5000|$|The {{process was}} invented in Hanau, Germany in 1917. Heraeus Vacuumschmelze and Dr. Wilhelm Rohn applied for a patent on vacuum melting on 12 January 1918 and were granted a German patent DE 345161. [...] E.F. Northrup built the first {{prototype}} of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>induction</b> furnace in the United States of America in 1920. Medium frequency furnaces were seen soon afterwards in England and Sweden in 1927. The process was initially developed to refine certain special metals such as cobalt and nickel. As these metals and alloys became more common, the process of VIM became more widely used. VIM now helps to melt a variety of metals for aircraft and nuclear applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{smelting}} metals {{in a vacuum}} is based on early development work carried out by Heraeus. The first vacuum furnaces came into use before the First World War. They were used to make alloys in the total absence of air. The first <b>vacuum</b> <b>induction</b> furnace was developed in 1917. Heraeus Vacuum Smelting started operations as an independent company in 1923, producing a variety of base metal alloys for use in electrics. The company owned 84 German patents between 1923 and 1933, resulting in 101 foreign registrations. Due to the increasingly high cost of investment and the different nature of {{this area of the}} business compared {{to the rest of the}} company, Heraeus sold its Vacuum Smelting business to Siemens (now SMS-MEVAC) in 1933. The Ruhrstahl-Heraeus process for vacuum degassing of steel was also a Heraeus innovation.|$|E
50|$|Most {{grades of}} steel are melted once and are then cast or teemed into a solid form prior to {{extensive}} forging or rolling to a metallurgically sound form. In contrast, VIM-VAR steels go through two more highly purifying melts under vacuum. After melting in an {{electric arc furnace}} and alloying in an argon oxygen decarburization vessel, steels destined for vacuum remelting are cast into ingot molds. The solidified ingots then head for a <b>vacuum</b> <b>induction</b> melting furnace. This vacuum remelting process rids the steel of inclusions and unwanted gases while optimizing the chemical composition. The VIM operation returns these solid ingots to the molten state in the contaminant-free void of a vacuum. This tightly controlled melt often requires up to 24 hours. Still enveloped by the vacuum, the hot metal flows from the VIM furnace crucible into giant electrode molds. A typical electrode stands about 15 feet (5 m) tall and will be in various diameters. The electrodes solidify under vacuum.|$|E
50|$|The {{electroslag}} remelting (ESR) {{process is}} used to remelt and refine steels and various super-alloys, resulting in high-quality ingots. This process can be started up through <b>vacuum</b> <b>induction</b> melting. The ESR process uses the as-cast alloy as a consumable electrode. Electric current (generally AC) is passed between the electrode and the new ingot, which is formed {{in the bottom of}} a water-cooled copper mold. The new ingot is covered in an engineered slag that is superheated by the electric current. The electrode tip is slowly melted from contact with the slag. These metal droplets travel through the slag to the bottom of the water-cooled mold and slowly freeze as the ingot is directionally solidified upwards from the bottom of the mold. The slag pool floats above the refined alloy, continuously floating upwards as the alloy solidifies. The molten metal is cleaned of impurities that chemically react with the slag or otherwise float to the top of the molten pool as the molten droplets pass through the slag.|$|E
5000|$|The alloy {{to undergo}} VAR is formed into a {{cylinder}} typically by <b>vacuum</b> <b>induction</b> melting (VIM) or ladle refining (airmelt). This cylinder, {{referred to as}} an electrode is then put into a large cylindrical enclosed crucible and brought to a metallurgical vacuum (...) [...] At {{the bottom of the}} crucible is a small amount of the alloy to be remelted, which the top electrode is brought close to prior to starting the melt. Several kiloamperes of DC current are used to start an arc between the two pieces, and from there, a continuous melt is derived. The crucible (typically made of copper) is surrounded by a water jacket used to cool the melt and control the solidification rate. To prevent arcing between the electrode and the crucible side walls, the diameter of the crucible is larger than that of the electrode. As a result, the electrode must be lowered as the melt consumes it. Control of the current, cooling water, and electrode gap is essential to effective control of the process, and production of defect free material.|$|E
