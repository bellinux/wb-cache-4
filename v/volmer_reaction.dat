40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{and the data}} of kinetic parameters given in literature for the chlorine evolution on various types of Ru 02 /Ti 02 electrodes are discussed. Moreover, some new experimental results are given. It has been concluded that the chlorine evolution on this type of electrode occurs according to the Volmer— Heyrowsky mechanism, where the <b>Volmer</b> <b>reaction</b> is in quasi equilibrium and the Heyrowsky reaction and eventually the diffusion of molecular chlorine away from the electrode surface into {{the bulk of the}} solution determine the potential— current density relation...|$|E
40|$|Many organic {{compounds}} contain acidic and/or basic groups that dictate their physical, chemical, and biological properties. For this reason, the acid dissociation constant, Ka, a quantitative measure of acid strength in solution, is a fundamentally important parameter in organic (synthetic) chemistry and related fields. In this study, the thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanisms of the proton reduction (hydrogen evolution) reaction at a platinum electrode {{have been investigated}} in the room temperature ionic liquid (IL) 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide, using a range of nitrogen (RxNH) acids as the proton source. The formal potential of the H+solvated/H 2 process (simulated by combining the classical <b>Volmer</b> and Tafel <b>reactions)</b> {{has been shown to}} be strongly dependent on the identity of the IL anion, making direct comparison of pKa data between ILs with different constituent anions impossible. Hydrogen evolution from weak nitrogen acids (protonated amines or sulfonamides) as the proton source is a diffusion controlled process which occurs in the potential region negative of the H+solvated/H 2 process. Simulations reveal that weak acid dissociation is limiting on the voltammetric time scale when pKa > 4, meaning proton reduction via a CE mechanism (where &# 8220;C&# 8221; is the acid dissociation step) cannot account for the experimentally observed mass-transport-limited currents. Under these conditions, proton reduction must proceed via an alternate pathway, where the weak acid undergoes direct reduction at the platinum electrode surface. Finally, the pKa values for 10 weak nitrogen acids have been calculated (5. 2 &# 8804; pKa &# 8804; 19. 5) from voltammetrically derived reversible half-wave potentials (E 1 / 2) and diffusion coefficients (D), highlighting the utility of voltammetry as a convenient and relatively straightforward method for quantifying equilibrium acidity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{hydrogen}} electrode on an interface platinum/dimethyl sulphoxide + 0. 5 M KClO 4 solution was examined {{from both the}} thermodynamic and kinetic aspect, using HCl as a proton source. The equilibrium potential was shown to obey a Nernstian dependence on concentration. The voltammograms recorded using a rotating platinum disc electrode evidenced that the cathodic evolution of hydrogen proceeds under mixed, activation–diffusion control. The diffusion coefficient of the proton was determined to amount to 4. 5 � 10 - 6 cm 2 s- 1. In the region of activation control, a Tafel slope of about 0. 110 V dec- 1 was estimated, which indicates that the <b>Volmer</b> <b>reaction</b> is the rate determining step...|$|E

Then the hydrogen evolution reactions at the electrodes were investigated by measuring the potential decay immediately after the interruption of an applied cathodic urrent. The reactions were found to proceed by the Volmer-Tafel mechanism. The total overvoltage (~) was divided into two components (~ 1 and ~=) corresponding to the Tafel and Volmer reactions. The exchange current densities of the elementary reactions, i 0 v and i 0 T, were then evaluated by extrapolating the Tafel lines for ~ and "q 2. The <b>Volmer</b> <b>reaction</b> is much more accelerated by surface modification with RuO 2 or Co 304 powder than the Tafel reaction, which results in the enrichment of adsorbed hydrogen, leading to higher charging efficiency. Particular attention has recently been drawn to nickel-hydride batteries using hydrogen storage alloys as the neg-ative electrode material. Batteries of this kind are charac-terized by several advantages over the conventional nickel-cadmium batteries, e. g., high energy density, high-rate capability, tolerance to overcharge and overdischarge, freedom from poisonous heavy metals, and no consumption of the electrolyte during charge-discharge cycles. 1 ' = The Volmer-Tafel mechanism and the Volmer-Heyrovsky mech-anism are well known for the hydrogen evolution reaction H~O + e [...] -> H(a) + OH- (<b>Volmer</b> <b>reaction)</b> [1] 2 H(a) [...] > Ha (Tafel reaction) [2] H(a) + H 20 + e [...] -+ H~. + OH- (Heyrovsky reaction) [3...|$|E
30|$|Under {{a special}} set of conditions, when the <b>Volmer</b> <b>{{reaction}}</b> is the rate-determining step of HER, a slop of ca. 120  mV dec− 1 should result, while a rate-determining Heyrovsky of Tafel reaction should produce slope of ca. 30 and 40  mV dec− 1, respectively [52, 53]. In this work, {{it seems that}} free energy barrier of discharge step is reduced to be comparable {{with that of the}} following desorption or combination step, resulting in the slope of 43  mV dec− 1 for vertical 1 T-WS 2 nanosheets. Meanwhile, the key step in HER is the adsorption of the proton on the active site. To asses this, we have varied the pH, as shown in Additional file  1 : Figure S 6. We found that the vertical 1 T-WS 2 nanosheets are active over a wide range of pH although the activity decreases when increasing the pH from 0 to 7, which results from the strong diminution of the quantity of protons available.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of hydrogen oxidation on a platinum-loaded gas-diffusion electrode has been investigated. Experimental potential–current curves, {{especially in the}} low overpotential range, have been measured for H 2 –N 2 mixtures with a small content of hydrogen and for pure H 2. Theoretical relations have also been presented. Comparing the experimental and theoretical relations, it is concluded that the hydrogen oxidation occurs according to the Volmer–Tafel mechanism. The reactivity of the electrode has a large effect on the kinetic parameters for hydrogen oxidation. The limiting current is determined by diffusion of hydrogen for a very reactive gas diffusion electrode and by the Tafel reaction for a gas diffusion electrode with a low reactivity. The transfer coefficient for the <b>Volmer</b> <b>reaction</b> V is 0. 5 and i 0,V/i 0,T 0. 1 for a very reactive gas diffusion electrode.

Over a temperature range of 293 to 3600 K the first order rate con-stants for Hz-Dz exchange and hydrogen molecule electrochemical oxidation are the same, showing that the adsorption-dissociation reaction (T AFEL,BoNHOEFFER-F ARKAS) is rate controlling.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of temperature, {{solution}} pH, and hydrogen pressure on the kinetics of the hydrogen electrode reaction (HER) on copper in borate buffer solution have been studied by means of steady-state polarization measurements, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In order to obtain electrokinetic parameters, such as the exchange current density and the cathodic Tafel slope, two stages of optimization have been performed. From the optimization process, the activation energy (Eac) of the HER on copper was obtained as ≈ 32 kJ mol− 1. Moreover, the mechanism of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on copper in mildly alkaline media has been studied by means of EIS over the frequency range of 0. 01 Hz ≤ f ≤ 5 kHz. The impedance spectra were modeled using a mechanism based upon the Volmer-Heyrovsky-Tafel steps for hydrogen evolution and by considering the reactions involved in hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group adsorption on the copper surface. A single set of kinetic parameters, including the rate constants and transfer coefficient, has been derived for each pH by optimization of the mechanistic model on the experimental impedance (eis) data.

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} evolution reaction at a platinum electrode and proton transport using bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (H[NTf 2]) as the proton source {{has been}} investigated in six aprotic [NTf 2] ionic liquids (ILs), a protic [NTf 2] IL, propylene carbonate, and water. Proton reduction to form hydrogen in ILs is highly sensitive to the surface state of the platinum electrode, requiring oxidative preconditioning at 2 V versus Fc/Fc+ (Fc = ferrocene) to activate the electrode and achieve reproducible voltammetry. The {{hydrogen evolution reaction}} at a preconditioned electrode in ILs has been simulated by combining the classical Volmer, H+ + e- H&# 8727; (E 10,ks, 1, 1), and Heyrovsky reactions, H+ + H&# 8727; + e- &# 0338; H 2 (E 20,ks, 2, 2), where E 0, ks, and are the standard potential, standard heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant, and charge transfer coefficient, respectively. The <b>Volmer</b> <b>reaction</b> is the rate-determining step on platinum in IL media and the formal potential of the H+/H 2 process is insensitive to {{the identity of the}} IL cation, lying at approximately 30 mV with respect to the Fc/Fc+ process. Proton transport in the ILs investigated obeys the Stokes-Einstein equation. Furthermore, the proton diffusion coefficient (measured electrochemically) is essentially identical to the self-diffusion coefficient of [NTf 2]&# 8727; (measured with pulsed field gradient spin-echo NMR), indicating that the protons are transported as undissociated H[NTf 2]. The Stokes radius of H[NTf 2] is estimated to be 3. 24 &# 0197; from the slope of a Stokes-Einstein plot, in agreement with the literature. Proton transport in propylene carbonate follows the same Stokesian relationship, implying that H[NTf 2] also is not dissociated in this molecular solvent. Finally, proton transport in water follows the well-established Grotthuss mechanism, as expected. Although we have shown that there is no Grotthuss-like proton conduction mechanism operating in the investigated ILs, this work lays the foundation for further studies on proton reduction, activity, and transport in this class of solvent. Ultimately, the goal is to develop an IL formulation which facilitates facile anhydrous proton conduction over a wide temperature range...|$|E
40|$|In polymer {{electrolyte}} {{fuel cells}} (PEFC) chemical energy, in for example hydrogen, is converted by an electrochemical process into electrical energy. The PEFC has a working temperature generally below 100  °C. Under these conditions water management and transport of oxygen to the cathode are the parameters limiting {{the performance of}} the PEFC. The purpose of this thesis was to better understand the complex processes {{in different parts of the}} PEFC. The rate-limiting processes in the cathode were studied using pure oxygen while varying oxygen pressure and humidity. Mass-transport limitations in the gas diffusion layer using oxygen diluted in nitrogen or helium was also studied. A large capacitive loop was seen at 1 - 10 Hz with 5 - 20  % oxygen. When nitrogen was changed to helium, which has a higher binary diffusion coefficient, the loop decreased and shifted to a higher frequency. Steady-state and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) models have been developed that accounts for water transport in the membrane and the influence of water on the anode. Due to water drag, the membrane resistance changes with current density. This gives rise to a low frequency loop in the complex plane plot. The loop appeared at a frequency of around 0. 1 Hz and varied with D/Lm 2, where D is the water diffusion coefficient and Lm is the membrane thickness. The EIS model for the hydrogen electrode gave three to four semicircles in the complex plane plot when taking the influence of water concentration on the anode conductivity and kinetics into account. The high-frequency semicircle is attributed to the <b>Volmer</b> <b>reaction,</b> the medium-frequency semicircle to the pseudocapacitance resulting from the adsorbed hydrogen, and the low-frequency semicircles to variations in electrode performance with water concentration. These low-frequency semicircles appear in a frequency range overlapping with the low-frequency semicircles from the water transport in the membrane. The effects of current density and membrane thickness were studied experimentally. An expected shift in frequency, when varying the membrane thickness was seen. This shift confirms the theory that the low-frequency loop is connected to the water transport in the membrane. QC 20121011 </p...|$|E
