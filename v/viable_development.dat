50|$|According to Habermann and De Fontgalland, the {{difficulties}} in {{the adoption of a}} <b>viable</b> <b>development</b> communication policy have to be simultaneously analyzed horizontally and vertically. Horizontally government agencies, semi-governmental offices (e.g., rural extension service), independent development organizations and private media outlets must coordinate policy. Vertically, information must flow in both directions between the population base and decision-making bodies. This involves local and supra-local administrations that are active in handing out directives and reporting back to the government. Commonly, default policies do not encourage/require such institutions to feed information from the populace to policymakers, with the exception of government extension bureaus.|$|E

Built {{to the north of}} the main town centre, the works had need to build locally accessible housing and services for the workers. The development of the railway village was on the lines of similar Victorian-era socially-encompassing lifestyle concepts, such as that at Bournville, but architect/builder Rigby's were given license to create a commercially <b>viable</b> <b>development</b> by the GWR.

50|$|This Coolibah {{tree was}} marked on 27 September 1876 to record camp 88 of William Oswald Hodgkinson's government-sponsored North-West Expedition {{in search of}} {{unexplored}} pastoral country in far western Queensland.

Due to Hodgkinson's efforts valuable pastoral lands were opened, leading to the <b>viable</b> <b>development</b> of far western Queensland. Hodgkinson's Marked Tree is symbolic of the nature and pattern of exploration of the Australian interior in the mid 19th century and is important surviving evidence of this principal theme in Queensland's history.|$|E
50|$|Because New Preston's steep, rocky terrain {{presents}} significant constraints to development, most <b>viable</b> <b>development</b> {{sites were}} utilized prior to 1900, making contemporary {{construction of new}} homes and businesses rare. As a consequence, New Preston exhibits {{a high degree of}} architectural and aesthetic cohesion. When new construction does occur, it generally follows—or attempts to follow—the historic vernacular. Portions of New Preston Hill Road and Findlay Road, three quarters of a mile west of the village center, are included in the New Preston Hill Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The more prominent buildings in that district include Hill Congregational Church, Rev. Samuel Whittlesey House (1808), and John Ferris House (1800).|$|E

Music venues and clubs appeared on both the East Bank and West Bank, though, {{as evidenced by the}} decline of the East Bank in the late 90s, the latter side of the river proved to be the more commercially <b>viable</b> <b>development.</b> A combination of factors, including compliance issues with city health and fire code and an elevated crime rate, coupled with the rise of the Warehouse District proved to be the demise of much of the entertainment district. Private developers such as Scott Wolstein and the now defunct Flats Oxbow Association have helped plan and redevelop the Flats through housing developments, which include new construction as well as renovated warehouse spaces, {{on both sides of the}} river.|$|E

50|$|Various {{possibilities}} {{for the future of}} the building had been explored with advisers including a public marketing campaign in March 2003. The complexity of dealing with the protected status of the building and the grounds affected the value and the terms on which the property could be sold. An application for the review of the listing was made in November 2004. This caused concern that it might lead to the demolition of the building. In the event however it resulted in a small but very important relaxation of the listing in respect of the administration wing of the building, which, when combined with a relaxation of use in relation to the frontage, meant that for the first time a <b>viable</b> <b>development</b> of the whole site could be envisaged. After creating a development plan that was favourably received by the local authority, the company finally achieved a sale in 2007, following which The Commonwealth Education Trust was formed as a successor charity, and The Commonwealth Institute was put into liquidation.|$|E
