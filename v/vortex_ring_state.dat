The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E

25|$|On 6 December 2002, {{the first}} ground {{tests of the}} BA609 {{prototype}} began, and the first flight took place on 6 March 2003 in Arlington, Texas, flown by test pilots Roy Hopkins and Dwayne Williams. After 14 hours of helicopter-mode flight testing, the prototype was moved to a ground testing rig to study the operational effects of the conversion modes. Following the completion of ground-based testing, on 3 June 2005 the prototype resumed flight testing, focusing on the expansion of its flight envelope. On 22 July 2005, the first conversion from helicopter to aeroplane mode while in flight took place. By October 2008, 365 flight-hours had been logged by two prototype aircraft. The AW609 demonstrated a safe dual-engine failure in normal cruise flight on 15 May 2009. By February 2012, this had risen to 650 hours, and {{it was reported that}} 85 percent of the AW609's flight envelope had been explored. Test pilot Paul Edwards has stated that the AW609 was not susceptible to the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> <b>state</b> phenomena, naturally slipping out of the vortex on its own since both rotors will not simultaneously enter the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we explore the existence, {{stability}} and dynamics of single and multiple <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> <b>states</b> that can arise in Bose-Einstein condensates. Earlier works have illustrated the bifurcation of such states, {{in the vicinity}} of the linear limit, for isotropic or anisotropic three-dimensional harmonic traps. Here, we extend these states to the regime of large chemical potentials, the so-called Thomas-Fermi limit, and explore their properties such as equilibrium radii and inter-ring distance, for multi-ring states, as well as their vibrational spectra and possible instabilities. In this limit, both the existence and stability characteristics can be partially traced to a particle picture that considers the rings as individual particles oscillating within the trap and interacting pairwise with one another. Finally, we examine some representative instability scenarios of the multi-ring dynamics including breakup and reconnections, as well as the transient formation of vortex lines.

40|$|A <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> is a torus-shaped vortex {{consisting}} of a region of fluid spinning around an imaginary axis line that forms a closed loop. It is an important phenomenon in animal kingdom and engineering applications. Birds and flying insects use buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> to glide higher altitudes; squid and jellyfish produce <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> during propulsion; <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> also participate in the blood flow through the human hearts. With {{the help of the}} <b>vortex</b> <b>ring,</b> animals can move fast and produce large thrust. In engineering, the Underwater Compressed Air Energy Storage (UWCAES) system uses surplus electricity to compress air into flexible accumulators (balloons) to store energy underwater. Balloons of stored compressed air may rupture when over-pressurized or pierced by a sharp object. This may generate a large-scale buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring,</b> leading to water surface disruptions and undesirable waves. As a result, it is a necessity to study the hydrodynamics of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring.</b> This work presents three papers to {{have a better understanding of}} the fluid dynamics of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring.</b> The first two papers focus on the flow behavior of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> and the third paper studies the vortex rings’ influence on the ambient fluid (flow behind a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring).</b> The first paper characterized the formation conditions of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> and its transition behavior from a laminar to a turbulent <b>vortex</b> <b>ring.</b> It is followed by a paper investigating the flow characteristics of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> experimentally, including rising velocity, ring radius, relative core size, circulation and the energy development of a buoyant <b>vortex</b> <b>ring.</b> The final paper analyzed the wake of a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> by simplifying that the core of a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> is solid.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulation (DNS) {{is used to}} study {{some aspects of the}} dynamics of <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> in viscous, incompressible ow at Reynolds numbers (defined as the ratio of the initial circulation to the kinematic viscosity) in the range of 103 to 104. Firstly, the effect of the particular initial core azimuthal vorticity profile of a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> on its subsequent evolution in unbounded ow is studied. <b>Vortex</b> <b>rings</b> {{with a wide range of}} initial core vorticity profiles are shown to relax to a common equilibrium state. Additionally the behaviour of the equilibrium <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> at large times is studied. When the slenderness ratio of the <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> increases beyond a particular limit, the <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> diverge from the common equilibrium state and follow paths determined by the viscosity of the uid. Secondly, the interaction of a laminar <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> with a non-deformable, free-slip surface at an oblique angle of incidence leading to the phenomenon of vortex reconnection is investigated. Specifically the effect of Reynolds number on the dynamics of the reconnection process is studied. The scaling of the reconnection timescale with the Reynolds number is obtained. At high Reynolds numbers the reconnection process leads to a breakdown of the entire <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> structure to a turbulent-like ow. This phenomenon is shown to be related to the mechanics of the reconnection process. Finally, the dynamics of <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> with swirl in unbounded ow is studied. Two different types of <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> with swirl were considered: i) <b>Vortex</b> <b>rings</b> with Gaussian distributions of core azimuthal vorticity and core azimuthal velocity and ii) Steady state solutions of the Euler equations for <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> with swirl.

2500|$|The {{cause was}} {{determined}} to be <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> <b>state</b> (VRS), a fundamental limitation on vertical descent which is common to helicopters.

[...] Subsequent testing has shown that the V-22, and the tiltrotor in general, is less susceptible to VRS, the conditions are easily recognized by the pilots; recovery from VRS requires a more natural action by the pilot than recovery in helicopters, the altitude loss is significantly less than for helicopters, and, with sufficient altitude ( [...] or more), VRS recovery is relatively easy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{spreading}} {{characteristics of}} acoustically excited swirling double-concentric jets were studied experimentally. The central jet was acoustically excited at {{low and high}} pulsation intensities. A smoke wire flow visualization and a hot-wire anemometer velocity measurement results show that excitation forces a <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> to roll-up {{from the edge of}} the central tube during each excitation period. At low pulsation intensities, the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> evolves downstream, and eventually breaks up into turbulent eddies. At high pulsation intensities, the primary <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> evolves and a series of trailing <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> form during the same period of excitation. The trailing <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> accelerate while evolving downstream and overtake the primary <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> within the same cycle.

40|$|We {{present a}} new model for an {{axisymmetric}} <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> confined in a tube. The model {{takes into account the}} elliptical (elongated) shape of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> core and thus extends our previous model [Danaila, Kaplanski and Sazhin, J. of Fluid Mechanics, 774, 2015] derived for <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> with quasi-circular cores. The new model offers a more accurate description of the deformation of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> core, induced by the lateral wall, and a better approximation of the translational velocity of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring,</b> compared with the previous model. The main ingredients of the model are the following: the description of the vorticity distribution in the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> is based on the previous model of unconfined elliptical-core <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> [Kaplanski, Fukumoto and Rudi, Physics of Fluids, 24, 2012]; Brasseur's approach [Brasseur, PhD Thesis, 1979] is then applied to derive a wall-induced correction for the Stokes stream function of the confined <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> flow. We derive closed formulae for the flow stream function and vorticity distribution. An asymptotic expression for the long time evolution of the drift velocity of the <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> {{as a function of the}} ellipticity parameter is also derived. The predictions of the model are shown to be in agreement with direct numerical simulations of confined <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> generated by a piston-cylinder mechanism.

50|$|Helicopter {{pilots are}} most {{commonly}} taught to avoid settling with power by monitoring their rates of descent at lower airspeeds.

However, since the condition often occurs near the ground, lowering the collective may not be an option; a loss of altitude will occur proportional to the rate of descent developed before beginning the recovery. In some cases, <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> <b>state</b> is encountered and allowed to advance {{to the point that the}} pilot may lose cyclic authority due to the disrupted airflow.
