40|$|Using {{interview}} data on LGBT young peoples’ policing experiences, I argue policing practices work to constrain public <b>visibilities</b> <b>of</b> sexual and gender diversity in public spaces. Police actions recounted by LGBT young people suggest {{the workings of}} a certain kind of visuality (Mason, 2002) and evidenced more subtle actions that sought to constrain, regulate, and punish public <b>visibilities</b> <b>of</b> sexual and gender diversity. Aligning with the work of sexualities academics and theorists, this paper suggests that, like violence is itself a bodily spectacle from which onlookers come to know things, policing works to subtly constrain public <b>visibilities</b> <b>of</b> “queerness”. Policing interactions with LGBT young people serves the purpose of visibly yet unverifiably (Mason, 2002) regulating displays of sexual and gender diversity in public spaces. The paper concludes noting how police actions are nonetheless visible and therefore make knowable to the public the importance of keeping same sex intimacy invisible in public spaces...|$|R

The <b>visibility</b> graph <b>of</b> P is a graph G obtained by representing each vertex of P by a vertex of G and two vertices of G are joined by an edge {{if and only if}} their corresponding vertices in P are visible. A graph G is a visibility graph if there exists a simple polygon P such that G is isomorphic to the <b>visibility</b> graph <b>of</b> P.

In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly asymmetrical, as a disc with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134°, and inclination of around 75°.
