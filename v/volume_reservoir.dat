The liver is indeed essential to life, not only due to its complex functions in biosynthesis, metabolism and clearance, but also its dramatic role as the blood <b>volume</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Among parenchymal organs, blood flow to the liver is unique due to the dual supply from the portal vein and the hepatic artery.

A central mechanism that controls and allows constancy of hepatic blood flow is the hepatic arterial buffer response. The current paper reviews the relevance of this intimate hepatic blood flow regulatory system in health and disease.

40|$|Utilizing {{geometry}} based static {{phase separation}} {{exhibited in the}} radial vaned capillary drying tray, a system was conceived to recover water from brine. This technology has been named the Capillary BRIC; abbreviated CapiBRIC. The CapiBRIC utilizes a capillary drying tray within a drying chamber. Water is recovered from clean water vapor evaporating from the free surface leaving waste brine solids behind. A novel approach of optimizing the containment geometry to support passive capillary flow and static phase separation provides {{the opportunity for a}} low power system that is not as susceptible to fouling as membranes or other technologies employing physical barriers across the free brine surface to achieve phase separation in microgravity. Having been optimized for operation in microgravity, full-scale testing of the CapiBRIC as designed cannot be performed on the ground as the force of gravity would dominate over the capillary forces. However, subscale units relevant to full-scale design were used to characterize fill rates, containment stability, and interaction with a variable <b>volume</b> <b>reservoir</b> in the PSU Dryden Drop Tower (DDT) facility.

40|$|The Macroscopic Chemistry Method is a {{technique}} for modelling chemical reactions in the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The approach differs from conventional DSMC chemistry methods in that {{the change in the}} number of each species over a time-step is calculated from the overall macroscopic cell parameters, rather than on a collision pair basis. The Macroscopic Chemistry Method (MCM) can be applied in flows where the collision rate is highly non-equilibrium and has previously been applied to model Dissociation-recombination reactions of a symmetrical diatomic gas. Here we propose a procedure for applying MCM to a multiple species reaction set which includes exchange reactions, as well as a method by which trace species can be modelled without the need for variable weighting factors. The procedure is tested in constant <b>volume</b> <b>reservoir</b> relaxation simulations of a high temperature gas and quasi-one-dimensional expansion of a high speed, high temperature gas. Initial compositions are chosen to resemble Earth and Martian atmosphere reacting systems. For the reservoir relaxation simulations, comparisons of the species mole fractions and overall temperature predicted by MCM are made with numerical integration of the reaction rate equations. For the one-dimensional expansion, results using the trace species algorithm are compared with a simulation without the trace species algorithm but with a much larger number of simulator particles. The reaction set consists of 54 chemical reactions (40 dissociation and 14 exchange reactions) amongst 8 species. The trace species algorithm exactly reproduces the temperature history predicted by numerical integration for the reservoir simulation. Without the trace species algorithm, the errors in the mole fractions are proportional to the inverse of the number of simulator particles used. For both the reservoir and expansion flow simulations, the trace species algorithm gives an improvement in accuracy equivalent to using 100 times the number of simulator particles...|$|E

40|$|Short-term {{operation}} {{policy for}} multipurpose reservoirs {{can be derived}} from an optimization model with the objective of minimizing short-term losses (opportunity costs). Construction of such loss functions requires the definition of target values for the decision variables, assessment of reliabilities with which inflows can be predicted, and an explicit statement of operational objectives. Formulation and evaluation of a model is complicated by the uncertainties inherent in the prediction of future streamflows and by controversies about the criteria of evaluation. We discuss these issues and illustrate some of our arguments with simple numerical experiments. A series of synthetic short-term forecasted values (which satisfy a specified distribution of forecast errors) is used to examine operation of a single reservoir. The quality of forecasted values is represented by the mean and variance of these errors or the coefficient of prediction (Cp). The objective function of the operation model is assumed to be the best possible tradeoff between probable deviations from two operation targets: release and storage <b>volume.</b> <b>Reservoir</b> release was effected according to the solution of the optimization model conditioned upon the forecasted streamflow volumes for a given time increment. The storage volume was then corrected to reflect actual streamflow for the forecasted period. This became the initial storage for the next forecast period.

Global left ventricular function and the venous reservoir were assessed by a Vevo 2100 in 20 female C 57 BL/ 6 N. LA and LAA were also studied in 10 CD- 1 and 10 FVB mice, whereas modifications investigated in 15 C 57 BL/ 6 N subjected to coronary artery ligation. Left ventricle function was evaluated as well as pulsed Doppler mitral valve, pulmonary vein, and LAA velocities. From 2 D view monoplane LA volumes were obtained and LAA long axis measured. Macroscopic inspection with casts and immunohistochemistry were performed. Results show that compared to humans, in C 57 BL/ 6 N mice left atrium was disproportionately smaller (5. 2 ± 1. 4 μL) than the left ventricle (53 ± 8 μL) and connected through a duct by a large LAA and posteriorly to three pulmonary veins. The LA volume increased 2 -fold during reservoir with two distinct phases, early and late divided by a short pause. LAA long axis (4. 1 ± 0. 5 mm) was almost 2 times longer than the LA. LAA flow volume together with LA <b>volume</b> <b>reservoir</b> account for about 36 % of stroke volume and the rest was provided by conduit flow.

A key challenge in this arena is the monitoring and verification (M&V) of CO 2 plumes in the deep subsurface. Towards that end, we have developed a tool that can simultaneously invert multiple sub-surface data sets to constrain the location, geometry, and saturation of subsurface CO 2 plumes. We have focused on a suite of unconventional geophysical approaches that measure changes in electrical properties (electrical resistance tomography, electromagnetic induction tomography) and bulk crustal deformation (til-meters). We had also used constraints of the geology as rendered in a shared earth model (ShEM) and of the injection (e. g., total injected CO{sub 2 }). We describe a stochastic inversion method for mapping subsurface regions where CO{sub 2 } saturation is changing. The technique combines prior information with measurements of injected CO{sub 2 } <b>volume,</b> <b>reservoir</b> deformation and electrical resistivity. Bayesian inference and a Metropolis simulation algorithm form the basis for this approach. The method can (a) jointly reconstruct disparate data types such as surface or subsurface tilt, electrical resistivity, and injected CO{sub 2 } volume measurements, (b) provide quantitative measures of the result uncertainty, (c) identify competing models when the available data are insufficient to definitively identify a single optimal model and (d) rank the alternative models based on how well they fit available data.

The stochastic inversions provide estimates of the most probable location, shape, volume of the plume and most likely CO{sub 2 } saturation. The results suggest that the method can reconstruct data with poor signal to noise ratio and use hard constraints available from many sites and applications.
