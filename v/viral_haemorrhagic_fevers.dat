50|$|ASFV is a large, icosahedral, {{double-stranded}} DNA virus with {{a linear}} genome containing at least 150 genes. The number of genes differs slightly between different isolates of the virus. ASFV has similarities {{to the other}} large DNA viruses, e.g., poxvirus, iridovirus, and mimivirus. In common with other <b>viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers,</b> the main target cells for replication are those of monocyte, macrophage lineage. Entry of the virus into the host cell is receptor-mediated, but the precise mechanism of endocytosis is presently unclear.|$|E

Climate modelling and forecasting have not yet reached the stage where confident predictions of regional changes at the level of a virus endemic area can be made. However, in the regions where pathogenic arenaviruses now circulate, significant effects are likely to include increases in surface temperature, changes in the extent and distribution of rainfall, the occurrence of extreme weather events, glacier retreat, and coastal flooding as a result of sea level rise. The possible impact of these changes on the geographical location and the incidence of arenavirus diseases and its human impact are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Crimean–Congo {{haemorrhagic}} fever (CCHF) is a severe disease {{with a case}} fatality of 2. 8 to 80 %. A patient dwelling in an endemic region for CCHF was admitted with fever preceding bleeding diathesis and pancytopenia. Despite no history of tick exposure, CCHF was highly suspected. With an oral ribavirin therapy, clinical and laboratory improvements were obtained. The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of IgM antibody to CCHF virus and positive RT-PCR. Although the main pathogenesis of CCHF infection is not elucidated yet, haemophagocytosis, a symptom rarely reported in <b>viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers,</b> was observed in this case.

40|$|The {{emerging}} and re-emerging {{diseases are}} posing a great health {{risk for the}} last few years. One such category of diseases is <b>viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> (VHFs), which have emerged in the new territories, worldwide. Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) cases, {{for the first time in}} India, were reported from Gujarat, in January 2011.

Nonetheless, with recent experience in control of epidemic diseases, and advances in basic scientific knowledge; the public health community is better prepared for these unexpected events. This review provides information to physicians on CCHF for managing outbreak, and identifies public health measures to prevent emergence and re-emergence of VHFs (including CCHF) in future. The authors suggest that though, there are a few challenging and unanswered questions, the public health preparedness still remains the key to control emerging and re-emerging diseases.

40|$|Medical {{cartography}} {{can provide}} valuable {{insights into the}} epidemiology and ecology of infectious diseases, providing a quantitative representation {{of the distribution of}} these pathogens. Such methods therefore provide a key step in informing public health policy decisions ranging from prioritising sites for further investigation to identifying targets for interventions. By increasing the resolution at which risk is defined, policymakers are provided with an increasingly informed approach for considering next steps as well as evaluating past progress. In spite of their benefits however, global maps of infectious disease are lacking in both quality and comprehensiveness. This thesis sets out to investigate the next steps for medical cartography and details the use of species distribution models in evaluating global distributions of a variety of zoonotic diseases of public health importance. Chapter 2 defines a methodology by which global targets for infectious disease mapping can be quantitatively assessed by comparing the global burden of each disease with the demand from national policymakers, non-governmental organisations and academic communities for global assessments of disease distribution. Chapter 3 introduces the use of boosted regression trees for mapping the distribution of a group of vector-borne diseases identified as being a high priority target, the leishmaniases. Chapter 4 adapts these approaches to consider Ebola virus disease. This technique shows that the West African outbreak was ecologically consistent with past infections and suggests a much wider area of risk than previously considered. Chapter 5 investigates Marburg virus disease and considers the variety of different factors relating to all aspects of the transmission cycle that must be considered in these analyses. Chapters 6 and 7 complete the mapping of the suite of <b>viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> by assessing the distribution of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever. Finally, Chapter 8 considers the risk that these <b>viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> present to the wider African continent, quantifying potential risk of spillover infections, local outbreaks and more widespread infection. This thesis addresses important information gaps in global knowledge of a number of pathogens of public health importance.

40|$|<b>Viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> (VHF) {{are caused}} by {{zoonotic}} viral infections transmitted to humans directly or by ticks or mosquitoes. The overall risk to travellers is conservatively estimated at < 1 in 1 million travel episodes to African countries where infection is present, and febrile patients returning from these countries are at least 1000 {{times more likely to}} have malaria than Lassa fever or another VHF. No cases have been reported in fellow travellers exposed to a travelling case and only one asymptomatic seroconversion (to Lassa) has been reported in over 2000 contacts following care of VHF cases in modern Western hospital settings. However, healthcare-associated transmission of infection has been a major problem in some endemic settings. The potential for healthcare-associated infection and the threats posed by unrecognised or new agents necessitate a high index of suspicion and a standardised risk assessment approach to febrile travellers.

40|$|A {{dipstick}} assay for {{the detection}} of Leptospira-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in human sera was evaluated in 27 laboratories in 23 countries. 873 serum samples from 711 patients including 329 laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis case patients, 239 noncase patients and 69 patients with viral infections causing heamorrhagic fever were tested. Relative to the results of the reference leptospirosis test, the sensitivity of the dipstick assay was 84. 5 % for serum samples collected during the first 10 days of the disease and 92. 1 % for serum samples collected 10 - 30 days after the onset of disease. The specificity was 87. 5 % and 94. 4 %, respectively. Similar to <b>viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers,</b> leptospirosis may cause bleeding. A small number of serum samples from patients with haemorrhagic viral infections gave a weak (1 +) stain. All other samples were negative.

40|$|<b>Viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> {{are caused}} by {{a wide range of}} viruses. There are 4 types of viruses well known to spread from person to person and able to cause {{nosocomial}} outbreaks with a high case fatality rate: an arenavirus (Lassa fever and more exceptionally the Junin and Machupo virus), a bunyavirus (Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever) and the Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses). So far there have been {{only a limited number of}} imported cases of viral haemorrhagic fever in industrialized countries. In recent years an increasing number of outbreaks of filovirus infections have occurred in Africa and in 2000 5 cases of Lassa fever were brought from Sierra Leone to Europe. Therefore European physicians should consider the possibility of a viral haemorrhagic fever in an acutely ill patient just returning from Africa or South-America with fever for which there is no obvious cause. Such patients should be questioned for risk factors for viral haemorrhagic fever. Using universal precautions for handling blood and body fluids and barrier nursing techniques there is little risk that if a patient with viral haemorrhagic fever arrives in Belgium there will be secondary cases...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recent {{reports have}} shown an {{expansion}} of Lassa virus from the area where it was first isolated in Nigeria {{to other areas of}} West Africa. Two Ghanaian soldiers on a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Liberia were taken ill with <b>viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> syndrome following the death of a sick colleague and were referred to a military hospital in Accra, Ghana, in May 2013. Blood samples from the soldiers and five asymptomatic close contacts were subjected to laboratory investigations. Objective: We report the results of these investigations to highlight the importance of molecular diagnostic applications and the need for heightened awareness about Lassa fever in West Africa. Methods: We used molecular assays on sera from the two patients to identify the causativeorganism. Upon detection of positive signals for Lassa virus ribonucleic material by two differentpolymerase chain reaction assays, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Results: The presence of Lassa virus in the soldiers’ blood samples was shown by L-gene segment homology to be the Macenta and las 803792 strains previously isolated in Liberia, with close relationships then confirmed by phylogenetic tree construction. The five asymptomatic close contacts were negative for Lassa virus. Conclusions: The Lassa virus strains identified in the two Ghanaian soldiers had molecular epidemiological links to strains from Liberia. Lassa virus was probably responsible for the outbreak of <b>viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> in the military camp. These data confirm Lassa fever endemicity in West Africa. </p...|$|R
