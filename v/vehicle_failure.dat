40|$|The SNAP-III {{thermoelectric}} generator procedures {{power from the}} decay heat of 2100 curies of Po/sup 210 /. This generator {{is to be used}} as a source of auxiliary power in a terrestrial satellite. For purposes of analysis, the satellite system postulated is launched from the Pacific Missile Bange into a 275 - statute mile polar orbit with an orbital lifetime of about 1 year. Po/sup 210 / is an alpha emitter having a half life of 138 days and alpha and gamma decay energies of 5. 3 and 0. 8 mev, respectively. It is a natural component of the earth's crust, as a member of the uranium disintegration series. Sampling of polonium in the biosphere was conducted specifically for this program to determine background radiation levels. Since the fuel is primarily an alpha emitter, there is no direct radiation problem. An analysis was performed to determine the ability of the fuel container to withstand the various thermal, mechanical, and chemical forces imposed upon the generator by <b>vehicle</b> <b>failures.</b> Where theoretical analysis was impossible and experimental evidence was desired, capsules and generators were tested under simulated missile-failure conditions, Thus, the safety limits of SNAP-III in a satellite application were defined. SNAP-III is designed to be aerothermodynamically consumed on reentry into the earth's atmosphere so that the polonium will be dispersed as aerosols in the upper stratosphere. Since heating rates will be lower for aborts occurring prior to orbiting, 65 abort cases have been considered to define the general consequences of <b>vehicle</b> <b>failures.</b> The spatial and temporal relations of vehicle aborts are summarized in cartographic and tabular form.

Burn-to- burn variations are managed through the identification of specific parameters that may be updated for each progressive burn. Failure triggers and automatic responses during the burn timeframe are defined to provide safety for the crew {{in the case of}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>failures,</b> along with override capabilities to ensure operational control of the vehicle.

Higher altitude failures after shroud jettison would involve detaching the entire spacecraft from the booster.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Advances in {{autonomy}} {{have made}} it possible to invert the typical operator-to-unmanned vehicle ratio so that a single operator can now control multiple heterogeneous Unmanned Vehicles (UVs). Real-time scheduling and task assignment for multiple UVs in uncertain environments will require the computational ability of optimization algorithms combined with the judgment and adaptability of human supervisors through mixed-initiative systems. The goal {{of this paper is to}} analyze the interactions between operators and scheduling algorithms in two human- in-the-loop multiple UV control experiments. The impact of real-time operator modifications to the objective function of an optimization algorithm for multi-UV scheduling is described. Results from outdoor multiple UV flight tests using a human-computer collaborative scheduling system are presented, which provide valuable insight into the impact of environmental uncertainty and <b>vehicle</b> <b>failures</b> on system effectiveness.
