50|$|The {{speed of}} radio signals in a vacuum, for example, is {{the speed of}} light, and so the <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> of a radio wave in a vacuum is unity, or 100%. In {{electrical}} cables, the <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> mainly depends on the insulating material (see table below).|$|E
50|$|The <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> (VF), {{also called}} wave {{propagation}} speed or {{velocity of propagation}} (VoP or ''''''), of a transmission medium is {{the ratio of the}} speed at which a wavefront (of an acoustic signal, for example, or an electromagnetic signal, a radio signal, a light pulse in an optical fibre or a change of the electrical voltage on a copper wire) passes through the medium, to the speed of light in a vacuum. For optical signals, the <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> is the reciprocal of the refractive index.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{a typical}} <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> for coaxial cable is [...]66, {{corresponding}} to a dielectric constant of 2.25. Suppose {{we wish to}} send a 30 MHz signal down a short section of such a cable, and delay it by a quarter wave (90°). In free space, this frequency corresponds to a wavelength of λ0=10m, so a delay of [...]25λ would require an electrical length of 2.5 m.

40|$|Relativistic {{addition}} of velocities in one dimension, though {{a mainstay of}} introductory physics, contributes much less physical insight than it could.

50|$|In {{the case}} of coaxial cable, where all of the volume in between the inner {{conductor}} and the shield is filled with a dielectric, the fill factor is unity, since the electromagnetic wave is confined to that region. In other types of cable, such as twin lead, the fill factor can be much smaller. Regardless, any cable intended for radio frequencies will have its <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> (as well as its characteristic impedance) specified by the manufacturer. In {{the case of}} coaxial cable, where F=1, the <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> is solely determined by the sort of dielectric used as specified here.|$|E

50|$|The {{ratio of}} the speed of the {{electromagnetic}} wave to the speed of light in free space is called the <b>velocity</b> <b>factor,</b> and depends on the electromagnetic properties of the conductor and the insulating materials surrounding it, and on their shape and size.|$|E
50|$|Due to the <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> of a {{particular}} transmission line, for instance, the transit time of a signal in a certain length of cable {{is equal to the}} transit time over a longer distance when travelling at the speed of light. So a pulse sent down a 2-meter section of coax (whose <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> is 2/3) would arrive {{at the end of the}} coax at the same time that the same pulse arrives at the end of a bare wire of length 3 meters (over which it propagates at the speed of light), and one might refer to the 2 meter section of coax as having an electrical length of 3 meters, or an electrical length of 1/2 wavelength at 50 MHz (since a 50 MHz radio wave has a wavelength of 6 meters).|$|E
50|$|In physics, {{particularly}} in the electromagnetic field, the propagation delay is {{the length of time}} it takes for a signal to travel to its destination.

Good isolation between adjacent traces can {{be achieved}} more easily than with microstrip.Stripline provides for enhanced noise immunity against the propagation of radiated RF emissions, {{at the expense of}} slower propagation speeds when compared to microstrip lines. The effective permittivity of striplines equals the relative permittivity of the dielectric substrate because of wave propagation only in the substrate.

50|$|When one is {{concerned}} with the number of wavelengths, or phase, involved in a wave's transit over a segment of transmission line especially, one may simply specify that electrical length, while specification of a physical length, frequency, or <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> is omitted. The electrical length is then typically expressed as N wavelengths or as the phase &phi; expressed in degrees or radians. Thus in a microstrip design one might specify a shorted stub of 60° phase length, which will correspond to different physical lengths when applied to different frequencies. Or one might consider a 2-meter section of coax which has an electrical length of one quarter wavelength (90°) at 25 MHz and ask what its electrical length becomes when the circuit is operated at a different frequency.|$|E
50|$|For example, at a {{frequency}} ν=20 MHz (free space wavelength of 15 m) in a transmission line whose <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> is 2/3, the guided wavelength (distance between voltage {{peaks of the}} forward wave alone) would be λ = 10 m. At instances when the forward wave at x = 0 is at zero phase (peak voltage) then at x = 10 m {{it would also be}} at zero phase, but at x = 5 m it would be at 180° phase (peak negative voltage). On the other hand, the magnitude of the voltage due to a standing wave produced by its addition to a reflected wave, would have a wavelength between peaks of only λ/2 = 5 m. Depending on the location of the load and phase of reflection, there might be a peak in the magnitude of Vnet at x = 1.3 m. Then there would be another peak found where |Vnet|=Vmax at x = 6.3 m, whereas it would find minima of the standing wave |Vnet| = Vmin at x = 3.8 m, 8.8 m, etc.|$|E
50|$|Another {{narrow band}} design {{is to use}} a λ/4 length of metal pipe. The coaxial cable is placed inside the pipe; at one end the braid is wired to the pipe while at the other end no {{connection}} is made to the pipe. The balanced end of this balun is at the end where no connection is made to the pipe. The λ/4 conductor acts as a transformer, converting the zero impedance at the short to the braid into an infinite impedance at the open end. This infinite impedance at the open end of the pipe prevents current flowing into the outer coax formed by the outside of the inner coax shield and the pipe, forcing the current to remain in the inside coax. This balun design is not good for low frequencies because of the long length of pipe that will be needed. An easy way to make such a balun is to paint the outside of the coax with conductive paint, then to connect this paint to the braid through a break in the outer insulation 1/4 wave from the end. For both forms (pipe or paint), the length is dependent on the <b>velocity</b> <b>factor</b> for the outer transmission line.|$|E
