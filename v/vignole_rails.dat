40|$|Nowadays urban {{vehicles}} {{have become}} more and more important in public transportation, this have lead to the development of new generations tramcars with structural configurations and design solutions (e. g. articulated bogie frames, independently rotating wheels) which can significantly improve comfort, capability and accessibility. Moreover the suburban tramways that are growing up, are often characterised by dedicated rights-of-way, equipped with <b>Vignole</b> <b>rails.</b> For these reasons a careful analysis of vehicle running safety is required, with particular respect of derailment risk, besides other topics such as riding comfort and vehicle stability and line maintenance. Maintenance of tramcar lines, actually, represents one of the major issue for urban transportation authorities. In fact, beyond their actual costs, maintenance activities may require intervention on the road yard, leading to a deep impact on urban mobility and what is more can deeply affect the comfort and the running stability of the vehicle. Thus it is important to point out the most important characteristics a line must have in terms of irregularity in order to guarantee the main running dynamics performances and safety. This work is aimed to provide an effective tool able to identify the influence of track degradation on the running safety (wheel climb) of a modern tramcar equipped with independently rotating wheels. By means of a dedicate multi-body model, tramcar dynamic behaviour in different running conditions (e. g. different curve radius, speed) can be investigated taking into account various track defects amplitude and shapes. In the paper, after {{a brief description of the}} mathematical model of the vehicle, with particular attention to the wheel/rail contact model (par. 2) as the methodology for the evaluation of the vehicle safety running behaviour (par. 3) and the obtained results are reported (par. 4) ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail</b> was a {{light section}} that today would be classed as {{flat-bottomed}} rail. In its original form it was only about 4 in deep and was used on baulk road interchangeably with bridge rail.|$|R

The most troubling issue was a swaying motion when running on the suburban <b>Vignoles</b> <b>rails.</b> The riders complained to no avail until several derailments made the management aware of the severity. A Gullfisk was test-run and {{found to have a}} much smoother ride. A horizontal suspension was added, which helped somewhat to reduce the swaying. This could only be installed on the newer MBO55 and -56 series, as MBO50 had a different bogie design. The issue was never corrected in a satisfactory way.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail</b> is {{the popular}} {{name of the}} {{flat-bottomed}} rail, recognising engineer Charles Vignoles who introduced it to Britain.Charles Vignoles observed that wear was occurring with wrought iron rails and cast iron chairs upon stone blocks, the most common system at that time. In 1836 he recommended flat-bottomed rail to the London and Croydon Railway {{for which he was}} consulting engineer.His original rail had a smaller cross-section than the Stevens rail, with a wider base than modern rail, fastened with screws through the base. Other lines which adopted it were the Hull and Selby, the Newcastle and North Shields, and the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company.|$|R

5000|$|To keep {{construction}} costs down, routes followed the terrain {{as much as}} possible, with gradients as steep as 1:22.22 (4.5%) to 1:20 (5%) compared {{to no more than}} 1:40 (2.5%) on more traditional lines, with the exception of some mountain railways. Curves could have radii of less than 30 m. The rail tracks used were very light; generally <b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail,</b> with mass being [...] depending on the distance. In many cases, lines were laid over road shoulders, which reduced the need to buy land and, above all, limited the need for new bridges and tunnels. But these measures severely limited the maximum operational speed, generally to less than 30 km/h.|$|R
5000|$|The {{line was}} built to {{standard}} gauge, 4 ft 8½ in (1,435 mm), with <b>Vignoles</b> (flat-bottom) <b>rails</b> spiked to light transverse sleepers, [...] "the whole of the line being ballasted with gravel, and, if I mistake not, a goodly bulk of sea shingle mixed therewith".|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{standard}} gauged, electrified at 600 V DC alimented by overhead line system. The first 710 m {{of the line}} operated as a street running tramway along Kondyli Coast, using the existing Piraeus Harbour tramway tracks. After this point the line was separated from road traffic, running on its own railway type right-of-way, laid with <b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail</b> tracks with a mass of 34 kg/m, thus allowing even standard railway rolling stock to use the line. As the line was single track, seven passing loops were constructed along its length to allow a frequent service in both directions. No signal system was ever installed and safe circulation was achieved {{by the use of}} predefined passing loops per each service. The last 800m section of the line was located within the naval base area and only Navy personnel bearing a pass, controlled by Naval Police, was allowed to continue.|$|R
50|$|Colonel Rich made a {{visit and}} made recommendations; he {{reported}} that the track was <b>Vignoles</b> (flat-bottom) <b>rail</b> spiked to transverse sleepers; the steepest gradient (he said) was 1 in 40 and the sharpest curve was of 12 chains radius, although a later GWR assessment of the line showed steeper gradients and sharper curves than this. The passenger service consisted of four trains each way every weekday; there was a connecting road service to Cardigan and to Newport. The rails were rather light, at 50 lbs/yard.|$|R
50|$|The SM&AR {{line had}} {{originally}} been laid with <b>Vignoles</b> (flat bottom) <b>rails</b> of 70 lbs per yard (35 kg/m) in 18 to 24 feet (5.5 to 7.3 metre) lengths, but the northward extension was laid with 75 lb per yard (37 kg/m) bullhead rail. The track limited locomotive weight, and was gradually replaced by 87 lb per yard (43 kg/m) bullhead track, but this took until 1928. Cerney station was renamed South Cerney on 1 July 1924. Blunsdon station closed in September 1924.|$|R
50|$|Accordingly, {{the line}} was ceremonially opened amongst great celebration on 17 December 1877, and to {{ordinary}} public operation the following day. There were six mixed (passenger and goods) trains each way, Monday to Saturday. It was a single track of standard gauge, using <b>Vignoles</b> (flat-bottom) <b>rails.</b> The one engine in steam system of operation was to be used {{and there was one}} intermediate station at Somerford (later Great Somerford), which did not have goods facilities at first. The junction with the GWR main line was at Dauntsey, between Swindon and Chippenham, where branch trains had a bay platform. Branch trains did not run beyond Dauntsey; there was a short length of loop siding alongside the branch line at Dauntsey, used for running round passenger trains. The line was 6 miles 4 furlongs and 1½ chains (10.5 km) in length; there was a tunnel at Malmesbury, and the station there was on Gloucester Road just beyond Stanes river bridge. The construction had cost £76,565 so far—the final cost was to be £87,094.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} trains ran from Oswestry, southwards over the Cambrian Railways line {{as far as}} Llynclys, then turning west on the Cambrian Railways Porthywaen branch, leaving that at Porthywaen passenger station, a very small building, and now entering on the Tanat Valley line itself. The track was of much lighter construction now, consisting of <b>Vignoles</b> pattern (flat-bottom) <b>rails</b> dogged direct to the sleepers. The Nantmawr branch of the Cambrian Railways converged from the north. The first TVR station was Blodwel Junction, a single platform station. Blodwel station had been opened in 1866, the terminus of the Potteries line, and known then as Llanyblodwel, part of the mineral branch crossing {{the path of the}} TVR. A road crosses the railway by a bridge at Blodwel; this is the only place where there is a bridge crossing of a road.|$|R
50|$|The {{width of}} the line at {{formation}} level is 11 feet on the embankments and 12 feet in cuttings. The gauges were 4 feet 8½ inches. The permanent way consists of flat-bottomed or <b>Vignoles</b> patterned <b>rail</b> stated to weigh 40 lbs per lineal yard in lengths of 15 feet, 17 feet 6 inches, and 21 feet, laid on transverse sleepers of half-round Baltic timber creosoted (4½ in.), and 9 feet long placed at an average distance of three feet apart, centre to centre, except that {{on some of the}} sharpest curves an extra sleeper has been inserted under every 21 feet length of rail. No chairs are made use of, but the rail is fastened to the transverse sleepers by a fang-bolt with a clip under the head, overlapping the flange of the rail on one side, and by a wrought iron spike on the other side. On the sharpest curves a wrought iron plate is laid between the rail and the sleeper, with holes punched in it, through which the fang-bolt and spike are driven; the joints of the rails are fastened with wrought iron fish-plates and bolts, and secured to the sleepers with a fang-bolt and clip {{on each side of the}} rail. The ballast is of gravel, a small proportion of sand; it was required according to the contract, to be eight inches deep under the sleepers, but is stated to average about one foot. No engine turn table has been provided. The line has a very large number of sharp curves having radii of 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 chains. The steepest incline is 1 in 66.|$|R
