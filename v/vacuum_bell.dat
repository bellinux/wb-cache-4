40|$|Two mode {{squeezed}} <b>vacuum</b> states allow <b>Bell’s</b> inequality violation (BIQV) for all non-vanishing squeezing parameter (ζ). Maximal violation {{occurs at}} ζ → ∞ when the parity of either component averages to zero. For a given entangled two spin system BIQV is optimized via orientations of the operators entering the Bell operator (c. f. S. L. Braunstein, A. Mann and M. Revzen: Phys. Rev. Lett. 68, 3259 (1992)). We show that for finite ζ in continuous variable systems (and in general whenever the dimensionality of the subsystems {{is greater than}} 2) additional parameters are present for optimizing BIQV. Thus the expectation value of the Bell operator depends, {{in addition to the}} orientation parameters, on configuration parameters. Optimization of these configurational parameters leads to a unique maximal BIQV that depends only on ζ.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper reviews {{applications}} of 2 -spinor methods to relativistic qubits (analogies between tetrads in Minkowski space and 2 -qubit states, qubits defined by means of null directions and their role for elimination of the Peres-Scudo-Terno phenomenon, advantages and disadvantages of relativistic polarization operators defined by the Pauli-Lubanski vector, manifestly covariant approach to unitary representations of inhomogeneous SL(2,C)). The second part deals with electromagnetic fields quantized by means of harmonic oscillator Lie algebras (not necessarily taken in irreducible representations). As opposed to non-relativistic singlets one has to distinguish between maximally symmetric and EPR states. The distinction is one of the sources of `strange' relativistic properties of EPR correlations. As an example, EPR averages are explicitly computed for linear polarizations in states that are antisymmetric in both helicities and momenta. The result takes the familiar form ± pcos 2 (α-β) independently of the choice of representation of harmonic oscillator algebra. Parameter p is determined by spectral properties of detectors and the choice of EPR state, but is unrelated to detector efficiencies. Brief analysis of entanglement with vacuum and <b>vacuum</b> violation of <b>Bell's</b> inequality is given. The effects are related to inequivalent notions of vacuum states.

Conservative treatment with the <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell</b> to elevate the funnel in patients with PE represents a potential alternative. Methods: A suction cup is used to create a vacuum at the anterior chest wall. A patient-activated hand pump is used to reduce the pressure up to 15 % below atmospheric pressure. Three different sizes of <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell</b> exist which are selected according to the individual patients age.

40|$|Kapton {{polyimide}} wiring insulation {{was found}} to be vulnerable to pyrolization, arc tracking, and flashover when momentary short-circuit arcs have occurred on aircraft power systems. Short-circuit arcs between wire pairs can pyrolize the polyimide resulting in a conductive char between conductors that may sustain the arc (arc tracking). Furthermore, the arc tracking may spread (flashover) to other wire pairs within a wire bundle. Polyimide Kapton will also be used as the insulating material for the flexible current carrier (FCC) of Space Station Freedom (SSF). The FCC, with conductors in a planar type geometric layout as opposed to bundles, is known to sustain arc tracking at proposed SSF power levels. Tests were conducted in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell</b> jar that was designed to conduct polyimide pyrolysis, arc tracking, and flashover studies on samples of SSF's FCC.

The vapor pressures of the materials are controlled by the temperature of the crucibles. The temperature and pressure of inert gas are also controlled. By varying the vapor pressure relative to the gas temperature and pressure, the conditions for substantial grain condensation can be controlled and grain formation measured using light scattering techniques. Thus the partial pressure for grain condensation, can be measured as a function of temperature.

40|$|The {{pectus excavatum}} {{treatment}} has two different approaches: non-surgical techniques (modified dynamic thoracic compressor, exercises and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell)</b> or surgical techniques (silastic or solid silicone implant, open surgical repair like sternochondroplasty and minimally invasive repair). The introduction of Nuss procedure improved the pectus excavatum treatment, but its low acceptance {{was due to}} the high complication rate (e. g. cardiac perfuration). The thoracoscopy use for bar mediastinal passage reduced the complication rate. In comparison with sternochondroplasty, the Nuss procedure has smaller incision, less blood loss and less operative time. However, it has more reoperations, complications, longer hospital stay and more readmission rates, more time of thoracic epidural catheter for postoperative analgesia and more need for analgesic after being discharged. Although Nuss procedure has been used in children, patients under ten years must be only observed. The Nuss procedure is applicable to moderate or light symmetrical pectus excavatum, without costal protrusion, in young and adolescents patients. Furthermore, the sternochondroplasty is applicable to severe or asymmetric pectus excavatum, with or without inferior costal protrusion.

All patients were offered psychological therapy and correction of the deformity. In addition, the children were followed-up by a telephone questionnaire (median follow-up after starting therapy 12. 8 months (5. 9 - 18. 0).

The specific thermal capacity was determined based on warm-up and cool-down transients. The heat dissipation rate was calculated from the values measured for heat radiated and stored, and the resulting values were corrected for conductive heat dissipation through the leads. The specific heat was 1. 117 J/ C-g for the LiNiO 2 cell and 0. 946 J/ C-g for the 75 %LiCoO 2, 25 %LiNiO 2 cell.

40|$|Pectus excavatum (PE) and {{pectus carinatum}} (PC) are {{relatively}} common deformities involving the anterior chest wall, occurring in 1 : 1000 and 1 : 1500 live births, respectively. While the etiology remains an enigma, {{the association of}} pectus deformities with other skeletal abnormalities suggests that connective tissue disease {{may play a role}} in their pathogenesis. Clinical features of these deformities vary with severity, as determined by the Haller index and Backer ratio, but frequently include cardiac and respiratory abnormalities. Importantly, there exist profound psychosocial implications for children afflicted with these defofrmities, including but not limited to feelings of embarrassment and maladaptive social behaviors. These debilitating characteristics have prompted the development of novel medical and surgical corrective techniques. The correction of pectus deformities reduces the incidence of physiological complications secondary to chest wall malformation, while simultaneously improving body image and psychosocial development in the affected pediatric population. The Ravitch (open) and Nuss (minimally invasive) procedures remain the most frequently employed methods of pectus deformity repair, with no difference in overall complication rates, though individual complication rates vary with treatment. The Nuss procedure is associated with a higher rate of recurrence due to bar migration, hemothorax, and pneumothorax. Postoperative pain management is markedly more difficult in patients who have undergone Nuss repair. Patients undergoing the Ravitch procedure require less postoperative analgesia, but have longer operation times and a larger surgical scar. The cosmetic results of the Nuss procedure and its minimally invasive nature make it preferable to the Ravitch repair. Newer treatment modalities, including the <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell,</b> magnetic mini-mover procedure (3 MP), and dynamic compression bracing (DCB) appear promising, and may ultimately provide effective methods of noninvasive repair. However, these modalities suffer from a lack of extensive published evidence, and the limited number of studies currently published fail to adequately define their long-term effectiveness. </p...|$|E
40|$|Only {{patients}} with a severe pectus excavatum deformity should be candidates for surgical repair. Mild and moderate degrees of deformity should be treated with a deep breathing and exercise program and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell.</b> The best age for repair is during puberty, but successful repair in adult patients (up to 70 years of age) has been reported. Those scheduled for minimally invasive repair should be measured for bar length and screened for metal allergies. The minimally invasive technique for pectus excavatum repair is done thoracoscopically and requires no rib cartilage or sternal resection. Instead, it relies on bracing the anterior chest wall with a sub-sternal support bar placed in position under the sternum after first correcting the deformity with an introducer specially developed for the procedure. Two bars generally give better correction than one bar. It is essential that the bars be adequately stabilized to prevent bar displacement and recurrence of the deformity. Several techniques {{have been developed to}} elevate the sternum during mediastinal tunneling to improve thoracoscopic visibility in very severe and asymmetric deformities. Since 1987 we have evaluated 3836 patients in our chest wall deformities clinic, of whom 1921 (50 %) have undergone repair. 1738 patients were primary repairs and 1346 of these have had their bars removed two to three years after placement. The biggest challenge in the early years was bar displacement but that has now been reduced to just over 1 % by use of a stabilizer on the left side and “ 0 ” PDS pericostal sutures on the right side. 88. 9 % of patients reported an excellent result, 9. 6 % a good result and 1. 5 % a poor or failed result.

40|$|In {{engineering}} practice {{it is important}} to know which factors affect the thermal and electrical resistance of metal contacts. This thesis is to investigate some of these factors such as surface roughness and contact pressure. Thermal electrical contact resistance ratios for metal contacts were calculated from the experimental data. The technical literature was searched, and several papers were found in which either thermal or electrical contact resistance was studied separately. However, none of the papers recorded data for both thermal and electrical resistances for the same samples. The information found in these papers has been used as a background for understanding the nature of thermal and electrical contact resistance. Both of these contact resistances are primarily a function of the load on the contact and the condition of the surfaces. At low pressures only a small fraction of the total gross area of the contacts is in metal-to-metal contact. Increasing the load, flattens the “hills” and reduces both the thermal and electrical contact resistance. This phenomenon is called “spreading resistance” since the flow of heat or electrical current must spread out after they pass through the restricted areas that are actually in contact. Another type of thermal and electrical resistance, which is called “interface resistance 2 ̆ 2, is caused by a film of foreign material such as an oxide, etc. on the surfaces of the contacting “hills”. If the space between the “hills” of a contact is filled with air, there is a heat flow by convection currents. The literature indicates this quantity of heat flow is approximately one thousandth of the total heat flow through metal contacts. Since the only electrical current conduction mechanism acting between areas not in actual metallic contact is that due to thermionic emission, the electrical resistance for these areas will be extremely high at room temperature for which thermionic emission is negligible. The experimental apparatus to measure both the thermal and electrical contact resistances consists mainly of a bellows-actuated press which is operated remotely under a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell.</b> The press pressure loads the sample metal wafers. A thin film heat meter is used to indicate the quantity of heat flowing through the metal contacts. The temperature drop caused by the contacts is measured with thermocouples. The temperature difference and the quantity of heat flowing is used to calculate the thermal contact resistance. A strain gage on the bellows-press stem measures the loading on the contact surfaces. Electrical probes are used to measure the electrica 1 resistance across the contact surfaces. The thermocouples and electrical resistance probes are permanently installed in the outer two smooth copper wafers. This makes it possible to quickly change to other sets of sample wafers of other metals and finishes. In order to use this permanent arrangement, it is necessary to finish two mating surfaces of the particular set of metal wafers to be tested, similar to the permanent smooth copper wafers so that these two extra mating contact resistances can be found and thus be subtracted from the overall contact resistance. The data indicates that the thermal-electrical contact resistance ratio can be changed by changing the load on the contacts. The heat meter had performed very well, and this new method of measuring heat flow will undoubtedly become a standard method of measuring heat flux...|$|E
