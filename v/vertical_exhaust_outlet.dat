40|$|Abstract Background Perfluorocarbon (PFC) vapour in the expired gases during partial liquid {{ventilation}} {{should be}} prevented {{from entering the}} atmosphere and recovered for potential reuse. This study aimed {{to determine how much}} PFC liquid could be recovered using a conventional humidified neonatal ventilator with chilled condensers in place of the usual expiratory ventilator circuit and whether PFC liquid could be recovered when using the chilled condensers at the ventilator <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet.</b> Methods Using a model lung, perfluorocarbon vapour loss during humidified partial liquid ventilation of a 3. 5 kg infant was approximated. For each test 30 mL of FC- 77 was infused into the model lung. Condensers were placed in the expiratory limb of the ventilator circuit and the amounts of PFC (FC- 77) and water recovered were measured five times. This was repeated with the condensers placed at the ventilator <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet.</b> Results When the condensers were used as the expiratory limb, the mean (± SD) volume of FC 77 recovered was 16. 4 mL (± 0. 18 mL). When the condensers were connected to the ventilator <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> the mean (± SD) volume of FC- 77 recovered was 7. 6 mL (± 1. 14 mL). The volume of FC- 77 recovered was significantly higher when the condenser was used as an expiratory limb. Conclusion Using two series connected condensers in the ventilator expiratory line 55 % of PFC liquid (FC- 77) can be recovered during partial liquid ventilation without altering the function of the of the ventilator circuit. This volume of PFC recovered was just over twice that recovered with the condensers connected to the ventilator <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study is}} performed into {{the effects of}} the location of exhaust diffusers in relation to the room heat sources on thermal comfort and energy saving. A new concept of the combination of indoor heat sources and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> was also employed in this investigation. The results showed that the indoor thermal environment and energy saving were greatly improved by combining the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets</b> with some of the room’s heat sources. For further improvement, this concept was also used along with a novel local exhaust ventilation system in the modelled office room. This system was adopted and developed for use in office spaces, where the exhaust opening was combined with the office workstation into a single unit. The main aim was to help extract the warmed and contaminated air locally before it could disperse across the room. Three different amounts of recirculated air and three different heights of the combined system were analysed. The results showed a significant improvement in energy savings and inhaled air quality in the room using the new ventilation system. It was also found that the performance of this system was greatly influenced by the height factor. In addition, in this research, the LES method was employed to investigate the complex characteristics of airflow and temperature distribution in the office room which used the concept of combining the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> with room heat sources. The results revealed that the airflow and temperature distribution were highly unsteady and unstable, particularly in the regions where buoyancy works effectively to cause a high number of perturbations.
