5000|$|As {{the core}} moves, the primary's linkage {{to the two}} {{secondary}} coils changes and causes the induced voltages to change.

When the core is in its central position, equidistant between the two secondaries, equal <b>voltages</b> <b>are</b> <b>induced</b> in the two secondary coils, but the two signals cancel, so the output <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> theoretically zero.

50|$|The Faraday {{generator}} {{is named}} after the man who first looked for the effect in the Thames river (see history). A simple Faraday generator would consist of a wedge-shaped pipe or tube of some non-conductive material.

50|$|The {{moving part}} in a linear {{generator}} is called the translator. When the buoy is lifted by the wave, the buoy sets the translator in motion. It is the relative motion between the stator and the translator in the generator which causes <b>voltage</b> to <b>be</b> <b>induced</b> in the stator windings.|$|R
50|$|Instead, {{they are}} {{built out of}} a {{three-phase}} induction motor or generator, called an idler, on which two of the terminals (the idler inputs) are powered from the single-phase line. The rotating flux in the motor produces a voltage on the third terminal. A <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> <b>induced</b> in the third terminal that is shifted by 120Â° from the voltage between the first two terminals. In a three-winding motor, two of the windings are acting as a motor, and the third winding is acting as a generator.|$|E
50|$|According to Faraday's law, {{since the}} same {{magnetic}} flux passes through both {{the primary and}} secondary windings in an ideal transformer, a <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> <b>induced</b> in each winding, according to eq. (1) in the secondary winding case, according to eq. (2) in the primary winding case. The primary EMF is sometimes termed counter EMF. This is in accordance with Lenz's law, which states that induction of EMF always opposes development of any such change in magnetic field.The transformer winding voltage ratio is thus shown to be directly proportional to the winding turns ratio according to eq. (3). common usage having evolved over time from 'turn ratio' to 'turns ratio'. However, some sources use the inverse definition.|$|E
50|$|The rotor {{is a large}} magnet with poles {{constructed}} of steel lamination projecting out of the rotorâs core. The poles are supplied by direct current or magnetized by permanent magnets. The armature with a three-phase winding is attached to three slip rings with brushes riding on them and mounted on the shaft. The field winding is wound on the rotor which produces the magnetic field and the armature winding is on the stator where <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> <b>induced.</b> Direct current (DC), from an external exciter or from a diode bridge mounted on the rotor shaft, produces a magnetic field and energizes the rotating field windings and alternating current energizes the armature windings simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Although it doesn't {{include a}} capacitor, the {{secondary}} winding {{is also a}} tuned circuit (electrical resonator); the parasitic capacitance between {{the ends of the}} secondary coil resonates with the large inductance of the secondary at a particular resonant frequency. When it is excited at this frequency by the primary, large oscillating <b>voltages</b> <b>are</b> <b>induced</b> in the secondary. The number of turns in the primary winding, and thus the resonant frequency of the primary, could be adjusted with a tap on the coil. When the two tuned circuits are adjusted to resonate at the same frequency, the large turns ratio of the coil, aided by the high Q of the tuned circuits, steps up the primary voltage to hundreds of thousands to millions of volts at the secondary.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the motor}} is in operation, {{the speed of}} the motor is {{dependent}} only on the supply frequency. When the motor load is increased beyond the breakdown load, the motor falls out of synchronization and the field winding no longer follows the rotating magnetic field. Since the motor cannot produce (synchronous) torque if it falls out of synchronization, practical synchronous motors have a partial or complete squirrel-cage damper (amortisseur) winding to stabilize operation and facilitate starting. Because this winding is smaller than that of an equivalent induction motor and can overheat on long operation, and because large slip-frequency <b>voltages</b> <b>are</b> <b>induced</b> in the rotor excitation winding, synchronous motor protection devices sense this condition and interrupt the power supply (out of step protection).|$|R

50|$|Ferrofluids enable an {{interesting}} opportunity to harvest vibration {{energy from the}} environment. Existing methods of harvesting low frequency (<100 Hz) vibrations {{require the use of}} solid resonant structures. With ferrofluids, energy harvester designs no longer need solid structure. One example of ferrofluid based energy harvesting is discussed in the journal article, Electromagnetic ferrofluid-based energy harvester. First a ferrofluid is placed inside a container that is wrapped with a coil of wire. The ferrofluid is then externally magnetized using a permanent magnet. When external vibrations cause the ferrofluid to slosh around in the container, there is a change in magnetic flux fields with respect to the coil of wire. Through Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> <b>induced</b> in the coil of wire due to change in magnetic flux.|$|E
50|$|If {{the brush}} axis is {{displaced}} {{at an angle}} to the magnetic axis, a net <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> <b>induced</b> at the brush terminals which will produce current in the armature. The current in the armature circuit will produce its own magnetic field, with North and South poles, but in this condition, the North Pole is not directly under the North pole of the magnetic axis and the South Pole is not directly above the South Pole of the magnetic axis. The poles of the armature are slightly displaced from those of the stator. In this condition, the N-pole of the stator field will repel the N-pole of the rotor field and the S-pole of stator field will repel the S-pole of the rotor field, so the rotor starts rotating.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Synchronous motors are {{designed}} to run at synchronous speed. Synchronous speed defines the natural rate of rotation of the magnetic field generated in the stator of an AC machine. This rate of rotation is governed by {{the frequency of the}} voltage applied to the machine and the number of pole pairs built into the stator, and is defined by the following equation: Synchronous Speed, Ns = (60 seconds/minute) * (Cycles per Second) (RPM) [2] The stator of a synchronous motor is wound {{in the same manner as}} a three-phase induction motor, with distributed poles. When a three-phase source is applied to the stator, a rotating magnetic field develops at synchronous frequency. The rotor of a synchronous motor, however, differs greatly from that of an induction motor. In an induction motor, <b>voltages</b> <b>are</b> <b>induced</b> i...|$|R

50|$|The cycle {{starts with}} no voltage and no current. Then one {{transistor}} turns on, a constant voltage {{is applied to}} the primary, current increases linearly, and a constant <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> <b>induced</b> in the secondary. After some time T the transistor is turned off, the parasitic capacities of the transistors and the transformer and the inductance of the transformer form an LC circuit which swings to the opposite polarity. Then the other transistor turns on. For the same time T charge flows back into the storage capacitor, then changes the direction automatically, and for another time T the charge flows in the transformer. Then again the first transistor turns on until the current is stopped. Then the cycle is finished, another cycle can start anytime later. The S-shaped current is needed to improve over the simpler converters and deal efficiently with remanence.|$|E
5000|$|Speakers and microphones: Most {{speakers}} {{employ a}} permanent magnet and a current-carrying coil to convert electric energy (the signal) into mechanical energy (movement {{that creates the}} sound). The coil is wrapped around a bobbin attached to the speaker cone and carries the signal as changing current that interacts with the field of the permanent magnet. The voice coil feels a magnetic force and in response, moves the cone and pressurizes the neighboring air, thus generating sound. Dynamic microphones employ the same concept, but in reverse. A microphone has a diaphragm or membrane attached to a coil of wire. The coil rests inside a specially shaped magnet. When sound vibrates the membrane, the coil is vibrated as well. As the coil moves through the magnetic field, a <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> <b>induced</b> across the coil. This voltage drives a current in the wire that is characteristic of the original sound.|$|E
50|$|If the {{generator}} {{is connected to}} a linear strictly resistive load, it will deliver power as soon as <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> <b>induced</b> in {{the generator}}. With a non-linear load the relation is not so simple. The load is not linear due to the transmission system, whose diode rectifier results in power only {{being able to be}} extracted over certain voltage levels. Consequently, the DC voltage level limits the amplitude of the generator phase voltage. With a non-linear load the generator phase voltage will reach maximum amplitude which is approximately equal to the DC voltage. When the generatorâs phase voltage reaches the level of the DC voltage current starts to flow (power is extracted) from the generator to the DC side of the rectifier. Power will be delivered as long as the waves can deliver mechanical power to the buoy {{and as long as the}} translator has not reached its upper or lower end stop. The current will increase when the speed of the translator increases. This non-linear power extraction results in different shapes of the voltages and the current pulses.|$|E

The soil structure is an important parameter that affects the level of this interference. In this study, the influence of a soil structure composed of layers with different resistivities, both horizontally and vertically, on the inductive part of this interference is inves-tigated. The method used to determine the inductive interference comprises finite-element calculations and standard circuit anal-ysis. The results show that good knowledge of the soil structure is necessary in order to estimate the above interference with min-imum error. Therefore, it is desirable that soil resistivity measure-ments are made both at adequate depths and at locations far away from the rights-of-way.
