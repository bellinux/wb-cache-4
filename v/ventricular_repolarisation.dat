5|$|There {{are five}} {{prominent}} {{features on the}} ECG: the P wave (atrial depolarisation), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarisation) and the T wave (<b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation).</b> As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. A downward deflection on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge ("depolarising") {{in the direction of}} that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative ("repolarising") {{in the direction of the}} lead. This depends on the position of the lead, so if a wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative deflection, and a lead on the right would show a positive deflection. The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. Testing when exercising can be used to provoke an abnormality, or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour Holter monitor if a suspected rhythm abnormality is not present at the time of assessment.|$|E

40|$|T-wave alternans is {{considered}} a potentially useful clinical marker for the risk of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with heart disease. Cellular repolarisation alternans is thought to underlie T-wave alternans, and moreover, to cause re-entrant ventricular arrhythmia. This review examines the experimental and clinical evidence linking repolarisation alternans and T-wave alternans with the occurrence of <b>ventricular</b> arrhythmia. <b>Repolarisation</b> alternans, manifest as alternating changes in action potential duration, is observed in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes and in multicellular preparations. Its underlying causes are discussed {{particularly with respect to}} the role of intracellular Ca 2 +. The repolarisation alternans observed at the single cell level is compared to the alternating behaviour observed in isolated multicellular preparations including the perfused ventricular wedge and Langendorff perfused heart. The evidence concerning spatial differences in repolarisation alternans {{is considered}}, particularly the situation where adjacent regions of myocardium exhibit repolarisation alternans of different phases. This extreme behaviour, known as discordant alternans, is thought to produce marked gradients of repolarisation that can precipitate unidirectional block and re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} underlying drug-induced arrhythmia and pro- poses {{a new approach}} for the automated analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The current method of assessing the cardiac safety of new drugs in clinical trials is by the measurement {{and analysis of the}} QT interval. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the QT interval has been questioned and alternative biomarkers based on T-wave mor- phology have been proposed in the literature. The mechanisms underlying drug effects on T-wave morphology are not clearly understood. Therefore, a combined approach of for- ward cardiac modelling and inverse ECG analysis is adopted to investigate the effects of sotalol, a compound known to have pro-arrhythmic effects, on <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation.</b> A computational model of sotalol and IKr, an ion channel that plays a critical role in <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation,</b> was developed. This model was incorporated into a model of the human ventricular myocyte, and subsequently arranged in a 1 -D fibre model of 200 cells. The model was used to assess the effect of sotalol on IKr, action potential duration and biomarkers of <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> derived from the simulated ECG. In parallel, an automated ECG analysis method based on machine learning, signal processing and time-frequency analysis is developed to identify a number of fiducial points in ECG waveforms so that timing intervals and a smooth T-wave segment can be extracted for morphology analysis. The approach is to train a hidden Markov model (HMM) using a data set of ECG waveforms and the corresponding expert annotations. The signal is first encoded using the undecimated wavelet transform (UWT). The UWT coefficients are used for R-peak detection, signal encoding for the HMM and a wavelet de-noising procedure. Using the Viterbi algorithm, the trained HMM is then applied to a subset of the ECG signal to infer the fiducial points for each heart beat. Furthermore, a method for deriving a confidence measure based on the trained HMM is implemented so that a level of confidence can be associated with the automated annotations. Finally, the T-wave segment is extracted from the de-noised ECG signal for morphology characterisation. This thesis contributes to the literature on automated characterisation of drug ef- fects on <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> in three different ways. Firstly, it investigates the mechanisms underlying the effects of drug inhibition of IKr on <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> as captured by the simulated ECG signal. Secondly, it shows how the combination of UWT encoding and HMM inference can be effectively used to segment 24 -hour Holter ECG recordings. Evaluation of the segmentation algorithm on a clinical ECG data set demonstrates the ability of the algorithm to overcome problems associated with existing automated systems, and hence provide a more robust analysis of ECG signals. Finally, the thesis provides insight into the drug effects of sotalol on <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> as captured by biomarkers extracted from the surface ECG.

Activation-recovery interval (ARI) and QTI were measured from multi-ple ECGs acquired from left ventricular epicardium, before and after procainamide administration (15 mg/min i. v. for 20 min). Procainamide therapy resulted in a signi cant prolongation in ARI and corrected QT interval (cQTI). A correlation between QTI, cQTI and ARI was found in only one animal (r = 0 : 78 and 0. 79 respectively, p = 0 : 01) before procainamide therapy. No correlation was found be-tween pooled QTI and ARI dispersion from the 10 animals at baseline or after procainamide administration (p> 0 : 05).

40|$|What is the QT interval? The QT interval, {{measured}} as {{the interval between}} the initiation of the Q wave and the termination of the T wave on an Electrocardiogram (ECG), {{is a measure of}} <b>ventricular</b> depolarisation and <b>repolarisation.</b> 1 Due to its variation with heart rate the QTc offers a more indicative value. A number of formulas including Bazzet’s formula and Freidreich’s formula can be used to calculate the QTc. 1 Normal values differ between males and females. Prolonged QTc is defined as> 450 msecs in males and> 470 msecs in females. 2 In order to understand factors which could influence the QTc {{it is important to have}} some biochemical knowledge of the ventricular action potential of the cardiac myocytes. This involves four phases as depicted in Fig. 1 below. Phase zero represents initial repolarisation with influx of Sodium. Phase one represents early repolarisation with inactivation of the Sodium currents and onset of transient outward Potassium currents. A balance between outwards Potassium currents and inward Calcium currents accounts for phase 2, the plateau phase. Rapid repolarisation (Phase 3) follows when Calcium currents are inactivated whilst Potassium currents remain open. Finally, Phase 4 represents the resting membrane potential. ...|$|R

40|$|Patients with {{congenital}} QT interval prolongation {{are at risk}} of {{ventricular arrhythmias}} and sudden death. It has been suggested that the susceptibility to arrhythmias in these syndromes {{may be related to the}} abnormal dynamics of <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation.</b> The dynamics of <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation,</b> including assessment of the effect of changing heart rate on the QT interval and the duration of the right ventricular monophasic action potential, were studied in eight patients with congenital long QT syndromes.

The rate adaptation of the QT interval was abnormal in only a few patients and in some patients this feature may be related to the severity of the condition. These abnormalities may be exaggerated by isoprenaline and lessened by propranolol and left stellate ganglion block. Monophasic action potential dynamics were normal in all patients. The hypothesis that impaired QT rate adaptation may play a role in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias in these syndromes is not, in general, supported by the present data. However, in patients with impaired adaptation the normalisation of QT dynamics after beta blockade and left stellate ganglion block was consistent with the efficacy of these forms of treatment...|$|E

Friedreich's ataxia typically causes motor abnormalities of the extremities, mainly impairing walking and the coordination of the legs and arms. The myocardium is affected at a later stage of the disease. The extent and timing of myocardial involvement determines the clinical course. Some patients have no cardiac symptoms and cardiac involvement can be established only by electrocardiographic or echocardiographic examination.

DESIGN [...] Randomised open label cross-over comparison of three regimens. SETTING [...] Tertiary arrhythmia referral centre. SUBJECTS [...] Eight patients with reduced left ventricular function and sustained ventricular tachycardia inducible by programmed stimulation. INTERVENTIONS [...] Three treatment regimens each of 48 hours duration: captopril, hydralazine plus isosorbide mononitrate, and control (no vasodilator). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Changes in central haemodynamics, electrophysiological parameters, and induction of ventricular tachycardia during treatment with captopril, or hydralazine combined with nitrate, compared with a control period.

40|$|Variability is {{observed}} {{at all levels}} of cardiac electrophysiology. Yet, the underlying causes and importance of this variability are generally unknown, and difficult to investigate with current experimental techniques. The aim {{of the present study was}} to generate populations of computational ventricular action potential models that reproduce experimentally observed intercellular variability of repolarisation (represented by action potential duration) and to identify its potential causes. A systematic exploration of the effects of simultaneously varying the magnitude of six transmembrane current conductances (transient outward, rapid and slow delayed rectifier K +, inward rectifying K +, L-type Ca 2 +, and Na + /K + pump currents) in two rabbit-specific ventricular action potential models (Shannon et al. and Mahajan et al.) at multiple cycle lengths (400, 600, 1, 000 ms) was performed. This was accomplished with distributed computing software specialised for multi-dimensional parameter sweeps and grid execution. An initial population of 15, 625 parameter sets was generated for both models at each cycle length. Action potential durations of these populations were compared to experimentally derived ranges for rabbit ventricular myocytes. 1, 352 parameter sets for the Shannon model and 779 parameter sets for the Mahajan model yielded action potential duration within the experimental range, demonstrating that a wide array of ionic conductance values can be used to simulate a physiological rabbit ventricular action potential. Furthermore, by using clutter-based dimension reordering, a technique that allows visualisation of multi-dimensional spaces in two dimensions, the interaction of current conductances and their relative importance to the ventricular action potential at different cycle lengths were revealed. Overall, this work represents an important step towards a better understanding of the role that variability in current conductances may play in experimentally observed intercellular variability of rabbit <b>ventricular</b> action potential <b>repolarisation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Optical {{mapping of}} voltage signals has revolutionised {{the field and}} study of cardiac {{electrophysiology}} by providing the means to visualise changes in electrical activity at a high temporal and spatial resolution from the cellular to the whole heart level under both normal and disease conditions. The aim of this thesis {{was to develop a}} novel method of panoramic optical mapping using a single camera and to study myocardial electrophysiology in isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. First, proper procedures for selection, filtering and analysis of the optical data recorded from the panoramic optical mapping system were established. This work was followed by extensive characterisation of the electrical activity across the epicardial surface of the preparation investigating time and heart dependent effects. In an initial study, features of epicardial electrophysiology were examined as the temperature of the heart was reduced below physiological values. This manoeuvre was chosen to mimic the temperatures experienced during various levels of hypothermia in vivo, a condition known to promote arrhythmias. The facility for panoramic optical mapping allowed the extent of changes in conduction timing and pattern of <b>ventricular</b> activation and <b>repolarisation</b> to be assessed. In the main experimental section, changes in epicardial electrical activity were assessed under various pacing conditions in both normal hearts and in a rabbit model of chronic MI. In these experiments, there was significant changes in the pattern of electrical activation corresponding with the changes in pacing regime. These experiments demonstrated a negative correlation between activation time and APD, which was not maintained during ventricular pacing. This suggests that activation pattern is not the sole determinant of action potential duration in intact hearts. Lastly, a realistic 3 D computational model of the rabbit left ventricle was developed to simulate the passive and active mechanical properties of the heart. The aim of this model was to infer further information from the experimental optical mapping studies.

DESIGN: Comparative study of non-invasive assessment of BRS, QT interval, and QT dispersion. SETTING: Large teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: 31 young asymptomatic, normotensive, insulin dependent diabetic patients, aged 20 - 55 years with normal clinical autonomic function. METHODS: QT intervals and QT dispersion were {{measured by a}} single observer blinded to other data about the patients. BRS was measured after activating the baroreflex with a Valsalva manoeuvre, and the rate in change of R-R interval to increasing systolic pressure during phase 4 was measured; in addition sequence analysis of resting systolic blood pressure and heart rate was performed during standing. The alpha coefficient [...] an index of the overall gain of the baroreflex mechanisms [...] was estimated from spectral analysis data of systolic blood pressure and pulse interval variability. RESULTS: Mean (SD) QTc interval was 406 (23) ms, QT dispersion was 44 (13) ms. There was no association between QT dispersion and any measurement of BRS. There was a negative correlation between mean QTc intervals and sequence analysis BRS (r = - 0. 355, P = 0. 049), but no association with Valsalva BRS.

40|$|Hypothermia {{is defined}} as a core body {{temperature}} of 35 °C or less and can be induced (i. e. therapeutic) or accidental. It is well established that hypothermia leads to a positive inotropic response which causes an increase in the magnitude of cardiac contraction, however rewarming from hypothermia is associated with a negative inotropic response, and the underlying mechanisms of this remain unclear. Accidental hypothermia is further complicated by risk of ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. This contributes to high mortality rates among these patients. Although hypothermia is used extensively as a therapeutic intervention and survival is possible after extreme exposure, treatment of arrhythmias during rewarming is still challenging. In order to develop targeted anti-arrhythmic strategies in this very specific situation, we first need to understand the basis for pro-arrhythmia during cooling and rewarming. This study aimed to examine the effect of hypothermia and rewarming on aspects of cardiac inotropy and excitability. An in vitro model of hypothermia and rewarming using isolated rat ventricular cardiomyocytes showed that following 3 hours of hypothermia there was a significant reduction in shortening upon rewarming. This was not accompanied by a change in intracellular Ca 2 +, suggesting a rewarming induced decrease in myofilament sensitivity to Ca 2 +. In separate experiments, animals underwent an in vivo hypothermia/rewarming procedure and displayed evidence of rewarming induced contractile dysfunction. Epicardial action potential (AP) measurements on these hearts showed a shortened AP duration (APD) when compared to normothermic control animals, which suggests that a sustained electrophysiological effect that could manifest as a shortened QT interval. In contrast to this, a period of transient hypothermia had alternative detrimental effects on the cardiac APD when compared to prolonged hypothermia, an effect that could predispose to the induction of long QT related arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia. Separate experiments assessed the effect of moderate (31 ˚C) and severe (17 ˚C) hypothermia on cardiac excitability in Langendorff perfused rabbit hearts. Moderate hypothermia prolonged PR and QT intervals whilst in severe hypothermia all ECG parameters were prolonged. Ventricular activation times were unaffected at 31 °C whilst action potential duration (APD 90) was significantly prolonged. At 17 °C there were significant and proportionally similar delays in both activation and <b>repolarisation.</b> <b>Ventricular</b> fibrillation (VF) threshold was significantly reduced at 31 °C (pro-arrhythmic), but at 17 °C VF threshold was > 2 x baseline (37 °C) (anti-arrhythmic). At 31 °C, transverse conduction (CVt) was relatively insensitive to cooling versus longitudinal conduction (CVl) but at 17 °C both CVt and CVl were proportionately reduced to a similar extent. The gap junction uncoupler heptanol had a larger relative effect on CVt than CVl, and at 31 °C was able to restore the CVt/CVl ratio, returning VF threshold to baseline values. This suggests that moderate hypothermia creates repolarisation abnormalities and is pro-arrhythmic. These divergent effects appear to be linked to a lower temperature sensitivity of gap junctions, a conclusion supported by the anti-arrhythmic effect of heptanol at 31 °C...|$|R

Left ventricular short axis images on echocardiography were digitised to reconstruct digitised M mode echocardiograms, from which left ventricular wall thickness curves were obtained. The wall thickening time (ThT) {{was defined as the}} period in which the instantaneous wall thickness exceeded 90 % of the maximum wall thickness. The ThT was measured from the ventricular wall thickness curve at the same segments where regional percentage uptake and washout rate of 123 I MIBG were measured.  PATIENTS—Seven patients with long QT syndrome.  RESULTS—The regional washout rate (mean (SD)) of 123 I MIBG in patients with long QT syndrome was greater in the segments with decreased percentage uptake of 123 I MIBG than in those without (17. 4  (10. 6) % v 9. 7  (16. 5) %, p < 0. 03).

For instance, the 97. 5 th centile value of QTend was 65  ms in normal individuals, 90  ms in infarct patients without arrhythmia, and 128  ms in those with VT; 70 % of the infarct patients who developed serious ventricular arrhythmias had values exceeding the 97. 5 th centile of the normal group, while only 18 % of the infarct patients without arrhythmia had dispersion values above this normal upper limit. Among the infarct patients, nearly half of those (18  of 39) with tachyarrhythmias had dispersion values that exceeded the 97. 5 th centile of those without arrhythmia.  Conclusions—Dispersion of <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> may be a good non-invasive tool for discriminating coronary patients susceptible to VT from those who are at low risk.    Keywords: QT dispersion;  myocardial infarction;  computer analysis;  arrhythmia...|$|E
40|$|Prolongation of the <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> {{manifests itself}} as a {{prolongation}} of the QT intervall on the surface ECG and represents a major risk for a special form of ventricular tachycardia called "torsades de pointes". Torsades de pointes are often self limited and are associated with palpitations, dizziness or syncope. Degeneration into ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death can occur. In addition to {{the various forms of}} the congenital long QT syndrome many drugs, such as antiarrhythmic drugs class IA and III, antibiotics, antihistamines, antidepressants, and methadone are known to prolong the QT interval. Most of these drugs block a specific potassium channel substantially involved in the <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation.</b> In addition, drug interaction or disturbances of drug metabolism may {{play a major role in}} the acquired form of the long QT syndrome. The individual risk and the potential of a pharmacologic substance to prolong the QT interval are not predictable. Certain risk factors identify patients at higher risk for drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval. Correctable factors include electrolyte disorders (e. g. hypokalemia) and concomitant administration of different QT prolonging drugs. External defibrillation is the therapy of choice in the hemodynamic unstable patient presenting torsades de pointes. In hemodynamic more stable patients application of intravenous magnesium can terminate torsades de pointes (membrane stabilizing properties). Temporary external or transvenous pacing at high heart rate might terminate incessant torsades de pointes by decreasing QT interval. Repeated ECG controls during therapy with QT prolonging drugs are mandatory, especially when drug doses are changed, additional drugs are prescribed, or in case of vomiting and diarrhea. QT prolongation in individual medical therapy is not always predictable. Therefore, updated lists of drugs with the potential of QT prolongation are available on the Internet (e. g. www. qtdrugs. org) ...|$|E
40|$|Long-distance {{running is}} growing in popularity. While {{moderate}} exercise unquestionably gives major health benefits, the effects of extreme physical exhaustion on cardiac function have been studied less. It has previously been observed that elevated cardiac biomarkers may be observed after exercise, the significance of which is not known. We aimed to study the cardiac impact of the 30 -km endurance race Lidingöloppet using biomarkers N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin T (TnT) and characterised cardiac function by echocardiography and vectorcardiographic measures of <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation.</b> In study I, 22 healthy senior runners that participated twice in the Lidingöloppet race (in 2003 and 2006) were studied using cardiac biomarkers (TnT, NT-proBNP) at baseline and after the race. Echocardiography was performed at baseline. TnT increased reproducibly in a subset of participants. NT-proBNP increased in all subjects and individuals reached similar levels at the two races. Both biomarkers were associated with larger left atrium and NT-proBNP was associated with greater LV mass suggesting a link to cardiac filling pressures. In study II, a group of 15 runners were studied longitudinally from baseline before the race, immediately post-race, {{on the next day}} and on day six. Vectorcardiography was used to determine measures of <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> and echocardiography was performed to examine cardiac functional changes. The race led to QT-interval prolongation mainly due to an increased Tpeak-to-Tend interval, as well as an enlarged Tarea which was sustained during the next 6 days. Runners with higher baseline NT-proBNP developed greater attenuation of myocardial velocities and a larger increase in Tarea. Functional fatigue of the heart thus occurs in parallel with altered <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation.</b> In study III, predictors of biomarker release were analysed at baseline and after the race in 185 runners aged an average of 61 years. In multivariable regression, independent predictors of large biomarker release were established. NT-proBNP release was predicted by (1) a higher level present at baseline, (2) a larger increase in creatinine, (3) higher age and (4) longer race duration. Elevation of TnT was predicted by (1) higher age, (2) a larger increase in creatinine and (3) fewer previous race participations. In 15 cases (8. 1 %), NT-proBNP was already elevated at baseline. Clinical work-up showed that 4 of these runners (2. 2 % of whole study population) harboured serious cardiovascular disease of whom one suffered sudden cardiac death within {{a few months after the}} race. In study IV, 23 experienced runners (median 11 previous race participations) were age-matched against 20 beginners (never raced previously in Lidingöloppet). Tissue Doppler imaging was used to analyse intra-left ventricular mechanical synchrony by computing the standard deviation of time-to-peak myocardial systolic velocity across 12 myocardial segments (Ts-SD). Furthermore, the I/D polymorphism of the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) gene was analysed. Post-race, beginners had higher levels of TnT in association with greater dyssynchrony. In multivariable analysis, post-race dyssynchrony was predicted by (1) lack of race experience, (2) more copies of the ACE D allele and (3) lower peak longitudinal systolic velocity. In study V, 31 experienced participants were age-matched against 35 beginners and studied before and after Lidingöloppet. Blood tests drawn included NT-proBNP, TnT and C-reactive protein (CRP). Genetic analysis of ACE I/D status was also performed. Despite similar levels at baseline, post-race levels of all biomarkers were higher in beginners. Homozygous carriers of the D allele exhibited a larger release of NT-proBNP despite non-significant differences between allele groups at baseline, showing that genetic factors are important for the release of NT-proBNP in runners. In conclusion, this study of predominantly senior long distance runners shows that prolonged exercise causes significant immediate and short-term effects on different aspects of cardiac function including biomarkers, myocardial velocities, <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> and intra-ventricular synchrony. Biomarkers rise especially in runners with less experience of endurance events. Levels of NT-proBNP are influenced by genetic factors and rise in the presence of cardiac dysfunction. Future studies need to address the potential clinical impact of these findings...|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic short QT (SQT) {{syndrome}} is a recently identified, genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals {{and an increased}} susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. In this computer simulation study, we identify the mechanisms by which cellular electrophysiological changes in the SQT syndrome associated with V 307 L KvLQT 1 (KCNQ 1) gene mutation (the gene coding the slowly activated rectifier potassium channel current (IKs)) increase arrhythmia-risk in human ventricle. Our simulations have shown that V 307 L gene mutation increases transmural heterogeneity of <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> that leads to an increased tissue’s vulnerability for uni-directional conduction block favorable to re-entrant arrhythmia. It also increases tissue’s susceptibility to sustain re-entry. This study provided novel mechanistic insights toward understandings of pro-arrhythmogenesis in patients with SQT syndrome subjected to V 307 L gene mutation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Thyroid hormone, acting {{through several}} nuclear hormone receptors, plays {{important}} roles in thermogenesis, lipogenesis and maturation of the neonatal brain. The receptor specificity for mediating these effects is largely unknown, and to determine this we developed mice lacking the thyroid hormone receptor TR alpha 1.

Electrocardiograms show that the mice also have prolonged QRS- and QTend-durations. The mice have a body temperature 0. 5 degrees C lower than normal and exhibit a mild hypothyroidism, whereas their overall behavior and reproduction are normal.

40|$|The {{effects of}} long term (4 weeks) {{treatment}} with oral metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) and sotalol (160 mg twice daily) on <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> time were compared {{in a double}} blind crossover study in 20 patients post-infarction. For QT interval studies transoesophageal atrial pacing was performed at a cycle length of 800 ms. Sotalol prolonged the QT interval by 5 - 7 % compared with metoprolol. The prolongation reflects {{a change in the}} repolarisation time because there was no change in the QS interval. Measurements of heart rate at rest and during bicycle exercise indicated that metoprolol and sotalol in the doses selected were equipotent as beta blockers.

40|$|The {{electrical}} cardiac systole originates {{from the}} beginning of the P wave (atrial depolarisation) until the end of the downward branch of the T wave (<b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation).</b> It includes, therefore, succession P-QRS-T and its corresponding intervals and segments: PQ, ST, and QT. The mathematical possibilities of variability in the length of the electrical systole of the heart may be diverse. It is well documented and established that such changes in length may make the myocardial cells more vulnerable and unstable, and may also cause serious cardiac arrhythmias and even sudden death. The current presentation illustrates these electrocardiographic entities with significant variations in the length of its waves and intervals: short PQ and QT intervals, short PQ and long QT, long PQ and long QT.

We have designed a monitoring and alarm system for detection of the onset of spontaneous nocturnal hypoglycaemia through monitoring of the electrocardiogram. The system incorporates expert- knowledge in the form of a rule-base. It performs monitoring of two ECG features and raises alarms if abnormalities are detected corresponding to hypoglycaemia. The top performance of the system is 100 % and 91. 30 % for sensitivity and specificity respectively.

40|$|Sixty-four {{dogs were}} {{randomly}} assigned to receive either thiopentone or propofol and their electrocardiograms were recorded immediately before and shortly after they were anaesthetised. Thiopentone caused a marked increase in QT and JT intervals, a flattening of the T-wave and an increase in precordial QT dispersion. Propofol induced a less marked increase in QT and JT intervals, corrected for heart rate. Both agents induced an increase in heart rate and a decrease in heart rate variability, consistent with reduced vagal tone. Shortly after anaesthesia was induced, thiopentone affected <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> to a far greater extent than propofol, changes which suggest that it {{may be more likely to}} induce re-entrant ventricular arrhythmogenesis and could be associated with an increase in sympathetic tone. Propofol may therefore be more suitable than thiopentone for dogs with a susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias or a long QT interval...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Idiopathic {{ventricular}} tachycardia (VT) {{occurs in a}} small but important subset of patients without clinically overt heart disease. The mechanism of the arrhythmogenesis remains unclear in these patients. This study examines modulation of the QT interval by the autonomic nervous system {{in a group of}} patients with idiopathic {{ventricular tachycardia}}. METHODS [...] Cardiac autonomic activity and <b>ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> were studied in 27 patients with VT associated with a clinically normal heart (NHVT) and in 20 normal subjects. All the patients were in sinus rhythm, had normal atrioventricular conduction, and were in a drug free state. Cardiac efferent autonomic activity was measured by spectral analysis of heart rate variability from 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiograms on a Holter analysis system (Marquette). <b>Ventricular</b> <b>repolarisation</b> was evaluated by measuring the QT intervals from the same 24 hour Holter tapes at one hour intervals. RESULTS [...] There was no difference in any of the QT interval variables including the maximum, minimum, and mean of both the QT interval and its corrected value (Bazett's formula) between patients with NHVT and normal subjects. The high frequency component (0. 04 - 0. 15 Hz) of heart rate variability was significantly decreased in patients with NHVT compared with normal subjects (16 (8) v 21 (12) ms, p < 0. 05). There was a significant correlation between the spectral variables of heart rate variability and the mean, maximal, and minimal QT intervals in normal subjects, whereas the relation was lost in patients with NHVT. No difference was found in mean heart rate between normal subjects and patients with NHVT (70 (9) v 72 (13) beats/min, NS). CONCLUSIONS [...] The high frequency component of heart rate variability is significantly decreased and the relation of QT interval to heart rate variability is significantly altered in patients with NHVT as compared with normal subjects. These findings suggest that abnormal modulation of the QT interval by the autonomic nervous system may play an important part in the arrhythmogenesis of NHVT. This might result from impaired vagal efferent cardiac activity in these patients...|$|E
