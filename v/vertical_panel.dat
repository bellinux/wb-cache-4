5|$|Various wedding {{guests are}} {{depicted}} in the scene. Shiva's attendant ganas enjoy the festivities; playing drums or dancing. The vahanas (vehicles) of the couple, Shiva's bull Nandi and Parvati's lion, are sometimes pictured in the scene. In <b>vertical</b> <b>panel</b> depictions, the celestial guests are often shown flying over Shiva and Parvati. While the gods are pictured flying on their respective vahanas (e.g. Indra on his elephant, Agni on a ram) and with their consorts; semi-divine beings like Vidyadharas fly without vehicles. An anachronism found in a few Kalyanasundara scenes {{is the presence of}} the yet-unborn children of Shiva and Parvati, Ganesha and Kartikkeya. Examples of this anachronism are found at the Rameshvara Cave of Ellora, and in a 9th-century sculpture from Uttar Pradesh now housed in Los Angeles County Museum of Art.|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 is {{an unusual}} {{combination}} of temple and palace. It is situated on the southeast side of Plaza 2. The structure consists of a central pyramidal base flanked by two attached range structures. The pyramidal base is topped by a shrine containing three rooms, the final room of the three is circular. The temple has three steep stairways flanked by balustrades. The main stairway ascends directly from the plaza, those on either side are perpendicular to the main stairway. The balustrade of each stairway terminates at the top in a <b>vertical</b> <b>panel.</b> The temple facade is in good condition although {{the roof of the}} temple is missing. The range structures are unequal in size and each contains a single long room atop a low platform. The facade of each of these rooms once possessed a row of columns although only stumps remain in situ. This temple-palace is K'iche' in style and has been identified with the Nija'ib' lineage of the K'iche', being very similar to the Temple of Awilix at Q'umarkaj. A tomb was excavated in Structure 4, it consisted of a complete skeleton with associated offerings that included two tripod earthenware bowls, one with duck effigies, a tripod incense burner, a flint knife, nine obsidian knives, five jade beads and some fragments of gold.|$|E

25|$|After {{the sale}} of the Number Two car, TVR began work on Number Three, which again used the same chassis and {{suspension}} design. Instead of the sidevalve Ford engine, it was fitted with the 1200cc 40hp OHV four-cylinder engine from an Austin A40. This car was painted yellow, and in contrast to the rounded bodywork of the first and second cars, it was styled with a blunt nose and a squarish <b>vertical</b> <b>panel</b> as the grille. Driven by Wilkinson in a number of car club events (such as sprints and hillclimbs) in 1952 and 1953, the car was quick enough to earn several awards. It was during these club events that one David Hives was introduced to the TVR management, and he would become a key TVR employee a decade later. Hives helped set up the production line at Griffith Motors in Syosset, New York.|$|E
500|$|Temple 2 (also {{known as}} Structure 2) is a tiered {{pyramidal}} platform {{on the west}} side of Plaza A. It has a stairway that climbs the east side of the structure, providing access from the plaza. Structure 2 faces the sunrise on the summer solstice. The structure is the best preserved of the excavated temples. Like many buildings at Iximche it had three construction phases dating, from oldest to newest, from the reigns of Wuqu-Batz', Oxlahuh Tz'i' and Hun-Iq'. The earliest of these phases was located by archaeologists tunnelling into the interior of the structure. It is poorly preserved because the facing stones were stripped in order to be reused. The middle phase is the best preserved of the three phases of construction and consisted of four stepped tiers supporting high talud-tablero style walls consisting of a sloping wall topped by a <b>vertical</b> <b>panel.</b> The temple had recessed corners and a steep stairway climbed to the topmost tier, at the top of the stair was a [...] sacrificial altar measuring [...] wide by [...] deep. The altar was made from stone and stucco and the top was slightly concave, it is of a type used in human sacrifice.|$|E

5000|$|The word bulki meant [...] "cargo" [...] in Old Norse.

50|$|Crane's Sunday {{pictures}} are carefully, lovingly, drawn, every panel composed {{to tell the}} story while sustaining the illusion of time and place. And the pages themselves are artful designs, irregular albeit nonetheless pleasing patterns of panels rather than uniform grids. But these layouts are not simply designs: they were devised to give visual impact to the story. When Crane drew Easy at the brink of a cliff, he gave depth to the scene by depicting it in a <b>vertical</b> <b>panel</b> that is two- or three-tiers tall. When Easy leads a cavalry charge or paddles a canoe down a lazy river, the panel is as wide as the page, giving panoramic sweep to the scene depicted.|$|E

The Prophet is made of metal planes, structured around a central axis formed by the head, spine and legs. The feet of the figure are flatly planted on the rectangular base. The artist's signature is inscribed {{on the top of the}} base, in between the figure's feet, and reads, [...] "P. Gargallo 4/7."
