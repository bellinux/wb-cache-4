40|$|AbstractObjectiveDeep thigh veins, {{including}} the superficial femoral, superficial femoropopliteal, and profunda femoris veins, are versatile autogenous conduits for arterial reconstruction. Although late venous complications are unusual, deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> may induce severe venous hypertension and predispose the limb to acute compartment syndrome. The {{purpose of this}} study was to define the frequency of fasciotomy in patients undergoing deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> and to identify clinical predictors of the need for fasciotomy after deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest.</b> MethodsOver 9 years, 162 patients underwent arterial reconstruction with deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvested</b> from 264 limbs. Indications for deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> included aortofemoral reconstruction in 127 patients, brachiocephalic arterial reconstruction in 22 patients, and visceral arterial reconstruction in 13 patients. ResultsFasciotomy was performed in 47 of 264 limbs (17. 8 %) after deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest.</b> The prevalence of fasciotomy after deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> was 20. 6 % for patients requiring aortofemoral reconstruction, whereas no patients underwent fasciotomy after deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> for mesenteric or brachiocephalic arterial reconstruction (P =. 0068). Fasciotomy was performed in 20. 7 % of limbs after complete deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> to a level below the adductor hiatus, but no fasciotomies were performed in patients undergoing subtotal deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest,</b> ending above the adductor hiatus (P =. 0023). The mean preoperative ankle-brachial index (ABI) was significantly lower in limbs requiring fasciotomy (ABI, 0. 39 ± 0. 05), compared with patients who did not require fasciotomy (ABI, 0. 79 ± 0. 02; P <. 0001). Fasciotomy was performed in 76. 0 % of limbs undergoing concurrent ipsilateral greater saphenous vein (GSV) and deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest,</b> compared with 11. 7 % of patients undergoing deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> alone (P <. 0001). The mean volume of intraoperative fluid administered to patients requiring fasciotomy was almost 50 % higher than the fluid resuscitation received by patients who did not require fasciotomy (9. 6 ± 1. 2 L vs 6. 5 ± 0. 6 L; P <. 0001). Logistic regression analysis determined that lower preoperative ABI (odds ratio [OR], 60. 1; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 12. 5 - 289. 3; P <. 0001) and concurrent harvest of the ipsilateral GSV (OR, 9. 9; 95 % CI, 3. 1 - 31. 3; P <. 0001) were predictors of the need for fasciotomy. ConclusionsOne in four patients undergoing deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> for aortofemoral reconstruction may be expected to develop acute compartment syndrome and require fasciotomy. The risk appears to be greatest in patients with severe lower extremity ischemia and in patients undergoing simultaneous GSV and deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest.</b> Prophylactic fasciotomy may be appropriate in patients with both risk factors, but vigilance for the development of compartment syndrome after deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> is required in all patients undergoing deep <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> for aortofemoral reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|While {{traditional}} open <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> {{was related}} to postoperative wound complications, endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> was developed to minimize the morbidity in the greater saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> procedure. In this study, these two procedures were compared for postoperative wound healing and long-term graft patency. We reviewed all consecutive patients undergoing elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting from January 2004 to December 2005 and collected data regarding wound complications and coronary events. Wound complications included dehiscence, excessive discharge, edema, altered sensation, cellulitis, hematoma, pain scale, and superficial and deep wound infection. Coronary events were defined as diagnosis of myocardial infarction during the first year’s follow-up. A total of 392 patients were included in our series, among whom 44 {{were excluded from the}} study due to emergent operation, preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump support, or the greater saphenous vein varicose characteristic, 78 belonged to open <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> group, and 270 to endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> group. Wound complications were significantly less in the endoscopic group (5. 2 %) compared to the open group (19. 2 %) (P= 0. 0002). There was no significant difference on preoperative risk factors, total operative time, or hospitalization days. During one-year follow-up, both the early and late graft patency rates were similar between the two groups. Endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> is safe and effective, which carries less risk for wound complications and is associated with better satisfaction and cosmetic result than the traditional greater saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> procedure. The endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> also demonstrates a great long-term patency...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveResidual clot strands {{within the}} excised saphenous vein are an {{increasingly}} recognized sequela of endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest.</b> We hypothesized that endoscopic visualization facilitated by sealed carbon dioxide insufflation causes stagnation of blood within the saphenous vein. In {{the absence of}} prior heparin administration, this stasis provokes clot formation. MethodsForty consecutive patients having coronary artery bypass grafting underwent endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> using sealed (Guidant VasoView, n = 30; Guidant Corp, Minneapolis, Minn) or open (Datascope ClearGlide, n = 10; Datascope Corp, Montvale, NJ) carbon dioxide insufflation followed by ex vivo assessment of intraluminal saphenous vein clot via optical coherence tomography. In the sealed carbon dioxide insufflation groups, clot formation was compared with (preheparinized, n = 20) and without (control, n = 10) heparin administration before endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest,</b> either at a fixed dose or titrated to an activated clotting time greater than 300 seconds. Risk factors for clot formation were assessed. ResultsResidual saphenous vein clot was a universal finding in control veins (sealed carbon dioxide insufflation endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> without preheparinization). At either dose used, heparin given before endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> significantly decreased saphenous vein clot burden. A similar reduction in clot was observed when using open carbon dioxide insufflation endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> without preheparinization. Intraoperative blood loss and blood product requirements were similar in all groups. Patient age and preoperative maximum amplitude of the thrombelastography tracing showed a linear correlation with saphenous vein clot volume. ConclusionBy enabling the quantification of this issue as never before possible, optical coherence tomography screening revealed that intraluminal saphenous vein clot is frequently found after endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest.</b> Systemic heparinization before harvest or an open carbon dioxide endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> system are benign changes in practice that can significantly lessen this complication...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: The greater {{saphenous vein}} {{is a common}} conduit for {{coronary}} revascularizations. Traditional <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> uses long incision(s) {{that can lead to}} significant morbidities. A minimally invasive technique has been developed that allows the harvest of much of the saphenous vein with one incision and fewer morbidities. Methods: Our technique and outcomes on 110 patients with minimally invasive harvest (endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting)</b> is presented. Comparisons are made with an equivalent retrospective group within the same hospital and to a smaller (n = 28) prospective group at other hospitals. Results: Endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> has evolved to one above-knee incision of 3 cm length that allows for the harvest of 35 cm of vein. Harvest times were longer for endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting,</b> showed a learning curve, and appeared to reach a baseline of 35 minutes. Incision closure times were less for the endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> group. Total skin to skin operating times for the entire cardiovascular procedure did not differ between the groups. In relatively homogeneous populations, leg infection rates did not differ, but other leg morbidities were less for the patients who underwent endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Hospital readmissions for leg wound care were low in both groups although the number of office visits required for leg care was higher for patients undergoing traditional <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Pain perception by the patients was much less for the endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> and remained lower for up to 4 weeks.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveGreater saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> for {{coronary}} {{and lower}} extremity bypass requires the longest incision of any surgical procedure. Endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> allows better results in some clinical variables compared to open harvesting techniques. The {{objective of this}} study is to present the results of a systematic review of the scientific evidence about the efficiency of endoscopic saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest.</b> MethodsWe performed a systematic review in the bibliographical databases Pubmed, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and NHS Health Technology Assessment Database. The search strategy was “endoscopic AND harvesting”, in the period January 1970 –December 2009.

MethodsPaired segments of great saphenous <b>veins</b> <b>harvested</b> either with conventional harvesting technique or no-touch technique were obtained from 9 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Quantitative measurements, using immunohistochemistry and morphometry, were performed. Ultrastructural analyses of vasa vasorum were performed with electron microscopy. Video footage of superficial vasa vasorum in an implanted saphenous <b>vein</b> graft <b>harvested</b> with the no-touch technique was captured during a coronary bypass operation and is presented for online viewing. ResultsThe total area of vasa vasorum in <b>vein</b> grafts <b>harvested</b> with the conventional technique was significantly reduced both in the media (P = . 007) and in the adventitia (P = . 014) compared with <b>vein</b> grafts <b>harvested</b> with the no-touch technique. Ultrastructural findings indicated that the no-touch technique preserved an intact vasa vasorum whereas the conventional technique did not. Video footage showed retrograde flow in the vasa vasorum in <b>vein</b> graft <b>harvested</b> with the no-touch technique. ConclusionsThese findings show that the no-touch technique for saphenous <b>vein</b> graft <b>harvesting</b> for coronary bypass grafting preserves an intact vasa vasorum.

40|$|Mohammad Salman Siddiqi Cardiothoracic Surgery Division, Department of Surgery, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman Abstract: Coronary artery bypass {{grafting}} is {{a commonly}} performed surgery worldwide that gives good results. Great saphenous vein {{is used as}} a conduit for bypass in over 95 % cases. The harvesting technique has remained unchanged over the years. However, wound complications from harvesting the great saphenous vein by open method can be a major source of postoperative morbidity. With the objective of preventing major complications, identification of risk factors for saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> site infection is important. It is imperative to develop approaches that prevent infection and to allow for early recognition of patients who are at high risk and who may need more watchful monitoring so as to prevent development of wound complications. It is desirable to assess the patient completely, delineate the anatomy of peripheral vessels particularly in a patient with associated peripheral vascular disease, identify the best site to perform the saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> incision, employ a meticulous surgical technique, recognize complications early, and start the recommended treatment without delay.

40|$|BackgroundWound {{complications}} after infrainguinal vein bypass {{remain a}} {{significant source of}} morbidity. Endoscopic saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> has emerged as a viable alternative to minimize <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> incisions. MethodsInfrainguinal bypass using endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> was performed in 214 limbs in 197 consecutive patients between May 1998 and July 2004. The indication for bypass was limb salvage in 88. 3 %, claudication in 9. 3 %, and other in 2. 4 %. Atherosclerotic risk factors were prevalent, with diabetes mellitus in 68 % and dialysis-dependent renal failure in 11. 7 %. ResultsThe procedure was successful in all but one patient. This patient was early in the series and had a friable varicose vein. Ipsilateral greater saphenous vein was used in 89. 7 %, contralateral greater saphenous vein in 8. 4 %, and lesser saphenous vein in 1. 9 %. Two injuries to the main trunk of the vein occurred early in the series. Assisted primary patency at a mean follow-up of 18 months (range, 1 to 48 months) is 77. 2 % by life-table analysis. For patients with claudication, rest pain, or minimal gangrene, the average length of stay was 3. 15 days (range, 1 to 6 days). Wound complications occurred in 16 patients (7. 5 %), 10 of these required only local care (class I and II), and 6 had deep wounds threatening the leg or graft (class III). Only 5 patients, all with class III wounds, required readmission to the hospital for graft-related problems. There is no increase in operating room time once the learning curve is overcome. Patient satisfaction is very high. ConclusionEndoscopic saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> is a useful adjunct to infrainguinal vein bypass, with short length-of-hospital stay, few wound complications, and low hospital readmission rates. Endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> is recommended as the procedure of choice for vein procurement for infrainguinal bypass procedures...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveWe {{describe}} and report our results using endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> (EVH) for lower extremity arterial bypass procedures, following {{the implementation of}} technical modifications specific to patients undergoing limb salvage procedures. MethodsWe underwent training in EVH, followed by implementation of the technique in patients requiring limb salvage for lower extremity ischemia and aneurysms. After technical modifications in the technique were developed for limb salvage, we reviewed our experience in all patients who underwent minimally invasive distal bypass with EVH. ResultsTechnical modifications include limited arterial dissection before <b>vein</b> <b>harvest,</b> the use of proximal and distal leg incisions for both exposure of arterial vessels and saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest,</b> improved hemostasis techniques in the vein graft tunnel, avoidance of compression wraps to the ipsilateral harvest tunnel, complete removal of the vein with either reversed or nonreversed graft placement, {{and use of the}} endoscopic tunnel for conduit placement. Thirteen patients (14 limbs) have undergone minimally invasive distal bypass since technical modifications were implemented. Indications for EVH were rest pain (n = 12; 85. 7 %) and tissue loss (n = 8; 57. 1 %). <b>Veins</b> <b>harvested</b> were the ipsilateral great saphenous vein (n = 10; 71. 4 %), contralateral great saphenous vein (n = 2; 14. 3 %), and short saphenous vein (n = 2; 14. 3 %). No venous injuries occurred during endoscopic harvest, and all were used for bypass. Thirty-day primary and primary assisted patency rates were 85. 7 % and 92. 9 %, respectively. The limb salvage rate was 100 %. Two patients developed postoperative hematomas, one early and one late, as a result of anticoagulation for cardiac comorbidities. Both patients required reoperation for successful re-establishment of patency. There were no perioperative deaths and no postoperative wound infections or complications. Two patients required a later prosthetic bypass, and two required a vein graft angioplasty. Complete wound healing was achieved in 75 % of patients with preoperative tissue loss. ConclusionsTechnical modifications in endoscopic saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> techniques facilitate their use in lower extremity limb salvage procedures. Vascular surgeons should become familiar with these techniques to minimize <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> wound complications and extend the options for limb salvage conduits, including use of both the ipsilateral and contralateral saphenous vein and the short saphenous vein. Meticulous hemostasis within the tunnel after endoscopic conduit harvest and avoidance of postoperative anticoagulation should help to prevent postoperative hematoma formation and early graft occlusion...|$|R
40|$|Saphenous vein grafts are {{the most}} common {{conduits}} used for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); however, no more than 60 % of vein grafts remain open after 10 years and graft failure is associated with poor clinical outcome. The “no-touch” harvesting technique—where a sheet of perivascular tissue is retained around the vein—improves graft patency to over 80 % after 16 years of follow-up, but the mechanism for the improved patency rate is unclear. In this study, we investigated acute functional differences between <b>vein</b> grafts <b>harvested</b> conventionally and by “no-touch” technique and explored the importance of perivascular tissue for reducing surgical trauma, minimizing excessive distension, and releasing vasoactive paracrine factors. Segments of human saphenous veins were obtained from CABG surgery and their functional properties investigated by isometric and isobaric myography. We found a broad diameter-tension relationship for human saphenous veins, with peak capacity for active tension development at diameters corresponding to transmural pressures around 60 mmHg. Across the investigated transmural pressure range between 10 and 120 mmHg, maximal tension development was higher for “no-touch” compared to conventionally <b>harvested</b> saphenous <b>veins.</b> Contractile responses to serotonin, noradrenaline, and depolarization induced with elevated extracellular [K+] were significantly larger for saphenous <b>veins</b> <b>harvested</b> by “no-touch” compared to conventional technique. Conventional vein grafts are routinely pressurized manually in order to test for leaks; however, avoiding this distension procedure did not change the acute contractile function of the conventionally excised saphenous veins. In contrast, even though surgical removal of perivascular tissue during conventional harvesting was associated with a substantial decrease in force development, removal of perivascular tissue by careful dissection under a stereomicroscope only marginally affected contractile responses of <b>veins</b> <b>harvested</b> by “no-touch” technique. In conclusion, we show that saphenous <b>veins</b> <b>harvested</b> by “no-touch” technique have greater contractile capacity than <b>veins</b> <b>harvested</b> by conventional technique. The different capacity for smooth muscle contraction is not due to vasoactive substances released by the perivascular tissue. Instead, we propose that the larger tension development of saphenous <b>veins</b> <b>harvested</b> by “no-touch” technique reflects reduced surgical damage, which may have long-term consequences that contribute to the superior graft patency...|$|R

The objective of our study is to determine the difference in wound complication and infection rates between two saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> techniques, long incision versus multiple short interrupted incisions (tunneling) for coronary artery bypass grafting at the King Abdullah University Hospital - Jordan. METHODS: Retrospectively we analyzed data from 1, 050 consecutive elective coronary artery bypass procedures performed from May 5, 2003, to December 31, 2007, in our institution. Saphenectomy using traditional Long incision <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> (Group 1) performed in six hundred and fifty patients (n= 650), while saphenectomy using multiple incisions with small skin bridges - tunneling (Group 2) performed in four hundred patients (n= 400). Saphenectomy performed by the cardiac surgery assistant or main cardiac surgeon. Inflammation, dehiscence, cellulites, lymphangitis, drainage, necrosis, or abscess necessitating dressing, antibiotics or debridement before complete healing without eschar were defined as wound complications. There was no statistical difference in preoperative risk factors in both groups. Test results were considered significant when P< 0. 05.

40|$|ObjectiveIn {{this study}} we aim to assess the {{cost-effectiveness}} analysis of minimally invasive <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting.</b> The great saphenous vein is {{the most commonly used}} conduit in coronary artery bypass surgery. In the past decade minimally invasive techniques have been developed to reduce the surgical trauma associated with the conventional open vein-harvesting technique. There is strong evidence to suggest that minimally invasive harvesting can reduce postoperative wound healing complications, pain, mobility restriction, and hospital stay. Despite the increasingly widespread use of this technique, formal cost-effectiveness analysis has never been performed. MethodsEconomic analysis was performed according to the National Institute of Healthcare and Clinical Excellence guidelines on the evaluation of technology by using published data on postoperative pain and mobility restriction, locally collected data, National Health Service reference costs, and manufacturer's data. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate and quantify the uncertainty associated with the results of our analysis. ResultsThe results of our analysis demonstrate that minimally invasive <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> was more cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $ 19, 858. 87 /quality-adjusted life year (QALY), comparing favorably with other health care interventions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated with 95. 6 % certainty that endoscopic harvesting was more cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $ 50, 000 /quality-adjusted life year. Alternative analysis suggested that even with considerable uncertainty associated with quality of life after <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting,</b> minimally invasive harvesting was more cost-effective than conventional <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting.</b> ConclusionMinimally invasive harvesting is the most cost-effective method of harvesting the great saphenous vein and can significantly improve a patient's quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{coronary}} artery bypass grafting surgery, arterial conduits are preferred because of more favourable long-term patency and outcome. Anyway the greater saphenous vein {{continues to be the}} most commonly used bypass conduit. Minimally invasive endoscopic saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> is increasingly being investigated {{in order to reduce the}} morbidity associated with conventional open <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting,</b> includes postoperative leg wound complications, pain and patient satisfaction. However, to date the short and the long-term benefits of the endoscopic technique remain controversial. This study provides an interesting opportunity to address this gap in the literature. Methods/Design Endoscopic Saphenous harvesting with an Open CO 2 System trial includes two parallel <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> arms in {{coronary artery}} bypass grafting surgery. It is an interventional, single centre, prospective, randomized, safety/efficacy, cost/effectiveness study, in adult patients with elective planned and first isolated coronary artery disease. A simple size of 100 patients for each arm will be required to achieve 80 % statistical power, with a significant level of 0. 05, for detecting most of the formulated hypotheses. A six-weeks leg wound complications rate was assumed to be 20 % in the conventional arm and less of 4 % in the endoscopic arm. Previously quoted studies suggest a first-year vein-graft failure rate of about 20 % with an annual occlusion rate of 1 % to 2 % in the first six years, with practically no difference between the endoscopic and conventional approaches. Similarly, the results on event-free survival rates for the two arms have barely a 2 - 3 % gap. Assuming a 10 % drop-out rate and a 5 % cross-over rate, the goal is to enrol 230 patients from a single Italian cardiac surgery centre. Discussion The goal of this prospective randomized trial is to compare and to test improvement in wound healing, quality of life, safety/efficacy, cost-effectiveness, short and long-term outcomes and vein-graft patency after endoscopic open CO 2 harvesting system versus conventional <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting.</b> The expected results are of high clinical relevance and will show the safety/efficacy or non-inferiority of one treatment approach in terms of <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> for {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting surgery.

40|$|Background: Endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> (EVH) was {{introduced}} in 1996 {{as an alternative to}} open <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> (OVH) for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries utilizing the saphenous vein. EVH has been shown to decrease post operative pain, wound complications, and length of hospital stay. Although EVH has become the preferred method of saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest,</b> the effect of EVH on graft patency has not been well studied. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2009 concluded that EVH was independently linked to increased morbidity and decreased graft patency. This surprising conclusion was not endorsed by the cardiothoracic community. Much debate about the effect of EVH on graft patency has ensued, however, surgical practice appears to have remained unchanged. The potential harm of EVH must be weighed against its proven benefits {{in the light of the}} large number of patients that undergo EVH annually as the predominant mode of saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> Methods: An exhaustive literature search was performed using OVID, Web of knowledge, EBMR, CINAHL, and clinicaltrials. gov with the following search terms: coronary artery bypass graft, endoscopy, saphenous vein, graft occlusion, and vascular patency. Three studies were identified; two randomized controlled trials and one retrospective cohort study. Several trials examining graft patency in comparing EVH to OVH that utilized clinical outcomes (such as myocardial infarction, revascularization, stroke or death) as surrogate endpoints were excluded. Results: Of the three included studies, two studies determined that there was no statistical significance in occlusion rates when comparing EVH to OVH grafts. One study, referenced above, did determine statistically significant higher occlusion rates in EVH grafts as compared to OVH grafts. Conclusion: Further research is needed to adequately explore the relationship between EVH and graft patency associated morbidity. Such research would need to address many confounding variables while including a large sample population with angiography patency measurements at predetermined time points. The limited state of current research has failed to demonstrate statistically significant harm that may otherwise persuade the Society for Thoracic Surgery to ignore the important proven benefits of EVH over OVH. At this juncture, EVH remains the predominant method of saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> for patients undergoing CABG surgery...|$|R

Forty patients were prospectively randomized into either a minimally invasive (minimal) or traditional (open) saphenous vein harvest group. Smooth muscle contractile function was assessed by responses to potassium chloride and phenylephrine. Endothelial cell function was assessed by responses to serial escalations in concentration of acetylcholine, bradykinin, calcium ionophore, sodium nitroprusside, and n-nitro-l-arginine using isometric tension studies. Results. Harvest times were similar for both groups. The total incision length in the minimal group was significantly shorter than in the open group. There were no differences in smooth muscle contractions to either receptor-independent or receptor-mediated agonists between the two groups. Similarly, vasorelaxation in response to both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent agonists were similar in both groups. Conclusions. Minimally invasive saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> is associated with similar medial smooth muscle and endothelial function as open harvesting. These findings suggest that minimally invasive harvesting techniques can be used without major detrimental effects on vascular integrity...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Minimal {{invasive}} endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> has not gained widespread acceptance although potential {{improvements in}} wound healing and patient comfort are undebatable. The main objections to routine application have been impaired graft quality and prolonged operation time. The feasibility of introducing the minimal invasive approach to <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> into a high volume cardiac bypass surgery program {{was to be}} investigated in 1400 patients. Methods: Our preferred technique is based on standard videoscopic equipment for endoscopic surgery. No disposables are used. The subcutaneous tissue above the saphenous vein is tunnelled by exclusively sharp dissection. No shear stresses are applied to the vein graft or its side branches. Side branches are closed by clips or bipolar coagulation. The differences between endoscopic and conventional surgical <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> with regard to operation time, graft quality, wound healing disturbances and postoperative pain were compared in two groups of 300 concurrently operated patients. Subsequently, a further 1100 patients underwent endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting,</b> giving a total experience of 1400 endoscopic procedures. Results: After a learning curve of approximately 100 procedures for an experienced surgeon, harvesting time using minimal invasive techniques was 16 ^ 4 min/graft vs. 10 ^ 2 min for the conventional technique (P, 0 : 01). Severe wound healing disturbances requiring re-intervention were observed in 0. 1 % following endoscopic harvesting, moderate wound healing disturbances were observed in 1. 7 % of patients. By comparison, conventional harvesting led to severe wound healing disturbances in 5 % and to moderate disturbances in 8 % (P, 0 : 05). Incidence of peri-operative myocardial infarction as an indirect measure of graft quality was 1. 7 % with endoscopic vs. 2. 3 % (n. s.) with conventional technique. Earl...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives to {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} possible reasons for major wound complications at the saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> site {{in patients with}} peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Design retrospective study. Material and methods fifteen consecutive patients admitted to the vascular department for impaired healing at the saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> site after successful coronary bypass artery grafting (CABG) (Group A) were evaluated for medical, perioperative, laboratory and pathological factors and outcome. Findings were compared with those in 15 matched controls followed in the outpatient clinic after CABG (Group B). Results absence of pedal pulses in the affected leg was noted in 13 patients in group A and 3 patients in group B. Ankle brachial index ranged from 0. 4 – 0. 7 in group A and 1. 7 – 1. 1 in group B; corresponding ankle pressures were 40 – 100 mmHg (mean 60 mmHg) and 80 – 160 mmHg (mean 110 mmHg). All patients in group A had PAD, whereas none did in group B, and all patients in group A required intervention to save the leg. Wound healing was noted in 11 group A patients; four patients underwent below-knee amputation. Conclusion saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> from limbs with severe PAD can lead to significant morbidity, including limb loss. In patients lacking a palpable pedal pulse, we recommend harvesting only the proximal saphenous vein...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} effects of prophylactic use of calcium dobesilate on complications of saphenectomy after saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> for coronary artery bypass graft. Materials and Methods: A total of consequtive 209 patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting were divided into two groups. Group 1 included 98 patients who received calcium dobesilate 2 x 500 mg for three months. Group 2 had 111 patients who did not recieve calcium dobesilate. Leg wound complications were analyzed in the postoperative first week, first and third month. Results: The difference of diameter in the first and third month, the incidence of sellulitis in the first week and first month, and superficial wound infections in the first week were significantly lower in the group of patients treated with calcium dobesilate. Conclusion: Our study showed that use of calcium dobesilate 2 x 500 mg during three months can decrease complications of saphenectomy after saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> in coronary artery bypass graft...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of a recent reoperative median {{sternotomy}} foraortic valve replacement in a patient who had a previous quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery, an injury to one of the previously placed vein grafts occurred. We needed to repair this injury with an interposition vein graft. The physician assistant (PA) assigned to the case was asked to harvest a short section of the greater saphenous vein. Because of the urgency of the situation, an open <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> (OVH) was thought to be the quickest way. The PA looked at me speechless {{with a great deal of}} apprehension.

40|$|Background: Gamma {{interferon}} (IFN-γ) {{is produced}} by activated natural killer and T cells under pathologic circumstances. The objective of our study was to compare the level of IFN-γ in open and endoscopic methods of <b>vein</b> <b>harvesting</b> for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Method: Ninety samples of human saphenous veins harvested from patients prepared for CABG. Pre- and postprocedure sera of the patients, in addition to supernatants of 3 -day endothelial cell culture, were analyzed for IFN-γ. Results: The mean preoperative IFN-γ level (0. 09 ± 0. 03 pg/mL) and that for postoperative sera (0. 08 ± 0. 02 pg/mL) {{were not significantly different}} (P = 0. 2). The mean IFN-γ level in endothelial cell culture from the endoscopic (0. 18 ± 0. 21 pg/mL) and the open method (0. 19 ± 0. 39 pg/mL) were not significant (P = 0. 89).

40|$|Open {{saphenous vein}} {{technique}} {{is the standard}} of care in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery (CABG) worldwide and in Saudi Arabia. Endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> (EVH) is an innovative technique that have been recommended by the international society of minimally invasive surgery. Our aim {{in the current study}} is to review our preliminary data about endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest.</b> Would endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> decrease the incidence of leg wound infections? This is a retrospective study of a single tertiary care center of 94 consecutive patients who underwent CABG with EVH. Preoperative associated risk factors were assessed. Postoperative follow up includes leg wound infection and patient satisfaction with EVH by using a telephone and/or a paper questionnaire. We had 94 consecutive patients who underwent CABG with EVH between October 2014 and October 2015, mean age was 56. 7 (33 – 77) years, 91. 5 % were male, mean euro score II was 2. 47 %. The most common presentation was NSTEMI (39. 4 %) followed by STEMI (26. 6 %), unstable angina (11. 7 %) and stable angina (5. 3 %). Our cohort had the following characteristics: 85. 1 % were diabetic, 84 % were hypertensive, 46. 8 % had dyslipidemia, 2. 1 % had CVA, 7. 4 % had Carotid artery disease, 2. 1 % had Congestive heart failure, 4. 3 % had any renal disease and 4. 3 % had previous PCI. Most of our patients received 3 grafts (44. 7 %) followed by 4 grafts (42. 6 %) of which only one leg was used for EVH (94. 1 %). Leg wound infection occurred in one patient only and in this case EVH was converted to open technique. A written and/or telephone questionnaire resulted in a high patient-satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome of EVH as well as very low grade of leg wound pain. EVH is a very promising innovative technique in patient undergoing CABG. Our patients were highly satisfied with their leg wound cosmetic outcome. In this single center experience, in Saudi Arabia, EVH is a promising innovative technique for saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest.</b> It is highly recommended that cardiac centers in Saudi Arabia embrace such less invasive technology...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundMinimal {{incision}} {{techniques for}} <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> may lessen wound complications after lower extremity revascularization, but long-term patency and limb salvage data are limited. MethodsThis retrospective case-control study used a computerized vascular registry set {{in an academic}} vascular surgical practice. All patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization using autogenous reversed great saphenous vein by a single vascular surgeon in a 10 -year period were reviewed. Harvest of great saphenous vein via long single incision (SI) in 133 patients was compared with minimal incisions with endoscopy (MIE) in 85, or MI without endoscopy in 106. The main outcome measures were primary and secondary graft patency by Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis and cumulative sum failure (CUSUM). Secondary outcomes of interest were limb salvage and wound complications. ResultsNo differences were observed between MIE, MI, and SI patients for demographic data, risk factors, or primary indications, including claudication, rest pain, ischemic ulcer, and gangrene. Endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> patients {{were significantly more likely}} than MI or SI to be women and more likely to use tobacco. Primary patency at 5 years was better after SI <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> (59 %) than with either MI (33 %, P =. 004) or MIE (44 %, P =. 045) techniques, although both MI groups had a higher proportion of bypass grafts to the popliteal artery. Similarly, cumulative secondary patency was better after SI (66 %) than with MI (47 %, P =. 045), but not MIE (58 %, P =. 45). Differences in limb salvage at 5 years in SI (73 %) were not statistically superior to either MI (59 %, P =. 24) or MIE (58 %, P =. 13). No learning curve for MI or MIE vein grafts was evident by CUSUM for primary patency at 12 months. No differences in wound complication rates were observed for SI (9 %), MI (10 %), or MIE (6 %) grafts (P =. 54). ConclusionsGraft patency and limb salvage deteriorated during the time when MI or MIE techniques of great saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> were adopted. This observation raises concern about the advisability of limiting the extent of the incision at the potential cost of compromised outcomes without an obvious advantage in limiting wound complications...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{insufflation}} {{was used}} by some devices for endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> to create a subcutaneous tunnel and facilitate the <b>vein</b> <b>harvest.</b> In the literature, some cases of CO 2 micro- and macro-embolisms or hypercarbia during this procedure are described. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate if the use of an open CO 2 system rather than a sealed system might be asso-ciated with different CO 2 absorption during the procedure. METHODS: Patients were randomized into two groups: those patients in the first group were submitted to endoscopic <b>vein</b> <b>harvest</b> using a sealed CO 2 insufflation; in the second group, the harvest was undertaken with an open CO 2 insufflation. Partial pressure of CO 2 in the arterial blood (PaCO 2) and end-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2) was recorded following anaesthesia induction and before the endoscopic pro-cedure (T 0), every 10 min during the endoscopic step (T 1) and end after 10 min from the CO 2 insufflation termination (T 2). RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were enrolled. PaCO 2 increased significantly between T 0, T 1 and T 2 in both groups (P = 0. 0001) during the endoscopic harvest, but the PaCO 2 level was significantly higher in the group that used the sealed system (44. 5 ± 7. 9 vs 39. 7 ± 7. 9 mmHg) at the end of the procedure (P = 0. 01). No significant differences between end-tidal CO 2 measured at the same intervals between groups were detected. CONCLUSIONS: There was a constant increase in the blood gas concentration compared with the basal pre-procedure values. Sealed systems were associated with a significantly higher CO 2 concentration at the end of the procedure compared with the open ones...|$|R
