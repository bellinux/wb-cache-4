Work had previously been completed on this project by students of ENG 454 in 2009 and by Rhyss Edwards as part of his thesis “Control System Design and Commissioning of Photovoltaic Trough Concentrator Systems Installed at the Murdoch University South Street Campus” in 2010. The major focus of this thesis was to cover the communication and data transmission between the <b>variable</b> speed <b>drives,</b> servo <b>motors</b> and the Labview controller over a RS- 485 network. The final system is {{to be used as a}} learning tool for engineering students. During this thesis a large emphasis was placed on the research and documentation of the existing tracking system. Information regarding the <b>variable</b> speed <b>drives,</b> servo <b>motors</b> and RS- 485 communication was gathered in order to gain an understanding of how the system interacted. From here documents were produced regarding the installation of SEW VSD’s and controlling the solar tracking program in order to aid future students who may work on this project. Robust testing of the existing system was undertaken in order to discover any deficiencies that may be present.

40|$|SUMMARY: Complaints that {{electricity}} was affecting behavior, health, {{and milk}} production of dairy cows when voltages {{were less than}} Public Utility Commission (PUC) standards were investigated on 12 farms located in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. PUCs and utilities in some jurisdictions have adopted 0. 5 volt or 1. 0 milliampere at cow contact as actionable limits below which utilities would not respond to farmer complaints of stray voltage. Using power quality instruments common in the electrical industry, investigators found large numbers of transient electrical impulses, and higher than 60 Hertz frequency har-monics on power lines and in milking stalls. Milk production decreased {{as the number of}} transient events increased and as the sum of step potential voltages> 0. 01 Volt (peak to peak) increased. Leg movements (steps) of the cow increased/minute as voltage differentials increased. Milk production decreased as the number of 3 rd, 5 th, 7 th, 21 st and 42 nd harmonics increased in a multiple herd analysis. Transient voltages/currents were distorted, nonsinusoidal, impulses at various frequencies produced by nonlinear loads {{both on and off the}} farm.

50|$|The {{installation}} {{and integration of}} <b>variable</b> frequency <b>drives</b> can lower the energy consumption of the building's circulation pumps to about 15% {{of what they had}} been using before. A <b>variable</b> frequency <b>drive</b> functions by modulating the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor that it powers. In the USA, the electrical grid uses a frequency of 60 Hertz or 60 cycles per second. <b>Variable</b> frequency <b>drives</b> are able to decrease the output and energy consumption of motors by lowering the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor, however the relationship between motor output and energy consumption is not a linear one. If the <b>variable</b> frequency <b>drive</b> provides electricity to the motor at 30 Hertz, the output of the motor will be 50% because 30 Hertz divided by 60 Hertz is 0.5 or 50%. The energy consumption of a motor running at 50% or 30 Hertz will not be 50%, but will instead be something like 18% because the relationship between motor output and energy consumption are not linear. The exact ratios of motor output or Hertz provided to the motor (which are effectively the same thing), and the actual energy consumption of the <b>variable</b> frequency <b>drive</b> / <b>motor</b> combination depend on the efficiency of the <b>variable</b> frequency <b>drive.</b> For example, because the <b>variable</b> frequency <b>drive</b> needs power itself to communicate with the building automation system, run its cooling fan, etc., if the motor always ran at 100% with the <b>variable</b> frequency <b>drive</b> installed the cost of operation or electricity consumption would actually go up with the new <b>variable</b> frequency <b>drive</b> installed. The amount of energy that <b>variable</b> frequency <b>drives</b> consume is nominal and is hardly worth consideration when calculating savings, however it did need to be noted that VFD's do consume energy themselves. Because the <b>variable</b> frequency <b>drives</b> rarely ever run at 100% and {{spend most of their time}} in the 40% output range, and because now the pumps completely shut down when not needed, the <b>variable</b> frequency <b>drives</b> have reduced the energy consumption of the pumps to around 15% of what they had been using before.|$|R
40|$|A {{test rig}} {{designed}} to generate heat exchanger pressure drop information under oscillating flow conditions is described.

An important design feature of this rig is that it utilizes a single close coupled dynamic pressure transducer to measure the pressure drop across the test sample. This eliminates instrumentation difficulties associated with the pressure sensing lines common to differential pressure transducers. Another feature of the rig is that it utilizes a single displacement piston. This allows for testing of different sample lengths and configurations without hardware modifications.

40|$|<b>Variable</b> Speed <b>Drive</b> (VSD) <b>motors</b> allow {{building}} {{exhaust systems}} to operate more efficiently. It also, in principle, {{should lead to}} less noise due to a general reduction in fan speeds. Therefore, the National Research Council replaced old rooftop fans at one of its facilities, with fans selected for low-noise characteristics and equipped with VSD electric motors. Noise measurements were made {{on the roof of}} the building, at a distance of 5 m, with all three fans operating simultaneously and under identical controller conditions. The fitting of the acoustic absorptive lining was early in the investigation and not well documented. Anecdotal evidence comparing noise from the fans with lined enclosures to those with unlined enclosures, suggests that the differences were small and insignificant. A characteristic of this type of VSD controller is that noise is generated when high frequency components in the electrical power to the motor cause electromagnetic resonances in the stator of the electric motor.
