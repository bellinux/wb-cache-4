40|$|In a {{companion}} paper Demeulenaere et al. (2005), the cam-based centrifugal pendulum (CBCP) was introduced as a simple, cam-based, input torque balancing (ITB) mechanism. The differential equation that governs the CBCP cam design was derived and a methodology for solving it developed. Furthermore, in a de-sign example, the CBCP {{was applied to}} balance the input torque of a high-speed cam-follower mechanism, driving the sley of a <b>weaving</b> <b>loom.</b> The present pa-per rstly shows how the design parameters for this particular design example can be optimized, so as to obtain a compact and technologically feasible mechanism. The formulation of the optimization problem {{is based on a}} parameterization of the CBCP rotor and coupler shape. Because of its nonconvex nature, the optimization problem is solved using a multi-start Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) approach. A design chart, based on an exhaustive analysis, is introduced which (i) allows the designer to perform the design optimization in a quick and approx-imative way, and (ii) gives a lot of insight in the behavior of the SQP-algorithm. Secondly, the CBCP is applied to an industrial case study, that is, a <b>weaving</b> <b>loom.</b> The robustness of the CBCP is illustrated by showing that input torque balancing solely the sley movement enhances the overall dynamic machine behavior, despite the presence of the non-balanced shed motion. A particular contribution of this part is the determination of the <b>weaving</b> <b>loom</b> regime behavior in the frequency domain, an approach which is believed to be novel in mechanism literature...|$|R
