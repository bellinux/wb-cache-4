25|$|Told {{partly in}} flashback, {{it is the}} story of Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) and Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford). Their {{differences}} are immense: she is a stridently vocal Marxist Jew with strong anti-war opinions, and he is a carefree WASP with no particular political bent. While attending the same college, she is drawn to him because of his boyish good looks and his natural writing skill, which she finds captivating, although he does not work <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> it. He is intrigued by her conviction and her determination to persuade others to take up social causes. Their attraction is evident, but neither of them acts upon it, and they lose touch after graduation.|$|E

Lanying Lin studied <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> this primary school and often got the best grade in the class. But she was still required to do all the washing and cooking. As soon as she went back home, she started doing housework. At night, after finishing all her housework, she finally began studying and slept after 12 a.m. every day. And at six in the morning, she got up to cook and then went to school. At the age of six, she could only sleep six hours a day and this continued for her whole life.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{found her}} {{to be one of}} the show's most underrated contestants and called her a [...] "polished {{performer}} with enough sass to eschew her surname". Tim Cuprisin of Milwaukee Journal Sentinel criticized Trenyce's use of her mononomous stage name as [...] "a bit too slick even for a slick competition". Jan Jagodzinski argued in a 2005 book, however, that the name was an attempt to garner [...] "an American appeal", since her birth name Lashundra Cobbin is [...] "an impossible 'pop' signifier". Judge Simon Cowell said that he [...] "never really warmed" [...] to Trenyce, as she [...] "worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> her image – too hard".|$|E

500|$|Peter Velits was {{the first}} BMC rider to cross the finish line and was {{therefore}} awarded the red jersey {{as the leader of}} the race, although all the 198 riders were on the same time. He attributed the team's victory to the tactic of sacrificing several riders who rode <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of the stage, while the remaining riders held on to set the time. Velits had previous success in the Vuelta: he finished on the podium of the 2010 edition. Vincenzo Nibali (Astana) explained after the stage that his team had not attempted to win the stage because it was [...] "quite dangerous" [...] and there were [...] "a lot of vibrations from the different surfaces", with additional difficulty coming from the time trial bikes.|$|E

In January 1928, James Lees-Milne stayed as a guest of Churchill's son Randolph. He described an evening after dinner; [...] "We remained at that round table till after midnight. Mr Churchill spent a blissful two hours demonstrating with decanters and wine glasses how the Battle of Jutland was fought. He got worked up like a schoolboy, making barking noises in imitation of gunfire, and blowing cigar smoke across the battle scene in imitation of gun smoke". On 26 September 1927 Churchill composed the first of his Chartwell Bulletins, which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there. The 26 September letter opens with a report of Churchill's deepening interest in painting; [...] "Sickert arrived on Friday night and we worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> various paintings... I am really thrilled... I see my way to paint far better pictures than I ever thought possible before".|$|E
