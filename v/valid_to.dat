5|$|Having been {{ratified}} by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states (27 of the 36 states, including those {{that had been in}} rebellion), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become <b>valid,</b> <b>to</b> all intents and purposes, {{as a part of the}} Constitution. Included on the enrolled list of ratifying states were the three ex-Confederate states that had given their assent, but with strings attached. Seward accepted their affirmative votes and brushed aside their interpretive declarations without comment, challenge or acknowledgment.|$|E

His alma mater, SUNY Maritime College, hired him in a show of solidarity as a teacher aboard the T/S Empire State V the year after the incident with the Valdez. In 1997, he was working as a para-legal and maritime consultant with New York City's Chalos & Brown, the firm that represented him in his legal cases. He was residing in his native Long Island as of 1997.|$|E
5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult judgment call where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally <b>valid</b> <b>to</b> an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|E

If a subject provided a <b>valid</b> response <b>to</b> the severity of nausea question that was >[*] 0 but did not provide a <b>valid</b> response <b>to</b> the vomiting-episode question, this day was counted as a day of nausea/vomiting. If a subject provided a <b>valid</b> response <b>to</b> the vomiting-episode question that was >[*] 0 but did not provide a <b>valid</b> response <b>to</b> the nausea-severity question, this day was counted as a day of nausea/vomiting. If the answer to the number of vomiting episodes was 99 (the maximum allowable value on the eDiary spinner), then the data were considered missing.|$|R

25|$|In general, it is {{becoming}} less <b>valid</b> <b>to</b> regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also Transport in the Faroe Islands) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population.

25|$|The Earth's average surface {{absolute}} temperature for the 1961–1990 period has been derived by spatial interpolation of average observed near-surface air temperatures from over the land, oceans and sea ice regions, with a best estimate of 14°C (57.2°F). The estimate is uncertain, but probably lies within 0.5°C {{of the true}} value. Given the difference in uncertainties between this absolute value and any annual anomaly, it's not <b>valid</b> <b>to</b> add them together to imply a precise absolute value for a specific year.|$|E

25|$|Statistical {{techniques}} {{were used to}} determine which, if any, of the criteria were the best indicators of alcoholism. Surprisingly, the answer was that all criteria were of roughly equal importance. No particular indicator or cluster of indicators predominated: it was the number and frequency of problems that best defined alcoholism. More importantly, the medical, sociological, and behavioural criteria were equally reliable (i.e. highly correlated). In other words, it was equally <b>valid</b> <b>to</b> call alcoholism a medical or a behavioural disorder—evidence that doctors and sociologists are indeed talking about the same “unitary disorder”.|$|E
25|$|It is not <b>valid</b> <b>to</b> train a vine, gourd, or ivy {{to cover}} a sukkah and then cover it with sukkah {{covering}} (s'chach). If, however, the sukkah-covering exceeds the vine, gourd, or ivy in quantity, or if the vine, gourd, or ivy is detached, it is valid. The general rule is that one may not use for sukkah-covering anything that is susceptible to ritual impurity (tumah) or that does not grow from the soil. But one may use for sukkah-covering anything not susceptible to ritual impurity that grows from the soil.|$|E

25|$|The Reynolds number can {{be defined}} for several {{different}} situations where a fluid is in relative motion to a surface. These definitions generally include the fluid properties of density and viscosity, plus a velocity and a characteristic length or characteristic dimension (L in the above equation). This dimension {{is a matter of}} conventionnbsp&– for example radius and diameter are equally <b>valid</b> <b>to</b> describe spheres or circles, but one is chosen by convention. For aircraft or ships, the length or width can be used. For flow in a pipe or a sphere moving in a fluid the internal diameter is generally used today. Other shapes such as rectangular pipes or non-spherical objects have an equivalent diameter defined. For fluids of variable density such as compressible gases or fluids of variable viscosity such as non-Newtonian fluids, special rules apply. The velocity may also be a matter of convention in some circumstances, notably stirred vessels.|$|E

However, if the same test was performed on that person very recently, then {{the existence of the}} previous test is a contraindication for the test (a medically <b>valid</b> reason <b>to</b> not perform it).|$|R

25|$|In March 2003 the New York Law School Law Review {{published}} {{an examination of}} the critical reviews of Skeptical Environmentalist from the Scientific American, Nature and Science magazines by Professor of Law David Shoenbrod and then Senior Law Student Christi Wilson of New York Law School. The authors take the perspective of a court faced with an argument against hearing an expert witness in order to evaluate whether Lomborg was credible as an expert, and whether his testimony is <b>valid</b> <b>to</b> his expertise. They classify the types of criticisms leveled at Lomborg and his arguments, and proceed to evaluate each of the reasons given for disqualifying Lomborg. They conclude that a court should accept Lomborg as a credible expert in the field of statistics, and that his testimony was appropriately restricted to his area of expertise. Of course, Professor Shoenbrod and Wilson note, Mr. Lomborg's factual conclusions may not be correct, nor his policy proposals effective, but his criticisms should be addressed, not merely dismissed out of hand.|$|E
25|$|However, Amaryll Beatrice Chanady distinguishes magical realist {{literature}} from fantasy literature ("the fantastic") based on differences between three shared dimensions: {{the use of}} antinomy (the simultaneous presence of two conflicting codes), the inclusion of events that cannot be integrated into a logical framework, {{and the use of}} authorial reticence. In fantasy, the presence of the supernatural code is perceived as problematic, something that draws special attentionwhere in magical realism, the presence of the supernatural is accepted. In fantasy, while authorial reticence creates a disturbing effect on the reader, it works to integrate the supernatural into the natural framework in magical realism. This integration is made possible in magical realism as the author presents the supernatural as being equally <b>valid</b> <b>to</b> the natural. There is no hierarchy between the two codes. The ghost of Melquíades in Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude or the baby ghost in Toni Morrison's Beloved who visit or haunt the inhabitants of their previous residence are both presented by the narrator as ordinary occurrences; the reader, therefore, accepts the marvelous as normal and common.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{research}} on Attic vase painting owes {{a great deal}} to John D. Beazley. He began studying these vases in about 1910, making use of the method developed by the art historian Giovanni Morelli for studying paintings, which had been refined by Bernard Berenson. He assumed that each painter created original works which could always be unmistakably attributed. He made use of particular details such as faces, fingers, arms, legs, knees, and folds of clothing. Beazley studied 65,000 vases and fragments, of which 20,000 were black-figure. In the course of his studies, which lasted almost six decades, he could attribute 17,000 of them by name or by using a system of pragmatic names, and classified them into groups of painters or workshops, relationships and stylistic affinity. He identified over 1,500 potters and painters. No other archaeologist had such a decisive influence on the research of an archaeological field as did Beazley, whose analyses remain <b>valid</b> <b>to</b> a large extent up to the present time. After Beazley, scholars like John Boardman, Erika Simon and Dietrich von Bothmer investigated black-figure Attic vases.|$|E
