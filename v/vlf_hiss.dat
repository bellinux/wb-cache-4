40|$|Observations at Sanae, Antarctica of a {{pulsating}} aurora with a {{low light}} level T. V. system have been combined with simultaneous recordings of <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> on a broad band receiver. Both auroral light and hiss intensities display a significant peak at 1. 3 Hz in the power spectrum. The peaks in the auroral light intensity variations lead those in the <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> by times between zero and 0. 2 s, as revealed by cross-spectral analysis.

40|$|Abstract. The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> emissions during quiet and disturbed conditions observed at ground stations and on-board satellites are summarized. The increased {{intensity of the}} hiss emissions during magnetic storm period is explained by considering the enhanced flux of ener-getic electrons during magnetic storm period. The generation and propagation mechanism of <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> are also briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Consideration of {{incoherent}} Cerenkov {{radiation from}} intense fluxes of electrons in the magnetosphere {{as a source}} of <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> and several other emission phenomena. A procedure for calculating the Cerenkov and cyclotron radiation power from a spectrum of electrons in a test volume is outlined, as well as a ray-tracing routine for determining the path that the emitted power follows through the magnetosphere. Comparisons are made between a <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> event and an energetic particle spectrum observed simultaneously with the Injun 5 spacecraft. Calculated power and fields for incoherent Cerenkov radiation are two orders of magnitude below the observed <b>VLf</b> <b>hiss</b> values, although the spectral shapes are similar. It is concluded that a partially coherent or amplified Cerenkov source or an instability is located in the altitude range from 3000 to 10, 000 km. Calculations regarding Cerenkov radiation as a possible source for other wave phenomena indicate that upper hybrid resonance noise and fast hisslers may be understood in terms of incoherent Cerenkov radiation, but that V-shaped <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss,</b> saucers, ELF hiss, and Io-related Jovian decametric radiation may not...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a VLF (0. 3 - 18 kHz) {{experiment}} aboard OGO 4 are compared with simultaneous data obtained by the satellite on precipitating electrons at 0. 7, 2. 3, and 7. 3 keV to determine {{the source of the}} auroral hiss band in the night side auroral zone. At these energies the correlation with <b>VLF</b> auroral <b>hiss</b> is best at 0. 7 keV and worst at 7. 3 keV. Auroral electrons in the keV range may enhance the intensity of <b>VLF</b> auroral <b>hiss</b> on the night side, but the predominant source of night side hiss appears to be electrons of energies below 0. 7 keV. Auroral hiss tends to occur simultaneously over a broad range of frequencies. A study based on OGO 6 data has revealed a lack of correlation between keV electrons and LF auroral hiss. These observations suggest that hiss of all frequencies is generated by electrons with energies below about 1 keV. The excellent correlation between auroral hiss and 0. 7 keV electrons in the day time cleft is apparently maintained when the region of very soft electron precipitation is in motion...|$|R
40|$|Auroral hiss in the {{vicinity}} of a quiet arc is studied by comparing the data obtained from a sounding rocket with predictions of the convective beam amplification (CBA) model of auroral hiss generation. It is concluded that the <b>VLF</b> auroral <b>hiss</b> observed by the payload appears to have been natural in origin. The CBA model produces predicted hiss spectra that are in good agreement with the data. The hiss intensity above the ionosphere was greater equatorward of the arc than within the arc; this pattern appears {{to be the result of}} emission geometry and refraction. Hiss intensity was not found to be better correlated with 0. 1 - 0. 7 keV fluxes than with more energetic electrons. No evidence is found for a three-wave parametric decay process. The data are consistent with a weak hiss source located at an altitude of 110 - 120 km...|$|R
30|$|We {{evaluate}} cyclotron resonant {{interactions of}} radiation belt electrons with VLF chorus, plasmaspheric ELF hiss and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves. We {{assume that the}} Earth’s magnetic field is dipolar and that each wave mode has a Gaussian spectral density. The dependence of the resonant electron diffusion rates on the latitudinal distributions of particle density and wave power is examined. We find that while the diffusion rates can {{be sensitive to the}} latitudinal distributions of density and wave power, in general the sensitivity depends on wave mode, equatorial pitch-angle, electron energy and L-shell. We determine the effects of the latitudinal distributions of density and wave power on the electron precipitation loss timescale due to combined scattering by <b>VLF</b> chorus, ELF <b>hiss</b> and EMIC waves. Accurate modeling of radiation belt electron dynamics requires observational data on the global distributions of particle number density and wave power.|$|R
40|$|VLF and ELF waves were {{measured}} on two rocket payloads launched into the dayside auroral oval on Dec. 18, 1974, and on Jan. 11, 1975. The correlation of the <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> intensity with the fluxes of precipitating electrons above 500 eV on short spatial and time scales was often poor, {{even when a}} positive slope existed in the electron phase space density. During the flight in 1975, distinct features were observed at the lower hybrid frequency; the frequency of this emission was used together with an independent density measurement to determine the relative concentration of O(+) to the heavier ions NO(+) and O 2 (+). It {{was found that the}} density of NO(+) or O 2 (+), which could not be distinguished, is enhanced over expected values between 150 and 400 km altitude. Broadband electrostatic and electromagnetic waves were observed after the barium-shaped charged explosion in 1975; the observed lowering of the auroral <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> cutoff due to the barium is consistent with either ducting of <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> emissions along the enhanced density duct produced by the barium or with local generation <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> during the barium injection...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of {{broadband}} ELF, VLF, and LF {{emissions in}} the magnetosphere were calculated assuming incoherent Cerenkov radiation from magnetospheric electrons with energies from 50 eV to 50 keV. Calculations were included to determine the ray paths of the emitted waves. A diffusive equilibrium model of the magnetosphere with an ionosphere, plasmapause, and a centered dipole magnetic field was used. Ray path calculations were done in three dimensions. Using simultaneous energetic electron and VLF data, comparisons were made between calculated and observed <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss.</b> Assuming a wave normal angle six degrees from the resonance cone angle, the calculated spectral densities are both two orders of magnitude below the observed spectral densities. It seems unlikely that <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> is produced by incoherent Cerenkov radiation. The observed spectral shape of V-shaped <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> {{is similar to that}} calculated from incoherent Cerenkov radiation...|$|E
40|$|Determination of {{the origin}} of auroral hiss by {{comparing}} the records of a vlf experiment (0. 3 to 18 kHz) with simultaneous data obtained by an auroral-particle experiment having detectors for precipitating electrons at 0. 7, 2. 3, and 7. 3 keV. It is found that, on the dayside of the earth, the occurrence of <b>vlf</b> <b>hiss</b> correlates well with precipitation events at 0. 7 keV, but in general very poorly with activity in the higher-energy channels. Exact correlation between variations in <b>vlf</b> <b>hiss</b> intensity and in electron fluxes is rare even at 0. 7 keV. In addition, <b>vlf</b> <b>hiss</b> tends to be observed over a somewhat larger spatial region than precipitating 0. 7 -keV electrons. It is concluded that, on the dayside, auroral hiss is generated by soft (E less than 1 keV) 'cusp region' electrons and that the lack of detailed correlation between the two phenomena is caused by propagation effects as the hiss travels downward and spreads from the generation region...|$|E
40|$|Outer zone {{radiation}} belt electrons can undergo gyroresonant interaction with various magnetospheric wave modes including whistler-mode chorus outside the plasmasphere and both whistler-mode hiss and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves inside the plasmasphere. To evaluate timescales for electron momentum diffusion and pitch angle diffusion, we utilize bounce-averaged quasi-linear diffusion coefficients for field-aligned waves with a Gaussian frequency spectrum in a dipole magnetic field. Timescales for momentum diffusion of MeV electrons due to VLF chorus {{can be less}} than a day in the outer {{radiation belt}}. Equatorial chorus waves (|λw| < 15 deg) can effectively accelerate MeV electrons. Efficiency of the chorus acceleration mechanism is increased if high-latitude waves (|λw| < 15 deg) are also present. Our calculations confirm that chorus diffusion is a viable mechanism for generating relativistic (MeV) electrons in the outer zone during the recovery phase of a storm or during periods of prolonged substorm activity when chorus amplitudes are enhanced. Radiation belt electrons are subject to precipitation loss to the atmosphere due to resonant pitch angle scattering by plasma waves. The electron precipitation loss timescale due to scattering by each of the wave modes, chorus, hiss, and EMIC waves, can be 1 day or less. These wave modes can separately, or in combination, contribute significantly to the depletion of relativistic (MeV) electrons from the outer zone {{over the course of a}} magnetic storm. Efficient pitch angle scattering by whistler-mode chorus or hiss typically requires high latitude waves (|λw| < 30 deg). Timescales for electron acceleration and loss generally depend on the spectral properties of the waves, as well as the background electron number density and magnetic field. Loss timescales due to EMIC wave scattering also depend on the ion (H+, He+, O+) composition of the plasma. Complete models of radiation belt electron transport, acceleration and loss should include, in addition to radial (cross-L) diffusion, resonant diffusion due to gyroresonance with <b>VLF</b> chorus, plasmaspheric <b>hiss,</b> and EMIC waves. Comprehensive observational data on the spectral properties of these waves are required as a function of spatial location (L, MLT, MLAT) and magnetic activity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} auroral-zone <b>vlf</b> <b>hiss</b> and low-energy charged-particle observations with the Injun 5 satellite. The {{results of this study}} provide a direct verification of the association between auroral-zone <b>vlf</b> <b>hiss</b> and intense fluxes of low-energy electrons with energies on the order of 100 eV to several keV. On the dayside of the magnetosphere, these low-energy electrons are identified with the dayside polar-cusp region observed at higher latitudes with the Imp 5 satellite. At other local times, through the dawn and dusk regions and into the nightside of the magnetosphere, the <b>vlf</b> <b>hiss</b> and low-energy electron precipitation regions are believed to correspond to the extension of the dayside polar cusp into the distant plasma sheet and downstream magnetosheath on the nightside of the magnetosphere. Intense fluxes of upgoing electrons are often observed in a narrow latitudinal band near the low-energy electron precipitation bands. These upgoing electrons are believed to be associated with another type of vlf emission called a saucer, which is frequently observed with Injun 5...|$|E
40|$|The Hall current {{electrojet}} instability was {{studied to}} determine if it generates <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> in the auroral zone of magnetic substorms. Using the kinetic equations with particle conserving Krook collision operator for electrons and ions, and Poisson's equation, it is shown that in the low frequency region, the range of frequency of unstable modes increases as the electron density increases, and that the high frequency component {{must be taken into}} account in calculations of turbulent saturation of the Hall current instability driven beyond threshold. It is concluded that Hall currents can generate waves in the <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> frequency band which are related to local auroral electrojet activity...|$|E
40|$|Narrow-band VLF {{emissions}} {{observed on}} different days by Alouette- 2 are described. It is found that narrow-band <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> (3. 5 - 7. 0 kHz) occurs at midlatitudes (at 54 to 64 deg) in the topside ionosphere during both the geomagnetically disturbed and quiet periods, although the hiss region moves towards the auroral zone during the disturbed period. It {{is likely that}} the midlatitude hiss at around 5 kHz is the origin of the narrow-band hiss (5 plus or minus 1 kHz) often observed at ground stations at low latitudes, since no VLF emissions above 2 kHz appear in the auroral zone. The midlatitude <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> observed in the topside ionosphere may be generated by the transverse (electron cyclotron) resonance instability in the magnetosphere...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} simultaneous observations of very-low-frequency radio noise by the Injun 5 satellite and of visual aurora along the same geomagnetic-field line by the Fort Churchill Auroral Observatory. Seven observations from the period of August 29, 1968, to March 4, 1969, are discussed. In 5 of the 7 events studied <b>vlf</b> <b>hiss</b> is observed in association with auroral-light emissions. These observations typically show the occurrence of <b>vlf</b> <b>hiss</b> in the general region of the auroral arc, with {{significant changes in the}} vlf spectrum sometimes observed in the immediate vicinity of the auroral arc. One event for which the associated charged-particle fluxes have been analyzed is investigated in detail. The vlf radio noise intensity for this event is among the largest observed with Injun 5 and is much greater than can presently be explained by an incoherent Cerenkov radiation mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> observations at Syowa and Molodezhnaya Stations, Antarctica, {{showed that}} continuous auroral hiss {{with a narrow}} spectral band was observed widely over the polar region, whereas the impulsive auroral hiss with the burst-like spectral structure occurred mainly in the localized region of breakup of aurora. Based on the obtained results, the generation mechanisms of the auroral hiss of these two types are briefly discussed in the present paper...|$|E
40|$|A new {{direction}} finding technique (abbreviated as DF) for auroral hiss emissions is introduced {{based on the}} measurement of time differences of arrival of waves between three spaced observing stations. Two unmanned observatories for <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> were built at positions about 20 km south and east from Syowa Station (geomagnetic lat. - 69. 6 °), Antarctica. The VLF signals observed at these two unmanned stations are sent in real time to Syowa Station over 2 GHz wide-band telemetry systems. The arrival time differences of <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> signals between Syowa Station and each unmanned station are automatically determined by cross-correlating the wave forms of the received signals. The arrival directions of hiss emissions {{are determined by the}} tripartite observation method. The accuracy of the whole system is about 10 °in incident and azimuthal angles. A comparison of the results obtained with those of ground-based auroral data has shown that the arrival directions of auroral hiss correspond well to the bright aurora areas at the ionosphere level and that they change rapidly in accordance with movements of the aurora...|$|E
40|$|The high-latitude spatial {{distributions}} of average signal intensities in 12 frequency channels between 4 Hz and 512 kHz {{as measured by}} the ac electric field spectrometers on the DE- 2 spacecraft are analyzed for 18 mo of measurements. In MLT-INL (magnetic local time-invariant latitude) there are three distinct distributions that can be identified with 4 - 512 Hz signals from spatial irregularities and Alfven waves, 256 -Hz to 4. 1 -kHz signals from ELF hiss, and 4. 1 - 64 kHz signals from VLF auroral hiss, respectively. Overlap between ELF hiss and spatial irregularity signals occurs in the 256 - 512 Hz band. <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> signals extend downward in frequency into the 1. 0 - 4. 1 kHz band and upward into the frequency range 128 - 512 kHz. The distinctly different spatial distribution patterns for the three bands, 4 - 256 Hz, 512 - 1204 Hz, and 4. 1 - 64 kHz, indicate a lack of any causal relationships between <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss,</b> ELF hiss, and lower-frequency signals from spatial irregularities and Alfven waves...|$|E

In geomagnetic quiet and weak substorm recovery phase periods, a narrow-band mid-latitude hiss and a broad-band polar hiss appear, respectively, at invariant latitudes from 50 ° to 63 ° and from 66 ° to 78 ° from the afternoon to the midnight in MLT. In substorm expansion phase, the polar hiss region moves to lower latitudes and approaches the mid-latitude hiss region, and also, a LHR hiss whose intensity peak latitude increases with decreasing frequency (from 20 kHz to 1. 5 kHz) {{appears in the}} mid-latitude hiss region near the plasmapause. Statistical study of <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> shows that the mid-latitude hiss occurs most often in the quiet period and is independent of the substorm activity. While, the occurrence rate of polar hiss is 61 % in the substorm period (200 nT AL ≧ - 583 nT) and 29 % in the quiet period (30 nT AL ≧ - lOOnT).

40|$|Studies {{were made}} of inter-relations among VLF-ELF-ULF radio noises, ionospheric absorption, {{geomagnetic}} variations and aurora at the South Pole, Byrd and Eights Stations, Antarctica. Semi-diurnal peaks in the above geophysical parameters were found : these peaks occurred {{within a few hours}} before magnetic noon and others a few hours before magnetic midnight. A geophysical event which takes place in the day sector is called a D (day) event and night sector an N (night) event. The N event is similar to AKASOFU 2 ̆ 7 s substorm. One N event consists of three phases called N- 1,N- 2 and N- 3. Early in the evening the N- 1 is the major part of the N event. In mid-evening, three phases co-exist. The N- 3 is the dominant feature of the late evening N event. Observations made by the Injun III satellite showed that <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> (main feature of the N- 1) was observed at the boundary and beyond the region of trapped electrons in the dark sector. VLF chorus (main feature of N- 3) was observed in the closed lines of force.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a non-typical {{very low frequency}} (VLF) 1 – 4 kHz hiss representing a sequence of separated noise bursts with a strange "mushroom-like" shape in the frequency–time domain, each one lasting several minutes. These strange afternoon VLF emissions were recorded at Kannuslehto (KAN, ϕ = 67. 74 ° N, λ = 26. 27 ° E; L ∼ 5. 5) in northern Finland during the late recovery phase of the small magnetic storm on 8 December 2013. The left-hand (LH) polarized 2 – 3 kHz "mushroom caps" were clearly separated from the right-hand (RH) polarized "mushroom stems" at the frequency of about 1. 8 – 1. 9 kHz, which could match the lower ionosphere waveguide cutoff (the first transverse resonance of the Earth–ionosphere cavity). We hypothesize that this VLF burst sequence could {{be a result of}} the modulation of the <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> electron–cyclotron instability from the strong Pc 5 geomagnetic pulsations observed simultaneously at ground-based stations {{as well as in the}} inner magnetosphere by the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms mission probe (THEMIS-E; ThE). This assumption is confirmed by a similar modulation of the intensity of the energetic (1 – 10 keV) electrons simultaneously observed by the same ThE spacecraft. In addition, the data of the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) radar at Tromsø show a similar quasi-periodicity in the ratio of the Hall-to-Pedersen conductance, which may be used as a proxy for the energetic particle precipitation enhancement. Our findings suggest that this strange mushroom-like shape of the considered <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> could be a combined mutual effect of the magnetospheric ULF–VLF (ultra low frequency–very low frequency) wave interaction and the ionosphere waveguide propagation...|$|E

40|$|Substorm {{characteristics}} of VLF emissions are studied and {{we show that}} substorm-associated VLF emissions are an important and useful tool for investigating only the wave-particle interaction process, but also the particle injection process during substorms. Special effects in VLF emissions with drifting center frequency are found to take place predominantly in the two local time sectors; dawn (LT～ 06) and premidnight (LT= 20 - 24 h). First, the {{characteristics of}} dawnside VLF emissions associated with substorms will be reviewed based on our previous work. As a very interesting property, the substorm-associated VLF/ELF emissions on the dawnside exhibit a rise in their central frequency with local time. We have presented its interpretation {{in terms of the}} energy dispersion of the electrons drifting from the midnight particle injection region toward the generation region (LT～ 06). A few events of substorm-associated <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> in the premidnight with a peculiar frequency drift were first discovered from our European VLF campaign and their characteristics are presented. The generation of hiss emissions just inside the plasmapause is interpreted due to a quasilinear cyclotron instability of the electrons injected from the plasma sheet. A new type of frequency drift in <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> in the premidnight sector discussed here is such that the central frequency sharply increases first and followed by a gradual decrease during two successive substorms. This frequency drift is reasonably accounted for by a model combining an L-shell drift of energetic electrons injected during the first substorm and a subsequent decrease under a large-scale convection electric field during the development of the event. The later decrease in frequency may be related to an additional injection of particles due {{to the development of the}} second sunstorm. Finally, we will suggest future experimental work to be carried out to examine the validity of our proposed models...|$|E

Observations of plasmasphere and auroral zone phenomena in the ionosphere are discussed, and escaping and trapped plasma waves in the magnetospheres of Jupiter and other planets are considered. Planned future magnetospheric research {{for the next four years}} is outlined...|$|E
40|$|A {{meridian}} scanning photometer {{was designed}} for investigating the time and space variations of auroral luminosity. With {{the aid of the}} quick-scan auroral photometer data of more than 300 clear night hours recorded at Syowa Station, Antarctica (geomagnetic lat. 69. 6 °S, long. 77. 1 °E), the following problems are studied: (1) space and time variation of auroral displays, (2) magnetic field variations associated with the space-time auroral displays, (3) relationships among auroras, magnetic field disturbance, magnetic pulsations, <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss,</b> VLF chorus and GNA during the course of substorms. Various kinds of morphological evidence obtained through the above investigations show that a polar substorm consists of the breakup phase and the post-breakup phase. The breakup phase is characterized by a sudden intensification of auroral arc(s) or band(s) and a rapid poleward movement of the intensified aurora(s) with speed of about 1 km/s (Breakup type aurora). The post-breakup phase is defined as diffused auroras or rays which still remain after the intense breakup type aurora(s) have passed away polewards (Post-breakup type aurora). Generally, the post-breakup aurora(s) move towards the equator side. A breakup type aurora is accompanied by a sharp pulsative geomagnetic disturbance (Breakup magnetic disturbance), while a post-breakup type aurora by a gradual negative bay-shape disturbance (Post-breakup magnetic disturbance). It seems that the sharp pulsative disturbance moves polewards together with the moving breakup aurora, while the gradual negative bay stays with the associated post-breakup aurora(s). Thus, the auroral electrojet can also be classified into AEJ- 1, which is an intense and narrow electrojet moving together with the breakup aurora, and AEJ- 2, which is a comparatively broad and weak electrojet associated with the post-breakup aurora(s). The auroral breakup phase is accompanied not only by a sharp pulsative geomagnetic disturbance but also by <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> emissions, ULF emissions of PiB type and a sharp CNA phenomenon, while the post-breakup aurora is accompanied by a gradual geo-magnetic bay, a gradual, weak CNA, VLF chorus emissions and ULF emissions of PiC type. With reference to 2 ̆ 7 the space-time variations in auroras associated with geomagnetic perturbations at Syowa Station, an overall physical picture of dynamic auroral behaviors over the entire polar region is given, as a conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Polar cusp <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss</b> of {{irregular}} spectra {{is observed}} mainly at geomagnetic invariant latitudes from 74 ° to 84 °, and at geomagnetic local times from 10 to 14 hours. This occurrence region corresponds well to {{a region of}} cusp precipitations of lowenergy electrons below 1 keV. Changes of lower cutoff frequency of polar cusp hiss are related with plasma irregularities in the polar cusp ionosphere. The whistler-mode Cerenkov radiation from electrons below I keV is discussed for generating the polar cusp hiss, but this mechanism can not work in the polar cusp ionosphere for VLF frequencies much lower than a local electron gyrofrequency. The whistler-mode VLF Cerenkov radiation is generated from the electrons below 1 keV at high altitude(～ 6 R_E) cusp magnetosphere, where a local electron gyrofrequency is in VLF band. The whistler-mode cusp hiss generated at high altitudes will propagate along field-aligned cusp plasma down to a strong geomagnetic field region where the cusp structure fades out. Below this region, the whistler-mode hiss spreads over the polar cusp ionosphere where low energy electron precipitations produce ionospheric irregularities...|$|E
40|$|The Topaz 3 auroral {{sounding}} rocket made the following observations concerning {{the transfer of}} precipitating auroral electron energy to transverse ion acceleration in the topside auroral zone. During {{the course of the}} flight, the precipitating electron beam was modified to varying degrees by interaction with <b>VLF</b> <b>hiss,</b> at times changing the beam into a field-aligned plateau. The electron distribution functions throughout the flight are classified according to the extent of this modification, and correspondences with ion acceleration events are sought. The hiss power during most of this rocket flight apparently exceeded the threshold for collapse into solitary structures. At the times of plateaued electron distributions, the collapse of these structures was limited by Landau damping through the ambient ions, resulting in a velocity-dependent acceleration of both protons and oxygen. This initial acceleration is sufficient to supply the number flux of upflowing ions observed at satellite altitudes. The bursty ion acceleration was anticorrelated, on 1 -s or smaller timescales, with dispersive bursts of precipitating field-aligned electrons, although on longer timescales the bursty ions and the bursty electrons are correlated...|$|E
