25|$|After Soda's separation, Cerati {{released}} the studio albums Amor Amarillo (1993), Bocanada (1999), +Bien (2001) and Siempre Es Hoy (2002). In 2002 he released 11 Episodios Sinfónicos that contained some Soda Stereo and solo songs played {{live with a}} symphony orchestra. Cerati also released electronic music as Plan V, and other projects. Ahí <b>Vamos!</b> (2006), is considered as a back-to-basics return. His last album to date is Fuerza Natural (2009), which changes several things about his previous albums and has been very well received by fans and critics.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the 2nd {{generation}} of Argentine rock solo artists formerly members of great bands of their era: Gustavo Cerati, Indio Solari, Vicentico, Fidel Nadal, etc. Ex-Soda Stereo member Cerati {{spent most of the}} early part of the decade in the electronic side of music. In 2006 he returned with his first album of all new music since 2002 (Ahi <b>Vamos)</b> where rock was front and center, albeit a more mature rock of a man in the middle age of his life. Ex-Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota Solari's debut album El tesoro de los Inocentes was seen as the best of 2004. Vicentico and his homonymous debut sold well, but his second effort suffered the sophomore slump. He has just released his third solo album, Los Pájaros. Skay Beillinson, also ex-Redonditos, also did well with his fourth solo efforts.|$|E
25|$|However, in verb {{expressions}} {{accompanied by}} an object pronoun, Brazilians normally place it amid the auxiliary verb and the main one (ela vem me pagando but not ela me vem pagando or ela vem pagando-me). In some cases, in order to adapt this use to the standard grammar, some Brazilian scholars recommend that ela vem me pagando should be written like ela vem-me pagando (as in EP), {{in which case the}} enclisis could be totally acceptable if there would not be a factor of proclisis. Therefore, this phenomenon may or not be considered improper according to the prescribed grammar, since, according to the case, there could be a factor of proclisis that would not permit the placement of the pronoun between the verbs (e.g. when there is a negative adverb near the pronoun, in which case the standard grammar prescribes proclisis, ela não me vem pagando and not ela não vem-me pagando). Nevertheless, nowadays, it is becoming perfectly acceptable to use a clitic between two verbs, without linking it with a hyphen (as in poderia se dizer, or não <b>vamos</b> lhes dizer) and this usage (known as: pronome solto entre dois verbos) can be found in modern(ist) literature, textbooks, magazines and newspapers like Folha de S.Paulo and O Estadão (see in-house style manuals of these newspapers, available on-line, for more details).|$|E

6000|$|I have {{recalled}} this characteristic {{speech to}} show the general tendency of Enriquez' convictions {{at the opening of}} this little story. It is only fair to say, however, that his usual attitude toward the sex he so cheerfully maligned exhibited little apprehension or caution in dealing with them. Among the frivolous and light-minded intermixture of his race he moved with great freedom and popularity. He danced well; when we went to fandangos together his agility and the audacity of his figures always procured him the prettiest partners, his professed sentiments, I presume, shielding him from subsequent jealousies, heartburnings, or envy. I have a vivid recollection of him in the mysteries of the SEMICUACUA, a somewhat corybantic dance which left much to the invention of the performers, and very little to the imagination of the spectator. In one of the figures a gaudy handkerchief, waved more or less gracefully by dancer and danseuse before the dazzled eyes of each other, acted as love's signal, and was used to express alternate admiration and indifference, shyness and audacity, fear and transport, coyness and coquetry, as the dance proceeded. I need not say that Enriquez' pantomimic illustration of these emotions was peculiarly extravagant; but it was always performed and accepted with a gravity that was an essential feature of the dance. At such times sighs would escape him which were supposed to portray the incipient stages of passion; snorts of jealousy burst from him at the suggestion of a rival; he was overtaken by a sort of St. Vitus's dance that expressed his timidity in making the first advances of affection; the scorn of his ladylove struck him with something like a dumb ague; and a single gesture of invitation from her produced marked delirium. All this was very like Enriquez; but on the particular occasion to which I refer, I think no one was prepared to see him begin the figure with the waving of FOUR handkerchiefs! Yet this he did, pirouetting, capering, brandishing his silken signals like a ballerina's scarf in the languishment or fire of passion, until, in a final figure, where the conquered and submitting fair one usually sinks into the arms of her partner, need it be said that the ingenious Enriquez was found {{in the center of the}} floor supporting four of the dancers! Yet he was by no means unduly excited either by the plaudits of the crowd or by his evident success with the fair. [...] "Ah, believe me, it is nothing," [...] he said quietly, rolling a fresh cigarette as he leaned against the doorway. [...] "Possibly, I shall have to offer the chocolate or the wine to thees girls, or make to them a promenade in the moonlight on the veranda. It is ever so. Unless, my friend," [...] he said, suddenly turning toward me in an excess of chivalrous self-abnegation, [...] "unless you shall yourself take my place. Behold, I gif them to you! I <b>vamos!</b> I vanish! I make track! I skedaddle!" [...] I think he would have carried his extravagance to the point of summoning his four gypsy witches of partners, and committing them to my care, if the crowd had not at that moment parted before the remaining dancers, and left one of the onlookers, a tall, slender girl, calmly surveying them through gold-rimmed eyeglasses in complete critical absorption. I stared in amazement and consternation; for I recognized in the fair stranger Miss Urania Mannersley, the Congregational minister's niece! ...|$|E
