A general procedure for pretest analysis of a <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> <b>frame</b> has been presented using CAE approach with software Virtual Lab. After the modal parameters are acquired from FEM analysis, the CAE based MAC method is used to optimize the measurement location and direction. The selection of an appropriate set of measurement locations and directions including initial accelerometers placement and test excitation point location are defined based on MAC method by Virtual Lab correlation part. Finally, for purpose of validation, the FEM modal {{analysis is}} compared with operational modal analysis.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a method that}} provides an estimate of road bank by decoupling the vehicle roll due to the dynamics and the roll due to the road bank. Suspension deflection measurements were used to provide a measurement of the relative roll between the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> <b>frame</b> and the axle frame or between the sprung mass and the unsprung mass, respectively. A deflection scaling parameter was found via suspension geometry and dynamic analysis. The relative roll measurement was then incorporated into two different kinematic navigation models based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) architectures. Each algorithm was tested and then verified on the Prowler ATV experimental platform at the National Center for Asphalt Technology (NCAT). Experimental data showed that both the cascaded and coupled approach performed well in providing estimates of the current vehicle roll and instantaneous road bank...|$|E
40|$|The Extended Kalman Filter is used {{extensively}} for inertial navigation. If initial attitude errors are small, many authors choose {{to represent the}} attitude states as a vector of small angles in the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> <b>frame.</b> Some authors choose to represent this vector in the navigation frame instead, but the corresponding reduction of filter performance in the closed loop filter is not discussed. Performance is regained when switching to an open loop filter, but closed loop filters are widely desired. This paper investigates this performance reduction. To show the effect,Monte Carlo simulation results are shown for several cases with a simplified inertial navigation problem using a closed and open loop filter and attitude states {{in the body and}} inertial frames. A qualitative argument is given to explain the effects, which stem from a state propagation model that poorly reflects the true system model for this case. A method is proposed to regain performance by using an estimated inertial frame for the attitude states. This method is only beneficial when the attitude states are measured indirectly via the velocity state equation. Results with this new frame are shown and discussed...|$|E

Although there are many beneficial applications by integrating UASs into the national airspace, the primary concern is UAS related midair collisions. The University of Washington Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics Autonomous Flight System Laboratory (AFSL) is collaborating with Insitu, a UAS company, to develop a collision warning and awareness plugin (CAPlugin) for Insitu's Common Open-mission Management Command and Control (ICOMC 2) system. The CAPlugin operates passively and notifies the operator when potential risks are detected at an increasing level of intensity. This paper's primary focus is the Forward State Estimator (FSE), a CAPlugin component, which predicts the vehicle's future position probability distribution, specifically for vehicles following a flight path. Error propagation is the methodology used by the FSE because minimal information is required for implementation. A point mass system involving a UAS following a flight path is the model used for deriving the error propagation in the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>body</b> <b>frame.</b> The paper present a scenario that demonstrates the CAPlugin capabilities and illustrates the FSE results, particularly for the flight path case...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The railway {{transport}} {{plays an important}} role in social and economic life of the country and carries out the large containment of transportation activities. The transport industry should migrate towards innovation changes and increase its significance as an important transit subsystem on the way of renovation of both the infrastructure and the strategy of all transportation process components including the interaction with other transport modes. At present the life sets strategic challenges for the railway branch, and the basic goals among them are as follows: high-speed train traffic development, increase of the weight of freight trains, new rolling stock development etc. Due to the urgency of this subject, the researchers should cope with the task devoted to one of aspects of improving the freight transportation efficiency, namely to the study of effects of various factors and characteristics of technical conditions of the freight cars running gears (which are unavoidable to arise during operation) on their basic dynamic indices. The deviations of technical conditions of running gears from the normal state of the wedge system of bogie swing suspension also play an important role among them. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the influence of different factors of the technical conditions of freight car running gears (size deviation in both the bearers and the wedge system during operation) on their basic indices – coefficients of horizontal and vertical dynamics, <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> acceleration, <b>frame</b> strength, and derailment stability coefficient. Methodology. The study was conducted by numerical integration and mathematical modeling of the freight car dynamic loading using the software package “Dynamics of Rail Vehicles” (“DYNRAIL”). Findings. As a result of the research for freight car dynamic coefficients determination taking into account technical conditions of the side bearers, the dependencies of the basic freight cars dynamic coefficients on the parameters of side bearers (the clearances in the side bearers and the wedge system conditions of the bogie swing suspension) considering running speed in the tangent and curved track sections of minor and mean radii were obtained. Originality. The impact of the technical condition of the car running gears on the traffic safety factors is determined. Practical value. The theoretical research results in determination of freight car dynamic indices taking into consideration the technical conditions of the side bearers of freight cars allow for an adequate assessment of effect of the freight car bogies’ technical conditions, namely the bearers parameters, on the railway traffic safety factors (coefficients of horizontal and vertical dynamics, <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> acceleration, <b>frame</b> strength and derailment stability coefficient) ...|$|R

40|$|Good {{comfort for}} the driver of a {{construction}} machine is crucial. Gearshift comfort {{is an important part}} of the total comfort. Volvo Construction Equipment Components has a simulation environment of the powertrain, SimPow, which is implemented in Matlab/Simulink. SimPow is mostly used for simulation of control strategies and performance. In order to be able to study gearshifting comfort, Volvo has an interest in developing new models for SimPow. The purpose of this thesis work is to build complementing models for SimPow, and evaluate what modifications are needed in order to be able to study gearshifting comfort. The work is limited to study only movement in the longitudinal direction and for one vehicle - the Wheel Loader L 150 E. The models are implemented in Simulink. The complementing models are of two kinds: – Models of the <b>vehicle.</b> The <b>bodies,</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>frame</b> and cabin are considered as rigid bodies. Elements consisting of springs and dampers, insulators, are connecting frame and cabin. Driving forces from the wheels results in acceleration (longitudinal, vertical and rotational) and jerk for the center of gravity of the vehicle frame. The acceleration of the frame gives rise to forces in the insulators, connecting frame and cabin. These forces accelerates the cabin and the driver. – Longitudinal models of the wheels. Torque from the powertrain gives rise to a longitudinal force, driving force, in the contact patch between ground and tire. The conclusion from the evaluation shows that a longitudinal model of the wheels is needed. Further, it is considered sufficient to study and measure the longitudinal acceleration of the frame. Therefore, the models of the vehicle are not needed...|$|R

Nonlinear control laws {{have the potential to}} effectively control the vehicle in all flight regimes but are often-times hindered by the fidelity of the reference model. The research presented provides a 6 DoF model for a single propeller fixed-wing aircraft that will be used to develop further insight into the use of nonlinear controllers. Through the use of a high precision 6 -axis load cell the vehicle dynamics are determined and a model is constructed based on multiple wind-tunnel tests. In particular for this fixed-wing aircraft, the hover to translational flight type of maneuver is of interest and a quaternion based velocity controller is developed that performs this task. The state data information, provided by an off-board motion capture system, is then compared through multiple flight tests.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} new method of {{defining}} a <b>body</b> coordinate <b>frame</b> for locomoting snake robots. Representing {{the motion of}} snake robots {{from the perspective of}} the robot is difficult because the internal shape changes that the robot uses to locomote interact with world in a complex way. Therefore, rather than representing the system in a <b>body</b> <b>frame</b> that is static to some fixed point on a link, we instead define a <b>body</b> <b>frame</b> that is consistent with the overall shape of the robot in all configurations. We are able to define such a <b>body</b> <b>frame</b> by continuously aligning it with the principal moments of inertia taken at the center of mass of the robot. In some cases we are able to further exploit symmetry in the shape of the robot’s cyclic motion (gait), and use non-linear optimization to more precisely align the <b>body</b> <b>frame</b> with the true axis of symmetry of the robot’s shape. These shape stable <b>body</b> <b>frames</b> serve as virtual chassis that effectively separate the internal motion of a gait from the external motion due to that gait’s interaction with the world. Furthermore, these <b>body</b> <b>frames</b> allow the motion of the robot to be described in a way that is well-aligned with one’s intuitive notions of position and orientation that arise when considering the system as a whole.
