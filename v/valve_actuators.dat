5000|$|Corliss valves open {{directly}} into the cylinder. The valves connect the cylinder to separate steam and exhaust plenums. Initially, Corliss used slide valves with linear actuators, but by 1851, Corliss had shifted to semi-rotary <b>valve</b> <b>actuators,</b> as documented in U.S. Patent 8253. [...] In this engine, the wrist plate {{was moved to the}} center of the cylinder side, as on later Corliss engines.

50|$|A valve {{actuator}} is the mechanism for {{opening and closing}} a valve. Manually operated valves require someone in attendance to adjust them using a direct or geared mechanism attached to the valve stem. Power-operated actuators, using gas pressure, hydraulic pressure or electricity, allow a valve to be adjusted remotely, or allow rapid operation of large valves. Power-operated <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> may be the final elements of an automatic control loop which automatically regulates some flow, level or other process. Actuators may be only to open and close the valve, or may allow intermediate positioning; some <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> include switches or other ways to remotely indicate {{the position of the}} valve.|$|E

50|$|The main factor {{preventing}} {{this technology}} from wide use in production automobiles {{is the ability}} to produce a cost effective means of controlling the valve timing under the conditions internal to an engine. An engine operating at 3000 revolutions per minute will rotate the camshaft 25 times per second, so the valve timing events have to occur at precise times to offer performance benefits. Electromagnetic and pneumatic camless <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> offer the greatest control of precise valve timing, but, in 2016, are not cost effective for production vehicles.|$|E
