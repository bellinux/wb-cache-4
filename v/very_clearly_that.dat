2500|$|Journalist Ahmed Osman in {{his book}} Stranger in the Valley of the Kings has {{suggested}} an identification between Joseph, the ancient Hebrew patriarch who led the tribe of Israel into Egypt during a famine, and Yuya.

2500|$|The {{novel is}} a satire {{of society as}} a whole, characterised by {{hypocrisy}} and opportunism, {{but it is not}} a reforming novel; there is no suggestion that social or political changes or greater piety and moral reformism could improve the nature of society. It thus paints a fairly bleak view of the human condition. This bleak portrait is continued with Thackeray's own role as an omniscient narrator, one of the writers best known for using the technique. He continually offers asides about his characters and compares them to actors and puppets, but his cheek goes even as far as his readers, accusing all who may be interested in such [...] "Vanity Fairs" [...] as being either [...] "of a lazy, or a benevolent, or a sarcastic mood". As Lord David Cecil remarked, [...] "Thackeray liked people, and for the most part he thought them well-intentioned. But he also saw <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>that</b> they were all in some degree weak and vain, self-absorbed and self-deceived." [...] Amelia begins as a warm-hearted and friendly girl, though sentimental and naive, but by the story's end she is portrayed as vacuous and shallow. Dobbin appears first as loyal and magnanimous, if unaware of his own worth; by the end of the story he is presented as a tragic fool, a prisoner of his own sense of duty who knows he is wasting his gifts on Amelia but is unable to live without her. The novel's increasingly grim outlook can take readers aback, as characters whom the reader at first holds in sympathy are shown to be unworthy of such regard.|$|E

2500|$|Manga scholar Ryan Holmberg {{contends that}} more than being {{inspired}} by a Kazuo Shimada story, Black Blizzard is a direct unauthorized adaptation of Shimada's [...] "Black Rainbow". The story follows two repatriated war veterans—one who is a pianist framed for murder, {{and the other a}} gambler whose family left him—who are handcuffed together and escape after a train crash. While Tatsumi does refer to the story in his autobiographical A Drifting Life, it is not mentioned in his gekiga manifesto Gekiga College. Holmberg suspects that Tatsumi included the manga's sources later in his autobiography because Masaki Sato's autobiography mistakenly assumed that it was based on the film The Defiant Ones, which was released two years later in 1958. Holmberg also notes that A Drifting Life was largely based on the history The Tale of Gekiga by Tatsumi's older brother Shōichi Sakurai, which itself borrows from Tatsumi's earlier Gekiga College. Holmberg discounts the influence of Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo because of how closely Black Blizzard mirrors [...] "Black Rainbow" [...] in its story. Holmberg says that the narrative of [...] "the manga's genesis, especially in its recent melodramatic versions, simply has to go"; [...] "the godfather of gekiga did not remake the world of manga , nor simply {{with the help of a}} couple of 'influences.' The evidence suggests <b>very</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>that</b> Tatsumi had at his side a copy of 'Black Rainbow,' which he was using more or less as a script". Lastly, he notes similarities between the circus singer Saeko Ozora and postwar singer Hibari Misora, concluding that gekiga did not have its roots in the [...] "everyday actualities of postwar Japan and especially its underclass", but rather [...] "mass entertainment and the world of fantasy from magazines and the movies", especially the prepackaged [...] "postwar experience".|$|E
