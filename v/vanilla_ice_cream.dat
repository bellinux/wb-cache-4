40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} presence and levels of Aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) in <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> samples consumed {{in the province of}} Samsun. For this purpose, a total of 115 samples comprising 25 <b>vanilla</b> <b>ice</b> <b>creams,</b> 65 fruit <b>ice</b> <b>creams</b> and 25 chocolate <b>ice</b> <b>creams</b> were used as the study materials. The <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> samples were purchased randomly from 11 different markets. The samples were analysed by the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Aflatoxin M 1 was detected in 30 (26. 08 %) of the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> samples, ranging from 6. 12 - 32. 15 ng kg‾ 1 whereas 85 samples (73. 92 %) did not reveal the presence of this toxin. The AFM 1 levels were not higher than the limits of the Turkish Food Codex (50 ng kg‾ 1 for <b>ice</b> <b>cream)</b> in all of the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> samples. It was concluded that the aflatoxins contained in some of the investigated samples were potential risks for public health. Therefore, milk which is the basic ingredient of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> must be continuously monitored for AFM 1 contamination. Furthermore, dairy cow feed should be stored {{in such a way that}} they do not become contaminated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{feasibility}} of incorporating beta-carotene-loaded solid lipid microparticles (BCSLM) into <b>vanilla</b> <b>ice</b> <b>creams</b> was investigated, through the physico-chemical characterization {{and evaluation of}} sensory acceptability of the products products. The BCSLM were produced with palm stearin as the lipid phase, hydrolyzed soy protein isolate as the surfactant, and xanthan gum as the thickener. The results showed similar values of proximate composition, total soluble solids, pH, and overrun for all formulations. On the other hand, colorimetric evaluations showed that the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> produced with partial substitution of artificial additives by BCSLM containing alpha-tocopherol presented a more intense color, while in the product with non-encapsulated beta-carotene, a fast degradation of carotenoid was confirmed, highlighting {{the importance of the}} encapsulation techniques. The results of the sensorial analysis of the products were highly satisfactory and showed that the panelists preferred the <b>ice</b> <b>creams</b> produced with BCSLM containing alpha-tocopherol and with partial substitution of artificial additives by BCSLM containing alpha-tocopherol, confirming the {{feasibility of}} incorporating BCSLM into <b>ice</b> <b>creams</b> to reduce the application of artificial dyes to the product...|$|R

500|$|Bacon {{ice cream}} has been recreated by other chefs in recent years. For example, it {{appears on the}} menu at Espai Sucre in Barcelona, a {{restaurant}} that specialises in desserts, with descriptions such as [...] "innovative" [...] and [...] "spectacular". In the United States, bacon {{was one of the}} themes for dessert at the Fancy food show. In 2006, two separate contestants created versions of bacon ice cream in the reality series Top Chef. Celebrity chef Bob Blumer won a Texas ice cream making competition with a bacon ice cream. Originally planning to use candied bacon, he changed at the last moment to do a bacon brittle ice cream. Chef Michael Symon made bacon ice cream in the first season of the Food Network's The Next Iron Chef competition. Andrew Knowlton, a judge, dismissed it as not original. But Symon managed to progress in the competition and eventually win. Burger King rolled out a [...] "bacon sundae", <b>vanilla</b> <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> with caramel, chocolate, bacon bits, and one strip of bacon, in the summer of 2012 in the US.

40|$|AbstractCurcumin was {{complexed}} with β-CD using co-precipitation, freeze-drying and {{solvent evaporation}} methods. Co-precipitation enabled complex formation, {{as indicated by}} the FT-IR and FT-Raman techniques via the shifts in the peaks that were assigned to the aromatic rings of curcumin. In addition, photoacoustic spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, with the disappearance of the band related to aromatic rings, by Gaussian fitting, and modifications in the spectral lines, respectively, also suggested complex formation. The possible complexation had an efficiency of 74 % and increased the solubility of the pure colourant 31 -fold. Curcumin–β-CD complex exhibited a sunlight stability 18 % higher than the pure colourant. This material was stable to pH variations and storage at − 15 and 4 °C. With an isothermal heating at 100 and 150 °C for 2 h, the material exhibited a colour retention of approximately 99 %. The application of curcumin–β-CD complex in <b>vanilla</b> <b>ice</b> <b>creams</b> intensified the colour of the products and produced a great sensorial acceptance...|$|R
