Following this, myocardial stress is induced, either by exercise or pharmacologically with adenosine, dobutamine or dipyridamole(Persantine), which increase the heart rate or by regadenoson(Lexiscan), a <b>vasodilator.</b> (Aminophylline can be used to reverse the effects of dipyridamole and regadenoson).

40|$|AbstractVasodilator {{therapy is}} useful {{adjunctive}} therapy {{in the management}} of both acute and chronic heart failure. Arteriolar dilators, such as hydralazine, increase cardiac output by decreasing the elevated peripheral vascular resistance that occurs in heart failure. Venodilators, such as nitrates, decrease ventricular filling pressures by redistributing blood so that more is pooled in peripheral veins. <b>Vasodilators</b> that produce both effects (nitro-prusside, prazosin, captopril, for example) are usually helpful in short-term improvement of hemodynamics. Long-term treatment with nonparenteral <b>vasodilators</b> often reduces symptoms and increases exercise tolerance, although there is inconclusive evidence regarding the effects of these agents on mortality. In acute myocardial infarction, intravenous <b>vasodilators</b> frequently improve cardiac performance. Evidence regarding their beneficial effects on infarct size and immediate mortality is encouraging but inconclusive. There is little evidence that they prolong life in patients who survive cardiogenic shock and leave the hospital. Thus, <b>vasodilators</b> can improve hemodynamics and lessen symptoms, but more evidence is needed regarding their long-term effects on survival...|$|R
25|$|There is a {{significant}} evidence–practice gap {{in the treatment of}} CHF; particularly the underuse of ACE inhibitors and β-blockers and aldosterone antagonists which have been shown to provide mortality benefit. Treatment of CHF aims to relieve symptoms, to maintain a euvolemic state (normal fluid level in the circulatory system), and to improve prognosis by delaying progression of heart failure and reducing cardiovascular risk. Drugs used include: diuretic agents, <b>vasodilator</b> agents, positive inotropes, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone). Some drugs which increase heart function, such as the positive inotrope milrinone, lead to increased mortality, and are contraindicated.|$|E

25|$|Serotonin {{secreted}} {{from the}} enterochromaffin cells eventually {{finds its way}} out of tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood platelets, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, where it can serve as a vasoconstrictor and/or a <b>vasodilator</b> while regulating hemostasis and blood clotting. In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II, norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium such as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. In physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin mediated release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells. Additionally, it inhibits the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves. Serotonin is also a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. There are various serotonin receptors.|$|E
