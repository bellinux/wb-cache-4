The <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> valve controls the resulting buildup of gas pressure by allowing excess gas to escape into a ground-side <b>vent</b> <b>line,</b> {{which leads to a}} flare stack at a safe distance away from the pad. A similar leak situation was seen during the first launch attempt of STS-119. NASA managers met on 14 June 2009 and 15 June 2009 and evaluated the leak, discussed steps that had to be taken, and set a new launch date of 17 June 2009, at 05:40 EDT.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{replacement}} of the valves, the Mission Management Team gave the approval for launch, and scheduled it for 11 March 2009. The astronauts arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on 8 March 2009 to prepare for launch. The 11 March 2009 launch was scrubbed due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> between the shuttle and the external tank. On 15 March 2009, the shuttle successfully lifted off from pad 39A. The leak problem manifested itself again during STS-127 which led to a thorough test. The root cause was found to be a misalignment in the GUCP (Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate) which was set right leading to a successful flight.|$|E
25|$|The {{launch date}} of 24 February 2011 was officially set after the Flight Readiness Review meeting on 18 February 2011.

Additionally, flight rules which required a 72-hour separation between dockings at the International Space Station threatened to delay the launch by at least a day due to the delayed launch of the ESA's unmanned Johannes Kepler ATV supply craft. Managers instead decided to press ahead with the countdown allowing for a possible standdown; had docking issues arisen with the ATV, STS-133 would have stood down for 48 hours. The Kepler ATV docked successfully at 10:59 UTC, 24 February 2011.|$|E

25|$|After the day {{required}} to make the tank safe by purging remaining hydrogen gas with helium gas, NASA engineers prepared for disconnection of the vent arm and the significant number of lines prior to taking their {{first look at the}} GUCP. On the night of 9 November, technicians began disconnecting the GUCP by unhooking and lowering the hydrogen <b>vent</b> <b>line.</b> Teams performed an initial inspection of the flight seal and quick disconnect prior to sending them to labs for a thorough engineering analysis. Engineers reported an unevenly (asymmetrically) compressed internal seal and the quick disconnect hardware also seemed have a less concentric fit than pre-fueling measurements indicated. Inspections also confirmed the condition of the hardware did not match the observations documented when it was installed on the external tank inside the VAB.|$|E
50|$|The Hydrogen <b>Vent</b> <b>Line</b> Access Arm mated the External Tank (ET) Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate (GUCP) to {{the launch}} pad {{hydrogen}} <b>vent</b> <b>line.</b> The GUCP provided support for plumbing and cables, called umbilicals, that transferred fluids, gases, and electrical signals between two pieces of equipment. While the ET was being fueled, hazardous gas was vented from an internal hydrogen tank through the GUCP, out a <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> to a flare stack where it was burned off at a safe distance. Sensors at the GUCP measured gas level. The GUCP was redesigned after leaks created scrubs of STS-127 and were also detected during attempts to launch STS-119 and STS-133. The GUCP released from the ET at launch and fell away with a curtain of water sprayed across it for protection from flames.|$|E

40|$|Compressors {{are used}} {{throughout}} the natural gas industry to move natural gas from production and processing sites to customer distribution systems. Compressors must periodically be taken off-line for maintenance, operational stand-by, or emergency shut down testing, and as a result, methane may be released to the atmosphere {{from a number of}} sources. When compressor units are shut down, typically the high pressure gas remaining within the compressors and associated piping between isolation valves is vented to the atmosphere (‘blowdown’) or to a flare. In addition to blowdown emissions, a depressurized system may continue to leak gas from faulty or improperly sealed unit isolation valves. Natural Gas STAR Partners have found that simple changes in operating practices and in the design of blowdown systems can save money and significantly reduce methane emissions by keeping systems fully or partially pressurized during shutdown. Though pressurized systems may also leak from the closed blowdown valve and from reciprocating compressor rod packing, total emissions can be significantly reduced. Four options for reducing emissions when taking compressors off-line are discussed in this paper. These include: ��Keeping compressors pressurized when off-line. ��Connecting blowdown <b>vent</b> <b>lines</b> to the fuel gas system and recovering all, or a portion, of the vented gas to the fuel gas system. ��Installing static seals on compressor rod packing. ��Installing ejectors on compressor blowdown <b>vent</b> <b>lines.</b> Keeping compressors fully pressurized when off-line achieves immediate payback—there are no capital costs and emissions are avoided by reducing the net leakage rate. Routing blowdown <b>vent</b> <b>lines</b> to the fuel gas system or to a lower pressure gas line reduces fuel costs for the compressor or other facility equipment, in addition t...|$|R

50|$|Investigators {{concluded}} that the disaster {{was due to the}} above-mentioned configuration change on the Atlas C, in addition to several weight-saving modifications unique to Missile 9C. When the Atlas was assembled at Convair, workmen attached a helium <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> to a port {{near the bottom of the}} RP-1 tank, below the anti-slosh baffles. On the Atlas B missiles, the vernier helium tank was mounted in a higher location resulting in a different fuel tank attachment point above the baffles. Helium pressure gas from the vernier propellant tanks leaked into the sustainer RP-1 turbopump, leading to cavitation which caused propellant unloading, pump overspeed, and rupture of the propellant lines. This then caused the fire that led to vehicle destruction. It was not clear whether the fire had been started by rupture of a LOX duct due to sudden pressure change from the helium venting or rubbing of the turbopump blades against the metal casing due to overspeed caused by the pump running without propellant in it. The accident was ultimately ruled to be the result of poor engineering judgement in attaching the vernier helium <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> to the bottom of the RP-1 tank.|$|E

5000|$|These {{chambers}} {{are normally}} cylindrical and operate at atmospheric pressure, but to prevent ingress of moisture a filter containing a desiccant is {{installed in the}} <b>vent</b> <b>line.</b> This is to stop moisture building up {{in the interior of}} the chamber, which would otherwise be introduced by the [...] "pump" [...] effect of changing atmospheric air pressure. These chambers have a cylindrical body made of aluminium or plastic a few millimetres thick. The material is selected to have an atomic number similar to that of air so that the wall is said to be [...] "air equivalent" [...] over a range of radiation beam energies. This has the effect of ensuring the gas in the chamber is acting {{as though it were a}} portion of an infinitely large gas volume, and increases the accuracy by reducing interactions of gamma with the wall material. The higher the atomic number of the wall material, the greater the chance of interaction. The wall thickness is a trade-off between maintaining the air effect with a thicker wall, and increasing sensitivity by using a thinner wall. These chambers often have an end window made of material thin enough, such as mylar, so that beta particles can enter the gas volume. Gamma radiation enters both through the end window and the side walls. For hand-held instruments the wall thickness is made as uniform as possible to reduce photon directionality though any beta window response is obviously highly directional. Vented chambers are susceptible to small changes in efficiency with air pressure [...] and correction factors can be applied for very accurate measurement applications.|$|E

The Eulerian formulation serves as a basis of design, which treats both phases as a continuum. The coupled differential equations to be resolved are, for one the continuity conservation equations (mass balances) and, secondly the momentum conservation equations for both phases. Fundamental knowledge about the flow behavior in the core box is necessary to carry out this simulation. The volume fraction of the sand and the entry velocity into the core box of both phases must be determined experimentally.
