5|$|In 1983's Return of the Jedi, the Emperor {{appears in}} person {{to oversee the}} last stages of the second Death Star's construction. He assures Darth <b>Vader</b> that they will {{together}} turn Luke, now revealed to be Vader's son, to the dark side. Unknown to <b>Vader,</b> the Emperor plans to replace his apprentice with Luke. When <b>Vader</b> brings Luke before his master, the Emperor tempts Luke to join the dark side by appealing to the young Jedi's fear for his friends, whom he has lured into a trap. This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills <b>Vader.</b> The Emperor tells Luke to kill <b>Vader</b> and take his place, but Luke refuses and declares himself a Jedi. Enraged, the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning. Moved by his son's cries for help, <b>Vader</b> throws the Emperor into the Death Star's reactor shaft, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Senators Organa, Mon Mothma, and Garm Bel Iblis meet on Corellia {{to plan a}} {{rebellion}} against the Empire, but are interrupted when Darth <b>Vader</b> arrives and arrests them and Kota. <b>Vader</b> attacks Starkiller and reveals that he {{was never meant to}} overthrow the Emperor; from the beginning, he was the Emperor's tool to expose his enemies, and that Vader's plans to overthrow the Emperor did not include Starkiller. Surviving Vader's attack, Starkiller uses the Force to ascertain the senators' and Kota's location: the Death Star. Inside the space station, Starkiller duels Darth <b>Vader</b> and manages to defeat his former master. As the Emperor goads Starkiller into killing <b>Vader,</b> Kota attempts to fight the Emperor, but is incapacitated by the Emperor's Force lightning.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor first {{appeared}} in The Empire Strikes Back. He appears in hologram form to address Darth <b>Vader,</b> his Sith apprentice. He tells <b>Vader</b> that Luke Skywalker is becoming {{a serious threat to}} the Empire and must not become a Jedi. <b>Vader</b> convinces him that Luke would be a great asset if turned to the dark side.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match Jonathan Coachman, (with Goldust and <b>Vader),</b> faced World Heavyweight Champion Batista in a Street Fight. In {{the start of}} the match, Batista fought both Goldust and <b>Vader,</b> where they {{proceeded}} to beat him down in the corner. However, Batista fought back with a series of Spears. Coachman, who stood on the outside, entered the ring, but didn't last long, as Batista clotheslined him. Batista attempted to suplex <b>Vader</b> but Goldust managed to hit Batista with a kendo stick, allowing Coachman to receive the advantage over Batista. The match concluded after Batista performed a Batista Bomb on Coachman to gain the win.|$|E
5|$|Palpatine {{orders the}} clone troopers {{to turn on}} their Jedi generals, while {{dispatching}} <b>Vader</b> to kill everyone inside the Jedi Temple and then murder the Separatist leaders on the planet Mustafar. Palpatine then reorganizes the Republic into the Galactic Empire, with himself as Emperor. Jedi Master Yoda confronts him in his Senate office and engages the Sith Lord in a lightsaber duel that ends in a stalemate. Sensing that his new apprentice is in danger, Palpatine travels to Mustafar and finds <b>Vader</b> near death following a duel with Obi-Wan. After returning to Coruscant, he rebuilds Vader's burned, mutilated body with the black armored suit from the original trilogy. Palpatine then tells <b>Vader</b> that Padmé {{was killed in the}} heat of Vader's anger, breaking what remains of his apprentice's spirit. Palpatine is last seen watching the original Death Star's construction, with <b>Vader</b> and Wilhuff Tarkin at his side.|$|E

5|$|Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel {{long before}} Lucas would shoot it. They trained {{extensively}} with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together. As {{in the previous}} two prequel films, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes {{without the use of}} stunt doubles. The speed at which <b>Vader</b> and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is mostly the speed at which it was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes. An example of this occurs as Obi-Wan strikes down on <b>Vader</b> after applying an armlock in the duel's first half.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} chooses the dark side, Starkiller kills Darth <b>Vader.</b> The Emperor then offers to let Starkiller take Vader's place as his {{apprentice}} if Starkiller proves himself by killing Kota. Starkiller instead attacks the Emperor, who effortlessly crushes Starkiller with the Rogue Shadow, severely injuring him and killing Kota, Juno, and the Senators. The story ends with Starkiller's broken body being grafted with armor {{so he can}} serve as the Emperor's assassin, though Palpatine assures Starkiller that he, like <b>Vader,</b> will be cast aside when he finds a new apprentice. The Infinities expansion content builds on this ending.|$|E

5|$|On the {{asteroid}} Polis Massa, Obi-Wan regroups with Yoda and Padmé {{gives birth to}} twins named Luke and Leia before dying shortly thereafter. A funeral procession is held for Padmé on Naboo, who is buried with the necklace Anakin made her years earlier. On Mustafar, Palpatine finds a severely burnt <b>Vader</b> still alive. After returning to Coruscant, Vader's mutilated body is treated and covered in a black armored suit. Palpatine explains to <b>Vader</b> that he killed Padmé in his anger. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan and Yoda decide to conceal the twins from the Sith, as they are the galaxy's only hope for freedom. Yoda exiles himself to the planet Dagobah, while <b>Vader</b> and the Emperor oversee {{the construction of a}} superstation, the Death Star. Bail Organa adopts Leia as his own daughter and takes her to Alderaan, while Obi-Wan delivers Luke to his step-family Owen and Beru Lars on Tatooine, where Obi-Wan intends to watch over Luke until the time is right to challenge the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Though {{outwardly}} {{appearing to}} be a well-intentioned public servant and supporter of democracy prior to becoming Emperor, he is actually Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith – a cult of practitioners of {{the dark side of}} the Force previously thought to have been extinct in the Star Wars galaxy for a millennium. As Sidious, he instigates the Clone Wars, nearly destroys the Jedi, and transforms the Republic into the Empire. He also manipulates Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into turning to the dark side and serving at his side as Darth <b>Vader.</b> Palpatine's reign is brought to an end when <b>Vader</b> kills him to save his son, Luke Skywalker.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{convince}} Padmé about Anakin's {{turn to the}} dark side, Obi-Wan stows aboard her ship. Padmé travels to Mustafar and implores <b>Vader</b> to leave the dark side. He refuses, and upon witnessing Obi-Wan, chokes Padmé into unconsciousness {{in a fit of}} rage. Obi-Wan duels and defeats <b>Vader,</b> severing most of his limbs and leaving him at the bank of a lava river where he is horribly burned. On Coruscant, Yoda battles Palpatine until their duel reaches a stalemate. Yoda flees with Bail Organa while Palpatine, sensing that his apprentice is in danger, travels to Mustafar.|$|E

5|$|After Thelma leaves Tom, {{he begins}} showing Peter more affection, causing Lois {{to believe it}} to be strange.

This scene, as with all scenes that contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright.

5|$|The Falcon {{journeys}} to the Rebel base at Yavin IV, {{where the}} Rebels analyze the Death Star plans {{and find a}} weakness. Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave. The Rebel fighters attack the Death Star but suffer heavy losses during the assault. During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, and he turns off his targeting computer. <b>Vader</b> appears with his own group of fighters, {{and is about to}} fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the Falcon and attacks <b>Vader</b> and his men, sending Vader's ship off into space. Guided by the Force, Luke fires into the port, destroying the Death Star, and he returns to the Rebel base with his friends to celebrate their victory.|$|E
5|$|A Rebel ship is {{captured}} by a Star Destroyer. On the ship are the droids C-3PO (Quagmire), R2-D2 (Cleveland) and the rebel leader Princess Leia (Lois). While {{the ship is}} boarded by stormtroopers, Leia tries to send an MPEG to Obi-Wan Kenobi through R2, but encounters so many complications that R2 offers to deliver the message himself. Leia {{is captured}} by Darth <b>Vader</b> (Stewie) while R2 and 3PO flee to Tatooine in an escape pod, where they are captured by Jawas.|$|E
5|$|Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids {{travel to}} Mos Eisley {{to find a}} pilot {{to take them to}} Alderaan. At a local cantina they hire {{smuggler}} Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch in the garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth <b>Vader</b> in a lightsaber duel. <b>Vader</b> strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the Falcon, taking the couch with them.|$|E
