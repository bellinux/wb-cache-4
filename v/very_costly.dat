5|$|In modern Polish historiography the battle's {{outcome is}} seen as a victory, if a <b>very</b> <b>costly</b> one, for the Polish and Soviet troops. As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet {{frontline}} was not seriously breached, and thus the German offensive was a failure.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, {{after many}} years of {{proposals}} and delays, construction began on a major upgrade of the Henlys Corner interchange. An underpass was originally proposed but this was heavily criticised by local residents, and would have been <b>very</b> <b>costly,</b> and was subsequently scrapped. The upgrade scheme improved on the current junction by adding extra lanes and allowing easier left and right turns, speeding up queue times. Cycle paths and safer pedestrian crossings were included.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to its losses, UBS announced a CHF 15billion rights offering {{to raise the}} additional funds need to shore up its depleted reserves of capital. UBS cut its dividend {{in order to protect}} its traditionally high Tier 1 capital ratio, seen by investors as a key to its credibility as the world's largest wealth management company. Marcel Ospel, who had been the architect of the merger that created UBS in 1998, also announced that he would step down as a chairman of the bank to be replaced by Peter Kurer, the bank's general counsel with virtually no banking experience. This ultimately proved <b>very</b> <b>costly</b> to UBS.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx on {{the left}} flank engaged the Spartan phalanx and mercenaries. During the initial assault, the Macedonian phalanx gave a {{considerable}} amount of ground before its weight drove back the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, overwhelmed by the deeper ranks of Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape {{with a small group of}} men. The battle was <b>very</b> <b>costly</b> for the Spartans; most of their army was routed with only 200 of the 6,000 Spartans that fought surviving the battle.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of his {{personal}} style, Cubitt was credited by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, with achieving the desired results. The 38th Division had mounted a successful but <b>very</b> <b>costly</b> attack in April 1918; under Major General Cubitt's command, the division mounted two further major operations, at the Battle of Albert in August and Battle of Cambrai in October. Both were successful, with the division demonstrating flexibility, improvisation, and a highly effective tactical doctrine. The division's performance at Cambrai was sufficiently good to rank {{it as one of}} the most effective British divisions during the Hundred Days Offensive.|$|E
5|$|These {{victories}} {{proved to}} be <b>very</b> <b>costly</b> to Pyrrhus and he diverted his attention to Sicily, where the Greek states on the island were appealing for his help against Carthage. Despite defeating the Carthaginians and occupying most of the island, Pyrrhus' behaviour alienated him from his Greek allies and {{he was forced to}} abandon Sicily and return to the Italian mainland. Pyrrhus attacked the rebuilt Roman army and after the inconclusive Battle of Beneventum, Pyrrhus returned to Epirus after leaving a garrison at Tarentum.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{major issue}} in {{clinical}} laboratory is to produce a precise result for every test especially {{in the area of}} Red Blood Cell (RBC) count. The number of red blood cell is very important to detect as well as to follow the treatment of many diseases like anaemia, leukaemia etc. Red blood cell count gives the vital information that help diagnosis many of the patient’s sickness. The old conventional method of RBC counting under microscope gives an unreliable and inaccurate result depends on clinical laboratory technician skill. This method puts a lot of strain on the technician. Another method for RBC counting uses the automatic hematology analyzer, this machine is <b>very</b> <b>costlier.</b> So it is not possible all the hospital’s clinical laboratory implement such an expensive machine to count the blood cell in their laboratory. This paper introduces an efficient and cost effective computer vision system for automatic red blood cell counting using image based analysis...|$|R

5|$|Van Overstraten {{is desperately}} keen for strong British counterattack. Either {{north or south}} of Leie could help restore the situation. Belgians expect to be {{attacked}} on the Ghent front tomorrow. Germans already have a bridgehead over canal west of Eecloo. There can be no question of the Belgian withdrawal to Yser. One battalion on march NE of Ypres was practically wiped out today in attack by sixty aircraft. Withdrawal over open roads without adequate fighter support <b>very</b> <b>costly.</b> Whole of their supplies are east of Yser. They strongly represent attempt {{should be made to}} restore the situation on Leie by British counter-attack for which opportunity may last another few hours only.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the battle as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence and desire to capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland as a <b>very</b> <b>costly</b> victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Australians {{were far}} more circumspect. The nation's {{involvement}} cost more than 60,000 Australian lives and many more were left unable to work {{as a result of their}} injuries. The impact of the war was felt in many other areas as well. Financially it was <b>very</b> <b>costly,</b> while the effect on the social and political landscape was considerable and threatened to cause serious divides in the nation's social fabric. Conscription was possibly the most contentious issue and ultimately, despite having conscription for home service, Australia was one of only two combatants not to use conscripts in the fighting. Nevertheless, for many Australians the nation's involvement in World War I and the Gallipoli campaign was seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of the Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war and Anzac Day is commemorated as a national holiday.|$|E

While sexual coercion does help increase male fitness, it is <b>very</b> often <b>costly</b> to females. However, {{in spite of these}} costs, a possible benefit to the females is a chance to test the stamina of the males, so that only those with [...] "good genes" [...] will father their offspring.

40|$|In object {{oriented}} paradigm {{the analysis and}} design activities are performed to produce models like analysis model, use case model and design model. These models are developed using Unified Modeling Language abbreviated as UML. Visual modeling using UML {{is the part of}} unified software development process. The wholeness or fullness of documenting requirement engineering models like use case model, result in a better quality software product. If we miss anything or commit any mistake in use case model it may propagate to analysis phase. Further there are chances that the same bug is propagated to design, testing and so on until deployment. The cost of removing bugs in testing is <b>very</b> <b>costlier</b> than that of its removal in the starting phase or model. It is therefore very necessary to verify what model we are developing and after the model making process is verified it is necessary to validate the model; that is to declare that the model we have made is correct. In this paper we have investigated the verification of the process of modeling in {{object oriented}} paradigm and the validation of the models. This workout makes certain that we are working on the precise models to yield correct product from quality point of view...|$|R
5|$|Land {{transport}} remained {{much more}} expensive than river or sea transport during the period. Many towns in this period, including York, Exeter and Lincoln, were linked to the oceans by navigable rivers and could act as seaports, with Bristol's port coming to dominate the lucrative trade in wine with Gascony by the 13th century, but shipbuilding generally remained on a modest scale and economically unimportant to England at this time. Transport remained <b>very</b> <b>costly</b> {{in comparison to the}} overall price of products. By the 13th century, groups of common carriers ran carting businesses, and carting brokers existed in London to link traders and carters. These used the four major land routes crossing England: Ermine Street, the Fosse Way, Icknield Street and Watling Street. A large number of bridges were built during the 12th century to improve the trade network.|$|E
5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are <b>very</b> <b>costly,</b> as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E
5|$|In early April the {{battalion}} {{was moved to}} Alexandria and from there on to Lemnos Island. On the morning of 25 April 1915, {{the battalion}} {{took part in the}} Landing at Anzac Cove, coming ashore as part of the second wave. Over the course of the first week the battalion was involved in establishing the beachhead and suffered heavily, losing five officers and 179 men killed or died of wounds. This was higher than any other subsequent battle that the battalion fought during the war. On 29 April, the 2nd Brigade was relieved by the 12th (Deal) Battalion and in early May the battalion was able to reorganise itself after its baptism of fire. The respite did not last long, however, for only ten days after the landing at Anzac Cove, the 2nd Brigade was transferred to Cape Helles in order to take part in an attack on Krithia on 8 May 1915. The attack was a <b>very</b> <b>costly</b> failure, with the battalion losing a further six officers and 87 men killed. Nevertheless, they were involved in what {{is believed to be the}} first brigade-level attack conducted by an Australian force against an entrenched enemy and the attack earned the Victorians many plaudits.|$|E
40|$|Through out the world, {{concrete}} {{is being}} widely {{used for the}} construction of most of the buildings, bridges etc. Hence, it has been properly labeled as the backbone to the infrastructure development of a nation.

To meet out this rapid infrastructure development a huge quantity of concrete is required.

5|$|In early August, {{in order}} to create a {{diversion}} to draw Ottoman reserves away from a major attack at Hill 971, which had been conceived as part of an attempt to break the stalemate that had developed around the beachhead, the 1st Brigade conducted an attack at Lone Pine. The 2nd Battalion was chosen to take part in the initial assault. After gaining possession of the main enemy line, the Australians were subjected to a series of determined counter-attacks which would last the next three days, which, although successfully repulsed, proved <b>very</b> <b>costly</b> for the Australians. The 2nd Battalion suffered considerably. Having started the action with 22 officers and 560 other ranks, they lost 21 officers and 409 other ranks killed or wounded. Among those killed was its commanding officer, Scobie, who was shot dead while attempting to repulse a counter-attack on 7 August. In Scobie's place, the battalion second-in-command, Major Arthur Stevens, who had been a second lieutenant less than 12 months before, took over as temporary commander.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's {{electricity}} supply was, {{until the early}} 2000s, generated almost entirely from hydroelectric sources; power stations on Lakes Burera and Ruhondo provided 90% of the country's electricity. A combination of below average rainfall and human activity, including the draining of the Rugezi wetlands for cultivation and grazing, caused the two lakes' water levels to fall from 1990 onwards; by 2004 levels were reduced by 50%, leading to {{a sharp drop in}} output from the power stations. This, coupled with increased demand as the economy grew, precipitated a shortfall in 2004 and widespread loadshedding. As an emergency measure, the government installed diesel generators north of Kigali; by 2006 these were providing 56% of the country's electricity, but were <b>very</b> <b>costly.</b> The government enacted a number of measures to alleviate this problem, including rehabilitating the Rugezi wetlands, which supply water to Burera and Ruhondo and investing in a scheme to extract methane gas from Lake Kivu, expected in its first phase to increase the country's power generation by 40%. Only 18% of the population had access to electricity in 2012, though this had risen from 10.8% in 2009. The government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013–18 aims to increase access to electricity to 70% of households by 2017.|$|E
5|$|General Nansouty {{arrived in}} Paris {{and there he}} {{remained}} during the Bourbon Restoration that followed Napoleon's abdication. He {{was one of the}} first general officers to swear allegiance to the new King of France, Louis XVIII, who would bestow a number of honours upon the General. His gesture encouraged many other generals to also swear allegiance to the new regime. On 12 April 1814, Nansouty was named extraordinary commissioner of the King in the 2nd military division, then, on 20 April, became a member of the commission that was in charge of the dissolution of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. He was given the distinction of Knight of the Order of Saint Louis on 1 June and on 6 July he was called to a command in the Military Household of the King of France, as captain-lieutenant of the 1st company of musketeers (grey musketeers). Despite these positions, Nansouty's financial situation declined severely under the Restoration. The General had had a highly honourable behaviour during the Napoleonic Wars and, unlike some of his fellow Napoleonic Generals, had drawn no revenues from pillaging. He had also been living a lofty and <b>very</b> <b>costly</b> lifestyle, which he considered normal for a nobleman such as himself. Nansouty had been earning a high revenue from his various positions during the Empire and additionally Napoleon was constantly paying high endowments to his best generals. Napoleonic endowments aside, Nansouty's salaries during the first four months of 1814 had brought him no less than 104,000 Francs, but, under the Bourbons, his dignity as Colonel-General of dragoons had been suppressed and transformed into an honorific title of Inspector of dragoons, leaving him with only a 25,000 Francs salary as captain-lieutenant in the King's Military Household.|$|E
