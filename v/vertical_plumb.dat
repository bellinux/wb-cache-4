40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{are often}} required to resist lateral loading. Lateral loads {{come from a}} variety of sources including wind, earthquakes, waves, and ship impacts. The lateral capacity of a pile is usually much smaller than the axial capacity and as a result groups of piles are often installed to increase the lateral capacity of the entire foundation system. When <b>vertical</b> or <b>plumb</b> pile groups do not provide sufficient lateral resistance the piles can be battered in order to mobilize some of the higher axial capacity to resist the lateral load. Several methods are available for predicting the ultimate lateral resistance to piles in sandy soil. However, these methods often produce significantly different ultimate resistance values. This makes it difficult for practicing engineers to effectively select the appropriate method when designing laterally loaded piles in sandy soil. In this paper, lateral load behavior of single piles in sandy soil was studied, for different L/D ratio by changing the diameter and length of pile. The analysis was carried out considering long free-head pile. The influence of soil type, effect of pile length and pile diameter on the pile response was observed and the results obtained by IS 2911 Part 1 (sec 2) and Matlock & Reese were presented...|$|R

5000|$|When the Airy transit circle was built, a mercury basin {{was used}} to align the {{telescope}} to the perpendicular. Thus the circle was aligned with the local <b>vertical</b> or <b>plumb</b> line, which is deflected slightly from the normal, or line perpendicular, to the reference ellipsoid used to define geodetic latitude and longitude in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (which is nearly {{the same as the}} WGS-84 system used by GPS). While the local vertical defined at the Airy transit circle still points to the modern celestial meridian (the intersection of the prime meridian plane with the celestial sphere), it does not pass through the Earth's rotation axis. As a result of this, the ITRF zero meridian, defined by a plane passing through the Earth's rotation axis, is 102 metres to the east of the prime meridian. A 2015 analysis by Malys et al. shows the offset between the Airy transit circle and the ITRF/WGS 84 meridians can be explained by this deflection of the vertical alone; other possible sources of the offset that have been proposed in the past are smaller than the current uncertainty in the deflection of the vertical near the observatory. The astronomical longitude of the Greenwich prime meridian was found to be 0.19&Prime; ± 0.47&Prime; East, i.e. the plane defined by the local vertical on the Greenwich prime meridian and the plane passing through the Earth's rotation axis on the ITRF zero meridian are effectively parallel. However, the claim, found, e.g., in a BBC article that this difference between astronomical and geodetic coordinates means that any measurements of transit time across the IRTF zero meridian will occur 0.352 seconds (or 0.353 sidereal seconds) before the transit across the [...] "intended meridian" [...] is based on a failure of understanding.

On 12 December it caught fire when a defective fuel gasket blew out; the repairs took a fortnight.

40|$|Introduction: WITS {{appraisal}} is {{a common}} parameter in cephalometrics to assess maxillo-mandibular skeletal relationship {{as an adjunct to}} angle ANB. The high variability of the WITS appraisal is attributable to difficulties or inaccuracies in identifying the occlusal plane or variations due to tooth eruption, dental development or treatment changes by vertical movement of incisors, molars, or both. Aim: An extracranial reference line common to both denture bases, instead of the occlusal plane is proposed to assess antero-posterior jaw relationships. Materials and Methods: A true <b>vertical</b> obtained by <b>plumb</b> line was recorded, while taking the cephalogram for 40 subjects. A line drawn perpendicular to this true vertical gave a stable and reproducible extracranial true horizontal (HOR) reference line. The linear distance between perpendiculars from points A and B was measured as an adjunct to angle ANB. Result: The Pearson′s product moment correlation coefficient calculated for the entire sample indicated higher correlation coefficient (r = 0. 8712) for the linear measurements on HOR (AH-BH) with respect to the angle ANB when compared with the WITS readings (AO-BO) (r = 0. 549). Conclusion: The horizontal appraisal method proposed eliminates the demerits of the occlusal plane and has the merits of simplicity and accuracy in comparison to WITS appraisal...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} scoliosis affecting primary school children aged ten to eleven in the metropolis of Johannesburg, South Africa, by using clinical screening methods. Comparisons are drawn between gender, race groups and government and independent primary schools. DESIGN A case study approach, incorporating the clinical screening of primary school children aged ten to eleven years, of all races and both genders, in both government and independent schools, was used. Thirty-two primary schools were considered (sixteen government and sixteen independent primary schools) out of which one class of pupils satisfying the age criteria of the sample group was randomly selected for screening. PROCEDURE Children involved {{in the study were}} screened for scoliosis using two methods, namely Adams’ Position and the Erect Position. Screening in the Erect Position made use of a <b>vertical</b> <b>plumb</b> line to detect deviation of the spine from the midline. Screening for scoliosis using the Adams’ Position required the subject to flex his/her trunk forward so that the skyline of the back could be observed for the presence of a rib hump unilaterally. At least one of the abovementioned tests had to be positive to make the diagnosis of scoliosis. Subjects’ age, gender, race, school and test results were captured on data collection forms for statistical evaluation. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of scoliosis, including all forms of the disease, was found to be far greater in the primary schools of Johannesburg than what statistics for the United States and world incidence indicated. Scoliosis was found to be most prevalent in independent primary schools and in White children, with socio-economic status having a seemingly strong influence on the prevalence of scoliosis. The male to female ratio of scoliosis was found to be statistically equal. Dr. M. A. Buchholtz Dr. M. Moodle...|$|E
