40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a case of}} mucinous adenocarcinoma with superficial stromal invasion and villous adenoma originating in {{the dome of the}} urinary bladder. Although no urachal remnants were identified, the location suggested urachal derivation. Only two previous cases of urachal adenocarcinoma with features of early stromal invasion associated with a <b>villous</b> <b>tumour</b> have been described...|$|E
40|$|Localized giant pseudopolyposis of {{the colon}} (pseudopolyp larger than 1. 5 cm in size) is a rare {{complication}} of inflammatory bowel disease. There is one report of an occult carcinoma within such a lesion, and no reports of sole dysplasia. A case of a 42 -year-old man with longstanding Crohn’s colitis who underwent a colonoscopy revealing a large, multilobulated mass at the splenic flexure that was not amenable to endoscopic removal, is described. Multiple biopsies showed no dysplasia and histology was consistent with an inflammatory pseudopolyp. Computed tomographic colonography demonstrated a mass resembling a large <b>villous</b> <b>tumour.</b> A decision for surgery was made. The surgical specimen was a complex anastomosing inflammatory pseudopolyp 5 cm × 4 cm × 3 cm in size, with a focus of low-grade dysplasia in an area free of inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{clinical}} relevance of MR and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) imaging of rectal <b>villous</b> <b>tumours</b> to elucidate the correlation between imaging results and specific histopathological tumour features, such as tumour size (T) and lymph node involvement (N), in order to establish the better technique for the pre-surgical patient evaluation. Patients and methods: 23 cases of <b>villous</b> <b>tumours</b> of the rectum were studied with phased-array MR and TRUS. All patients underwent either surgical or endoscopic treatment. Final diagnosis was based on histopathological results. In particular, the following features were characterized by the imaging techniques mentioned above: lesion site, distance between lesion and ano-rectal junction, size, morphology and contrast enhancement of lesions, fluid layer around the lesion, alterations of the deep layers of the rectal wall, sphincter infiltration, presence or absence of mesorectal, iliac and obturatory lymphnode involvement. Results: Histology established muscular involvement in 7 cases (T 2), perirectal fat infiltration in 1 case (T 3) : in the remaining 15 cases, staging was Tis-T 1. In 17 / 23 cases (73. 9 %) the lesions were correctly staged with both imaging techniques, whereas in 5 / 23 cases (21. 7 %) the lesions were overstaged. No cases were understaged. TRUS concorded with histological exams in 17 / 23 cases (73. 9 %). 5 / 23 cases (21. 7 %) were overstaged and 1 / 23 (4 %) was understaged. MR and TRUS were in accordance in 20 / 23 cases (86. 9 %). Discussion: Considering the frequent degeneration of <b>villous</b> <b>tumours,</b> correct preoperative identification and precise evaluation of these lesions, such as the detection of rectal wall invasion, is essential in deciding optimal treatment strategy. MRI and TRUS allow the identification of specific features of <b>villous</b> <b>tumours</b> and of malignant degeneration, allowing for a correct local disease staging. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|A 68 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of bone-graft {{harvesting}} from the right iliac crest presented with an incisional hernia and abscess at the graft donor site. Following incision and drainage of the abscess, CT demonstrated an enterocutaneous fistula between the appendix and bone-graft incision with appendicitis assumed to be the original cause of the abscess. At laparoscopy, the appendix was adherent to the hernia sac with mucinous material at the superficial orifice of the fistula site but not in the peritoneal cavity. Laparoscopic appendicectomy with fistula track excision was performed. Histological evaluation confirmed a well-to-moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma arising on a background of dysplastic <b>villous</b> adenoma. <b>Tumour</b> extended along the fistula track to involve the surface skin. A laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, lymph node dissection and wide local excision of the fistula track were carried out at a second procedure. Final histology confirmed pT 4 N 1 tumour with clear resection margins. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Context Enteric {{duplication}} cysts {{are rare}} lesions of uncertain incidence and natural history. Pre-operative confirmation of diagnosis can be difficult. This case reports an adult duodenal duplication cyst presenting with grossly elevated intra-lesional levels of tumour markers. Case report A 57 -year-old female {{was found to}} have a complex cystic lesion of the head of the pancreas. Intra-lesional fluid analysis revealed a grossly elevated CA 19 - 9 and CEA. Resection was undertaken under the assumption that this was a cystic tumour. Macroscopic examination after opening the duodenum revealed a <b>villous,</b> circumferential <b>tumour</b> in the proximal duodenum measuring 4 cm in length. A cystic lesion was present in the medial wall of the tumour and did not communicate with the duodenal lumen. Microscopically, the tumour comprised Brunner’s gland hyperplasia with associated mucosal thickening. The wall of the underlying cystic lesion was comprised of muscularis formed by the outer muscle coat of the duodenal wall. The final diagnosis was of a duodenal duplication cyst. There was no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. Conclusion This is the first report of a duodenal duplication cyst having elevated intra-cyst fluid levels of amylase, carbohydrate antigen CA 19 - 9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Although rare, this is an important differential diagnosis in the management of cystic tumours of the pancreas...|$|R
40|$|Background: Early {{colorectal}} cancer {{is defined as}} carcinoma limited to the mucosa or submucosa. Up to 20 per cent of all {{colorectal cancer}}s treated in some Japanese institutions are early cancers. These cancers are sometimes flat or depressed, and may be less than 1 cm in diameter. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the frequency and morphology of early colonic cancers detected at colonoscopy by a surgeon aware of and looking for such lesions. Methods: A review was made of all colonoscopies performed by or under the supervision of a single endoscopist between 1990 and 1998. Follow-up and outcome of all patients with early colorectal cancer was undertaken. Results: Ninety-five invasive colorectal cancers were identified from 2198 colonoscopies. Eighteen were early colorectal cancers (T 1). Macroscopically these were flat (nine <b>tumours),</b> <b>villous</b> (four) and pedunculated (five). Two patients had lymph node metastasis. The median size of flat cancers was 20 (range 9 – 30) mm. Median follow-up was 3 years. One patient had local recurrence, and another, whose early cancer was metachronous, died from metastatic cancer. Conclusion: This study identified early colonic cancer with similar frequency and morphology to that reported by the Japanese. Colonoscopy should be considered as the investigation of choice for patients with large bowel symptoms...|$|R
