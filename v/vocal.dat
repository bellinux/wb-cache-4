5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound {{because of the}} lack of a melon and <b>vocal</b> cords. In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to <b>vocal</b> cords. They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular <b>vocal</b> cords of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound with support from the arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|E
