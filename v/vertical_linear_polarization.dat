40|$|Abstract—Polarization {{reconfigurable}} patch antennas {{which can}} switch polarization states among <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> (LP), left- and {{right-hand circular polarization}} (CP) is demonstrated in this paper. The original orthogonal linear polarized antenna is a square patch fed by two ports at the adjacent edges. CP operations can be activated by introducing perturbations at the opposite corners of the patch. If a diode is loaded on every perturbed corner, the antenna polarization states can be alternated by {{controlling the bias voltage}} of two PIN diodes. Perturbation elements can be cut on the patch or on the ground. Two antenna prototypes are suggested, simulated, and verified by experiments. These polarization reconfigurable antennas have good antenna performances of low reflection coefficient, axial ratio, and cross-polarization (X-pol), and high isolation between two LP operations. They have concise structure with only two PIN diodes being required. The two reconfigurable antennas are low cost and can be integrated easily in wireless communication systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Measurement of {{the third}} and fourth Stokes {{parameters}} of microwave thermal emission can be degraded by nonideal radiometer characteristics. Of particular importance is the level of polarization purity and the knowledge of polarization impurity {{on the part of the}} instrument. An explicit relationship is developed between the true Stokes parameters and the measurements, as functions of nonideal polarization characteristics. In principle, knowledge of the characteristics allows the degradation to be removed by a postprocessing calibration procedure. However, errors in the knowledge are possible, resulting from inexact initial testing and/or subsequent drifting of the instrument. The effects of these errors on overall calibration are considered. It is found that there is considerably greater tolerance to the errors when incoherent detection is used (differencing 6458 linear and left- or right-hand circular polarizations), as opposed to coherent detection (direct cross correlation of <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>linear</b> <b>polarizations).</b> This is particularly true when cross-polar leakage is imbalanced. The level of nominal polarization purity that is required is also more relaxed in the incoherent case. On the other hand, coherent detection has the capability for superior performance with regard to precision. 1...|$|R

We present novel algorithms for the proper calibration and treatment of such interferometric observations and test our algorithms with both simulations and real data. The use of our algorithms will be important for the optimum calibration of forthcoming observations with the Atacama Large mm/submm Array (ALMA) in very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) mode. Our algorithms will also allow us to optimally calibrate future VLBI observations at very high data rates (i. e., wide bandwidths), where linear-polarization feeds will be preferable at some stations, to overcome the polarimetric limitations due {{to the use of}} quarter-wave plates.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} fabrication of a customized in house Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) process based on-chip antenna that is both frequency and polarization reconfigurable. It is designed to work at both 60 GHz and 77 GHz through MEMS switches. This antenna can also work in both horizontal and vertical linear polarizations by utilizing a moveable plate. The design is intended for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) and automotive radar applications. Typical on-chip antennas are inefficient and difficult to reconfigure. Therefore, {{the focus of this}} work is to develop an efficient on-chip antenna solution, which is reconfigurable in frequency and in polarization. A fractal bowtie antenna is employed for this thesis, which achieves frequency reconfigurability through MEMS switches. The design is simulated in industry standard Electromagnetic (EM) simulator Ansoft HFSS. A novel concept for horizontal to <b>vertical</b> <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> agility is introduced which incorporates a moveable polymer plate. For this work, a microprobe is used to move the plate from the horizontal to vertical position. For testing purposes, a novel mechanism has been designed in order to feed the antenna with RF-probes in both horizontal and vertical positions. A simulated gain of approximately 0 dB is achieved at both target frequencies (60 and 77 GHz), in both horizontal and vertical positions. In all the cases mentioned above (both frequencies and positions), the antenna is well matched (< - 10 dB) to the 50 Ω system impedance. Similarly, the radiation nulls are successfully shifted by changing the position of the antenna from horizontal to vertical. The complete design and fabrication of the reconfigurable MEMS antenna has been done at KAUST facilities. Some challenges have been encountered during its realization due to the immaturity of the customized MEMS fabrication process. Nonetheless, a first fabrication attempt has highlighted such shortcomings. According to the high gain obtained in a lossy silicon substrate and the compatibility of the custom MEMS process with {{the state of the art}} standard CMOS process, it is believed that the design of this antenna can lead to efficient and low cost reconfigurable millimeter-wave System-on-Chip (SoC) solution...|$|E
