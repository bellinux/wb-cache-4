25|$|A {{variety of}} iron, copper, arsenic and zinc ores such as arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, pyrite and {{chalcopyrite}} with sphalerite, are present as small veins and in quartz veins throughout north-trending shear zones that cut the iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. Dikes composed of quartz-feldspar porphyry run parallel to or lie within the shear zones and are {{cut by the}} mineralization. Chalcopyrite occupies later fractures which intersect massive arsenopyrite. Sparse quartz veins normally exist in or adjacent to the arsenopyrite-rich zones. Several northeast-trending deformation zones intersect pyroxenite of a mafic sill in northwest Strathy Township. Within these high-strain zones quartz veins normally contain chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite with exsolved pentlandite and traces of sphalerite and galena. Chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and pentlandite are deposited throughout shear zones which lack quartz <b>veining.</b> These zones are not known to contain large amounts of gold, although investigations are incomplete.

25|$|At {{the time}} of opening in 1910, the {{addition}} was of French Renaissance design, carried out {{in a general way}} in the interior though there was a slight leaning toward the Spanish in the exterior details. The addition and the older structure were connected with a large courtyard between the two buildings, forming an angle at this point. The ground floor contained a large lobby. To its right was the main dining room and to the left, the Broadway Cafe. Just underneath the Broadway Cafe, down a flight of marble stairs, was the Grill. The Broadway Cafe contained walls of light, artificial stone and its ceiling was treated in the Italian Renaissance style, ornamented in low relief. The corridor walls were of Greek Skyros marble in gray and yellow with a slight <b>veining</b> of purple. The coffered ceiling carried out this color scheme. The large dining room was modelled after the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre. The first floor contained a foyer in Louis XIV style, with carved, dark oak woodwork and walls completely covered in tapestries of the period. From this foyer opened out the Tea Room whose walls of artificial stone were covered with wooden grillage, painted green while the skylight over the entire room was concealed by rafters and grillage with entwined vines. Adjoining this was a Flemish-style Banquet Room in dark oak. Carved wooden doors were set with panelled mirrors in the foyer hall. Elevator doors were of bronze.|$|E

2500|$|Included in {{the grains}} are {{intrusions}} (non-calcite material) {{which does not}} vary significantly among the four grades; tests in the late 1990s confirm the 1910 amount of 0.5%. [...] Constant inclusions in all Yules are magnesium oxide (MgO), manganese oxide (MnO), iron oxide (FeO), and strontium oxide (SrO) while other inclusions vary by quarry location. [...] Inclusions are in four groups: quartz (the most abundant and gray in color); muscovite (mica, occurs as thin gold lines and streaks, and also occurs with quartz in clouds of gray mixed with brown); feldspar (with larger grain size 0.591inches (15mm) to 1.379inches (35mm) and gray in color but less translucent than quartz inclusions); and pyrite.

2500|$|The Egyptians {{were the}} first to produce an {{artificial}} imitation of turquoise, in the glazed earthenware product faience.

Most of these products differ markedly from natural turquoise in both physical and chemical properties, but in 1972 Pierre Gilson introduced one fairly close to a true synthetic (it does differ in chemical composition owing to a binder used, meaning it is best described as a simulant rather than a synthetic).

2500|$|Yahalom (יָהֳלֹם = in the masoretic text) / Onychion (in the Septuagint) - in {{some other}} places the Septuagint instead has Beryllios where the masoretic reads Yahalom. The word Yahalom appears to be {{connected}} with the Hebrew meaning strike hard, and possibly with the word hallamish meaning flint; hallamish {{is connected to the}} Assyrian word elmeshu, referring to a precious stone which was hard, and possibly white, or at least with an insignificant colour, and from which whole rings were sometimes made. A few scholars have suggested that Yahalom may refer to diamonds, owing to their hardness, though the skill of cutting diamonds had not been discovered before the classical era. Although the Septuagint's Onychion is the Greek term for Onyx, Onyx was not mined prior to the era of classical Greece. Onyx is derived from the Greek for fingernail, due to the pink-white <b>veining.</b> In the Syriac Peshitta of the sixth or seventh century (MS. B.21, Inferiore of the Ambrosian Library in Milan, Italy), the word used to describe this stone is ܢܩܥܬܐ = naq'atha, a word which is sometimes transliterated into Arabic as it is pronounced in Aramaic, mainly by Arabic-speaking Christians. Bar-Ali, a 9th-century Arab author, brings down two opinions about this stone, the naq'atha, saying, by one opinion, that it is [...] "honey-coloured," [...] and by the other opinion that it is [...] "turquoise, a blue-coloured stone." [...] In some versions of the Peshitta, the Aramaic word rendered for the same stone is shabzez, translated as [...] "diamond." [...] This may account for today's understanding of this word, although in ancient times yahalom may have meant something else. Of the well-known honey-coloured gemstones, we find Citrene and Hessonite garnet (both, from Sri Lanka), while in Africa (Tanzania) we find Imperial Zircon, a honey-coloured stone with an extreme brilliance. Spanish Jewish scholar, Abraham ibn Ezra says the yahalom was a white stone.|$|E
2500|$|Nevada is the country's {{other major}} producer, {{with more than}} 120 mines which have yielded {{significant}} quantities of turquoise. Unlike elsewhere in the US, most Nevada mines have been worked primarily for their gem turquoise and very little has been recovered as a byproduct of other mining operations. Nevada turquoise is found as nuggets, fracture fillings and in breccias as the cement filling interstices between fragments. Because of the geology of the Nevada deposits, {{a majority of the}} material produced is hard and dense, being of sufficient quality that no treatment or enhancement is required. While nearly every county in the state has yielded some turquoise, the chief producers are in Lander and Esmeralda counties. Most of the turquoise deposits in Nevada occur along a wide belt of tectonic activity that coincides with the state's zone of thrust faulting. It strikes about N15°E and extends from the northern part of Elko County, southward down to the California border southwest of Tonopah. Nevada has produced a wide diversity of colours and mixes of different matrix patterns, with turquoise from Nevada coming in various shades of blue, blue-green, and green. Some of this unusually coloured turquoise may contain significant zinc and iron, which is the cause of the beautiful bright green to yellow-green shades. Some of the green to green yellow shades may actually be variscite or faustite, which are secondary phosphate minerals similar in appearance to turquoise. A significant portion of the Nevada material is also noted for its often attractive brown or black limonite <b>veining,</b> producing what is called [...] "spiderweb matrix". While a number of the Nevada deposits were first worked by Native Americans, the total Nevada turquoise production since the 1870s has been estimated at more than 600 tons, including nearly 400 tons from the Carico Lake mine. In spite of increased costs, small scale mining operations continue at a number of turquoise properties in Nevada, including the Godber, Orvil Jack and Carico Lake mines in Lander County, the Pilot Mountain Mine in Mineral County, and several properties in the Royston and Candelaria areas of Esmerelda County.|$|E
