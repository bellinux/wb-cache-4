40|$|In many {{industrial}} applications, {{such as in}} {{the automotive}} and machine building industry, there is a continuous push towards lightweight materials motivated by material and energy savings. This increased use of lightweight materials, however, can strongly compromise the Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) performance of the final products. Especially in times where the NVH performance not only receives a higher legislative attention, but also becomes a commercial differentiator, this also represents a key point of attention for designers and directs research activities towards new experimental and numerical techniques to accurately predict the NVH performance of lightweight systems as early as possible in the design process. The presented work discusses novel measurement setup, specifically developed for examining the vibro-acoustic behaviour of lightweight structures. The test stand consists of a concrete cavity of 0. 83 m³. At its front wall, test specimens of variable size and thickness can be inserted. This test setup allows applying both acoustic and structural excitation.
