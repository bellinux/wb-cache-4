25|$|Sam Malloy (Aidan Mitchell) – Sam, the {{youngest}} Malloy child, is transgender and frequently dresses in feminine clothing. The idea for Sam's non-binary gender expression came about before Izzard—a gender non-conforming comedian—joined the show. Sam's gender expression is accepted and respected {{by their parents}} and siblings. On their first night in the Rich home, Sam draws a large mural on a bedroom wall depicting the family's recent adventures, including the car accident and Dahlia's release from prison. In addition to artistic skill, Sam is interested in French and very earnest about getting a good education. Like {{the rest of the}} family, Sam appears to be <b>very</b> <b>clever</b> and adept at trickery. In episode 3, Sam is the key player in an elaborate con of Dahlia's to get the Malloy children into Rosemere Academy. During the season 1 finale, Sam expresses reluctance and even denial in leaving Eden Falls.|$|E
25|$|Noll {{has become}} a popular {{internet}} meme, particularly in Australia. The popular phrase 'Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australian Idol title' gained popularity in 2015, with multiple Facebook pages appearing featuring the phrase. Noll acknowledged the internet fame, finding it 'very funny' and stating 'Some of the stuff they’ve done is bloody brilliant and <b>very</b> <b>clever</b> and very funny. I reckon half of the kids putting together these memes {{need to be on}} my marketing team!' In January 2016 a Facebook page was created titled 'Get Shannon Noll to Groovin' the Moo 2016'. Despite the pages thousands of likes the organisers of Groovin' the Moo didn't reach out to the artist to perform. In June 2016, the 'GATchphrase' for the 2016 GAT (a theme chosen by the VCE students of Victoria to write into their papers to show group protest) was voted to be Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australia Idol title. An estimated 3,600 took part in this event. Noll is recognisable by his southern cross tattoo, an image of which was highly circulated in internet meme culture. This displays his patriotic pride and love for Australia.|$|E
25|$|In general The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a {{considerable}} achievement for a first-off author. The country-house-party murder is a stereotype in the detective-story genre, which Christie makes no great use of. Not her sort of occasion, at least later in life, and perhaps not really her class. The family party is much more in her line, {{and this is what}} we have here. This is one of the few Christies anchored in time and space: we are in Essex, during the First World War. The family is kept together under one roof by the exigencies of war and of a matriarch demanding rather than tyrannical – not one of her later splendid monsters, but a sympathetic and lightly shaded characterisation. If the lifestyle of the family still seems to us lavish, even wasteful, nevertheless we have the half sense that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Edwardian summer, that the era of country-house living has entered its final phase. Christie takes advantage of this end-of-an-era feeling in several ways: while she uses the full range of servants and their testimony, a sense of decline, of break-up is evident; feudal attitudes exist, but they crack easily. The marriage of the matriarch with a mysterious nobody is the central out-of-joint event in an intricate web of subtle changes. The family is lightly but effectively characterised, and on the outskirts of the story are the villagers, the small businessmen, and the surrounding farmers – the nucleus of Mayhem Parva. It is, too, a <b>very</b> <b>clever</b> story, with clues and red herrings falling thick and fast. We are entering the age when plans of the house were an indispensable aid to the aspirant solver of detective stories, and when cleverness was more important than suspense. But here we come to a problem that Agatha Christie has not yet solved, for cleverness over the long length easily becomes exhausting, and too many clues tend to cancel each other out, as far as reader interest is concerned. These were problems which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.".|$|E

500|$|The writers later {{noted that}} the episode divided fans. Essentially, those who loved it were those who {{realized}} that the writing was intentionally bad {{as a way of}} parodying bad television writing, while others who did not understand this distinction were less enthusiastic. Matt Groening feared that the fans would interpret the episode in a negative light and was uneasy about the episode when it was in production. He later {{went on to say that}} the episode [...] "turned out great". The writers of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood called it, [...] "A <b>very</b> <b>clever</b> spin on the alternates offered by the Treehouse of Horrors run. Each of the spin-offs is <b>very</b> <b>clever</b> in its own way." [...] It has also appeared as one of the favorite episodes on a number of [...] "best of" [...] lists. Entertainment Weekly placed the episode 19th in their top 25 Simpsons episode list. In an interview for Star-News, The Simpsons writer Don Payne revealed that the episode was in his personal top six of the best The Simpsons episodes. Additionally, Gary Mullinax, a staff writer for The News Journal, picked the episode as part of his top-ten list.|$|E

500|$|Shelley Conn plays Danni Prendiville, {{an officer}} with Section 20. Porter started {{an affair with}} her after he was redrafted into service.

500|$|IGN's Robert Canning {{also found}} the long-running {{football}} vs. glee storyline repetitive, but wrote that the football players joining glee club was [...] "a welcome twist", however convoluted and unrealistic. He rated the episode 8/10, finding it [...] "preposterously fun". Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker considered the episode [...] "at once in-your-face and under-handed, <b>very</b> <b>clever</b> about its very cynicism." [...] He noted that while he had become jaded with Glee, he enjoyed [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", summarizing that, [...] "Everything in this episode was chaotic and topsy-turvy, but you never had the feeling the silliness was {{getting away from the}} producers.
