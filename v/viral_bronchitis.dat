40|$|ABSTRACT Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a glyco-protein and {{a member}} of the C-type lectin super family, the collectin family, and the acute phase protein family.

The factors behind the predominance of Ark DPI IBV isolates are unclear. Analysis of ArkDPI derived vaccines currently used in the US revealed that they are heterogeneous and that some minor viral subpopulations within these vaccines efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract of chickens and are selected as early as three days post vaccination. The proportion of these minor subpopulation differed among the Ark vaccines. We analyzed {{the significance of these}} viral subpopulations within the Ark serotype vaccines. We found that Ark vaccines containing high proportions of the selected subpopulations resulted in higher viral loads, more severe respiratory signs and tracheal pathology but also a higher immune response.

BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections [...] acute bronchitis and community acquired pneumonia (CAP) [...] are important causes of morbidity in Australia. Acute bronchitis is often treated with antibiotics, although {{the cause is}} usually viral. Community acquired pneumonia may be fatal, particularly in the elderly, therefore appropriate assessment and management is essential. OBJECTIVE: This article describes the aetiology, clinical assessment, investigations and management of acute bronchitis and CAP in the community. DISCUSSION: Clinical assessment is important for acute bronchitis and CAP, with investigations such as C reactive protein, serology, and chest X-ray informing diagnosis {{and management of the}} latter. Causative organisms are usually not identified, but are presumed to be <b>viral</b> for acute <b>bronchitis,</b> and Streptococcus pneumoniae for CAP; although 'atypicals' are also important. Antibiotics should generally not be prescribed for acute bronchitis, however, there is some evidence they may provide limited benefits in patients who have chest signs, are very unwell, are older, have comorbidities, or smoke. In patients with CAP, treated outside of hospital, the combination of amoxycillin and doxycycline/roxithromycin is the treatment of choice. Nigel Stocks; John Turnidge; Alan Crocket...|$|R

It is envisaged that herbal products that can stem this trend would be of great benefit. Garcinia kola (GK), also known as bitter kola is one of such plants. Generally used as a social snack and offered to guests in some cultural settings, bitter kola has been indicated in the treatment of laryngitis, general inflammation, <b>bronchitis,</b> <b>viral</b> infections and diabetes. In this study, the effects of methanol seed extract of Garcinia kola on the proliferation of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMCs) in cell culture by Angiotensin II (Ang II) and LPS-induced NO production were carried out. Confluent VSMCs were exposed to GK (25, 50 and 100 μg/ml) before or after treatment with lipopolyssacharide (100 μg/ml), and Angiotensin II (10 - 8 - 10 - 6 M). Cellular proliferation was determined by MTT assay and NO production by Griess assay. Treatment with Angiotensin II (10 - 8, 10 - 6) or LPS significantly enhanced proliferation of VSM cells while LPS significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production. Treatment with GK (25, 50 & 100 μg/ml) attenuated VSM cell proliferation. The results indicate that GK has potential to inhibit mitogen activated vascular cell growth and possibly inhibit inflammatory responses to LPS. Thus GK may be useful in condition that is characterized by cellular proliferation and inflammatory responses...|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{bronchitis}} (IB) is {{an acute}} highly contagious viral respiratory disease of poultry caused by virus {{belongs to the}} family of Coronaviridae. The virus consist of many serotypes with low level of cross-protectivity among serotypes. Field data showed that the outbreaks of IB were frequently reported in chicken flocks, although vaccinations against the disease have been practiced. Hence, the study on serotype relationship among isolates of the viruses is essentially required. The aim {{of this study was to}} isolate and characterize IB viruses from chicken flocks in some areas of Java. Isolation of the virus was carried out in nine-day old embrionated chicken eggs and identified by means of agar gel precipitation (AGP) tests against standard antisera to IB virus. The serotypes of the IB viral isolates were determined by cross-neutralization tests in nine day old embryonated chicken eggs using r value derived from homologous and heterologous serum titres as criteria. This study obtained 12 IB viral isolates which were identified on the basis of the ability to cause lesions in chicken embryos and positive to agar gel presipitation test against standard positive antiserum to the virus. Based on the cross-neutralization tests in embryonated chicken eggs, isolate I. 9 was formed to have relationship closed to Mass- 41 serotype, while I. 2, I. 3, and I. 7 isolates were closely to the serotype of Con- 46. Virus isolates (I. 5, I. 14, I. 24, and I. 25) were decided to have no serotype relationships to either Mass- 41 or Con- 46 serotype. Since the I. 5, I. 14, I. 24 and I. 25 isolates were not neutralized by antisera against the previous identified local infectious <b>bronchitis</b> <b>viral</b> isolates, and that were considered to be distinct serotype to the previously identified local IB viral isolates. ...|$|R

Additionally, bronchitis is described as either acute or chronic depending on its presentation and is also further described by the causative agent. Acute bronchitis {{can be defined as}} acute bacterial or viral infection of the larger airways in healthy patients with no history of recurrent disease. It affects over 40 adults per 1000 each year and consists of transient inflammation of the major bronchi and trachea. Most often it is caused by viral infection and hence antibiotic therapy is not indicated in immunocompetent individuals. <b>Viral</b> <b>bronchitis</b> can sometimes be treated using antiviral medications depending on the virus causing the infection, and medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs and expectorants can help mitigate the symptoms. Treatment of acute bronchitis with antibiotics is common but controversial as their use has only moderate benefit weighted against potential side effects (nausea and vomiting), increased resistance, and cost of treatment in a self-limiting condition. Beta2 agonists are sometimes used to relieve the cough associated with acute bronchitis. In a recent systematic review it was found there was no evidence to support their use.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm. (Pharmacy Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The commonest {{prescribed}} {{group of}} drugs is antimicrobials. Various {{studies have shown}} that they are overused globally. Since Primary health care represents the first tier of the health care system, evaluation of antimicrobial use in primary health w e settings is a necessity to ensure rational and cost-effective use of these agents in the treatment of infectious diseases. It has been reported by Hooton and Levy (2001 : 1088) that 20 % to 50 % of antimicrobials are inappropriately used in developing countries. According to Rebana et al. (1998 : 175) the increasing overuse of antimicrobials has resulted in an enormous escalation in the total costs of drugs contributing to 15 % to 30 % of the total health budget. Hooton and Levy (2001 : 1087) reported in a study that inappropriate use and overuse of antimicrobials are risk factors for the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. There is a high incidence of infectious diseases in developing countries that are due to the rapid spread of resistant strains through over-crowding, poor sanitation and unsafe sexual practices (Liu et al., 1999 : 540). The general objective of the study was the analysis and interpretation of the usage and related costs of antimicrobial prescriptions in a private primary health w e setting in South Africa. The study is a non-experimental, quantitative, retrospective drug utilisation review of antimicrobial usage in a private primary health care setting. Data were obtained from the central database of a private primary health care service provider. Data of nine randomly selected clinics, situated in different geographical areas of South Africa, were extracted for the period 1 st January to 31 st December 2001. The study population was made of the total patient population of patients using antimicrobials during this one year period. Antimicrobial usage was analysed according to: number of patients, age and gender distribution, diagnosis, pharmacological groups. The total number of patients who visited the nine clinics during the year was 83 655 of which 59. 50 % were females and 40. 22 % males. In 0. 28 % of the cases gender was not indicated. Patients in age groups 6 (20 - 40 years) and 7 (40 - 60 years) accounted for the highest number of patients (66. 31 %, n = 54 964). A total of 515 976 medicine items costing R 1 716 318. 90 were prescribed, of these, 18. 69 %, (N= 96 423) were antimicrobials costing 60. 89 %, (R 1 045 108. 00). Of the total number of patients that visited the nine clinics, 65. 34 % (N= 54 663) were prescribed antimicrobials. The total number of diagnoses (140 723) where antimicrobials were prescribed accounted for 68. 52 % (N 46 42 1). The highest number of antimicrobial prescriptions according to pharmacological and age groups were: penicillins followed by sulphonamides and tetracyclines. The diagnoses with the highest number of antimicrobial prescriptions were the respiratory tract infections (<b>viral</b> influenza, acute <b>bronchitis</b> and upper respiratory tract infection) and pelvic inflammatory disease The prescribing of antimicrobials in respiratory tract infections could indicate overuse and inappropriate use of these drugs. Because most of these infections are caused by viruses or other non-bacterial agents, are self limiting. Therefore, the use of antibiotics courses is neither necessary nor appropriate in these conditions. The overuse and inappropriate use of such drugs {{have an effect on the}} health of the patients needing cure, and the general budget on health care service. It is recommended that further studies are conducted on antimicrobial prescribing and use. Master...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the level of antimicrobial peptides in the blood serum of 46 young children with acute bronchitis depending on the etiological factor.

The Gram-negative bacteria Haemophilus influenzaе (32. 6 %) is a leading etiological factor in the development of acute bacterial bronchitis. It is proved that the development of acute bronchitis in young children occurs due to lower activity of the antimicrobial peptide (human bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (hBPI)), and is independent of etiologic factor.

40|$|Background: Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{is a significant}} public health problem. Prudent use of antibiotics is crucial in reducing this resistance. Acute bronchitis is a common reason for consultations with general medical practitioners, and antibiotics are often prescribed even though guidelines recommend not prescribing them for uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Objective: To analyse the antibiotic prescription patterns of South African (SA) general medical practitioners {{in the treatment of}} acute bronchitis. Methods: The 2013 claims for members of 11 health insurance schemes were analysed to assess antibiotic prescription patterns for patients diagnosed with acute bronchitis. The patterns were assessed by type of bronchitis, chronic health status of the patients, sex and age group. The types of antibiotic prescribed were also analysed. Results: Of 166 821 events analysed, an antibiotic was prescribed in more than half (52. 9 %). There were significant differences by type of bronchitis and chronic health status. Patients with <b>viral</b> <b>bronchitis</b> {{were more likely to be}} prescribed an antibiotic than those with bacterial bronchitis (odds ratio (OR) 1. 17, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 08 - 1. 26). Patients with a chronic illness were less likely to be prescribed an antibiotic than those without (OR 0. 58, 95 % CI 0. 57 - 0. 60). More than 70 % of the antibiotics prescribed were cephalosporins, penicillins and other beta-lactams. Conclusions: Prescription rates of antibiotics for acute bronchitis by SA general medical practitioners are high. There is an urgent need to follow the guidelines for antibiotic use for acute bronchitis to reduce the likelihood of increasing resistance to available antibiotics. IS...|$|E
