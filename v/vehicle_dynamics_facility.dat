40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> prediction system, {{which consists of}} a sensor fusion system and a vehicle parameter identification system. This sensor fusion system can obtain the six degree-of-freedom <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> and two road angles withoutusing a vehicle model. The vehicle parameter identification system uses the <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> from the sensor fusion system to identify ten vehicle parameters in real time, includingvehicle mass, moment of inertial, and road friction coefficients. With above two systems, the future <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> is predicted by using a <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> model, obtained from the parameter identification system, to propagate with time the current vehicle state values, obtained from the sensor fusion system. Comparing with most existing literatures in this field, the proposed approach improves the prediction accuracy both by incorporating more <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> to the prediction system and by on-line identification to minimize the vehicle modeling errors. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed method successfully predicts the <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> in a left-hand turn event and a rollover event. The prediction inaccuracy is 0. 51 % in a left-hand turn event and 27. 3 % in a rollover event...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for estimation and prediction of <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> states by incorporating digital road map and <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> models. Precise information about <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> states {{is essential for the}} safety and stability of vehicle. In particular, the tire-road contact forces and vehicle side slip angle are the most important parameters for evaluating the safety of <b>vehicle.</b> Nevertheless, these <b>dynamics</b> states are immeasurable with low cost sensors. Therefore, different observers, or the so-called virtual sensors are developed to estimate <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> states. However, the existing observers are only capable in estimating <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> states at a current instant but not to predict the potential dangers in a future instant. In order to make time for correcting drive behaviors, especially when driving at high speed, it seems very appealing for us to predict an impending dangerous event and react before the danger occurs. In this paper, the estimation of <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> states is based on the fusion of information from inertial sensors, GPS and OpenStreetMap. The geometry of the upcoming path ahead of vehicle is provided by the digital map and is employed to predict the future dynamics states...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest in optimising driver-vehicle interaction by improving <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Understanding the relation between subjective and objective assessment of <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> is an increasingly important issue. There are several reasons for these developments. Firstly, vehicle design engineers experience {{that there is a}} limited amount of knowledge about how to design for optimal driver-vehicle interaction. Secondly, the design cycle for new vehicles could be shorter if more precise design principles and guidelines were available. These design principles and guidelines should indicate to the engineer, which objective vehicle design parameters are relevant for driver acceptance and driver-vehicle performance, and which settings of objective <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> parameters will most likely result in optimal driver-vehicle interaction. Thirdly, electronic systems in vehicles, such as <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> control and drive by wire systems, allow the designer to define and adapt the handling and steering characteristics of a vehicle according to specific abilities and preferences of the driver. This paper describes a new approach for research on <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> requirements for optimal driver-vehicle interaction, and explains the benefits of this approach.

This technical book presents outcomes from the NATO Advanced Study Institute (ASI) ‘Advanced Autonomous Vehicle Design for Severe Environments’, held in Coventry, UK, in July 2014.

The pilots, seated erect in the Ames man-carrying rotation device(MCRD), tracked with k/s+ 1 and k/s(s+ 1) <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> in fixed- and moving-base simulation. Following the learning phase of the experiment, five levels of spurious angular acceleration were superimposed on the motion of the MCRD. Learning of the tracking task was found to be a function of both <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> and mode of simulation. The presence of congruent motion information reduced learningtime in k/s(s+ 1) <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> and resulted in lower tracking error in both <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics.</b> The spurious angular accelerations resulted in an increase in pilot tracking error; however, the relationship between the magnitude of the acceleration and its effect was highly complex.

40|$|The central {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{development}} of a <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Dynamics</b> Controller suitable to multi-actuator vehicles. Starting with a review of Vehicle Dynamcis Control approaches employed in traditional vehicles and an identification of their drawbcks a new centralized <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Dynamics</b> Control structure is motivated. Based on this structure a multi-layer control architecture dividing the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Dynamics</b> Control task into a high level contral task and a low level allocation task is developed. The design of two model based high level controllers is conducted and a comparative study is carried out to determine the best approach. The low level allocation problem, the coordination problem of the multitude of actuators arising with the introduction of multi-actuator vehicles, is outlined. Different allocation approaches are investigated and the most suitable algorithm is derived based on the specific allocation problem. The development of the low level control allocator is presented and the design of necessary state estimators is conducted.
