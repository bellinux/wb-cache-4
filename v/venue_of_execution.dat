50|$|Hanging was {{the method}} {{prescribed}} by law from 1860 to 1921. The <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> <b>executions</b> {{moved from the}} counties to Nevada State Prison in 1903. In response to Mormon preferences, the Nevada State Legislature passed a statute in 1910 that became effective in January 1911, allowing condemned prisoners to choose between execution by shooting or hanging. On May 14, 1913, Andriza Mircovich became the only inmate in Nevada to be executed by shooting. After the warden of Nevada State Prison {{was unable to find}} five men to form a firing squad, a shooting machine was built to carry out Mircovich's execution. A law in 1921 replaced hanging with the gas chamber, which was used from the 1924 <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> Gee Jon to the 1979 <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> Jesse Bishop, both at Nevada State Prison.|$|R

50|$|The {{activities}} of the LSP offices in major cities (Vilnius, Kaunas) and in the provinces differed in principle. The LSP officers in major cities would most often study more complicated cases of political and strategic character, thus not directly participating in mass killings of the Jews. After interrogations, the Jews were handed over either to the Gestapo or to another Lithuanian collaborationist force named Ypatingasis būrys, which then transported them to the mass murder site of Paneriai or to other places <b>of</b> mass <b>execution.</b> The LSP offices in the province took {{an active role in}} the Holocaust and, altogether, were more active. Here, the LSP officials would not only conduct the interrogations, but would also organize mass arrests, transport Jews to the <b>venues</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment or <b>execution,</b> and carry out the executions. As an estimated 80% of Lithuanian Jews were murdered by the end of 1941, the Jewish problem lost its prominence.|$|R
