5|$|The player {{collects}} {{money by}} exploring Rapture {{and from the}} bodies of defeated foes; this money can be used at <b>vending</b> <b>machines</b> to restock on ammunition, health and EVE, and other items; like security cameras, <b>vending</b> <b>machines</b> can also be hacked to reduce the costs of items from it. The player will also receive rewards {{in the form of}} ADAM from completing some tasks, as well as from either saving or killing the Little Sisters after defeating their Big Daddy guardian.

In addition to plasmids, the player will also collect and buy tonics that provide passive bonuses, such as increasing Jack's strength, using EVE more efficiently, or making Jack more resistant to damage. The player can only have a limited number of plasmids and tonics active at any time, and can swap between the various plasmids and tonics at certain stations located throughout Rapture.|$|E
