50|$|Due {{to their}} {{favorable}} size, Aframax tankers can serve most ports in the world.

Aframax class tankers are largely used in the basins of the Black Sea, the North Sea, the Caribbean Sea, the South and East China Seas, and the Mediterranean. Non-OPEC exporting countries may require the use of tankers because the harbors and canals through which these countries export their oil are too small to accommodate the larger Suezmax or the <b>larger</b> still <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>crude</b> <b>carriers</b> and ultra-large <b>crude</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
