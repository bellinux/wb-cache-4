40|$|A {{new method}} is {{introduced}} {{to determine the}} kinetic parameters of electron transfer reactions of biologically important compounds, based on the measurements of the half-peak width (ΔEp/ 2) of the square-wave voltammograms. A simple surface (diffusionless) redox reaction, and a simple electrode reaction occurring from dissolved state are considered as model systems. In the region of quasireversible electron transfer, the half-peak widths of theoretical square-wave voltammograms are linear functions of the logarithm of the dimensionless kinetic parameter ln(K) that characterizes {{the rate of the}} electron transfer reaction. The dimensionless kinetic parameter K is defined as K=ks(fD) − 0. 5 for the redox reaction taking place from dissolved state, whereas for the surface redox reaction K is defined as K=ks/f (ks is the standard rate constant of electron transfer, f is the SW frequency, and D is the diffusion coefficient). A set of linear regression equations for the dependences ΔEp/ 2 vs. ln(K) are derived, which can be used for rapid and precise determination of the charge-transfer kinetic parameters.
