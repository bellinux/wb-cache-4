The {{first part of the}} project deals with the evaluation of the relative performance benefits of using a <b>vaneless</b> stator in place of a vaned stator in a radial turbine. Using a commercial CFD code, a series of numerical models were developed of existing test turbine geometries consisting of a common turbine rotor with a series of different vaned and <b>vaneless</b> stator configurations. The results are compared with corresponding measured turbine performance data for a total of six turbine geometries. Steady state predictions showed good agre. ement with the experimental trends confirming the <b>vaneless</b> stators to yield higher efficiencies across the full operating range. Subsequent analysis of the numerical results compared the detailed internal passage flows for both types of stator, showing the vaned stator to incur generally higher overall levels of total pressure loss due to the combined effects of secondary flows, boundary layer growth and wakes from vane trailing edges. Transient analysis successfully captured the variation in rotor inlet flow properties with each stator design, showing the <b>vaneless</b> stators to deliver more uniform flow conditions around the rotor periphery.

They consist of an impeller, a <b>vaneless</b> diffuser and a volute. The model stage outputs, pressure ratio and efficiency, are compared with experimental data. Then, both models are further investigated by comparing their losses prediction with validated Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) data. The implemented models are taken from literature.

The next impeller losses are studied: incidence, skin friction, choking, jet-wake mixing, blade loading, hub to shroud, tip clearance, shock and distortion losses. The <b>vaneless</b> diffuser outlet is calculated using a one-dimensional numerical solution to the underlying differential equations. For the volute, a set of empirical losses is used.
