5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun <b>varies</b> slightly during the year, so {{the speed with which}} the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also <b>varies.</b> For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E

5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size <b>varies</b> with its {{distance from}} the Earth, {{and it is this}} effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also <b>varies</b> during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E

5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves <b>varies</b> greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the basil <b>varies</b> due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E

This variation has been estimated to be fivefold. It causes approximately one percent of worldwide disability adjusted life years and resulted in 20,000 deaths in 2010.

5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also <b>varies</b> with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail <b>varies</b> as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E
5|$|The common {{phenomenon}} amongst {{birds in}} which {{males and females}} {{of the same species}} exhibit different characteristics beyond the differences in their sexual organs. It can manifest in size or plumage differences. Sexual size dimorphism <b>varies</b> among taxa with males typically being larger, though this is not always the case i.e. in birds of prey, hummingbirds, and some species of flightless birds. Plumage dimorphism, in the form of ornamentation or colouration, also <b>varies,</b> though males are typically the more ornamented or brightly coloured sex. Such differences have been attributed to the unequal reproductive contributions of the sexes.|$|E
