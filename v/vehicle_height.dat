25|$|Today, the Port Aransas Ferry System {{provides}} free {{transportation service}} 24 hours a day, {{seven days a}} week. The service connects Mustang Island and Port Aransas with the mainland of Aransas Pass. The number of boats in service {{at any one time}} depends on demand. There are six boats that carry 20 regular passenger vehicles, and two new larger ferries that carry 28 passenger vehicles each trip. During peak hours, some travelers may need to wait while the ferry makes the trip across the channel. A 24-hour radio message (AM 530) provides information about ferry regulations and can be used for live broadcasts for emergency situations. A maximum <b>vehicle</b> <b>height</b> of 13 feet 6 inches is allowed. A maximum vehicle width of 96 inches is allowed. The maximum weight limit is 80,000 pounds. Peak months include June, July, and August. The ferry system is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation.|$|E
25|$|This IFV variant is {{essentially}} a Fahd 240, fitted with a dual-weapon turret that has a 12.7mm machine gun and a 7.62mm machine gun. The addition of a turret requires a third crewman, the gunner, {{but it does not}} affect the Fahd 240's passenger capacity. The turret is the French BTM-208 turret, produced under license from the French SAMM company. It is air-tight, and provides NBC protection. It incorporates and aiming telescopic periscope, forward–observation, rotating mirror periscope in co-axial alignment with weapons, and five or six bullet-proof glass ports insuring all-round vision and ballistic protection. 200 rounds are provided for the 7.62mm machine gun, and another 100 for the 12.7mm machine gun. Elevation limits are -8 and +45, the turret provides 360 degrees of traversion for the weapons. The vehicle has a rotating seat, and an armored hatch for the turret. The machine guns can be fired by means of a foot pedal, freeing the gunner's hands. A central console groups control switches and warning lights governing weapon selection. The addition of a turret increases the <b>vehicle</b> <b>height</b> to 2.85 meters.|$|E

The main armament, {{which had a}} limited lateral traverse, was mounted directly in a casemate-style hull. This created the lowest possible profile {{in order to reduce}} the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>height,</b> making the StuG more difficult to hit and easier to protect in hull defilade.|$|R

5000|$|Wide whitewall tires {{reached their}} zenith in {{popularity}} by the early-1950s. The 1957 production {{version of the}} Cadillac Eldorado Brougham was fitted with whitewalls that were reduced to a 1" [...] wide stripe floating on the tire sidewall with a black area between this stripe and the wheel rim. The whitewall stripe width began to diminish {{as an attempt to}} reduce the perceived height of the wheel/tire. During the decade, increasingly lower <b>vehicle</b> <b>heights</b> were in vogue. During the 1950s, Fender skirts also covered up white wall tires.|$|R

50|$|Ford Aerospace's entry {{was based}} around the Bofors 40 mm L/70 cannons, twin-mounted {{in the center}} of the turret in a fashion similar to the General Dynamics entry. The {{relatively}} large and boxy turret also mounted separate long-range search and short-range tracking radars on top. The radars were mounted on booms to give them a clear view of the sky, and both had the ability to be folded down to reduce the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>height</b> during travel. The tracking radar was a modified version of the Westinghouse AN/APG-66 from the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Like the GD entry, it also mounted a complete optical sighting and ranging system.|$|R

50|$|The Wolfe Islander III is {{the ferry}} {{currently}} serving between Kingston, Ontario and Wolfe Island (Ontario). It can hold approximately 55 cars, and is end-loading.

As {{it is the}} only public access to Wolfe Island, the vessel operates as a free ferry. Crossing time is approximately 20 minutes. It was launched into service on 5 February 1976 by then Ontario Minister of Transportation, James W. Snow.|$|E
50|$|Guardrail is {{intended}} to deflect.

A guardrail that deflects significantly can causes pocketing which has the potential to snag a vehicle which may cause it to flip or rollroll, or cause the rail to fail allowing a vehicle to penetrate the guardrail.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{developed}} by Donald Healey to be produced in-house by his small Healey car company in Warwick and based on Austin A90 Atlantic mechanicals.

Body styling was by Gerry Coker, the chassis was designed by Barry Bilbie with longitudinal members and cross bracing producing a comparatively stiff structure upon which to mount the body. In order to keep the overall <b>vehicle</b> <b>height</b> low the rear axle was underslung, the chassis frame passing under the rear axle assembly.|$|E

50|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the M4 Sherman was standardized, the US Ordnance Department started work on a successor. The Ordnance Department had already been working on heavily armored infantry tank design for the British, using M4 parts. The new project was started on the 25 May 1942, it was originally designated M4X. Starting with the T20, the Ordnance Department initially developed three series of improved medium tank prototypes, the T20, T22, and T23. The main differences between the T20, T22 and T23 lay {{in the choice of}} transmission. The T20 used a torque converter fluid drive, the T22 a 5-speed mechanical drive similar to the M4 drive, and the T23 used an electric drive. All moved the transmission {{to the rear of the}} vehicle eliminating the need for a driveshaft running the length of the vehicle. The driveshaft used in the M3 & M4 vehicles forced the turret to be mounted higher increasing the <b>vehicle</b> <b>height.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{was no room}} to stow any {{ammunition}} so it had to {{be carried}} by a separate vehicle. When mounted, the sIG 33 had a total 25° of traverse and could elevate from -4° to +75°. It used a Rblf36 sight. The chassis was overloaded and breakdowns were frequent. The <b>vehicle's</b> extreme <b>height</b> and lack of on-board ammunition were severe tactical drawbacks.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} a {{significant}} number of incidents in which a double-decker bus has collided with a low bridge, often a railway bridge.

50|$|Kits can be {{as simple}} as lift blocks (spacers placed between the axles and leaf springs) and coil spring/strut spacers and {{extended}} shocks; to replacement control arms, trailing arms, and custom four-link systems. Suspension lifts also impact other factors, such as drive shaft length, steering geometry and brake lines. Legality is often an issue when installing suspension lifts, as many jurisdictions have varying laws on <b>vehicle</b> ride <b>height</b> and placement of lights and bumpers.|$|R
