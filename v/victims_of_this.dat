5|$|Several {{historical}} figures may {{have died from}} A.phalloides poisoning (or other similar, toxic Amanita species). These were either accidental poisonings or assassination plots.

5|$|Several other {{formations}} {{were also}} created but were mostly eroded away following two major periods of uplift. The Laramide orogeny affected the entire {{western part of}} what would become North America starting about 70million to 50million years ago. This event helped to build the Rocky Mountains {{and in the process}} closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations were <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> uplift. The Colorado Plateaus were uplifted 16million years ago and were segmented into different plateaus, each separated from its neighbors by faults and each having its own uplift rate. The Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Sevier River Formation were removed by erosion following this uplift.|$|E
5|$|The <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{poisoning}} {{were almost}} exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures {{in other parts}} of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors. Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive, which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E

25|$|Pakistani cinema {{entered into}} a decline during the regime of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who began to Islamicise the country. One of the first <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sociopolitical change was Pakistani cinema. Imposition of new {{registration}} laws for film producers requiring filmmakers to be degree holders, where not many were, led to a steep decline in {{the workings of the}} industry. The government forcibly closed most of the cinemas in Lahore. New tax rates were introduced, further decreasing cinema attendances. Other factors such as VCRs and film piracy had a negative affect on the growth of the industry.|$|E
25|$|A Thomas Reuters Foundation survey {{says that}} India {{is the fourth}} most {{dangerous}} {{place in the world}} for women to live in. Women belonging to any class, caste, creed or religion can be <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cruel form of violence and disfigurement, a premeditated crime intended to kill or maim permanently and act as a lesson to put a woman in her place. In India, acid attacks on women who dared to refuse a man's proposal of marriage or asked for a divorce are a form of revenge. Acid is cheap, easily available, and the quickest way to destroy a woman's life. The number of acid attacks have been rising.|$|E
25|$|Polluting {{water may}} be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a {{pollutant}} limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter.

25|$|Sejanus {{created an}} {{atmosphere}} of fear in Rome, controlling a network of informers and spies whose incentive to accuse others of treason was {{a share in the}} accused's property after their conviction and death. Treason trials became commonplace; few members of the Roman aristocracy were safe. The trials played up to Tiberius' growing paranoia, which made him more reliant on Sejanus, as well as allowing Sejanus to eliminate potential rivals. <b>Victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> reign of terror related to the imperial family included Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus, second husband of Tiberius' first wife Vipsania, who had since died, Decimus Haterius Agrippa, grandson of Agrippa and husband of Augustus' great-niece, Quinctilius Varus.|$|E
25|$|Though {{initially}} forming {{part of the}} Kingdom of Israel, {{from the}} biblical account it appears that under Uzziah and Jotham the tribe of Gad joined with the kingdom of Judah instead. Nevertheless, when Tiglath-Pileser III annexed the kingdom of Israel in about 733-731 BC, Gad also fell victim to {{the actions of the}} Assyrians, and the tribe were exiled; in the Talmud, it is Gad, along with the tribe of Reuben, that are portrayed as being the first <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fate. The manner of the exile led to the further history of the tribe being lost, and according to the Book of Jeremiah, their former lands were (re)conquered by the Ammonites.|$|E
25|$|I wish {{to express}} my heartfelt horror at the {{indiscriminate}} terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday.

500|$|The {{month after}} the plan took effect, the Canadian {{government}} announced that the country's sex industry {{would no longer be}} allowed to employ foreign workers because of the risks of exploitation, abuse, and trafficking in that environment. As part of this policy, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada stopped issuing new temporary work permits for foreigners seeking work with escort agencies, massage parlours, and strip clubs. Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, said that he hoped that the NAP-CHT would be strengthened by this new policy, and said that its purpose was to protect foreigners [...] "from what they might not know will happen to them when they get to Canada." [...] That November, Status of Women Canada sought to support the NAP-CHT by soliciting the public for proposals of how to best support community organizations that serve female victims of sex traffickingthe most common <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> form of trafficking.

And Chris Carter the director has stamped all over it and made it so arch and obvious and dull that it kills it stone dead." [...] Shearman and Pearson praised the idea of [...] "a town which feels like an X-Files audience", but derided the episode's comic book setting and wrote that [...] "this play on post-modernism just doesn't make any sense [...] a comic has action, a way of jumping from frame to frame... this is languorous and self-indulgent." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote that the episode [...] "falls flatter than the chemical pancakes used to anesthetize the <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> episode" [...] due to its [...] "collection of situations and observances that bear little relation to each other." [...] Vitaris also criticized the scene wherein various characters are compared to animals, and commented, [...] "the mean spiritedness of [...] is mind-boggling".

500|$|The American white ibis is a tactile, nonvisual forager, {{which limits}} {{its ability to}} choose {{from a wide variety}} of prey. For the most part, the American white ibis forages for food by tactile probing. It wades slowly through shallow water and sticks its long, downcurved bill into the {{substrate}} of the water body with its bill held at around [...] agape at the tip, and sweeps its long bill back and forth across the bottom to pick out suitable food items. Birds may also probe when standing still. Groping with a wide open bill is a technique used by ibis in deeper water when alone, as is head swinging, in which the ibis swings its wide open bill widely in open water. Others copy this type of foraging if they see one ibis doing it. On land, the American white ibis locates prey by sight and pecks, and does not have to insert its bill into the substrate. The American white ibis seeks small prey when other birds are around, as it needs time to break up larger food items into smaller pieces to eat, and other predators such as herons and egrets often take the opportunity to rob the ibis of its catch. Along with the scarlet ibis, the species coexists with another five species of ibis in the Llanos in Venezuela. American white ibis males are aggressive to and take prey items from smaller ibises, but the smaller females are more often the <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> behavior.|$|E
