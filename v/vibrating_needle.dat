Most ophthalmic surgeons choose to carry out the standard cataract extraction because although phacoemulsification offers a more rapid rehabilitation due to smaller incisions, it requires special training and experience and expensive, complicated equipment...|$|E

The theoretical advantage of the <b>vibrating</b> <b>needle</b> is that it reduces the injection pain. We evaluated the effectiveness of Vibraject in combination with an electrical injection device. Injections were given into the alveolar mucosa adjacent to the root apex of the maxillary lateral incisor in 10 volunteers. Vibraject was randomly applied to either the left or right side of the injection. No statistically significant decrease in pain scores was found at needle insertion or anesthetic injection. The clinical efficacy of Vibraject remains controversial...|$|E

Ultrasound shear-wave imaging can provide quantitative information about soft tissue mechanical properties, specifically the complex shear modulus.

This disserta-tion describes several quantitative developments in the field of ultrasound shear-wave imaging.

50|$|When {{mobile phones}} and pagers vibrate, the {{vibrating}} alert {{is produced by}} a small component that {{is built into the}} phone or pager. Many older, non-electronic buzzers and doorbells contain a component that vibrates for the purpose of producing a sound. Tattoo machines and some types of electric engraving tools contain a mechanism that <b>vibrates</b> a <b>needle</b> or cutting tool.|$|R
50|$|For a {{sound to}} be {{recorded}} by the Phonograph, {{it has to go}} through three distinct steps. First, the sound enters a cone-shaped component of the device, called the microphone diaphragm. That sound causes the microphone diaphragm, which is connected to a small metal <b>needle,</b> to <b>vibrate.</b> The <b>needle</b> then <b>vibrates</b> in the same way, causing its sharp tip to etch a distinctive groove into a cylinder, which was made out of tinfoil.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current investigation was to measure the force exerted by a <b>vibrating</b> <b>needle</b> as it penetrated into a tissue surrogate or into a soft tissue. Specifically, the former was a clay construct covered with latex rubber 'skin' and the latter was a chicken ventriculus (gizzard). The penetration force was assessed within the frequency range 0 - 1000 Hz. The influence of mechanical parameters including needle tip geometry, needle diameter, vibration amplitude, speed of insertion and {{the temperature of the}} specimen on the penetration force was also assessed. The results showed that the penetration force can be reduced by 2 to 3 times by vibrating a hypodermic needle at 100 - 1000 Hz, in both tissue surrogate and soft tissue. Also, as expected larger amplitudes of vibration, slower rates of insertion, smaller needles, sharper tips and higher specimen temperature all tended to reduce the needle insertion force. The statistical significance of the results obtained by experimental study of tissue surrogate and soft tissue were assessed using appropriate standard test methods. In most cases, ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's comparison indicated that the variation in penetration force according to frequency and the other test parameters was highly significant (p < 0. 001), which lends credence to the idea that needle induced trauma and pain can be reduced by modulating the relevant kinetic and geometric parameters...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} pour an earthen {{material}} in a liquid state, as a concrete, technologies used by concrete and ceramic industries {{can be transferred}} to the field of earthen construction. Two different methods should be employed simultaneously. The first relates to theories of grain packing that have led to models of Apollonian packing and spaced packing, commonly used for the development of cement concrete (ultra high performance concrete and self-leveling concrete). It concerns the optimization of the granular skeleton of natural materials. The second relates to the dispersion of the colloidal fraction of earthen materials. In natural soils, clays are organized as porous aggregates composed of several tens of particles. These aggregates trap water that is not used to liquefy the mixture. The dispersion of these aggregates, releasing this interstitial water, liquefies the earthen material without adding water. This dispersion is obtained by adding a small proportion (on the order of a few tenths of a percent by mass relative to the dry material) of deflocculating agents such as those commonly used for the development of industrial ceramics. The combined action of these two methods leads to a solid material that does not crack while drying, and can easily be implemented at a viscosity comparable to that of vibrated concrete with the same tools than those employed by the concrete industry (cement mixer, shuttering, <b>vibrating</b> <b>needle).</b> This new technique is particularly suited for the implementation of slabs and other horizontal surfaces, and also for vertical walls...|$|E
40|$|A new cryo-process {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for the fabrication of advanced fuel for nuclear systems. The process uses a new cryo-processing technique whereby small, porous microspheres (< 2000 µm) are formed from sub-micron oxide powder. A simple aqueous particle slurry of oxide powder is pumped through a microsphere generator consisting of a <b>vibrating</b> <b>needle</b> with controlled amplitude and frequency. As the water-based droplets are formed and pass through the microsphere generator they are frozen in a bath of liquid nitrogen and promptly vacuum freeze-dried to remove the water. The resulting porous microspheres consist of half micron sized oxide particles held together by electrostatic forces and mechanical interlocking of the particles. Oxide powder microspheres ranging from 750 µm to 2000 µm are then converted into a nitride form using a high temperature fluidized particle bed. Carbon black {{can be added to}} the oxide powder before microsphere formation to augment the carbothermic reaction during conversion to a nitride. Also, the addition of ethyl alcohol to the aqueous slurry reduces the surface tension energy of the droplets resulting in even smaller droplets forming in the microsphere generator. Initial results from this new process indicate a lower impurity contamination in the final nitrides due to the single feed stream of particles, material handling and conversion are greatly simplified, a minimum of waste and personnel exposure are anticipated, and finally the conversion kinetics may be greatly increased because of the small oxide powder size (sub-micron) forming the porous microsphere. Thus far the fabrication process has been successful in demonstrating all of these improvements with surrogate ZrO 2 powder. Further tests will be conducted in the future using the technique on UO 2 powders...|$|E

The cataract is usually broken into two or four pieces and each piece is emulsified and aspirated out with suction. The nucleus emulsification {{makes it easier to}} aspirate the particles. After removing all hard central lens nucleus with phacoemulsification, the softer outer lens cortex is removed with suction only.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Molecular {{techniques}} are transforming {{our understanding of}} cellular function and disease. However, accurate molecular analysis methods will be limited if the input DNA, RNA, or protein is not derived from pure population of cells or is contaminated by the wrong cells. A novel Ultrasonic Vibration Microdissection (UVM) method was proposed to procure pure population of targeted cells from tissue sections for subsequent analysis. The principle of the Ultrasonic Vibration Cutting is analyzed, and a novel microknife is designed. A multilayer piezoelectric actuator is used to actuate a sharp <b>needle</b> <b>vibrating</b> with high frequency and low amplitude (Approx. 16 – 50 kHz, and 0 - 3 μm) to cut the tissue. Contrast experiment was done to test the feasibility of UVM method.

40|$|Abstract—Ultrasound image {{guidance}} of interventional devices during {{minimally invasive surgery}} provides the clin-ician with improved soft tissue contrast while reducing ion-izing radiation exposure. One problem with ultrasound im-age guidance is poor visualization of the device tip during the clinical procedure. We have described previously guid-ance of several interventional devices using a real-time 3 -D (RT 3 -D) ultrasound system with 3 -D color Doppler com-bined with the ColorMark technology. We then developed an analytical model for a <b>vibrating</b> <b>needle</b> to maximize the tip vibrations and improve the reliability and sensitivity of our technique. In this paper, we use the analytical model and improved radiofrequency (RF) and color Doppler fil-ters to detect two different vibrating devices in water tank experiments {{as well as in}} an in vivo canine experiment. We performed water tank experiments with four different 3 -D transducers: a 5 MHz transesophageal (TEE) probe, a 5 MHz transthoracic (TTE) probe, a 5 MHz intracardiac catheter (ICE) transducer, and a 2. 5 MHz commercial TTE probe. Each transducer was used to scan an aortic graft sus-pended in the water tank. An atrial septal puncture nee-dle and an endomyocardial biopsy forceps, each vibrating at 1. 3 kHz, were inserted into the vascular graft and were tracked using 3 -D color Doppler. Improved RF and wall filters increased the detected color Doppler sensitivity by 14 dB. In three simultaneous planes from the in vivo 3 -D scan, we identified both the septal puncture needle and the biopsy forceps within the right atrium using the 2. 5 MHz probe. A new display filter was used to suppress the un-wanted flash artifact associated with physiological motion. I...|$|E
40|$|Fibre-reinforced polymer-matrix {{composite}} materials have highly attractive physical properties which justify the present {{rapid increase in}} applications within industry. However, {{composite materials}} suffer, like every structural material, from a failure to achieve their design properties. Therefore this research project has investigated the processing of resin used in composite materials. Initially the research programme has been concerned with the cure of epoxy resins (specifically Araldite MY 750 epoxy resin system), the behaviour of the resin as it cures and how the extent of cure can affect the mechanical properties of components. Therefore, investigations {{have been carried out}} into how resin cure can be monitored by the NMR spectra and the relaxation time properties. There were four methods of analysing the data investigated, overall transverse relaxation time (T 2) and free induction decay data (FID) data using the Oxford QP NMR analyser, transverse relaxation time data and spectral changes for the individual chemical environments using the Jeol EX 270 NMR spectrometer, curemeter investigations using the <b>vibrating</b> <b>needle</b> curemeter (VNC) and finally Barcol hardness investigations during the later part of the cure cycle. Both the Jeol NMR spectrometer and the Oxford QP NMR analyser are designed for use primarily with liquid-state experimentation, however for the spectral, relaxation time, and FID investigations results were obtained far longer in the cure than expected. Also for the T 2 investigations a transition period was noticed in the data obtained that corresponded to the gel of the resin as determined by known viscosity data for that resin mix at that cure temperature. The use of NMR as a curemeter technique was verified by repeating the analysis of the resin cure at 40, 60, 80 and 100 °C. This data was then compared to known viscosity data and cure profiles obtained by the VNC curemeter and Barcol hardness readings on similar sized samples.

The second study presents a technique for shear-wave imaging using a <b>vibrating</b> <b>needle</b> source for shear wave excitation. An advantage of such an approach is extended bandwidth of the measurement and a well-defined shear wave propagation that can be advantageous in the complex shear modulus reconstruction. This method was used to explore viscoelastic mechanisms in liver tissue and to explore different modeling approaches. It was found that the shear dynamic viscosity provides more contrast in imaging thermal damage in porcine liver, as compared to the shear elastic modulus. The third study was to develop an FDTD 3 D viscoelastic solver capable of accurate modeling of shear wave propagation in heterogeneous media. Numerical results are experimentally validated. Furthermore, this numerical framework is used to study complex modulus imaging, specifically a direct algebraic Helmholtz inversion. The practical limitations and complex shear modulus reconstruction artifacts were studied, where it was found that distortions can be minimized simply by imaging the magnitude of the complex shear modulus. The final study was a recursive Bayesian solution to complex shear modulus reconstruction. A result of this is a stochastic filtering approach that uses a priori information about spatio-temporal dynamics of wave propagation to provide low variance estimates of the complex shear modulus. The stochastic filtering approach is studied both in simulation and experiments. The benefit of such an approach is low variance online reconstruction of the complex shear modulus per imaging frequency...|$|E
