Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or <b>vented</b> <b>cell,</b> since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|E

40|$|Two embryological fates for {{cells of}} the neural tube are well established. Cells from the dorsal part of the {{developing}} neural tube emigrate and become neural crest cells, which in turn {{contribute to the development}} of the peripheral nervous system and a variety of non-neural structures. Other neural tube cells form the neurons and glial {{cells of the}} central nervous system (CNS). This has led to the neural crest being treated as the sole neural tube-derived emigrating cell population, with the remaining neural tube cells assumed to be restricted to forming the CNS. However, this restriction has not been tested fully. Our investigations of chick, quail and duck embryos utilizing a variety of different labelling techniques (DiI, LacZ, GFP and quail chimera) demonstrate the existence of a second neural tube-derived emigrating cell population. These cells originate from the ventral part of the cranial neural tube, emigrate at the exit/entry site of the cranial nerves, migrate in association with the nerves and populate their target tissues. On the basis of its site of origin and route of migration we have named this cell population the ventrally emigrating neural tube (<b>VENT)</b> <b>cells.</b> <b>VENT</b> <b>cells</b> also differ from neural crest cells in that they emigrate considerably after the emigration of neural crest cells, and lack expression of the neural crest cell antigen HNK- 1. <b>VENT</b> <b>cells</b> are multipotent, differentiating into cell types belonging to all four basic tissues in the body: the nerve, muscle, connective and epithelium. Thus, the neural tube provides at least two cell populations – neural crest and <b>VENT</b> <b>cells</b> – that {{contribute to the development of}} the peripheral nervous system and various non-neural structures. This review describes the origin of the idea of <b>VENT</b> <b>cells,</b> and discusses evidence for their existence and subsequent fates...|$|R

Traditional NiCd {{batteries are}} of the sealed type, which means that charge gas is normally recombined and they release no gas unless severely overcharged or a fault develops. Unlike typical NiCd cells, which are sealed, vented cells have a vent or low pressure release valve that releases any generated oxygen and hydrogen gases when overcharged or discharged rapidly. Since the battery is not a pressure vessel, it is safer, weighs less, and has a simpler and more economical structure. This also means the battery is not normally damaged by excessive rates of overcharge, discharge or even negative charge.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vented</b> <b>cell</b> voltage rises rapidly {{at the end}} {{of charge}} {{allowing}} for very simple charger circuitry to be used. Typically a battery is constant current charged at 1 CA rate until all the cells have reached at least 1.55 V. Another charge cycle follows at 0.1 CA rate, again until all cells have reached 1.55 V. The charge is finished with an equalizing or top-up charge, typically for not less than 4 hours at 0.1 CA rate. The purpose of the over-charge is to expel as much (if not all) of the gases collected on the electrodes, hydrogen on the negative and oxygen on the positive, and some of these gases recombine to form water which in turn will raise the electrolyte level to its highest level after which it is safe to adjust the electrolyte levels. During the over-charge or top-up charge, the cell voltages will go beyond 1.6 V and then slowly start to drop. No cell should rise above 1.71 V (dry cell) or drop below 1.55 V (gas barrier broken).|$|E

40|$|Ni-Cd sealed and <b>vented</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been}} widely used in the last few years. The {{environmental}} hazard related to the heavy metals contained in Ni-Cd batteries is well known. Therefore, a number of scientific studies and commercial processes have been implemented in order to recycle them. Since spent batteries are a heterogeneous and complex material, any kind of recovery process needs some preliminary treatments. The proposed process described in this paper has been tested in laboratory and further developed in a pilot plant. It consists of a combination of mechanical and hydrometallurgical treatment steps, and is able to treat all type of Ni-Cd batteries. In particular, the mechanical treatments have to be done separately on <b>vented</b> and sealed <b>cells,</b> while the hydrometallurgical step is performed on a mixture of the two products obtained from mechanical steps. A fully automated dismantling line would allow the separate recovery of the plastic or metallic casing, terminals, KOH electrolyte, and electrodes to be further processed for Ni and Cd recovery. The electrodes coming from dismantling line and sealed batteries are submitted separately to an original crushing and elutriation treatment to separate metallic and active paste in the first case and metallic, plastic and active paste in the second case. The hydrometallurgical treatment is carried out on active paste bearing product to produce Ni, Cd, and Fe commercial salts through acidic leaching followed by a multi-step solvent extraction operation to obtain pure solutions...|$|R

These 100 AH experimental nickel-zinc cells had as common components the nickel positive electrodes (GFM), flexible inorganic separator (GFM) bags on the negative electrodes, pressed powder zinc oxide electrodes, and cell containers with hardware. The variations introduced were four differing electrolyte absorber (interseparator) systems used to encase the nickel positive electrodes of each cell group. The four groups of 100 AH experimental <b>vented</b> nickel-zinc <b>cells</b> were tested to determine, based on cell performance, the best two interseparator systems. Using the two interseparator systems, two groups of experimental 300 AH cells were fabricated. Each group of three cells differed only in the interseparator material used.

The hydride alloy quality of hydride electrodes can be effectively determined by measuring rate capability. The results of <b>vented</b> <b>cell</b> experiments confirm that the capacity decay of non-coated alloy electrodes in sealed cells is not due to the oxidation of oxygen from the nickel hydroxide positive electrodes.

The solubilities of Zn species in these electrolytes are 20 - 25 % of the Zn solubility in strongly alkaline [- 30 weight percent (w/o) ] electrolytes. The rate of Zn electrode shape change was significantly less than that in cells with KOH, KOH-KF, or KOH-K 2 CO 3 electrolytes. <b>Vented</b> <b>cells</b> constructed with KOH-KF electrolytes showed capacity-loss rates as low as 0. 07 %/cycle, which may be compared to values of 0. 4 - 0. 5 %/cycle in cells with- 30 w/o KOH electrolyte.

40|$|Since their {{discovery}} by Cajal in 1889, the Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICC) {{have generated}} much {{controversy in the}} scientific community. Indeed, the nervous, muscle or fibroblastic nature of the ICC has remained under debate {{for more than a}} century, as has their possible physiological function. Cajal and his colleagues considered them to be neurons, while contemporary histologists like Kölliker and Dogiel categorized these cells as fibroblasts. More recently, the role of ICC in the origin of slow-wave peristaltism has been elucidated, and several studies have shown that they participate in neurotransmission (intercalation theory). The fact that ICC assemble in the circular muscular layer and that they originate from cells which emerge from the ventral neural tube (<b>VENT</b> <b>cells),</b> a source of neurons, glia and ICC precursors other than the neural crest, suggests a neural origin for this particular subset of ICC. The discovery that ICC express the Kit protein, a type III tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the proto-oncogene c-kit, has helped better understand their physiological role and implication in pathological conditions. Gleevec, a novel molecule designed to inhibit the mutant activated version of c-Kit receptors, is the drug of choice to treat the so-called gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), the most common non-epithelial neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract. Here we review Cajal's original contributions with the aid of unique images taken from Cajal's histological slides (preserved at the Cajal Museum, Cajal Institute, CSIC).

Both primary and secondary cells can be packaged as high-rate cells, which can present a threat to crew and equipment {{in the event of}} external or internal short circuits.

A switch has been developed that consists of a thin layer of composite material made from nanoscale particles of nickel and Teflon that conducts electrons at room temperature and switches to an insulator at an elevated temperature, thus interrupting current flow to prevent thermal runaway caused by internal short circuits. The material is placed within the cell, as a thin layer incorporated within the anode and/or the cathode, to control excess currents from metal-to-metal or metal-to-carbon shorts that might result from cell crush or a manufacturing defect. The safety of high-rate cells is thus improved, preventing serious injury to personnel and sensitive equipment located near the battery. The use of recently available nanoscale particles of nickel and Teflon permits an improved, homogeneous material with the potential to be fine-tuned to a unique switch temperature, sufficiently below the onset of a catastrophic chemical reaction. The smaller particles also permit the formation of a thinner control film layer (< 50 m), which can be incorporated into commercial high-rate lithium primary and secondary cells. The innovation permits incorporation in current lithium and lithium-ion cell designs with a minimal impact on cell weight and volume. The composite thermal switch (CTS(TradeMark)) coating can be incorporated in either the anode or cathode or both. The coating can be applied in a variety of different processes that permits incorporation in the cell and electrode manufacturing processes.

40|$|The {{performance}} of cylindrical cells made from negative electrode active materials of two selected AB 2 metal hydride chemistries with different dominating Laves phases (C 14 vs. C 15) were compared.

Annealing of the Alloy C 15 eliminated the ZrNi secondary phase and further improved the high-rate and peak power performance. This treatment on Alloy C 15 showed the best low-temperature performance, but also contributed to a less-desirable high-temperature voltage stand and an inferior cycle stability.

The goal of this work was to evaluate {{the performance of}} the iron phosphate Li-ion battery technology for utility applications requiring frequent charges and discharges, such as voltage support, frequency regulation, and wind farm energy smoothing. Test results have indicated that the LiFeBatt battery technology can function up to a 10 C{sub 1 } discharge rate with minimal energy loss compared to the 1 h discharge rate (1 C). The utility PSOC cycle test at up to the 4 C{sub 1 } pulse rate completed 8, 394 PSOC pulsed cycles with a gradual loss in capacity of 10 to 15 % depending on how the capacity loss is calculated. The majority of the capacity loss occurred during the initial 2, 000 cycles, so it is projected that the LiFeBatt should PSOC cycle well beyond 8, 394 cycles with less than 20 % capacity loss.

The cells are designed to mitigate the release of special nuclear material to the environment {{in the event of a}} detonation of high explosive within the Gravel Gertie. Although there are some subtle differences between the cells of DAF and Pantex, their general design, geometry, and configuration are similar. The cells consist of a round room approximately 10. 4 m in diameter and 5. 2 m high enclosed by 0. 3 -m-thick concrete. Each cell has a wire-rope cantenary roof overlain with gravel. The gravel is approximately 6. 9 m deep at the center of the roof and decreases toward the outer edge of the cell. The cell is connected to a corridor and subsequent rooms through an interlocking blast door. In the event of a accidental explosion involving significant amounts of high explosive, the roof structure is lifted by the force of the explosion, the supporting cables break, the gravel is lifted by the blast (resulting in rapid <b>venting</b> of the <b>cell),</b> and the gravel roof collapses, filling the cell. The lifting and subsequent collapse of the gravel, which acts much like a piston, is very challenging to model...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} large study {{aimed at}} searching for {{patterns}} of diversity in the genus Persephonella along the north to south geochemical gradient of the ELSC, ten novel strains of Alphaproteobacteria were isolated unexpectedly. Using defined media under microaerophilic conditions to enrich for Persephonella from chimney samples collected at the seven vent fields on the ELSC and the dilution to extinction by serial dilution method to purify cultures, a total of ten strains belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria were isolated. Two of these isolates, designate MN- 5 and TC- 2 were chosen for further characterization and are proposed as two new species of a novel genus to be namedThermopetrobacter. Both strains are aerobic, capable of chemoautotrophic growth on hydrogen and grow best at 55 °C, pH 6 and 3. 0 % NaCl. Strain MN- 5 is capable of heterotrophic growth on pyruvate and malate and TC- 2 is only able to grow heterotrophically with pyruvate. The GC content of MN- 5 is 69. 1 and TC- 2 is 67 mol%. GenBank BLAST results from the 16 S rRNA gene reveal the most closely related sequence to MN- 5 is 90 % similar and the most closely related sequence to strain TC- 2 is 89 % similar. Sampling at a shallow marine vent on the coast of Vulcano Island, Italy in 2007 led to the isolation of a novel species of Hydrogenothermus, a genus within the Hydrogenothermaceae family. This isolate, designated NV 1, represents the secondHydrogenothermusisolated from a shallow marine <b>vent.</b> NV 1 <b>cells</b> are rod-shaped, approximately 1. 5 μm long and 0. 7 μm wide, motile by means of a polar flagellum and grow singularly or in short chains. Cells grow chemoautotrophically using hydrogen or thiosulfate as electron donors and oxygen as the sole electron acceptor. Growth was observed between 45 and 75 °C with an optimum of 65 °C (doubling time 140 min), pH 4. 0 - 6. 5 and requires NaCl (0. 5 - 6. 0 % w/v). The G+C content of total DNA is 32 mol%...|$|R
40|$|The {{future of}} mass {{transportation}} is clearly {{moving toward the}} increased efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction of hybrid and electric vehicles. With the introduction of high-power/high-energy storage devices such as lithium ion battery systems serving as {{a key element in}} the system, valid safety and security concerns emerge. This is especially true when the attractive high-specific-energy and power-chemistry lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) is used. This chemistry provides great performance but presents a safety and security risk when used in large quantities, such as for a large passenger bus. If triggered, the cell can completely fuel its own fire, and this triggering event occurs more easily than one may think. To assist engineers and technicians in this transfer from the use of primarily fossil fuels to battery energy storage on passenger buses, the Battery Application Technology Testing and Energy Research Laboratory (BATTERY) of the Thomas D. Larson Pennsylvania Transportation Institute (LTI) in the College of Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University partnered with advanced chemistry battery and material manufacturers to study the safety concerns of an NCA battery chemistry for use in transit buses. The research team ran various experiments on cells and modules, studying rarely considered thermal events or venting events. Special considerations were made to gather supporting information to help better understand what happens, and most importantly how to best mitigate these events and/or manage them when they occur on a passenger bus. The research team found that the greatest safety concern when using such a high-energy chemistry is ensuring passenger safety when a cellâ€™s electrolyte boils and causes the ventilation of high-temperature toxic material. A cell-venting event can be triggered by a variety of scenarios with differing levels of likelihood. Also, though the duration of a venting event is relatively short, on the order of just a few seconds, the temperature of the <b>venting</b> material and <b>cell</b> is extremely high. During a venting event, the high-pressure, burning gases tend to burn holes in nearby packaging materials. Most interestingly, the team discovered that following a venting event the large-format cells tested immediately reached and remained at extremely high external skin temperatures for very long periods, on the order of hours. The majority of this report covers the testing designed to better understand how high-energy cells of this chemistry fail and what materials can be used to manage these failures in a way that increases passenger survivability...|$|R

Allie and Bea chat to each other through an air <b>vent</b> in their <b>cell</b> wall. They discuss their pasts and begin to bond. When she is released she has to convince Kaz that the drugs were not hers. Allie visits Bea's cell and catches her self harming, she shows Bea sympathy and tends to her wounds. Allie gives Bea some ointment to help conceal her self-harming scars and applies it. Bea warns Allie that she is not a lesbian. She tells Bea that she intends to leave Kaz's group and realign herself with Bea. She warns Allie not to, explaining that it will make her a target for other inmates to gain advantage against Bea. Allie kisses Bea, but unbeknown to them, Ferguson has witnessed it. She continues to meet with Bea for romantic liaisons in the kitchen. Ferguson monitors their meeting times and begins a plot to murder Bea. Allie tells Bea that Kaz believes she is to blame for her vigilante group's incarceration. Kaz makes Allie join a protest, while Ferguson drugs and attacks Bea in the kitchen. Will gains evidence that Ferguson reported Kaz to the police. She rushes to save Bea from Ferguson. Allie becomes hysterical as a lifeless Bea is laid on the floor. After Bea is rescued, Allie is questioned by Vera and Will, Allie denies any knowledge of what happened. When Bea believes that Kaz and Allie played her, Allie is heartbroken and begs Kaz to set the story straight which doesn't happen. Allie tries to beat Kaz up but Kaz just forcibly hugs her until she calms down. Heartbroken, Allie relapses on to the drugs and takes cocaine. During the episode Smitten, Allie is flaunting herself in the exercise yard, Kaz takes Allie away when Bea refuses. When Lucy is beating Allie up in the showers, Bea and Maxine come to her aid, Allie confesses her love to Bea. Later in the episode, Bea supports Allie during cold turkey. Allie and Bea start a relationship in the following episode and then proceed to consummate their relationship. After having sex, Allie goes to the showers where Ferguson gives her a hot shot. Bea finds Allie in the showers and raises the alarm. Allie is transferred to hospital and placed on life support. Some time later Allie suddenly wakes up.|$|R
