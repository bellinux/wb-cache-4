40|$|Two {{ancient and}} highly {{divergent}} actin-based cytoskeletal systems have evolved in angiosperms. Plant genomes encode complex actin and actin binding protein (ABP) gene families, {{most of which}} are phylogenetically grouped into gene classes with distinct vegetative or constitutive and reproductive expression patterns. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ectopic expression of high levels of a reproductive class actin, ACT 1, in vegetative tissues causes severe dwarfing of plants with aberrant organization of most plant organs and cell types due to a severely altered actin cytoskeletal architecture. Overexpression of the <b>vegetative</b> <b>class</b> actin ACT 2 to similar levels, however, produces insignificant phenotypic changes. We proposed that the misexpression of the pollen-specific ACT 1 in vegetative cell types affects the dynamics of actin due to its inappropriate interaction with endogenous vegetative ABPs. To examine the functionally distinct interactions among the major classes of actins and ABPs, we ectopically coexpressed reproductive profilin (PRF 4) or actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) isovariants (e. g., ADF 7) with ACT 1. Our results demonstrated that the coexpression of these reproductive, but not vegetative, ABP isovariants suppressed the ectopic ACT 1 expression phenotypes and restored wild-type stature and normal actin cytoskeletal architecture to the double transgenic plants. Thus, the actins and ABPs appear to have evolved class-specific, protein–protein interactions that are essential to the normal regulation of plant growth and development...|$|E
40|$|Profilin {{is a small}} actin-binding {{protein that}} regulates {{cellular}} dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), five profilins were identified. The <b>vegetative</b> <b>class</b> profilins, PRF 1, PRF 2, and PRF 3, are expressed in vegetative organs. The reproductive class profilins, PRF 4 and PRF 5, are mainly expressed in pollen. In this study, we examined {{the role of the}} first intron in the expression of the Arabidopsis profilin gene family using transgenic plants and a transient expression system. In transgenic plants, we examined PRF 2 and PRF 5, which represent vegetative and reproductive profilins. The expression of the PRF 2 promoter fused with the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene was observed in the vascular bundles, but transgenic plants carrying the PRF 2 promoter-GUS with its first intron showed constitutive expression throughout the vegetative tissues. However, the first intron of PRF 5 had little effect on the reporter gene expression pattern. Transgenic plants containing PRF 5 promoter-GUS fusion with or without its first intron showed reproductive tissue-specific expression. To further investigate the different roles of the first two introns on gene expression, the first introns were exchanged between PRF 2 and PRF 5. The first intron of PRF 5 had no apparent effect on the expression pattern of the PRF 2 promoter. But, unlike the intron of PRF 5, the first intron of PRF 2 greatly affected the reproductive tissue-specific expression of the PRF 5 promoter, confirming a different role for these introns. The results of a transient expression assay indicated that the first intron of PRF 1 and PRF 2 enhances gene expression, whereas PRF 4 and PRF 5 do not. These results suggest that the first introns of profilin genes are functionally distinctive and the first introns are required for the strong and constitutive gene expression of PRF 1 and PRF 2 in vegetative tissues...|$|E

Major <b>vegetative</b> <b>classes</b> {{identified by the}} remote sensing technique were cypress swamp, pine, wetland grasses, salt grass, mixed mangrove, black mangrove, Brazilian pepper. Australian pine and melaleuca were not satisfactorily classified from LANDSAT. Aircraft scanners provided better resolution resulting in a classification of finer surface detail. An edge effect, created by the integration of diverse spectral responses within boundary elements of digital data, affected the wetlands classification. Accuracy classification for aircraft was 68 % and for LANDSAT was 74 %...|$|R

40|$|Plants are an {{important}} group of organisms which are capable of auxotrophic growth and therefore have a vital function to maintain life on earth. Although a number of plant species reproduce asexually, most plant species use specialised structures, flowers, for sexual reproduction. Compared with animal systems surprisingly {{little is known about}} the molecular processes governing organogenesis. However during the last five years a number of regulatory genes have been identified, isolated and characterized which are controlling the onset of developmental programmes leading to the determination and development of the various floral organs. The function of these genes was studied using genetic and molecular genetic techniques. Three classes of genes can be discriminated which are determining the developmental switches from <b>vegetative</b> meristem (<b>class</b> I), via floral meristem (class II) into the various organ primordia (class III). The genes involved encode transcription factors which function in a complex network of regulatory proteins. The final fates of the floral organ primordia are determined by the so-called ABCD genes. The activity of those genes can be summarised in the ABCD model which provides a simplified way to describe how the identity of each floral organ is determined...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to ȣ-indotoxins (Cry and Cyt toxins), Bt produces a novel family of insecticidal proteins named vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip) during its <b>vegetative</b> stage. Two <b>classes</b> of Vip toxins were described. The first {{consists of a}} binary system composed of two proteins: Vip 1 and Vip 2, which are 100  kDa and 52  kDa in size, respectively. These proteins are highly toxic to certain coleopteran species (Chakroun et al. 2016). The second class is of a 88.5  kDa protein (Vip 3) and active against {{a wide range of}} lepidopteran insects (Chakroun et al. 2016). These two classes of proteins do not display sequence homology with Cry or Cyt proteins (Chakroun et al. 2016). There are, to date, about 82 identified Vip genes. The Vip toxins do not form crystals.|$|R
40|$|Northeastern forests have {{experienced}} regeneration delays and/or failures due to browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Investigations {{were made in}} north-central West Virginia {{to determine if the}} size of clearcut is correlated with degree of deer browsing, regeneration of shrubs and trees, and percent ground cover by various herbaceous plants. Tree seedlings, woody shrubs, and herbaceous ground cover were recorded in September 1992 and August 1993 on 16, 1 -year-old clearcuts, ranging in size from 0. 8 to 0. 2 ha. Woody regeneration was categorized by species, origin, browsed or not, and <b>vegetative</b> height <b>class</b> on 25 systematically arranged sampling stations within each clearcut. Herbaceous plant cover (ferns, grasses, and sedges) was ocularly estimated as percent horizontal ground cover. All tree and shrub combined and commercial tree species for timber were species significantly taller in the 0. 8 -ha clearcuts than in the smaller cuts. Percent browsed was generally lower for all tree species groups and Rubus spp. in the 0. 8 -ha clearcuts than in the smaller clearcuts. Tree seedling diversity was relatively unaffected and percent fern cover was greatest in the 0. 2 -ha clearcuts. White-tailed deer use was relatively unaffected by clearcut size 1 and 2 years after harvest. If timber and wildlife are the primary objectives of small forest landowners, clearcuts smaller than 0. 8 -ha in size should be avoided...|$|R
40|$|An extreme {{rainfall}} event (the largest on record) in Columbia, SC {{occurred in}} a 24 -hour period on October 4, 2015. A total of 21. 49 " of rainfall occurred in the Gill's Creek watershed during a 3 -day period between October 3 rd and 4 th. This rainfall event resulted in numerous dam failures, riverine flooding, and large erosion events. The McCrady National Guard Training Base, located near Columbia, SC experienced substantial damages to the sand-clay roads throughout. Heavy rains, overland flow and stream flow caused substantial movements (sheet flows over 1 -m in depth) of alluvium. To aid in base management for assessing road stability and accumulation areas airborne LiDAR data was acquired after the event and analyzed in a change detection study with LiDAR data prior to the event. The contributions of this research are in 1) {{the development of a}} change detection modeling approach for LiDAR data that incorporates the spatial variation in change/no-change thresholds and 2) application of the LiDAR-based approach to the sediment movement in an extreme rainfall event. The spatial variable threshold model was based on <b>vegetative</b> cover <b>classes,</b> flightline bias, LiDAR-point density, LiDAR scan angle, and topographic slope. Field-based data (301 observations) for calibrating and validating the model was in the form of high precision/accuracy GNSS RTK data, total station surveyed data, manual boreholes (16) of sediment depth, and field reconnaissance. The overall accuracy of the pre- and post-event LIDAR data were 18 -cm (Accuracyz) ...|$|R
40|$|Plants encode {{at least}} two ancient and {{divergent}} classes of actin, reproductive and <b>vegetative,</b> and each <b>class</b> produces several subclasses of actin isovariants. To gain insight into the functional significance of the actin isovariants, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis lines that expressed a reproductive actin, ACT 1, {{under the control of}} the regulatory sequences of a vegetative actin gene, ACT 2. In the wild-type plants, ACT 1 is predominantly expressed in the mature pollen, growing pollen tubes, and ovules, whereas ACT 2 is constitutively and strongly expressed in all vegetative tissues and organs, but not in pollen. Misexpression of ACT 1 in vegetative tissues causes dwarfing of plants and altered morphology of most organs, and the effects are in direct proportion to protein expression levels. Similar overexpression of ACT 2 has little effect. Immunolocalization of actin in leaf cells from transgenic plants with highest levels of ACT 1 protein revealed massive polymerization, bundling, and reorganization of actin filaments. This phenomenon suggests that misexpression of ACT 1 isovariant in vegetative tissues affects the dynamics of actin and actinassociated proteins, in turn disrupting the organization of actin cytoskeleton and normal development of plants...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been designed}} and tested that permits the quantitative assessment of historic marsh conditions from black and white aerial photography. Utilizing a computerized scanning and writing Rotating Drum Microdensitometer (RDM) system, baseline marsh data has been derived by combining present day field data with computer analysis of present day and historical aerial photography. Quantitative information on the marsh grasses studied (Spartina alternifora - tall and short growth forms, Salt Hay - a mixture of Spartina patens and Distichlis spicata), their distributional patterns, and surface water locations were established. The RDM technique relates subtle optical density differences in a film emulsion to actual field conditions. Algorithms are then used to classify and map the marsh variables being studied. In this investigation, photographs were scanned using picture elements (pixels) as small as 25 µm per side. For 1 : 12, 000 scale photographs, this translates to a ground equivalent area of 0. 96 square feet. The RDM system measures the optical density of each pixel and assigns it one of 256 different density levels. This is approximately {{an order of magnitude}} greater than the human eye 2 ̆ 7 s ability to differentiate subtle shades of gray. Once computer analysis is completed, the RDM system then prints the classification categories on to an emulsion, producing a film image that maps the marsh variables. Classification maps were produced by the RDM system for two geographically separate saline marshes. Each marsh was in excess of 100 acres. Using a Zoom Transfer Scope, the RDM classification maps were transferred and compared to historic wetland maps produced from manual interpretation of color infrared photographs and then extensively field surveyed. The wetland maps were produced by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Except for a few small areas where S. alterniflora was misclassified, <b>vegetative</b> cover <b>classes</b> were correctly classified. The vegetational boundaries and land/water interfaces were located with great accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Land cover map of North Sinai was {{produced}} {{based on the}} FAO-Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) of 2004. The standard FAO classification scheme provides a standardized system of classification {{that can be used}} to analyze spatial and temporal land cover variability in the study area. This approach also has the advantage of facilitating the integration of Sinai land cover mapping products to be included with the regional and global land cover datasets. The total study area is covering a total area of 20, 310. 4  km 2 (203, 104  hectare). The landscape classification was based on SPOT 4 data acquired in 2011 using combined multispectral bands of 20  m spatial resolution. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to manipulate the attributed layers of classification in order to reach the maximum possible accuracy. GIS was also used to include all necessary information. The identified <b>vegetative</b> land cover <b>classes</b> of the study area are irrigated herbaceous crops, irrigated tree crops and rain fed tree crops. The non-vegetated land covers in the study area include bare rock, bare soils (stony, very stony and salt crusts), loose and shifting sands and sand dunes.

The artificial surfaces include linear and non-linear features...|$|R
40|$|Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) {{catalyze}} {{the conversion}} of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides and are essential for de novo DNA synthesis and repair. Streptomyces spp. contain genes coding for two RNRs, either of which is sufficient for <b>vegetative</b> growth. The <b>class</b> Ia RNR is encoded by the nrdAB genes, and the class II RNR is encoded by nrdJ, which is coexpressed with nrdR. We previously showed that the Streptomyces coelicolor nrdR gene encodes a protein, NrdR, which represses transcription of both sets of RNR genes. NrdR {{is a member of}} a highly conserved family of proteins that is confined exclusively to prokaryotes. In this report, we describe a physical and biochemical characterization of the S. coelicolor NrdR protein and show that it is a zinc-ATP/dATP-containing protein that binds to the promoter regions of both Streptomyces RNR operons. The NrdR N terminus contains a zinc ribbon motif that is necessary for binding to the upstream regulatory region of both RNR operons. The latter contains two 16 -bp direct repeat sequences, termed NrdR boxes, which are located proximal to, or overlap with, the promoter regions. These experiments support the view that NrdR controls the transcription of RNR genes by binding to the NrdR box sequences. We also show that the central NrdR ATP cone domain binds ATP and dATP and that mutations that abolish ATP/dATP binding significantly reduce DNA binding, suggesting that the ATP cone domain may allosterically regulate NrdR binding. We conclude that NrdR is a widely conserved regulator of RNR genes, binding to specific sequence elements in the promoter region and thereby modulating transcription...|$|R
