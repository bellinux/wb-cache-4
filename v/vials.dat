Chang attacks Bond and is killed; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces {{that she is a}} CIA agent spying on Drax. Bond has saved one of the <b>vials</b> he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretence of being on leave.|$|E

40|$|Outreach {{sessions}} are immunization services in which health workers immunize {{children in their}} communities, are needed to improve vaccine coverage in rural areas of developing countries. These services face very high open <b>vial</b> wastage, which happens when vaccine doses stored in a <b>vial</b> are not used within a specified time after the <b>vial</b> is opened. Such open <b>vial</b> wastage is directly caused by the choice of <b>vial</b> size used and the session size (number of pariticipants attending an outreach session) for which the outreach {{sessions are}} planned. The open <b>vial</b> wastage decreases with increase in session size. However, controlling the session size is not practical. Hence, this thesis proposes reducing open <b>vial</b> wastage through the choice of <b>vial</b> size. The choice of a single dose <b>vial</b> reduces the likelihood of open <b>vial</b> vaccine wastage; but it increases the vaccine purchase cost per dose {{compared to that of}} larger <b>vial</b> sizes. This study proposes two methodologies, based on stochastic optimization and binary integer programming models. Both methods compute the optimal <b>vial</b> size and the reorder point to be used by a vaccine store that plans for immunization sessions in a developing country, while dealing with the tradeoff between vaccine purchase cost and the open <b>vial</b> wastage, as a function of <b>vial</b> size. The proposed methodologies are used to recommend the optimal <b>vial</b> size to be used in Bangladesh for Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine and Measles vaccine. Additionally this thesis applies the proposed methodologies to study the effect of session size and vaccine <b>vial</b> size on the open <b>vial</b> wastage. Finally this thesis suggests how knowing the optimal <b>vial</b> size can result in financial incentives that could be offered to participants of immunization sessions to increase participation of people in immunization sessions...|$|R

5|$|Rona's {{methods were}} also used {{as part of the}} {{experiments}} conducted by the Office of Human Radiation Experiments {{to determine the effects of}} human exposure to radiation. Early in her career, she had been exposed to the dangers of radium. Rona's requests for protective gas masks were denied, as Stefan Meyer downplayed the hazards of exposure. She purchased protective gear with her own money, not believing there was no danger. When <b>vials</b> of radioactive material exploded and the laboratory became contaminated, Rona was convinced her mask had saved her. Gleditsch had also warned her of the dangers the year Rona was sick and living in Paris, when Joliot-Curie died, emphasizing the risk of radium-related anemia. In her 1978 book about her experiences, Rona wrote about the damage to bones, hands, and lungs of the scientists studying radioactivity. Since they wore no gloves and frequently poured substances between <b>vials</b> without protection, she noted that their thumbs, forefingers, and ring fingers were often damaged. The secrecy surrounding the project makes it difficult to know if any of the scientists not directly working on any project knew specifically what their contributions were being used for.|$|E

30|$|To add a {{particular}} reagent, the <b>vial</b> gripper {{moves to the}} reagent storage position and then lowers itself to a position where it can grasp and lift the <b>vial</b> before moving it to the designated reagent addition location on the specified cassette. To deliver the reagent to the reaction vessel, the gas supplier lowers, the inert gas valve opens, and the <b>vial</b> gripper lowers to place the <b>vial</b> down onto a pair of needles {{in one of the}} two reagent addition positions or in the eluent addition position, pressurizing the <b>vial</b> and transferring its contents. The required time for addition of a reagent is generally determined by repeatedly measuring the time needed for complete transfer of the desired liquid and volume at the desired pressure, taking the maximum time value, and multiplying by a safety factor. The entire contents of the reagent <b>vial</b> are delivered at once. After addition is complete, the <b>vial</b> gripper lifts the empty reagent <b>vial,</b> the gas supplier disengages, and the <b>vial</b> is returned to its original storage position.

Players earn combos by overthrowing enemies; almost hitting an obstacle or going through a ring also increases the player's combo count.

5|$|Dan's {{health is}} {{determined}} by a health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life <b>Vials</b> and Life Fountains that replenish Dan's health and fill any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player dispatches enough enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the true ending is revealed.|$|E

In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable of being at sea for extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and <b>vials</b> to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to that of the {{original}} game in which players control Sir Daniel Fortesque as he travels through Gallowmere to stop the evil Zarok. Dan can utilize a variety of weapons, including close range weapons such as swords and axes to long ranged weapons such as throwing knives and crossbows. If Dan defeats enough enemies to collect the Chalice of Souls hidden throughout each level, he will be able to travel to the Hall of Heroes, where a legendary hero rewards him by giving him a new weapon or other helpful items. Dan possesses a single life bar throughout the game, which can be sustained by collecting Life Bottles throughout the game which can be replenished by energy <b>vials</b> and Life Fountains. The remastered version also includes some exclusive arcade-style minigames which can also be played over online multiplayer.|$|E

5|$|Thiomersal (also spelled thimerosal, {{especially}} in the United States) is an organomercury compound used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Following a mandated review of mercury-containing food and drugs in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove thiomersal from vaccines {{as quickly as possible}} as a precautionary measure, and it was rapidly phased out of most U.S. and European vaccines. It is still used in all multi-dose <b>vials</b> of flu vaccines in the U.S. In the context of perceived increased autism rates and increased number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule, some parents believed the action to remove thiomersal was an indication that the preservative caused autism.|$|E
