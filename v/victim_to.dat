50|$|The {{government}} sustained impressive {{efforts to}} provide care for trafficking victims during the reporting period.

Victims receive medical assistance, including emergency care, through the national health care system. The police identified 1,035 sex trafficking victims and 445 labor trafficking victims in 2007. The government encourages foreign <b>victims</b> <b>to</b> assist in trafficking investigations and prosecutions by providing work and residence permits <b>to</b> <b>victims</b> choosing <b>to</b> assist, giving them the option of either permanent residence status or funding to return to their own countries after the prosecution. There is no indication that victims are inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or penalized for unlawful acts committed {{as a direct result of}} being trafficked. Spain does not employ formal procedures for identifying victims among vulnerable groups, such as women in prostitution.|$|R
