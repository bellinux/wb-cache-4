40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel concept for a low cost <b>variable</b> <b>delivery</b> external gear <b>pump</b> (VD-EGP). The proposed VD-EGP {{is based on}} the realization of a variable timing for the connections of the internal displacement chambers with the inlet and outlet ports. With respect to a standard EGP, an additional element (slider) is used along with asymmetric gears to realize the variable timing principle. Previously performed tests confirmed the validity of the concept, for a design capable of varing the flow in the 65 %- 100 % range. Although the VD-EGP concept is suitable for various flow control system typologies (manual, electro-actuated, hydraulically flow- or pressure- compensated), this paper particularly details the design and the test results for a prototype that includes both a manual flow control system and a pressure compensator. Flow vs pressure and volumetric efficiency curves are discussed along with transient (outlet flow fluctuation) features of the VD-EGP...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to study {{the effect of the}} solid transport capacity in pumping operation: A special type of jet apparatus was investigated which emits a water jet downward counter current to delivery flow, from inside of the suction pipe toward sediment to be excavated. Two sizes of jet pipe were considered; each was tested at three different positions for a centrifugal <b>delivery</b> <b>pump</b> operated in its economic range of operation. This jet pipe discharge was confirmed to increase sand transport capacity of the centrifugal <b>delivery</b> <b>pump</b> as the jet mouth was in the position close to the annular suction mouth. At this position, the sand transport capacity of the centrifugal <b>delivery</b> <b>pump</b> increased as the jet discharge increased. When the jet mouth was positioned above the area close to the suction mouth, the sand transport capacity of the centrifugal <b>delivery</b> <b>pump</b> decreased. As the jet mouth was extended below the area close to the suction mouth, the sand transport capacity of the centrifugal <b>delivery</b> <b>pump</b> was nearly equal in either case of pumping with or without the jet water in operation...|$|R

40|$|Insertion {{heuristics}} {{have proven}} to be popular methods for solving a variety of vehicle routing and schedulingproblems. In this paper, we focus on the impact of incorporating complicating constraints on the efficiency of insertion heuristics. The basic insertion heuristic for the standard vehicle routing problem has a time complexity of On 3. However, straightforward implementations of handling complicating constraints lead to an undesirable time complexity of On 4. We demonstrate that with careful implementation it is possible, in most cases, to maintain the On 3 complexity or, in a few cases, increase the time complexity to On 3 logn. The complicating constraints we consider in this paper are time windows, shift time limits, <b>variable</b> <b>delivery</b> quantities, fixed and <b>variable</b> <b>delivery</b> times, and multiple routes per vehicle. Little attention has been given to some of these complexities (with time windows being the notable exception), which are common in practice and {{have a significant impact on}} the feasibility of a schedule as well as the efficiency of insertion heuristics.

40|$|Communication amongst field devices, {{control unit}} and {{programming}} unit in industrial automation networks {{is essential for}} bulk production, but largely consists of wired networks that can sometimes be bulky and substantially lack mobility as at times there can arise {{a need for a}} field device to be moved either for maintenance purposes or for rearrangement. There was therefore a need for wireless communication and PROFIBUS networks that can provide the minimum movement to field devices or the programing computer. Although wireless communication technology has penetrated the commercial network, it is still inadequately utilised in industrial settings due to electromagnetic induction and other forms of interferences due to industrial machinery. This dissertation introduced wireless communication in a PROFIBUS network where the MPI section was replaced with the wireless link. The PROFIBUS network technology is a hybrid of protocols where the PROFIBUS DP employs RS 485 technology with a transmission rate of 45 kbps and above while the PROFIBUS PA employs Manchester Encoded Bus Powered (MBP) technology at a fixed rate of 31. 25 kbps. In RS 485 technology, data is transmitted as a voltage difference between the two wires while in MBP data is transmitted as transitions in current signal and data and power are transmitted on the same conductors. The PROFIBUS data is also transmitted in the form of telegrams which further puts a strain on any form of intermediate processing and hence the need for high speed processing. In this research task the PROFIBUS PA level transmitter measures the pressure of the fluid in the Blend Chest and sends it to the PLC. The level transmitter was installed and wired to the PROFIBUS DP/PA coupler. The PROFIBUS network, consisting of the PLC, variable speed drives, <b>variable</b> speed <b>pumps,</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>pump</b> and level transmitter, was configured and commissioned for controlling and monitoring from the programing computer. The program for the PLC was written using Siemens Step- 7, compiled and downloaded to the PLC. The control and monitoring was done using the variable table. The wireless communication channel was then simulated using Matlab and Simulink. The wireless devices were then integrated into the PROFIBUS network and the MPI cable linking the programing computer and the PLC was then replaced by the wireless channel and the network was controlled and monitored from the programing computer over the wireless channel. On successful completion of this research task the research plant at MUT was controlled and monitored from the programing computer over the wireless channel and the researchers and demonstrators can now access the PLC and the PROFIBUS network using the wireless communication.
