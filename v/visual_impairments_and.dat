40|$|ABSTRACT Background: The {{number of}} blind years {{resulting}} from blindness in children is alarmingly high. Blindness in children {{can have a}} significant impact on their performance at school as well as their social interaction and future employment as visually impaired children have a long lifetime of blindness ahead of them. The consequences of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> blindness in children are an important public health issues with greater impact in developing countries, where 80 % of the blindness in children occurs. The control of blindness in children is considered a high priority area within the World Health Organization’s VISION 2020 initiative. However many developing countries do not have the accurate information about the magnitude <b>and</b> causes of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> blindness in children, from which the scope and priorities for prevention and treatment can be identified. To date the established pediatric eye clinic which works as a tertiary eye centre does not have baseline data on the magnitude <b>and</b> causes of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> blindness in children. Objective: To determine the magnitude <b>and</b> causes of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> blindness in children attending pediatric eye clinic at Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es salaam Tanzania 2010. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted between June and December 2010. A total of 232 children aged 15 years and below attending pediatric eye clinic at the Muhimbili National Hospital were enrolled. Interview and physical examination was done. The visual acuity of 201 children was assessed by quantitative methods while that of 31 children was assessed by light fixing and following Method. Results: Among the 201 children assessed by quantitative methods 8 % had <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> 4. 0 % were blind. Of the 62 eyes evaluated by light fixating and following method, 8 (12. 9 %) vi eyes were not able to fixate and follow light. There were multiple causes of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> blindness among the affected children. Ocular trauma was the predominant cause of both uniocular <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> blindness causing 15, 29. 4 % and 17, 34. 7 % respectively. Amblyopia due to congenital cataract was the leading cause of bilateral <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> accounting for 31. 3 % while cortical blindness was the main cause of bilateral blindness responsible for 50. 0 % of bilaterally blind children. Abnormalities of the optic nerve emerged as an important cause of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> blindness which affected 7 (43. 8 %) visually impaired children and 2 (25. 0 %) blind children. Conclusion: <b>Visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> blindness in children is high among the children attending the pediatric eye clinic at Muhimbili National Hospital with younger children being more affected with blindness than the older ones. Corneal scaring due to measles and vitamin A deficiency were not seen as the causes of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> blindness in these children. Efforts towards prevention of ocular trauma among children and improvement of antenatal and natal care so as to reduce birth asphyxia and consequently cortical blindness should be emphasized...|$|R

40|$|This Master thesis aims at {{developing}} {{knowledge on}} what music therapy can afford {{for children with}} <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> their sighted caregivers in terms of bonding and early interaction. Children with <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> their sighted caregivers, due to their vulnerable situation and their different perception style, often experience challenges in interaction, communication and bonding. The focus in this article-based Master thesis is on how musical interaction can contribute to bonding and early interaction. The study aims to give answers to the following research question: “What can joint music making afford children with <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> their caregivers in terms of bonding and social interaction?” A qualitative, exploratory study in which children with <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (aged 1 to 4) and their caregivers participated in music therapy sessions over 10 weeks was conducted in a pedagogical institution for people with <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> Data has been collected by participant observation, field notes, video recordings and interviews. Moments of positive interactions in music were selected and analyzed and the selections were triangulated by interviews with caregivers. The data-material indicates that music therapy promotes positive bonding patterns and enhances early interaction by providing experiences of togetherness, joint attention and happiness. Musical interaction seems to facilitate elements of early interaction that can be challenging for children with <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> their sighted caregivers. This thesis discusses the findings in the broader perspective of disability studies and community music therapy and argues that music therapy promotes positive interactions and empowerment of children with <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> their caregivers. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} between <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> mortality {{has been reported}} in many studies. As well as some ocular diseases may be associated with increased mortality directly, <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> is also reportedly associated with many factors linked to higher risk of dying via indirect pathways. These include unintentional injury and increased risk of falls, reduced walking speed, lower body mass index, self-reported difficulty in physical activity and nutrition, cardiovascular diseases and even cancer, dementia, anxiety, depression, and reduced social interaction. <b>Visual</b> <b>impairment</b> also severely affect a person’s self-ranking of his or her health.

Of the 641 electronics, 42 works were selected in full and another 20 were identified as being possibly relevant. Ten studies were included. The studies ranged in sample size from 31 to 21, 995 participants.
