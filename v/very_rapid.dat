5|$|A {{neutron star}} {{is a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a neutron star is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times the mass of the Sun. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can have a <b>very</b> <b>rapid</b> rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E
5|$|Speciation {{has been}} {{observed}} multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature. In sexually reproducing organisms, speciation results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence. There are four primary geographic modes of speciation. The most common in animals is allopatric speciation, which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by habitat fragmentation or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce <b>very</b> <b>rapid</b> changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms. As selection and drift act independently on populations isolated {{from the rest of}} their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed.|$|E
5|$|The kulintang {{is played}} by {{striking}} the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao would always sit on chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they would commonly sit on the floor. Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them in midair, changing {{the arrangement of the}} gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding <b>very</b> <b>rapid</b> fire strokes all in an effort to show off a player's grace and virtuosity.|$|E

5000|$|Cataract Canyon {{historically}} contained several rapids {{which are}} currently submerged beneath Lake Powell {{and have been}} buried in lake sediment. [...] "Gypsum Canyon Rapid" [...] and [...] "Dark Canyon Rapid" [...] in particular were considered <b>very</b> difficult <b>rapids</b> to navigate.|$|R
5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated with thick, steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and <b>very</b> <b>rapid</b> change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work is being done to better understand the fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E
5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, <b>very</b> <b>rapid</b> movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E
5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A {{large portion of the}} star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be <b>very</b> <b>rapid.</b> The pulsar {{at the heart of the}} Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.|$|E

50|$|In {{the dental}} field, three studies (Layzer 1978, Gutmann 1979, Blanco 1983) have {{identified}} Lhermitte's sign among nitrous oxide abusers. This is {{likely due to}} Nitrous Oxide depletion of vitamin B12 leading to a <b>very</b> severe, <b>rapid</b> deficiency {{in the absence of}} supplementation.|$|R

5|$|These {{scattering}} methods generally use monochromatic X-rays, {{which are}} restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A broad spectrum of X-rays (that is, a blend of X-rays with different wavelengths) {{can also be used}} to carry out X-ray diffraction, a technique known as the Laue method. This is the method used in the original discovery of X-ray diffraction. Laue scattering provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the X-ray beam, and is therefore used in structural studies of <b>very</b> <b>rapid</b> events (Time resolved crystallography). However, it is not as well-suited as monochromatic scattering for determining the full atomic structure of a crystal and therefore works better with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements.|$|E

The samples softened as the temperature approached the well-established melting point, at around 170  °C, which was evidenced by a <b>very</b> distinct, <b>rapid</b> drop of the probe rod into sample as it melted.|$|R

25|$|The GRB {{itself is}} <b>very</b> <b>rapid,</b> lasting {{from less than}} a second up to a few minutes at most. Once it disappears, it leaves behind a {{counterpart}} at longer wavelengths (X-ray, UV, optical, infrared, and radio) known as the afterglow that generally remains detectable for days or longer.|$|E

40|$|Many {{systems can}} display a <b>very</b> short, <b>rapid</b> {{changing}} stage (quasi-discontinuous region) inside a relatively {{very long and}} slowly changing process. A quantitative definition for the "quasi-discontinuity" in these systems has been introduced. We have shown by a simplified model that extra-large Feigenbaum constants can be found inside some period-doubling cascades due to the quasi-discontinuity.
