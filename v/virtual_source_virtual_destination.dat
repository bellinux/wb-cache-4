40|$|Este trabalho apresenta um estudo dos mecanismos de policiamento de tráfego ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) mais conhecidos e uma analise das condições de seu gerenciamento utilizando o protocolo SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). Para este fim foram considerados os objetos gerenciados integrantes de MIBs (Management Information Base) propostas por vários grupos de trabalho com o objetivo de averiguar a viabilidade de gerenciar o processo de policiamento de trafego mediante manipulação de tais objetos. Realizando este gerenciamento pode-se acompanhar o estado da rede e utilizar estas informações no planejamento da capacidade da rede, pois muitas vezes, o congestionamento não ocorre apenas por excesso de trafego e sim pelo mau dimensionamento dos componentes da rede de computadores. Foram estudados diversos mecanismos de controle de trafego e congestionamento. Estes mecanismos pertencem basicamente a dois procedimentos sugeridos pelo Fórum ATM: controle dos mecanismos de use/rede e controle de realimentação de fluxo. Os algoritmos estudados no processo de controle dos mecanismos de use/rede foram: balde furado, balde furado virtual, balde furado com memória, janelas saltitantes, janelas deslizantes, contadores de pico, escalonamento virtual, balde furado de estado continuo. No processo de controle de realimentação do fluxo existem dois mecanismos básicos: o credit-based e o rate-based. Como o segundo mecanismo foi melhor aceito internacionalmente, surgiram vários algoritmos que seguiam seus princípios. Entre eles pode-se citar: controle de fluxo baseado na taxa, controle de taxa explicita, VS/VD (<b>Virtual</b> <b>Source</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Destination),</b> PRCA (Proportional Rate Control Algorithm), EPRCA (Enhanced Proporcional Rate Control Algorithm), ERICA (Explicit Rate Indication for Congestion Avoidance) e CAPC (Congestion Avoidance using Proportional Control). Este trabalho estuda os dois mecanismos básicos assim como os algoritmos que seguem a filosofia rate-based. As MIBs inspecionadas para este trabalho foram: MIB da RFC 1695 [AHM 94], MIB dos objetos suplementares [LY 96], MIB da especificação UNI 3. 1 do Fórum ATM[CHA 96], MIB da {{interface}} M 4 do Fórum ATM [ATM 96] MIB da empresa Bay Networks [BAY 96] e MIBs da empresa Cisco [WAN 96] [CHA 96 a], [GRO 96], [GRO 96 a], [RBH 96] e [BAK 96]. Em resultado ao estudo dos mecanismos de controle de trafego e congestionamento e a análise das MIBs selecionadas, foram construídas tabelas que tentam relacionar os parâmetros necessários para controlar os mecanismos de tráfego e congestionamento com os objetos das MIBs selecionadas. A cada parâmetro de controle é verificado se existe um objeto gerenciado ou uma combinação de objetos que podem fornecer o valor do parâmetro. A partir desta análise é verificado se os objetos gerenciados podem monitorar os mecanismos de tráfego e congestionamento. This work {{presents a}} study of the best known ATM traffic policing mechanism and an analysis of management conditions using the SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). For this reason the managed objects were considerated pertaining to MIBs (Management Information Base) proposed by many working groups. This work inquires the possibility of managing the traffic policing process using the objects of this selected MIBs. Realizing this management, it can follow the network state and to utilize these informations in the planning of network capacity, because many times, the congestion only not happen for traffic excess but it occurs by worse dimension of the computer networks components. It was studied many traffic and congestion control mechanisms. These mechanisms belong to two procedures proposed by the ATM Forum: usage/network parameter control and feedback control mechanism. The algorithms studied for the usage/network parameter control were: leaky bucket, virtual leaky bucket, buffered leaky bucket, jumping window, moving window, peak counters and generic cell rate algorithm. The feedback control has two variations: credit-based and rate-based. The second mechanism was better accepted internationally, and many algorithms followed its principles. The algorithms were: rate based flow control, explicit rate control, VS/VD (Virtual Source / Virtual Destination), PRCA (Proportional Rate Control Algorithm), EPRCA (Enhanced Proporcional Rate Control Algorithm), ERICA (Explicit Rate Indication for Congestion Avoidance) e CAPC (Congestion Avoidance using Proportional Control). This work studies the two basic mechanism and the rate-based algorithms. The inspected MIBs for this work were: RFC I 695 's MIB [AHM 94], definitions of supplemental managed objects for ATM management [LY 96], ATM Forum ATM UNI 3. 1 Specification's MIB [CHA 96], ATM Forum M 4 interface's MIB [ATM 96], Bay Networks enterprise's MIB [BAY 96] and Cisco enterprise's MIB [WAN 96] [CHA 96 a], [GRO 96], [GRO 96 a], [RBH 96] e [BAK 96]. As a result of the study of the traffic and congestion control mechanisms and the analysis of selected MIBs, table were built that try to relate the necessary parameters to control traffic and congestion mechanisms with the managed objects. Each control parameter is examined if it has a managed object or a object arrangement that can supply the parameter value. This analysis will verify if managed objects can control traffic and congestion control...|$|E

In this paper, we discuss the limitations of this approach to address {{the large number of}} flows and the large delay-bandwidth product scenarios typical of next generation Internets. As a result, we propose a link layer back-pressure flow control which can be applied to Internet backbones over ATM. More precisely, we use the ABR service and flow control, where routers become <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> (VSs) and <b>virtual</b> <b>destinations</b> (VDs) for the ABR control loop. We introduce a VS/VD "behavior" that implements a rate based backpressure flow control and that addresses max-min fairness. Finally, for the case of edge router connectivity to the ATM network (as opposed to ATM {{all the way to the}} host), we discuss approaches that can be used to convey ATM rate control indications to TCP sources connected to legacy LANs...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is the {{development}} and performance analysis of a flow control algorithm for the ABR (Available Bit Rate) service category in ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networks. ATM is a connection-oriented multiplexing and switching technique, that was developed for broadband-ISDN to transport data and multimedia streams with high bandwidth requirements in one integrated network. In ATM networks data is sent in packets of fixed size, called ATM cells, and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters are guaranteed for each individual connection. Since ATM networks have to support different applications, the ATM Forum (an association of manufacturers, network operators, users, and research institutes) has defined several service categories in its Traffic Management Specification. The ABR (Available Bit Rate) service category allows the use of remaining link bandwidth left unused by other service categories of higher priority. Another advantage of the ABR service is the guarantee of a minimum transmission rate per connection together with a low cell loss rate {{without the need for}} a specification of the ABR traffic characteristics. This makes ABR an attractive service category and an important feature of ATM networks. The ABR service category uses a flow control mechanism to adapt the transmission rate of ABR sources to the varying bandwidth left unused. For this, an end-to-end feedback control loop is established, providing information on the current condition of the network nodes (ATM switches) and the allowed transmission rate to the ABR <b>source.</b> If the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Source</b> / <b>Virtual</b> <b>Destination</b> (VS/VD) technique is used at an ATM switch along the network path from the ABR sender to the receiver, this flow control loop is split into two separate segments. The VS/VD switch is acting as an ABR destination for the upstream loop and as an ABR source for the downstream loop. The VS/VD technique offers the advantages of shortening the control loop and the feedback delay as well as controlling the individual ABR transmission rate inside of subnets, where VS/VD switches are located at the boundaries. This thesis meets the challenge of developing a novel VS/VD algorithm with the help of linear control theory. Existing works either do not address the special structure and tasks of VS/VD switches in their analytical analysis or use only heuristics and trial and error approaches for the VS/VD switch algorithm design. With the help of mathematical techniques it was possible to target important performance objectives, like stability and robustness, already during the design process of the novel VS/VD switch algorithm. A fair allocation of the ABR capacity to the ABR connections as well as an effective control of the VS/VD switch queue lengths were targeted as major performance objectives during the design of the algorithm. Beside the analytical performance evaluation an extensive analysis using simulations was performed. With the help of discrete event simulations various performance metrics for different network topologies, source configurations, and load conditions were investigated. From the analytical and simulation results it could be concluded that the newly developed VS/VD flow control algorithm does fully meet the defined performance requirements. It can be concluded that in this thesis a novel, simple ABR flow control algorithm based on linear control theory and tailored for VS/VD switches has been developed. The algorithm offers a fair, stable, and robust control of ABR sources including stable queue levels at the VS/VD switch and hence leading to a high throughput for ABR connections and an efficient utilization of the complete available bandwidth...|$|R

Multicasting is the ability to transmit information from a single source node to multiple destination nodes and is becoming an important requirement in high-speed networks. As WDM technology matures and multicast applications become increasingly popular, supporting multicast routing at the WDM layer becomes an important and yet a challenging topic. This paper concerns with the problem of optical multicast routing in WDM networks. A few nodes in the network may have wavelength conversion and/or splitting capabilities. In this paper, a new multicast tree construction algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is based on a concept called <b>virtual</b> <b>source.</b> A <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> is a node having both the splitting and wavelength conversion capabilities. By exploiting the presence of <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> nodes, the proposed algo rithm achieves improved performance. To further improve the performance, the algorithm assigns priorities to nodes based on their capabilities.

Considering that PCA is the best decorrelation transform theoretically and Independent channel coding is widely used for 22.2 multichannel compression, the experiment compared the proposed 3 D-M/S method with PCA and Independent channel coding in bitrate, complexity and objective quality. Three MPEG test sequences (es 01 voice signal, sc 03 symphony music signal, si 02 castanets transient signal, mono 48 -kHz sampling) were used as the moving <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> following the VBAP rule, four sequences (si 03, si 01, sc 01, es 02) were used as the discrete fixed-position <b>virtual</b> <b>sources.</b> The <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> and respective azimuth and altitude panning angle are generated on a per-frame basis. Here, only point <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> were {{used to test the}} best performance of three methods, as subband signals can be regarded as point sources in subband coding when bandwidths are small enough. Signals with decorrelated elements are beyond the scope of VBAP model and will decrease the coding performance, for its difference signals retains high energy which depends on the correlation and the energy of the decorrelated elements. Uncorrelated signals with independent audio content is tested in the end.|$|R

The author derives a fundamental formulation based on standard integral equations and the single-layer potential approach is identified as a useful tool in order to derive a general solution. He also proposes extensions to the single-layer potential approach which allow for a derivation of solutions for non-enclosing distributions of secondary sources such as circular, planar, and linear ones. Based on above described formulation it is shown that the two established analytic approaches of Wave Field Synthesis and Near-field Compensated Higher Order Ambisonics constitute specific solutions to the general problem which are covered by the single-layer potential solution and its extensions.

40|$|Traditionally, the Marchenko {{equation}} forms a {{basis for}} 1 -D inverse scattering problems. A 3 -D extension of the Marchenko equation enables the retrieval of the Green’s response to a <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> in the subsurface from reflection measurements at the Earth’s surface. This constitutes an important step beyond seismic interferometry. Whereas seismic interferometry requires a receiver at {{the position of the}} <b>virtual</b> <b>source,</b> for the Marchenko scheme it suffices to have sources and receivers at the surface only. The underlying assumptions are that the medium is lossless and that an estimate of the direct arrivals of the Green’s function is available. The Green’s function retrieved with the 3 -D Marchenko scheme contains accurate internal multiples of the inhomogeneous subsurface. Using source-receiver reciprocity, the retrieved Green’s function can be inter-preted as the response to sources at the surface, observed by a virtual receiver in the subsurface. By decomposing the 3 -D Marchenko equation, the response at the virtual receiver can be decomposed into a downgoing and an upgoing field. By deconvolving the retrieved upgoing field with the downgoing field, a reflection response is obtained, with <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> and <b>virtual</b> receivers in the subsurface. This redatumed reflection response is free of spurious events related to internal multiples in the overburden. The redatumed reflection response forms the basis for obtaining an image of a target zone. An important feature is that spurious reflections in the target zone are suppressed, without the need to resolve first the reflection properties of the overburden...|$|R

40|$|The <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> {{method is}} {{a useful tool for}} redatuming a seismic survey below {{complicated}} overburden by creating <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> at downhole receiver locations, hence generating data independent of the overburden and the time-lapse changes therein. In this article we first apply this technique to crosswell geometries, whereby a virtual crosswell survey is simulated by shooting a line of surface shots passing through two boreholes instrumented with downhole sensors. Using this acquisition geometry, receivers in one of the two wells are turned into <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> by correlating the wavefield recorded by those receivers with the recording at receivers in the other well, and summing the correlated data over the surface shots. An important feature of virtual crosswell surveys that is not easily achievable in real crosswell surveys is the possibility to customize the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> radiation type (P, S) and pat-tern. Unlike real crosswell surveys where the radiation pattern of the downhole source is fixed, we can control the radiation pattern of the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> by appropriate selection of the surface shots that illuminate the <b>virtual</b> <b>source.</b> In the fol-lowing sections, we compare and contrast real versus virtual crosswell data for a field trial in the US onshore. Next we apply the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> method to downhole recording in a horizontal well to maximize the lateral extent of the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> image for reservoir monitoring. To create <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> that are completely independent of the over-burden, one needs to cross-correlate the direct arrival gated in the downgoing waves at the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> with the upgoing waves at other receivers (Mehta, et al., 2007). For vertical or deviated wells, up-down wavefield separation is possible us-ing f-k filtering. For horizontal wells, such a wavefield sepa-ration scheme is not possible and we resort to dual-sensor summation familiar from ocean-bottom seismic.

That is, both <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> {{are obtained}} {{on the basis}} of the new viewpoint that the position of a <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> can also be obtained regardless of the focus position of any physical aperture. VS 1 is a <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> that is a point acoustic source model set behind physical array elements and enables an increase in the transmitted ultrasound intensity using plural transmission ultrasound elements, and increases the size of the region of interest, that is, the same <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> as that reported solo by other groups previously. As is well known, VS 1 increases the echo signal-to-noise ratio; this yields a tissue displacement/strain measurement as well as B-mode imaging, and enables associated applications, eg, shear modulus reconstruction. Alternatively, VS 2 uses an arbitrary position ahead of the physical array elements as a <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> position with a synthetic aperture method. With VS 2, random scattering media (material) such as point acoustic sources can be used as <b>virtual</b> <b>sources.</b> Preliminary experimental results are presented for a lateral modulation method.

40|$|Studying and {{understanding}} acoustic scattering pattern from underwater targets {{has been of}} interest to various communities such as the archeologists and the navy for several reasons and applications. The present state-of-the-art technique in this area involves such methods as analytical approach and FEM/BEM numerical technique. This thesis aims to study and demonstrate the power of using the hybrid virtual source/FE approach where the physical presence of a target is replaced by <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> placed {{in the vicinity of}} the target and in a manner where the pressure/displacement relationship on the target surface is satisfied by the <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> when the target is being insonified. Accurate results for the far-field radiation of the target can be obtained by superposition of the point source Green's function of each <b>virtual</b> <b>source.</b> The hybrid <b>virtual</b> source/FE approach shows potential to be a computationally efficient method for computing acoustic scattering. The derivation of the dynamic flexibility matrix for an elastic conical shell with endcaps will be illustrated in this thesis. It will be shown that the dynamic flexibility matrix corresponds to the acoustic admittance matrix in the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> approach where the scattering functions are computed in the MIT's program OASES/SCATT. (cont.) Moreover, the benchmarking and validation of the approach will be conducted with the hybrid analytical/ <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> approach. Firstly, the approach predicts natural frequencies close to the theoretical analysis for higher order modes with more than 2 circumferential transverse vibration lobes. Secondly, it produces displacement profile that conforms to analytical results. The scattering functions are also in agreement those computed by the hybrid analytical/ <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> approach, with discrepancies observed at lower frequencies. In exact terms, discrepancies start to appear for frequency in the range of 1000 to 2000 Hz for a 0. 01 m thick, 2 m long, 0. 3 m radius steel cylinder without endcaps. The scattering functions will be compared with the SCATT/OASES <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> approach for pressure release and rigid cylinders and cones. For the hybrid FE/virtual source approach, the structural sound speed and density approach zero and infinity for pressure-release and rigid target respectively. On the other hand, in the SCATT/OASES <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> approach, the pressure and displacement are required to vanish on the target surface respectively. It will be shown that the two approaches agree with each other. (cont.) Moreover, scattering functions over steel cones and cylinders for various frequencies have also been derived in this research. The results will be interpreted physically and theoretically in this thesis. The importance of including structural damping in the finite element formulation of the target so as to reflect the effect of resonance on scattering will be illustrated. Other issues, such as effect of target orientations on scattering, will also be investigated in this thesis.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of reduced order head related impulse response (HRIR) models to improve the computational efficiency in acoustic virtual displays. State space models of varying order were generated from zero-elevation HRIRs using a singular value decomposition technique. A source identification experiment was conducted under anechoic conditions in which three subjects were required to localize sounds in the front horizontal plane. The sounds were either (1) real sources (emitted by individual loudspeakers in a semi-circular array), (2) <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> generated from the original HRIRs, or (3) <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> generated using reduced order state space models. All <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> were created by simultaneous activation of two loudspeakers at ± 30 ° using a <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> imaging technique based on either the measured or modeled HRIRs. The errors in the perceived direction of the <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> generated from the reduced order models were compared to errors in localization using the original HRIRs.

40|$|In the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> (VS) method we crosscorrelate seismic {{recordings}} at two receivers {{to create}} a new data set as if one of these receivers were a <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> and the other a receiver. We focus on the amplitudes and kinematics of VS data, generated by an array of active sources at the surface and recorded by an array of receivers in a borehole. The quality of the VS data depends on the radiation pattern of the <b>virtual</b> <b>source,</b> which in turn is controlled by the spatial aperture of the surface source distribution. Theory suggests that when the receivers are surrounded by multi-component sources completely filling a closed surface, then the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> has an isotropic radiation pattern and VS data possess true amplitudes. In practical applications, limited sourceaperture and deployment of a single source type create an anisotropic radiation pattern of the <b>virtual</b> <b>source,</b> leading to distorted amplitudes. This pattern can be estimated by autocorrelating the spatial Fourier transform of the downgoing wavefield in the special case of a laterally invariant medium. The VS data can be improved by deconvolving the VS data with the estimated amplitude radiation pattern in the frequency-wavenumber domain. This operation alters the amplitude spectrum but not the phase of the data. We can also steer the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> by assigning it a new desired amplitude radiation pattern, given sufficient illumination exists in the desired directions. Alternatively, time-gating the downgoing wavefield before crosscorrelation, already common practice in implementing the VS method, can improve the radiation characteristics of a <b>virtual</b> <b>source.</b> GeotechnologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>source</b> gathers were {{generated}} using {{the principles of}} seismic interferometry from 135 hours of ambient noise recorded during a controlled-source survey across the Salton Sea Geothermal Field in southern California. The non-uniform nature of the noise sources violated a primary assumption of the method and generated artifacts in the data. The artifacts generated by the high-energy impulsive sources (e. g. earthquakes, shots) were removable using traditional methods of amplitude normalization prior to cross-correlation. The continuous source artifacts generated by the geothermal wells and highways required an unconventional approach of utilizing only normalized impulsive sources to successfully reduce the artifacts. <b>Virtual</b> <b>source</b> gathers were produced successfully that contained strong surface waves at 0. 4 - 2. 5 Hz, {{an order of magnitude}} below the corner frequency of the geophones, and modest body waves at 22 - 30 Hz, which are generally more difficult to obtain due to the need for many large, well-distributed subsurface <b>sources.</b> The <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> gathers compare well to nearby explosive shots and are more densely spaced, but have a much lower signal-to-noise ratio. Analysis of the surface waves was complicated by strong higher-order modes.

40|$|We {{present a}} new redatuming {{workflow}} developed {{for improving the}} repeatability of seismic data and designed specifically to account {{for changes in the}} source signatures or variations in downgoing fields in general. The new approach is based on the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> method with the same potential for reducing nonrepeatability, associated with acquisition geometry changes and variations in the near surface. To correct for changes in the source wavelet between surveys, we suggest deconvolving the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> gather of the monitor survey with the point-spread function (PSF) of the same survey, and immediately convolving with the PSF of the base or reference survey. The PSF governs the radiation pattern of the <b>virtual</b> <b>source.</b> Trying to completely deconvolve the effects of individual PSFs on each <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> response may degrade repeatability due to possible amplification of noise. Instead, we try to equalize radiation patterns of the <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> across all repeat surveys by reassigning a new reference PSF to all surveys. We apply the deconvolution-convolution method to a field 4 D dataset with buried receivers and demonstrate significant improvement in repeatability.

An estimate of the direct arriving wavefront is required {{in addition to the}} reflection data. However, no information about the medium is needed. We illustrate the method with numerical examples in a lossless acoustic medium with laterally-varying velocity and density and take into consid-eration finite acquisition aperture and a spatially-extended <b>virtual</b> <b>source.</b> We examine the reconstructed wavefield when a macro model is used to estimate the direct arrivals.

40|$|Spatial audio aims to {{recreate}} or synthesize spatial attributes when reproducing audio over loudspeakers or headphones. Such spatial attributes include, for example, locations of perceived sound sources and an auditory sense of space. This thesis focuses on {{new methods of}} spatial audio for loudspeaker listening and on measuring the quality of spatial audio by subjective and objective tests. In this thesis the vector base amplitude panning (VBAP) method, which is an amplitude panning method to position <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> in arbitrary 2 -D or 3 -D loudspeaker setups, is introduced. In amplitude panning the same sound signal is applied {{to a number of}} loudspeakers with appropriate non-zero amplitudes. With 2 -D setups VBAP is a reformulation of the existing pair-wise panning method. However, differing from earlier solutions it can be generalized for 3 -D loudspeaker setups as a triplet-wise panning method. A sound signal is then applied to one, two, or three loudspeakers simultaneously. VBAP has certain advantages compared to earlier <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> positioning methods in arbitrary layouts. Previous methods either used all loudspeakers to produce <b>virtual</b> <b>sources,</b> which results in some artefacts, or they used loudspeaker triplets with a non-generalizable 2 -D user interface. The <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> generated with VBAP are investigated. The human directional hearing is simulated with a binaural auditory model adapted from the literature. The interaural time difference (ITD) cue and the interaural level difference (ILD) cue which are the main localization cues are simulated for amplitude-panned <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> and for real sources. Psychoacoustic listening tests are conducted to study the subjective quality of <b>virtual</b> <b>sources.</b> Statistically significant phenomena found in listening test data are explained by auditory model simulation results. To obtain a generic view of directional quality in arbitrary loudspeaker setups, directional cues are simulated for <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> with loudspeaker pairs and triplets in various setups. The directional qualities of <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> generated with VBAP can be stated as follows. Directional coordinates used for this purpose are the angle between a position vector and the median plane (θcc), and the angle between a projection of a position vector to the median plane and frontal direction (Φcc). The perceived θcc direction of a <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> coincides well with the VBAP panning direction when a loudspeaker set is near the median plane. When the loudspeaker set is moved towards a side of a listener, the perceived θcc direction is biased towards the median plane. The perceived Φcc direction of an amplitude-panned <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> is individual and cannot be predicted with any panning law. reviewe...|$|R
