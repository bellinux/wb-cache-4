The type collection was made in Armidale, New South Wales in July 2008. Molecular analysis shows that the species groups in a clade with species in the section Purpurascentes of the genus Cortinarius, along with the sequestrate C. caesibulga and C. cinereoroseolus, and the agarics C. porphyropus and C. purpurascens. The specific epithet argyrionus is derived from the Ancient Greek word meaning [...] "silvery violet", and refers to the sheen and colour of the fruit bodies.|$|E

5000|$|The rubber-faced Ernest, {{almost always}} {{dressed in a}} denim vest and {{baseball}} cap, appeared {{at the door of}} an unseen and unheard but seemingly unwilling neighbor named <b>Vern.</b> The spots were structured in a way to allow the viewer to be [...] "Vern", as Varney looked directly in the camera whenever <b>Vern</b> was addressed.

[...] While <b>Vern</b> is never shown to ever say anything, it is implied that he finds Ernest to be an unwelcome pest due to him trying to slam his door in Ernest's face on a few occasions. <b>Vern</b> also shakes his head [...] "No" [...] whenever Ernest invites him to do something. Ernest, despite having good intentions, is utterly oblivious to Vern's apparent distress regarding him and always regards <b>Vern</b> as his closest buddy and confidant.|$|R
