5|$|<b>Vanilla</b> tahitensis (Tahitian <b>vanilla),</b> {{which is}} a cross-strain of <b>Vanilla</b> planifola (Mexican <b>vanilla</b> and Bourbon <b>vanilla)</b> and <b>Vanilla</b> odorata (Inflated <b>Vanilla),</b> is {{produced}} in French Polynesia, especially in Tahiti, and also Hawaii. Its pods have fewer seeds than <b>Vanilla</b> planifolia, {{which is not a}} direct competitor. Mexican <b>vanilla</b> is used almost exclusively as the base of <b>vanilla</b> extract, due to higher vanillin levels. Tahitian <b>vanilla</b> is used primarily in perfume because of its coumarin-like scent. Other Tahitian <b>vanilla</b> products include <b>vanilla</b> green tea, <b>vanilla</b> oil, <b>vanilla</b> powder, <b>vanilla</b> rum, and vinegar-based <b>vanilla.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Vanilla</b> Ice took an {{interest}} in the musical style found on Hard to Swallow while performing {{as a member of a}} Miami grunge band, and was able to develop this sound through a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, with whom he shared {{an interest}} in motocross racing. Robinson produced the album after being advised against working with <b>Vanilla</b> Ice. The album's darker lyrical subject matter developed from conversations, in which Robinson encouraged him to write about his past. Subjects included <b>Vanilla</b> Ice's abusive childhood, drug addiction and struggles with fame. While the album revived <b>Vanilla</b> Ice's career, it received largely negative reviews and did not chart.|$|E

5|$|<b>Vanilla,</b> {{originally}} a crop endemic to South America, {{was introduced in}} French Polynesia in 1848 by Admiral Ferdinand-Alphonse Hamelin, a French commander in the Pacific. The admiral delivered several dozen specimens of the plant to the Tahitian Governor's garden in Papeete. A new variety of <b>vanilla</b> was subsequently developed {{in the area and}} came to be popularly known as Tahitian <b>vanilla.</b> This has special characteristics compared to the varieties such as <b>Vanilla</b> planifolia grown {{in other parts of the}} world, particularly in respect to taste and scent. It has resulted in greater demand for the Tahitian variety.|$|E
5|$|Production, {{initially}} for export, {{reached a}} high of 200 tons in 1939. But it decreased to about 125 tons (metric) due to the onset of World War II in 1945. Exports gradually increased after the war to 300 tons by 1949 but then started to decline with about four tons of export in 1985 as it became ineffective to produce <b>vanilla</b> due to as international competition, the costs of transportation of processed <b>vanilla,</b> exchange rates, state protectionism, plant pathology, varying global economics, and availability of cheaper varieties all affected the economics of <b>vanilla</b> production in the area.|$|E

Similarly, coffee had been grown on family plots of four to five trees until the early 19thcentury, when more intensive cultivation for export began. <b>Vanilla,</b> later to become one of Madagascar's premiere export crops, was introduced by French entrepreneurs in 1840 and planted in eastern coastal rainforests. The technique of hand pollination, critical to higher <b>vanilla</b> yields, was introduced 30years later. Nonetheless, <b>vanilla</b> remained a marginal crop {{until the end of the}} monarchy.|$|E
