25|$|After the {{departure}} of Arvydas Sabonis {{at the conclusion of}} the 2003–04 season, Žalgiris faced a series of ups and downs. In the 2004–05 season, thanks to <b>very</b> <b>solid</b> play from mainstays Tanoka Beard, Mindaugas Timinskas, Dainius Šalenga and new addition Robert Pack, Žalgiris had a <b>very</b> <b>solid</b> season. In the EuroLeague, Žalgiris finished the regular season with an 8–6 record, including wins on the road against heavy favorites Maccabi Tel Aviv and FC Barcelona. However, in the Top16 phase, Žalgiris entered a long slump and finished with an 0–6 record. Žalgiris recovered on the domestic front, easily defeating ULEB Cup winner Lietuvos Rytas in the LKL finals with a 4–0 sweep, and also won the inaugural Baltic Basketball League championship, beating Lietuvos Rytas in the finals 64–60.|$|E

25|$|Gloucestershire {{stayed in}} Northampton for the Twenty20 game, and lost again. Two home wins followed, though, over Glamorgan and Worcestershire, {{and they looked}} <b>very</b> <b>solid</b> after their initial setback - after two no-results and yet another win over Worcestershire had ensured that they had grabbed eight points from six games. However, their bowling let them down {{in the last two}} games, first {{allowing}} whipping boys Glamorgan to take a thumping ten-wicket victory at Cardiff, and then handing Somerset the highest team score in Twenty20 Cup history, with 228 for 5 - which sent Somerset through and Gloucestershire out.|$|E
25|$|Fougères is {{situated}} in the Cadomian chain. The oldest buildings use readily available stone: la cornéenne.

Most of the buildings of the town are built with these local materials. It took {{the arrival of the}} railway to import other stones (late 19th century). In military strategy, note that the castle is not on high, but on a deposit of la cornéenne, which prevents the risk of attacks by mining and from underground.|$|E

Carter arrived in time for the final week of the regular season schedule and went on to lead the AHL in playoff scoring with 23 points (12 goals and 11 assists) in 21 games, while Richards joined one game into the second round and went on to collect 15 points (seven goals and eight assists) in 14 games.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the more}} serious issues facing today’s global {{community}} is preservation of the environment. A major part of this preservation effort is limiting the amount of contaminates introduced {{into the air and}} water of the planet. The paint industry shares these concerns and {{over the past two decades}} has made much progress in bringing more environmentally friendly products to the marketplace (Chatta 1980; Padget 1993; Nabauurs et al. 1996; Bhabe and Athawale 1997). Of prime concern has been the removal or reduction of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in paint and coatings formulations, as these substances can contribute to air pollution. Approaches to limiting VOC content have included the introduction of <b>very</b> high <b>solids</b> (> 75 %) liquid coatings, powder or “solventless ” coatings, and waterborne (latex) paints and coatings. In this report we will concentrate on <b>very</b> high <b>solids</b> types of coatings. <b>Very</b> high <b>solids</b> coatings can be achieved by using low molecular weight polymers which are soluble in high concentration in the chosen solvent. The resulting solution must have a viscosity in the appropriate range for the desired end use of the coating. Another approach to <b>very</b> high <b>solids</b> coating formulations is the use of reactive materials as solvents. Such materials become part of the polymeric film left behind when the coating dries or cures and does not contribute to VOC. Utilization of this approach yields formulations that are nearly solvent free. In order to be used as a reactive solvent a molecule must have at least one and preferably two or mor...|$|R

25|$|Ceramic {{is on the}} {{one hand}} a <b>very</b> <b>solid</b> material; on the other hand, it breaks even at {{relatively}} low mechanical stress. MLCC chips as surface-mounted components are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly on the substrate. They are stuck between soldered joints on the printed circuit board (PCB), and are often exposed to mechanical stresses, for example, if vibration or a bump impacts the circuit board. They are also more sensitive to thermal stresses than leaded components. Excess solder fillet height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. Of all influencing factors, causing a mechanical shock stress to the PCB proved to be the most critical one. The reason is that forces induced by those kinds of stresses are more or less transmitted undampened to the components via the PCB and solder joints.|$|E
25|$|Due to the NBA lockout, {{the team}} signed Sonny Weems and primary Denver Nuggets point guard Ty Lawson. The team also {{resigned}} long time fan-favorite Marko Popovič. The team also signed longtime Lietuvos Rytas player and former Lithuanian National team captain Robertas Javtokas as center. However, the season started very poorly for Žalgiris. Hoping {{to end the}} slump, Romanov fired coach Ilias Zouros and replaced him with former Lietuvos Rytas head coach Aleksandar Trifunović. Despite initial improvement, with the team finishing the EuroLeague regular season with a 4–6 record {{and a trip to}} the Top 16, the slump continued in the Top 16, with the team ending the disastrous Euroleague season with 0–6 record. After Ty Lawson left the team, Mantas Kalnietis played his perhaps best season, becoming a true leader for Žalgiris. The team slowly recovered, winning the LKF Cup. After being eliminated in the VTB playoffs, Žalgiris made the BBL Final Four, winning against Lietuvos Rytas in the finals despite losing leader Sonny Weems (who was released due to injury) and DeJuan Collins (who was released due to failing a drug test). With <b>very</b> <b>solid</b> play from Marko Popovič and Tomas Delininkaitis, Žalgiris retained the LKL title, defeating Lietuvos Rytas in the finals 4:1 and ending a difficult season on a high note.|$|E

They won 6 of 7 games, including the noteworthy away games victories versus the BC Nizhny Novgorod 78–82 and Galatasaray S.K. 76–82, both of them being EuroLeague Top 16 participants last season. During the last match {{of the regular season}} versus the AEK, Neptūnas was even able to guarantee the first place in the group, but after dissipating a 16-point advantage in the third quarter, lost it 75–71 and finished second. Just {{before the start of the}} EuroCup's Last 32 stage, Trent Plaisted replaced Simas Galdikas. Despite a very successful first stage, the Last 32 phase {{began with a}} desperate loss to Aris 84–58 in Thessaloniki. However, the team then created a feast in Klaipėda, defeating Alba Berlin 73–65. Following it, Neptūnas suffered two close defeats to the Italian powerhouse EA7 Emporio Armani Milan (79–71 in Milan and 73–74 in Klaipėda). The pleasant 72–68 rematch with Aris left the Neptūnas hopes for the playoffs alive, though it vanished after losing to Alba 62–76 in Berlin and finishing with a 2–4 record in the second round.|$|E
40|$|Context To {{present the}} case of an unusual {{presentation}} at imaging of a <b>very</b> small <b>solid</b> undifferentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma which mimics a side-branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Case report The patient came to our hospital for a revaluation of a cystic pancreatic lesion. Ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) examinations were carried out. A small cystic lesion of about 1. 5 cm in diameter was seen in the posterior aspect of the pancreatic uncinate process A <b>very</b> small, <b>solid,</b> vascularized nodule was detected at CEUS within the lesion. Consequently, the patient underwent CT and MRI. MRI confirmed the presence of an intralesional nodule and communication with the main pancreatic duct was demonstrated, suggesting the diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with solid intralesional tissue. A pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was carried out. An undifferentiated adenocarcinoma having a notable peripheral inflammatory reaction and dilated branch duct was finally diagnosed. Conclusion To our knowledge, we present for the first time, {{the case of}} a <b>very</b> small <b>solid</b> undifferentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma of the uncinate process which mimicked a side-branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm at imaging. The cystic appearance may be an epiphenomenon of a solid lesion and this possibility has to be considered when one encounters incidental cystic lesions at imaging...|$|R
