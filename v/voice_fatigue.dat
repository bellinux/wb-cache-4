40|$|Following {{from the}} premise that story sharing with {{similarly}} situated others surrounding salient life transitions is healing and empowering, this inquiry uncovered a provocative phenomenon referred to as "voice fatigue. " According to project participants who were six midlife members of a support circle for women undergoing marital dissolution, <b>voice</b> <b>fatigue</b> may occur over time when a woman amidst life transition grows tired of hearing her own pain-filled voice. <b>Voice</b> <b>fatigue</b> also may serve as an indicator that a transitional woman is ready to move forward in her healing process. Such healing is premised to occur via the dynamic shaping of a survivor's story, symbolizing a refusal to view oneself as a mere victim. Feminist psychotherapists may play an invaluable supportive role within this process, and are urged to collaborate with their female clients on their journey towards emotional and spiritual healing, growth, and transformation. Grounding This Work As a doctoral candidate conducting feminist research with women in transition, my work was grounded in the discourse of women's relational voice. Following in feminist psychologist Carol Gilligan's (1982) innovative tradition, my central premise was that, within a culture that silences the feminine, sharing one's story with similarly situated supportive others enables women {{to make sense of}} their life experiences and is afiBrming and empowering (Belenky et al., 1997...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the vocal vibration pattern of <b>fatigued</b> <b>voice</b> by high speed laryngscopic imaging. A computer program, High Speed Video Processing (HSVP) program, was used to quantify the laryngscopic images using indices measuring glottal area, anterior-posterior length of the glottis and {{the width of the}} glottis. Twenty participants aged from 18 to 23 years (mean = 21. 2 years, s. d. = 1. 3 years) with normal voice were recruited to participate in a singing task. Vocal fatigue was induced through prolonged singing. High speed laryngscopic imaging was taken before and after the singing task. Images of /i/ phonation were analyzed using the HSVP program. Significant changes were found in the posterior glottal length ratio index and glottal length to width ratio index following vocal fatigue. It was hypothesized that vocal fatigue condition would lead to a compensatory hyperactive laryngeal adjustment. This lengthened the vocal folds anterio-posteriorly and made the glottis narrower.

40|$|Posterior {{laryngitis}} is {{a common}} cause of chronic cough, hoarseness, <b>voice</b> <b>fatigue</b> and throat pain. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine how patients with posterior laryngitis have been examined, treated and followed up, and to assess their present health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Patients treated for posterior laryngitis at consultation at the ear-, nose- and throat clinic during 2000 - 2008 were contacted by mail. The letter contained questionnaires addressing the current symptoms and medication, and the HRQOL 36 -item short-form questionnaire (SF- 36). Medical records were scrutinized. One hundred and twenty-two patients with verified signs and symptoms of posterior laryngitis were included. Forty percent of the patients had been treated for acid-related symptoms prior to consultation. The most common symptoms at the time of consultation were the sensation of hoarseness (women 40 %, men 37 %), globus (women 35 %, men 33 %) and cough (women 33 %, men 26 %). The most frequent diagnosis was gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Ninety percent of the women and 92 % of the men were treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). At the time of study, 63 % of the patients still had symptoms. The results of the SF- 36 questionnaire showed significantly lower HRQOL for women. Patients with posterior laryngitis present varying symptoms, and are often not adequately treated or followed up. When PPI treatment fails, other aetiologies of their complaints, such as visceral hypersensitivity, weakly gaseous acid reflux or non-acid reflux are not considered.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} a unique instance of cranial nerve injury related to uncomplicated carotid artery stenting (CAS). Case Report: A 74 -year-old {{woman with a}} history of expressive aphasia and right upper/ lower extremity weakness underwent staged CAS procedures under local anesthesia and conscious sedation. After routine predilation with a 4 -mm balloon, a tapered 7310330 -mm Acculink stent was placed and dilated with a 5 -mm balloon. At 1 month after the second procedure, the carotid stents were patent bilaterally, but the patient reported <b>voice</b> <b>fatigue</b> and hoarseness along with dysphagia to liquids that started 2 days after her second procedure. Brain scans ruled out stroke. Direct laryngoscopy showed left vocal cord paralysis and a mobile right vocal cord; computed tomography revealed adduction of the left vocal cord consistent with a left recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Radiography did not show any evidence of stent fracture. Electromyography was suggestive of right recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis and only mild abnormalities on the left. A repeat laryngoscopy performed 4 months after the initial evaluation revealed persistent left vocal fold paralysis and no abnormalities on the right. The patient was referred for voice therapy; at 18 months, the stents were patent, and her vocal symptoms had significantly improved. Conclusion: While minimally invasive endovascular techniques evolve for management of vascular disease, the anatomical structures at risk during open procedures may be injured with endovascular approaches as well.

40|$|Introduction and aims: Respiratory {{function}} may be impaired {{in multiple}} sclerosis (MS) and cervical {{spinal cord injury}} (CSCI), but few studies have reported voice and speech data before and after respiratory training in MS and CSCI. The aims of these studies were therefore to provide {{a detailed description of}} voice and speech following CSCI, and to evaluate effects of glossopharyngeal breathing (glossopharyngeal pistoning for lung insufflation, GI) and expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) on respiration, voice and speech, and communication in individuals with MS or CSCI. Methods: Participants were 26 individuals with CSCI, a control group (CG) of 19 matched non-injured individuals, and six individuals with MS. The project included three group studies and two single subject studies (one being repeated across five participants). The following data were analyzed: respiratory, acoustic, aerodynamic, and anamnestic information, self-reported voice and speech function and limitations, and perceptual voice and speech assessment performed by experienced speech-language pathologists. Results: A majority of the participants with CSCI experienced long-standing voice changes and used a range of strategies to compensate for the limited respiratory function. The Sw-VHI scores showed significantly more pronounced voice problems in the group with CSCI, and their results on maximum respiratory, voice, and speech performance tasks were significantly worse when compared with the CG. Participants with a vital capacity (VC) of less than 50 % of the expected performed significantly worse than participants with a VC above 50 % of the expected, and the level of injury had an impact on respiratory function in complete CSCI. The listeners rated the presence of the perceptual voice and speech characteristics to be low in the group with CSCI, but harshness and vocal fry were present to a higher degree, and in more participants with CSCI, and loudness was rated lower than normal compared with the CG. There were both short- and long-term effects on voice and speech, including increased loudness and improved phonatory stability in the seven individuals with CSCI who used GI. Long-term effects were particularly marked in the participant with MS, who showed continued improvements of respiration and speech up to the last follow up 20 months after intervention, both on habitual speech measures and when using GI. Following EMST, some of the five participants with MS showed increases in maximum expiratory pressure, maximum phonation time, loudness and phonatory stability, but the results suggested larger effect sizes in the two participants with mild MS, who were able to train with a higher load. Self-reports indicated effects on communicative participation in MS after GI and EMST. Conclusions: CSCI can result in long-standing changes in voice function secondary to the respiratory impairment, especially in challenging speech tasks. Therefore, individuals with CSCI risk <b>voice</b> <b>fatigue</b> and restrictions in communicative participation. The voice and speech changes following CSCI are perceptually subtle, but can be identified by posing questions or using instruments about self-perceived limitations, and by including more challenging speech tasks in the assessment. GI can be considered in speech pathology intervention for patients with CSCI and MS. EMST may have additional positive effects, why more clinical investigations about the outcomes of this treatment are needed...|$|E

40|$|Aging {{of voice}} is an unseen issue {{perceived}} by sounding ‘old’. This involves a widespread change throughout {{the upper and}} lower airway mainly affected by the change in anatomy and physiology of vocal fold/cord. Thinning of laryngeal mucosa, atrophy of vocal muscles, reduced movement of cricoarytenoid joint, reduced lung volume and capacities; reduced movement of tongue, jaw as well systemic conditions may all affect the normal voice in older ages. Higher pitch voice in men, lower pitch voice in women, ‘thin’ <b>voice,</b> vocal <b>fatigue,</b> difficulty in being heard in noisy situations, tremor or shakiness in the voice are common changes found in old people.

Methods Evaluation of 71 patients through European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Module (EORTC QLQ-C 30) and Head and Neck Module (QLQ-H&N 35), and trial-specific questionnaires. Treatment consisted of standard radiotherapy with 4 weekly IA or 3 weekly IV cisplatin infusions. Results No significant differences in treatment-related QOL problems between 1 and 5 years posttreatment were observed, except for dry mouth (gradually improving; p =. 004). Survivors have lower fatigue levels (p =. 04), better voice (p = 0. 3), and swallowing (p =. 03) than patients who could not complete all subsequent follow-up questionnaires. Conclusions Most treatment-related QOL issues deteriorate during treatment, improve in the first year, and then remain stable, except xerostomia, improving up to the 5 -year assessment point. Survivors show more positive scores for <b>fatigue,</b> <b>voice,</b> and swallowing. QOL issues at 1 year, thus, for most already represent those after 5 -year follow-up.

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} towards automobile safety and security. In the field of an automotive research, a method to monitor and to detect a fatigue/drowsy or a drunken driver has been studied for many years. Previous research uses sensors such as an infrared camera for pupil detection or <b>voice</b> to detect <b>fatigue,</b> or image processing to detect driver expression. Even these approaches are able to detect driver’s fatigue; however, these methods are not driver adaptable nor interactive with a outside driving situation. We propose driver’s fatigue approach for real-time detection of driver fatigue. The system consists of a sensors directly pointed towards the driver’s face. The input to the system is a continuous stream of signals from the sensors. The system monitors the driver’s eyes to detect micro-sleeps (short periods of sleep lasting 3 to 4 seconds), monitors the driver’s jaw to detect jaw movement and monitors to detect driver pulse from finger using LED & LDR assembling. The system can analyze the eyes lid movement, jaw movement, variation in pulse rate from the driver compute {{it as well as}} compare signal. Accordingly, we can be obtained the driver’s fatigue level based on the response signals and alert driver. ...|$|R
40|$|Vocal folds {{are made}} of an {{elastomeric}} tissue and are essential to everyday life, allowing for communication. Approximately 28 million individuals have paralysis or scarring of the vocal folds mostly due to injury or systemic diseases. Symptoms may include <b>voice</b> hoarseness or <b>fatigue.</b> Healthy vocal folds consist of distinct layers of soft tissue. We are designing hydrogels with properties similar to these healthy tissues. The hydrogels are envisioned {{to be used as}} injectable and degradable tissue matrices that allow for repair and regeneration of the vocal folds. ^ We present the synthesis of a robust and degradable hydrogel system made of lactide containing poly (ethylene glycol) that was cross-linked in the presence of collagen. The hydrogel precursor solutions are low viscous and injectable and the cross-linked hydrogels form elastomeric-like polymer networks. Mechanical properties of the hydrogels were found to depend predominantly on PEG-LA-DA polymer concentration. Incorporation of collagen into the covalently cross-linked PEG based network enhanced hydrogel viscoelasticity. Degradation properties were strongly dependent on temperature. Experimental results suggest that this hydrogel system can be further formulated and developed to fine tune mechanical and degradation properties. The findings and results from this project show promise in generating robust and degradable soft materials for custom made viscoelastic tissue repair such as that of vocal fold. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{investigate}} {{music theory}} teachers’ professional and extra-professional vocal loading and background noise exposure, (2) {{to determine the}} correlation between vocal loading and background noise, and (3) to determine the correlation between vocal loading and self-evaluation data. Methods: Using voice dosimetry, 13 music theory teachers were monitored for one workweek. Parameters analysed were voice SPL, F 0, phonation time, vocal loading index (VLI) and noise SPL. Spearman’s correlation was used to correlate vocal loading parameters (voice SPL, F 0 and phonation time) and noise SPL. Each day, subjects self-assessed their voice using visual analogue scales. VLI and self-evaluation data were correlated using Spearman’s correlation. Results: Vocal loading parameters and noise SPL were significantly higher in the professional than in the extra-professional environment. Voice SPL, phonation time and females’ F 0 correlated positively with noise SPL. VLI correlated with self-assessed <b>voice</b> quality, vocal <b>fatigue</b> and amount of singing and speaking voice produced. Conclusions: Teaching music theory is a profession with high vocal demands. More background noise is associated with increased vocal loading and may indirectly increase the risk for voice disorders. Correlations between VLI and self-assessments suggest that these teachers are well-aware of their vocal demands and feel their effect on voice quality and vocal fatigue.

40|$|Fourteen dysphonic {{patients}} who had previously undergone total or extended cordectomy underwent medialization thyroplasty. A minimum delay of 6  months was respected to allow the spontaneous "neocord" formation, to evaluate the voice recovery achieved by speech therapy alone and to avoid an undiagnosed early recurrence. Surgery was performed under general anaesthesia, using a laryngeal mask, because undermining the fibrous tissue at the inner side of the thyroid ala is a prolonged and difficult procedure. This step was essential to ensure an easy placement of the implant and to avoid tearing the fibrous tissue, with subsequent risk of implant extrusion. Visual control of the implant implementation was obtained by flexible videoendoscopy. The Montgomery(®) implant system (Boston, Westborough, MA) {{was used for the}} majority of the cases. Hand-made modified Montgomery implants or Gore-tex(®) were used in case of extended scarring or peculiar anatomic defect.

40|$|Speech signal {{processing}} for voice communications can be characterised {{in terms of}} silence compression, noise reduction, and speech compression. The limit in the channel bandwidth of voice communication systems requires efficient compression of speech and silence signals while retaining the voice quality. Silence compression by means of both voice activity detection (VAD) and comfort noise generation could present transparent speech-quality while substantially lowering the transmission bit-rate, since pause regions between talk spurts do not include any voice information. Thus, this thesis proposes smoothed likelihood ratio-based VAD, designed {{on the basis of}} a behavioural analysis and improvement of a statistical model-based voice activity detector. Input speech could exhibit noisy signals, which could make the <b>voice</b> communication <b>fatiguing</b> and less intelligible. This task can be alleviated by noise reduction as a preprocessor for speech coding. Noise characteristics in speech enhancement are adapted typically during the pause regions classified by a voice activity detector. However, VAD errors could lead to over- or under- estimation of the noise statistics. Thus, this thesis proposes mixed decision-based noise adaptation based on a integration of soft and hard decision-based methods, defined with the speech presence uncertainty and VAD result, respectively. At low bit-rate speech coding, the sinusoidal model has been widely applied because of its good nature exploiting the phase redundancy of speech signals. Its performance, however, can be severely smeared by mis-estimation of the pitch. Thus, this thesis proposes a robust pitch estimation technique based on the autocorrelation of spectral amplitudes. Another important parameter in sinusoidal speech coding is the spectral magnitude of the LP-residual signal. It is, however, not easy to directly quantise the magnitudes because the dimensions of the spectral vectors are variable from frame to frame depending on the pitch. To alleviate this problem, this thesis proposes mel-scale-based dimension conversion, which converts the spectral vectors to a fixed dimension based on mel-scale warping. A predictive coding scheme is also employed in order to exploit the inter-frame redundancy between the spectral vectors. Experimental results show that each proposed technique is suitable for enhancing speech quality for voice communications. Furthermore, an improved speech coder incorporating the proposed techniques is developed. The vocoder gives speech quality comparable to TIA/EIA IS- 127 for noisy speech whilst operating at lower than half the bit-rate of the reference coder. Key words: voice activity detection, speech enhancement, pitch, spectral magnitude quantisation, low bit-rate coding...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In Belgium, {{music theory}} {{teachers}} teach theoretical aspects of rhythm, singing and other music-related skills (such as pitch accuracy or singing in harmony) outside the regular school setting. To date, their voice use {{and how it}} may be affected by background noise have hardly been studied. OBJECTIVES: 1) to determine the relationship between music theory teachers’ vocal loading and background noise and 2) to examine if the daily number of vocal fold vibration cycles (vocal loading index, VLI) {{is reflected in the}} teachers’ auto-evaluation of their voice. METHODS: A VoxLog voice dosimeter (Sonvox) was used to monitor 13 music theory teachers for one 6 -day workweek from the early morning until late evening. Parameters analysed were fundamental frequency (F 0, Hz), voice sound pressure level (SPL, dB), time dose (%), noise SPL (dB), and VLI. At the end of each monitoring day, subjects evaluated their <b>voice</b> quality, vocal <b>fatigue,</b> and amount of speaking and singing voice used by means of a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed positive correlations between noise SPL and F 0, voice SPL and time dose. Correlations were also found between VLI and auto-evaluation data: a rise in VLI accompanied a decrease in self-perceived voice quality, an increase in vocal fatigue and an increase in the perceived amount of singing and speaking voice used. CONCLUSION: Three conclusions were drawn from the results. Firstly, vocal loading measured in music theory teachers is connected to the background noise level. Secondly, a great number of vibration cycles is associated with a self-reported increase in vocal fatigue and a lower general voice quality {{at the end of the}} day. Finally, correlations between the number of vibration cycles and the self-reported amount of voice use suggest that visual analogue scales are a reliable method to evaluate daily voice use.

Not only can abusive vocal and speech habits affect the quality of voice, but they can also result in inappropriate vocal technique, which is why vocal hygiene, i. e. taking care of one's singing voice, is of utmost importance. What it takes is a lifestyle and behaviour that work {{in the best interest of}} one’s voice while, at the same time, improving their mental and physical well-being. The theoretical part of the present Master’s dissertation provides an overview of vocal anatomy and speech production physiology as well as speech pathology, while placing special emphasis on the risk factors that contribute to the development of voice disorders in singers. The thesis defines the role of a speech and language therapist, who – alongside a phoniatrician and a psychologist – is crucial in voice treatment. Last but not least, the study includes guidelines to improve vocal hygiene in singers, keeping their voice as healthy as possible. The purpose of the empirical study was to determine the frequency of voice problems among choral singers, the impact of abusive vocal and eating habits on their vocal function as well as their familiarity with the concept of vocal hygiene. Answering the background questionnaire on the frequency of their vocal problems and the knowledge of vocal hygiene, 71 members of two Slovenian choirs participated in the study. The results show that 76...|$|R
40|$|Master of MusicThroughout the 20 th Century, female operatic singers {{in most of}} {{the major}} European opera houses were given “grace days” (where they were not {{required}} to sing) in recognition of the effect of hormonal changes on the singing voice. Financial constraints in professional companies have resulted in a reduction of such considerations, but to date, there has been no systematic study of the effects of hormonal fluctuations {{on the quality of the}} female singing voice, or of its potential adverse effects on the vocal apparatus for singers who are affected by pre-menstrual syndrome. This study investigated the effects of hormonal fluctuations on young professional female classical singers. Female and male professional singers in training (students) at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, University of Sydney, were asked to participate as volunteers in the study by keeping daily diaries. The female singers kept a diary for two separate months beginning on the first day of menstruation, in which they recorded their daily basal temperature, mood, voice state and physical well being. The male control subjects kept daily diaries for one month. Acoustic analysis of two vocal samples taken during the second month, on days 1 and 14 of the cycle, were completed on the six most severely affected female subjects, who were identified through their diary ratings of changes in vocal quality during menstruation. The selected students assessed their own vocal samples, presented in random order, to determine whether they could reliably identify which of their samples were affected by menstruation. Vocal staff at the Conservatorium (pedagogues), who were blind to the purpose of the study, also assessed recordings presented randomly. Results indicated that self-perceived vocal quality varied over the course of the menstrual cycle, particularly during the first seven days of the cycle, that negative changes in mood affected the <b>voice,</b> and that <b>fatigue,</b> effort, hoarseness, weakness & peak performance were the most frequently affected vocal states. A surprising finding was that male self-perceived voice quality also varied over the course of one month of diary keeping. There was no consistent change in direction of scores during menstrual and non-menstrual phases. Five of the six most affected singers correctly identified their performance during menstruation but pedagogues were not consistently able to do so [...] These results indicate that perceived quality of the voice through changes in the menstrual cycle may not be as obvious to a highly trained observer even though they were reliably perceived by the singer. This study demonstrates that menstruation has a discernible impact on the self-perception of female singers’ vocal quality and implies that the premenstrual or menstrual female may not feel able to present her peak performance at these times of hormonal fluctuation. Further detailed research in this area may be warranted on a larger scale to elaborate a more precise clinical management of the problem...|$|R
