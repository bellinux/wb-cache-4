500|$|The {{story of}} Strange Days was {{originally}} conceived by director James Cameron around 1986. He eventually {{presented it to}} his former wife and director Kathryn Bigelow, who immediately found it impressive. According to her, [...] "These two characters {{on the eve of}} the millennium, with one character trying to get the woman who loves him to help him save the woman he loves. It's this great emotional matrix." [...] After a series of dialogues, Cameron and Bigelow developed the film's society and political element. Cameron focused more on the romantic side, while Bigelow centered more on [...] "the edginess, the grit" [...] part of the film, which was something she was always interested in. Cameron later wrote a 90-page treatment based on these dialogues, stating that [...] "It was practically a novel, but it was unwieldy; it needed structure." [...] The treatment was then presented to screenwriter Jay Cocks, who turned it into a script. Cameron felt that the resulting script was <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>structured</b> and only did a dialogue polish on top of it.|$|E

Optimal conditions for the control of VBC polymerization by RAFT are first established, followed by the use of the “grafting from” method to yield polymeric brushes that form a well-defined shell surrounding the silica core. We obtain particles that are monodisperse in size, and we demonstrate that the exceptional control over their dimensions is achieved by careful tailoring the conditions of the radical polymerization...|$|R
