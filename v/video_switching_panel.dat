40|$|This article {{proposes a}} panel {{model with a}} regime {{switching}} mechanism to analyse the feature of US business cycles. This Markov <b>Switching</b> <b>Panel</b> model is simple and can easily be estimated using Hamilton's (1989) method. We test {{the ability of the}} Markov <b>Switching</b> <b>Panel</b> model to identify US turning points using the US coincident indicator data. The empirical evidence shows that this model is highly capable of identifying US recessionary dates. It also has a better forecast performance than the Markov Switching vector autoregressive model. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{information}} contained in a large panel data set is used to date historical turning points of the Austrian business cycle and to forecast future ones. We estimate groups of series with similar time series dynamics and link the groups with a dynamic structure. The dynamic structure identifies a group of leading {{and a group of}} coincident series. Robust results across data vintages are obtained when series specific information is incorporated {{in the design of the}} prior group probability distribution. The results are consistent with common expectations, in particular the group of leading series includes Austrian confidence indicators and survey data, German survey indicators, some trade data, and, interestingly, the Austrian and the German stock market indices. The forecast evaluation confirms that the Markov <b>switching</b> <b>panel</b> with dynamic structure performs well when compared to other specifications.
