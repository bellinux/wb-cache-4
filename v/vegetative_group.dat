In this study, {{we have identified}} and characterized three legumains encoded by Theobroma cacao genome through in silico analyses, three-dimensional modeling, genetic expression pattern in different tissues and {{as a response to}} the inoculation of Moniliophthora perniciosa fungus. The three proteins were named TcLEG 3, TcLEG 6, and TcLEG 9. Histidine and cysteine residue which are part of the catalytic site were conserved among the proteins, and they remained parallel in the loop region in the 3 D modeling. Three-dimensional modeling showed that the propeptide, which is located in the terminal C region of legumains blocks the catalytic cleft. Comparing dendrogram data with the relative expression analysis, indicated that TcLEG 3 is related to the seed legumain group, TcLEG 6 is related with the group of embryogenesis activities, and protein TcLEG 9, with processes regarding the <b>vegetative</b> <b>group.</b> Furthermore, the expression analyses proposes a significant role for the three legumains during the development of Theobroma cacao and in its interaction with M.  perniciosa...|$|E

The knowledge on <b>vegetative</b> compatibility <b>groups</b> (VCGs) is of particular interest in asexual fungi as they subdivide the population in groups that can exchange genetic information via heterokaryosis and the parasexual cycle. Among the techniques used in studies about <b>vegetative</b> compatibility <b>groups,</b> the obtainment of nit mutants is apparent. This paper is aimed at obtaining heterokaryons between different isolates of C. lindemuthianum, grouping them in VCGs and evaluating their genetic variability by using the nit mutants system. Nit mutants were obtained from 20 single spore isolates. The mutants were phenotypically classified and paired for complementation and formation of heterokaryons so as to group them in VCGs. Seventeen mutants from the different phenotypic-rates were recovered: nit 1, nit 2, nit 3 and nitM. At the same time, 10 mutants were selected for pairing and division of the anastomosis groups. Nine heterokaryons were obtained and the isolates were divided into 9 <b>vegetative</b> compatibility <b>groups.</b> In the combinations for the formation of anastomosis, 31 compatible combinations and 24 incompatible combinations were observed. It was concluded that the methodology used to select nit mutants in C. lindemuthianum made it possible to determine the <b>vegetative</b> compatibility <b>groups</b> and that such a technique was adequate to prove genetic variability...|$|R

The seasonality of the macroalgae community structure was strongly influenced by microhabitat variables (current velocity, substrate H', and irradiance), demonstrating their importance over time and at different scales.

Based on pairings of nit mutants from the different isolates, five <b>vegetative</b> complementation <b>groups</b> (VCG) were identified, and barriers {{to the formation of}} heterokaryons were observed among isolates derived from the same geographic area.

40|$|Four {{aspects of}} {{horizontal}} genetic transfer during heterokaryon formation {{were examined in}} the asexual pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) : (1) variability based on method of heterokaryon formation; (2) differences in nuclear and mitochondrial inheritance; (3) the occurrence of recombination without nuclear fusion; (4) the occurrence of horizontal genetic transfer between distantly related isolates. The use of non-pathogenic strains of Fusarium oxysporum as biocontrol agents warrants a closer examination at the reproductive life cycle of this fungus, particularly if drug resistance or pathogenicity genes can be transmitted horizontally. Experiments were divided into three phases. Phase I looked at heterokaryon formation by hyphal anastomosis and protoplast fusion. Phase II was a time course of heterokaryon formation to look at patterns of nuclear and mitochondrial inheritance. Phase III examined the genetic relatedness of the different <b>vegetative</b> compatibility <b>groups</b> using a multilocus analysis approach. Heterokaryon formation was evident within and between <b>vegetative</b> compatibility <b>groups.</b> Observation of non-parental genotypes after heterokaryon formation confirmed that, although a rare event, horizontal genetic transfer occurred during heterokaryon formation. Uniparental mitochondria inheritance was observed in heterokaryons formed either by hyphal anastomosis or protoplast fusion. Drug resistance was expressed during heterokaryon formation, even across greater genetic distances than those distances imposed by vegetative compatibility. Phylogenies inferred from different molecular markers were incongruent at a significant level, challenging the clonal origins of Foc.

Human exposure to aflatoxins is limited by regulations that prohibit the use of crops containing excess quantities of aflatoxins for foods and feeds. Aflatoxins are regulated in part per billion (ppb) ranges with the maximum allowable level varying with country and intended use of the commodity. The quantity permitted in U.

However, certain methodological limitations prevent its application on a large scale. Furthermore, systematic investigations into the genetics underlying complementation tests between nit mutants of fungal isolates (i. e. heterokaryon formation) are lacking for Verticillium species. In this work, a diverse collection of 27 V. dahliae isolates – including representatives of all VCGs, both mating types, and heterokaryon self-incompatible isolates – was employed for the development and optimization of (i) a protocol for the rapid generation of nit mutants of V. dahliae isolates using UV-irradiation and (ii) a reproducible high-throughput procedure for complementation tests between nit mutants in liquid cultures using 96 -well microplates. The genetic analysis of selected heterokaryons demonstrated that the frequently encountered ‘weak’ cross-reactions between VCGs and their subgroups can be actually heterokaryotic, implying the absence of strict genetic barriers between VCGs. In conclusion, we provide in this work an optimized method for the high-throughput VCG assignment of V. dahliae populations and a genetic analysis of heterokaryons that may have serious implications for the interpretation of VCG classification data.

Evaluations of macroalgal communities took into consideration the following spatial scales: the drainage basin (the Pedras river and Marrecas river basins), shading regime (open and shaded stream segments), mesohabitats (riffles and pools), and microhabitats (sampling units of 0. 05 m 2). A total of 29 taxa (23 subgeneric, one generic, and five <b>vegetative</b> <b>groups)</b> were identified. on these, 12 taxa belong to Chlorophyta, 11 to Cyanobacteria, four to Heterokontophyta, and two to Rhodophyta.

CHV1 is {{exceptional}} amongst mycoviral research due its success as biocontrol agent against chestnut blight in Europe, {{but also because it}} is a model organism for studying hypovirulence in fungi. However, this system is only being used in Europe routinely, because of the relative small number of <b>vegetative</b> compatibility <b>groups</b> (VCGs) on this continent. In contrast, in North America the distribution of the hypovirulent phenotype is often prevented because fungal hyphae cannot fuse and exchange their cytoplasmic content due to an incompatibility reaction. In the United States of America at least 35 VCGs were found. A similar situation seems to be present in China and Japan where 71 VCGs were identified so far.|$|R

Using the double-pick method to force heterokaryon formation via hyphal anastomosis, 104 pairwise combinations were done between 100 auxotrophic mutants of Foe representing races 1, 2 and 4 in five VCGs. Inter formae speciales heterokaryon formation was also observed on pairings between benomyl resistant Wild Type Testers (WTT) and wild type isolates in 15 VCGs and four different formae speciales. Microconidia analysis of heterokaryons identified both parental phenotypes as well as diploid phenotypes. Colonies with altered and hybrid genotypes were recovered from analysis of sectors from prototrophic hybrids as well as sectors with parental phenotype providing evidence of all stages of the parasexual cycle in this asexual, soilborne, phytopathogen...|$|R
