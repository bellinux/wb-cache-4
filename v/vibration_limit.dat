50|$|HDD data {{transfer}} rate depends upon the rotational speed of the disks and the data recording density. Because heat and <b>vibration</b> <b>limit</b> rotational speed, increasing density has become the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Areal density (the number of bits that {{can be stored in}} a certain area of the disk) has been increased over time by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk, and the number of sectors per track. The latter will increase the {{data transfer}} rate for a given RPM speed. Improvement of {{data transfer rate}} performance is correlated to the areal density only by increasing a track's linear surface bit density (sectors per track). Simply increasing the number of tracks on a disk can affect seek times but not gross transfer rates. According to industry observers and analysts for 2011 to 2016, “The current roadmap predicts no more than a 20%/yr improvement in bit density”. Seek times have not kept up with throughput increases, which themselves have not kept up with growth in bit density and storage capacity.|$|E

Construction activities, particularly piling processes, may generate excessive ground-borne vibrations.

The force <b>limited</b> <b>vibration</b> test technique has been utilized at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and other NASA centers to provide more realistic vibration test environments for aerospace flight hardware. In standard random vibration tests, the payload is mounted to a rigid fixture and the interface acceleration is controlled to a specified level based on a conservative estimate of the expected flight environment. In force <b>limited</b> <b>vibration</b> tests, both the acceleration and force are controlled at the mounting interface to compensate for differences between the flexible flight mounting and rigid test fixture.

Previously, a variety of command generation techniques such as input shaping have been used to reduce residual <b>vibration,</b> <b>limit</b> transient deflection, conserve fuel or adhere to numerous other performance specifications or performance measures. This dissertation addresses key issues regarding the application of command generation techniques to tethered satellite systems. The three primary objectives of this research are as follows: 1) create analytically commands that will limit the deflection of flexible systems 2) combine command generation and feedback control to reduce the retrieval time of tethered satellites, and 3) develop command generation techniques for spinning tether systems. More specifically, the proposed research addresses six specific aspects of command generation for tethered satellites systems: 1) create command shapers that can limit the trajectory tracking for a mass under PD control to a pre-specified limit in real time 2) create commands analytically that can limit the transient deflection of a model with one rigid-body and one flexible mode during rest-to-rest maneuvers 3) command generation for a 2 -D model of earth-pointing tethered satellites without tether flexibility, 4) command generation for a 2 -D model of earth-pointing tethered satellites to reduce tether retrieval time and reduce swing angle, 5) command generation for a 3 -D model of earth-pointing tethered satellites without tether flexibility, and 6) command generation for improved spin-up of spinning tethered satellite systems.

40|$|Large {{numbers of}} fluid elastic {{structures}} {{are part of}} many power plant systems and vibration of these systems sometimes are responsible for plant shut downs. Earlier research at Cornell in this area had centered on nonlinear dynamics of fluid-elastic systems with low degrees of freedom. The focus of current research {{is the study of}} the dynamics of thousands of closely arrayed structures in a cross flow under both fluid and impact forces. This research is relevant to two areas: (1) First, fluid-structural problems continue to be important in the power industry, especially in heat exchange systems where up to thousands of pipe-like structures interact with a fluid medium. [Three years ago in Japan for example, there was a shut down of the Monju nuclear power plant due to a failure attributed to flow induced vibrations. ] (2) The second area of relevance is to nonlinear systems and complexity phenomena; issues such as spatial temporal dynamics, localization and coherent patterns entropy measures as well as other complexity issues. Early research on flow induced vibrations in tube row and array structures in cross flow goes back to Roberts in 1966 and Connors in 1970. These studies used linear models as have many of the later work in the 1980 's. Nonlinear studies of cross flow induced vibrations have been undertaken in the last decade. The research at Cornell sponsored by DOE has explored nonlinear phenomena in fluid-structure problems. In the work at Cornell we have documented a subcritical Hopf bifurcation for flow around a single row of flexible tubes and have developed an analytical model based on nonlinear system identification techniques. (Thothadri, 1998, Thothadri and Moon, 1998, 1999). These techniques have been applied to a wind tunnel experiment with a row of seven cylinders in a cross flow. These system identification methods have been used to calculate fluid force models that have replicated certain quantitative <b>vibration</b> <b>limit</b> cycle behavior of the vibrating cylinders. The methods are based on nonlinear analysis ideas such as harmonic balance and center manifold theory. In a set of new experiments we have looked at the dynamics of 300 and 1000 vibrating rods in cross flow. Classic fluid structure experiments have generally taken a reductionist view of fluid-elastic dynamics, namely one attempts to measure or derive forceflow relations for a single structure and then extend the results to a large number of structures. However in strongly non-linear systems such reductionist analysis does not always capture important phenomena such a chaotic dynamics, localization and coherent structures. In the case of large numbers of closely packed structures in a fluid flow, strong nonlinear effects include impact between structures. Also in large arrays, there is a natural random deviation from an exact periodic pattern that may affect the global spatial and temporal dynamics. Another complexity is the time delay effect of upstream eddies from vibrating structures driving downstream structures...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{engineering}} {{analyses of}} the integrated Ares-Orion stack show that vibration levels for Orion crews {{have the potential to}} be much higher than those experienced in Gemini, Apollo, and Shuttle vehicles. Of particular concern to the Constellation Program (CxP) is the 12 Hz thrust oscillation (TO) that the Ares-I rocket develops during the final ~ 20 seconds preceding first-stage separation, at maximum G-loading. While the structural-dynamic mitigations being considered can assure that vibration due to TO is reduced to below the CxP crew health limit, it remains to be determined how far below this limit vibration must be reduced to enable effective crew performance during launch. Moreover, this "performance" <b>vibration</b> <b>limit</b> will inform the operations concepts (and crew-system interface designs) for this critical phase of flight. While Gemini and Apollo studies provide preliminary guidance, the data supporting the historical limits were obtained using less advanced interface technologies and very different operations concepts. In this study, supported by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) Human Research Program, we investigated display readability-a fundamental prerequisite for any interaction with electronic crew-vehicle interfaces-while observers were subjected to 12 Hz vibration superimposed on the 3. 8 G loading expected for the TO period of ascent. Two age-matched groups of participants (16 general population and 13 Crew Office) performed a numerical display reading task while undergoing sustained 3. 8 G loading and whole-body vibration at 0, 0. 15, 0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 7 g in the eyeballs in/out (x-axis) direction. The time-constrained reading task used an Orion-like display with 10 - and 14 -pt non-proportional sans-serif fonts, and was designed to emulate the visual acquisition and processing essential for crew system monitoring. Compared to the no-vibration baseline, we found no significant effect of vibration at 0. 15 and 0. 3 g on task error rates (ER) or response times (RT). Significant degradations in both ER and RT, however, were observed at 0. 5 and 0. 7 g for 10 -pt, and at 0. 7 g for 14 -pt font displays. These objective performance measures were mirrored by participants' subjective ratings. Interestingly, we found that the impact of vibration on ER increased with distance {{from the center of the}} display, but only for vertical displacements. Furthermore, no significant ER or RT aftereffects were detected immediately following vibration, regardless of amplitude. Lastly, given that our reading task required no specialized spaceflight expertise, our finding that effects were not statistically distinct between our two groups is not surprising. The results from this empirical study provide initial guidance for evaluating the display readability trade-space between text-font size and vibration amplitude. However, the outcome of this work should be considered preliminary in nature for a number of reasons: 1. The single 12 Hz x-axis vibration employed was based on earlier load-cycle models of the induced TO environment at the end of Ares-I first stage flight. Recent analyses of TO mitigation designs suggest that significant concurrent off-axis vibration may also occur. 2. The shirtsleeve environment in which we tested fails to capture the full kinematic and dynamic complexity of the physical interface between crewmember and the still-to-bematured helmet-suit-seat designs, and the impact these will have for vibration transmission and consequent performance. 3. By examining performance in this reading and number processing task, we are only assessing readability, a first and necessary step that in itself does not directly address the performance of more sophisticated operational tasks such as vehicle-health monitoring or manual control of the vehicle...|$|E
