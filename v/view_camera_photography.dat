5000|$|Zoom lenses are {{not used}} in <b>view</b> <b>camera</b> <b>photography,</b> {{as there is no}} need for rapid and {{continuous}} change of focal length with static subjects, and the price, size, weight, and complexity would be excessive. Some lenses are [...] "convertible": the front or rear element only, or both elements, may be used, giving three different focal lengths, though the quality of the single elements is not as good at larger apertures as the combination. These are popular with field photographers who can save weight by carrying one convertible lens rather than two or three lenses of different focal lengths. Older convertible lenses may not be corrected for chromatic aberration, making them unsatisfactory with color film.|$|E

5000|$|The press {{camera is}} still {{used as a}} {{portable}} medium or large format film camera for photojournalism and among fine art photographers who {{use it as a}} low cost, more portable alternative to a <b>view</b> <b>camera.</b> In news <b>photography,</b> the press <b>camera</b> has been largely supplanted by the smaller formats of 120 film and 135 film, and more recently by digital cameras. The advantage of the 4x5 inch format over 35 mm format is that the size of the film negative is 16 times that of a 35 mm film negative image. [...] Press cameras were largely superseded by the 6x6cm medium format Rolleiflex in the early to mid-1960s and later by 35 mm rangefinder or single-lens reflex cameras. The smaller formats gained acceptance as film technology advanced and quality of the smaller negatives was deemed acceptable by picture editors. The smaller cameras generally offered lenses with faster maximum apertures and by the nature of their smaller size, were easier to transport and use. The bulk and weight of the camera itself, as well as the size of the film holders (two pictures per film holder), limited the number of exposures photographers could make on an assignment; this was less of an issue with 12 exposures on a roll of 120 film, or 36 exposures on 35 mm film.|$|R

5000|$|Steep {{learning}} curve: In {{addition to}} needing the knowledge required {{to operate a}} fully manual <b>camera,</b> <b>view</b> <b>camera</b> operators must understand {{a large number of}} technical matters that are not an issue to most small format photographers. They must understand, for example, <b>view</b> <b>camera</b> movements, bellows factors, and reciprocity. A great amount of time and study is needed to master those aspects of large format <b>photography,</b> so learning <b>view</b> <b>camera</b> operation requires a high degree of dedication.|$|R
50|$|Folding and <b>view</b> <b>cameras</b> use bellows {{to exclude}} light while {{allowing}} the lens {{to be moved}} relative to the film plane for focusing and, mainly in <b>view</b> <b>cameras,</b> to allow the lens to slide and tilt to control the image (camera movements).|$|R

50|$|Photographers may employ <b>view</b> <b>camera</b> {{movements}} and the Scheimpflug principle {{to place an}} object close to the lens in focus, while maintaining selective background focus. This technique {{requires the use of}} a <b>view</b> <b>camera</b> or perspective control lens with the ability to tilt the lens with respect to the film or sensor plane. Lenses such as the Nikon PC-E and Canon TS-E series, the Hartblei Super-Rotator, the Schneider Super Angulon, several Lensbaby models, the Zoerk Multi Focus System, and various tilt-shift adapters for medium format, allow the use of tilt in cameras with fixed lens mounts. Traditional <b>view</b> <b>cameras</b> permit such adjustment as part of their design.|$|R
