40|$|When {{cementitious}} {{materials are}} used for the containment of waste they act in two different, and sometimes conflicting, ways. The first is physical {{and the second is}} chemical containment in which the water passing through the barrier is buffered to high pH thereby substantially reducing the solubility of many harmful species and promoting sorption onto the matrix. Chemical barriers have been extensively researched for nuclear waste containment and this paper reports on the development of chemical barriers for the non-nuclear waste management. It focuses on the ability of a cementitious barrier to chemically condition liquid leachates, neutralising organic acids and reducing the solubility of priority pollutants. This is similar {{to the way in which}} cement suppresses actinide leaching in the disposal of nuclear wastes. In this paper, the results of an extensive preliminary investigation into potential mixes using <b>various</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> are presented and some of the measured properties are compared with those, which are required for a multi-layer barrier. The results indicate that many of these mixes are well suited to this application...|$|E
40|$|Cementitious {{materials}} have traditionally not been economically viable for most landfill containment systems. Conventional liners {{have been made}} with clay and high-density polyethylene membranes, supporting packed aggregate layers. This paper describes an alternative technology in which low-cost concrete liners may be constructed, making use of materials, which {{are considered to be}} wastes by their primary producers. Many materials that have the potential for use either as binder or as aggregate materials for concrete currently form part of the United Kingdom landfill inventory. Although unattractive for use as structural concrete, they offer considerable utility for landfill liner applications. Recent increases in disposal costs including the introduction of the landfill tax have, however, made low cost low strength mixes a financially attractive option as a barrier for landfill leachate containment. In this paper the required properties of cementitious mixes for this purpose are discussed. The results of an extensive investigation into potential mixes using <b>various</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> are presented and the measured properties are compared with those, which are required. All of the mixes, which have been investigated, contain large amounts of secondary materials. If these materials were treated as wastes their disposal costs would be high, so the mixes may be designated “negative cost mixes. ” The results indicate that some of these mixes are well suited to this application...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mineral</b> <b>waste</b> {{is largely}} an {{unavoidable}} by-product of the extraction, processing {{and production of}} mineral-based products. The UK is well-endowed with mineral resources which have been worked {{for thousands of years}} resulting in millions of tonnes of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> across the country. The most significant mineral resource worked was coal with more than 26, 000 million tonnes of coal produced and 3600 million tonnes of waste rock. Other significant volumes of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> were derived from metal mining including tin, copper, lead and iron ore. Also a considerable volume was derived from the production of industrial and construction minerals such as brick clay, building stone, china clay, salt and slate. Currently the largest volumes of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> produced in the UK are those associated with the production of construction aggregate from hard rock quarries and sand and gravel operations. The amount of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> produced in the UK is currently not known in detail. Any figures for <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> are usually based on calculations that rely on the amount of saleable products recorded in the Annual Minerals Raised inquiry. Legislation in the UK is primarily concerned with the safe disposal of waste. It was not until the introduction of the Landfill Tax in 1996 and the Aggregates Levy in 2002 that concerted effort was made by the UK minerals industry to reduce, reuse or recycle <b>mineral</b> <b>waste.</b> A significant amount of research has been carried out since then to identify new uses for <b>mineral</b> <b>waste,</b> much of it funded in the 1990 s and 2000 s by the taxes raised.

30|$|Rubble, slag, and sludge, {{referred}} to as non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes,</b> are frequently recycled as alternate materials for natural non-metallic mineral resources such as dirt, crushed stone, sand, and clay. Concrete waste and asphalt concrete waste, which are non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes,</b> are categorized as industrial wastes in Japan. According to the annual report of Japan’s Ministry of the Environment (2015), the emission of these non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> in 2012 was 56.7 million tons in the country, which accounted for 15 % of the 379.1 million tons of total industrial waste.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on the {{increase}} in generation of non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> and the decrease in demand for construction by investigating the material flow resulting from and the economic influence {{of changes in the}} supply and demand for wastes, focusing on the period from the near future to 2030. We predict the amount of final disposal of non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> and its influence on industries in the future under the assumption of two scenarios—zero emission and business-as-usual—using linear programming and input–output techniques developed for non-metallic mineral materials. We conclude that zero emission can be achieved at the cost of a 3.76 % decrease in the value added of industries related to non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes.</b> Otherwise, the final disposal might increase 13 times the size of 2005 ’s disposal. Considering the empirical results, we discuss an effective policy for non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> management from the viewpoints of material flow and economic influence.|$|R

30|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{leads to}} the collapse of the balance of supply and demand in non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes,</b> which increases the amount of final disposal.

Both types of tested <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> have resulted from the magnesium products industry, namely as waste-product and as deposits on the industrial equipment. The composition of these waste shows significant contents of precipitated magnesium and calcium carbonates as well as low contents of iron, copper, manganese and zinc. The {{difference between the two}} tested <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> lies in the double magnesium content, established for the crusts composition. An acid low fertile soil was treated with four different doses of each waste, in absence or in presence of nitrogen addition. The waste influence on the development of wheat was established by analysing some physiological characteristics of green wheat plants, on one hand as well as their essential and trace elements content, on the other hand...|$|R
40|$|An {{industrial}} <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> {{produced in}} the aluminum sulphate industry was selected as a low cost catalyst precursor. This material {{has been active in}} dibenzylether hydroconversion, as a model compound of C-O linkages in coal. Besides, it was used in the hydroconversion of a colombian subbituminous coal. The <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> and a commercial iron oxide (as reference material) were sulfided in order to produce iron sulfide, pyrrhotite type (Fe 1 -xS), which is the active phase in hydroconversion reactions. The solids were characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Catalytic tests with the model compound and coal were carried out at 5 MPa of H 2, temperatures between 240 °C and 400 °C and reaction times were 0. 5 h or 1 h. The results showed a higher activity of the industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> compared with the reference material in the dibenzylether C-O bond cleavage. These kind of bonds are responsible for asphalthenes and preasphalthenes assembly in the molecular coal structure. In addition, coal conversion in presence of catalysts was 83. 9 %, this value was 1. 8 times higher than conversion without catalyst. Results show the potential of the industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> to be used as catalyst in the hydroconversion of coal due to its good activity and low cost...|$|R

40|$|In 1998 the BGS, in {{collaboration}} with Tarmac, initiated an industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> project known as REFILL which {{was funded by the}} EU BriteEuRam programme.

Also, BGS assisted Tarmac in research work to find uses for the fines produced at a coastal aggregate quarry in southern Ireland. In 1999 BGS developed a further research project, known as ‘Minerals from Waste’, which was funded by the UK Government Department for International Development (DfID). This project aimed to improve the sustainability of mining communities by investigating the use of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> as a source of construction and industrial minerals. The types of waste found in a range of extractive operations were reviewed. Case studies were carried out in Namibia and Costa Rica including investigations of the properties of the <b>waste,</b> <b>mineral</b> product evaluations, market and economic appraisals and social and environmental impact assessments of local communities. Overall, this work aimed to benefit not only mine and quarry engineers, but all those involved in the management of mine waste. ...|$|R

30|$|This result {{implies that}} if the policy for {{non-metallic}} <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> management is thoroughly {{carried out in the}} future, zero emission can be achieved at the small cost of a 3.76 % decrease in the value added. Otherwise, the final disposal might increase 13 times that of 2005. A drastic increase of final disposal waste leads to the shortage of landfill and generates huge social costs, including not only private costs, as the disposal cost, but also external costs, such as environmental contamination. Such a social cost would be much larger than a decrease by 3.76 % in the value added. Focusing on the result, we can suggest the zero emission scenario and encourage waste policies to minimize final disposal of non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes.</b>|$|R

Leaching methods can be different depending on the leaching time periods, leaching dynamics, sample preparation method or the pH of the elution medium. In Poland, little attention is paid to the research on the relationship between the leaching of particular heavy metals from <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> and changes in environmental conditions, including the pH of the environment. Tests being carried out abroad have started to pay great attention to the pH-dependent impact of the environment and the liquid being in contact with the material on the degree of leaching contaminants from wastes.

Authors of the paper will try to prove that Polish methods of waste characterization is incomplete and inconsistent with opinions prevailing in the global literature.

The study shows that at present at least 3 mil. tons of <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> and by-products are applied on cultivated land. Particularly wastes and by-products are employed which are resulting from sugar processing (calcium carbonate sludge), water supply (dredging spoil), exploration of quarry (fractions of minor quality, mineral powder), chemical industry (ammonium sulphate, various limy residues), treatment of water for industrial use (sludge from decarbonation) and iron and steel production (blast furnace cinder and converter slug). In view of detrimental effects of substances as applied on cultivated land substantial efforts for legal regulations are required. (orig.)
