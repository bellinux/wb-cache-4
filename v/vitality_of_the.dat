5|$|In Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, Kain is {{introduced}} {{as a young}} human noble. In the game's prologue, he is murdered by assassins, and resurrected as a vampire by Mortanius, a necromancer. He is promised both vengeance and a cure to his vampirism if he can restore the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, edifices whose state dictates the <b>vitality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world; the nine guardians who symbiotically represent the Pillars were corrupted prior to his birth, and must be killed before the land can recover. During his quest, he meets the ancient vampire Vorador, who influences him to forsake his former humanity and accept his vampirism, and discovers the Soul Reaver, a legendary soul-devouring sword. Using the Reaver, he tries to alter the course of Nosgoth's history to prevent the Nemesis—a tyrant king—from coming to power. Tricked by Moebius, the guardian of time, Kain succeeds in destroying the Nemesis, but the temporal paradox this triggers results in a new timeline in which vampires have been hunted to extinction; Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After systematically tracking down and killing most of the guardians, he confronts Mortanius—revealed as the guardian of death, and the orchestrator of Kain's assassination—and realizes that he himself is the final guardian, and that the cure to his curse entails his own destruction. Faced with the obligation of self-sacrifice—thereby restoring the world, but ensuring the annihilation of the vampire race—or the alternative of destroying the Pillars to rule over the world in its miasmatic state, Kain opts for the latter choice, embracing vampirism as a blessing as the Pillars collapse.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) {{split the}} empire into {{separately}} administered {{eastern and western}} halves in 286; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers, as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other. In 330, {{after a period of}} civil war, Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital, Constantinople. Diocletian's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy, reformed taxation, and strengthened the army, which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing: excessive taxation, a declining birthrate, and pressures on its frontiers, among others. Civil war between rival emperors became common {{in the middle of the}} 4th century, diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach. For much of the 4th century, Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period, with a widening gulf between the rich and poor, and a decline in the <b>vitality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller towns.

40|$|Objectives: Fatigue is {{typically}} associated with MS, but recent studies {{suggest that it is}} also a problem for patients with stroke. While a direct comparison of fatigue in e. g. Stroke and MS is desirable, it is presently not easily possible because of different definitions and assessment tools used for the two conditions. In the present study we therefore assessed fatigue in Stroke and MS using a generic, not disease-specific instrument to allow transdiagnostic comparison. Method: 137 patients with MS and 102 patients with chronic stroke completed the SF- 36, a generic questionnaire assessing health related quality of life. Fatigue was measured through <b>the</b> <b>vitality</b> scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SF- 36. <b>The</b> <b>vitality</b> scale consists <b>of</b> two positive items (lot of energy, full of life) and two negative ones (worn out, tired). The two negative ones were scaled in reverse order. The vitality scale has been recommended as reciprocal index of fatigue. Results: Normalized vitality scores in MS (35. 3) and stroke (42. 1) were clearly lower than published reference values from the SF- 36 in age-matched healthy controls. <b>The</b> sum score <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vitality</b> items was lower in MS than in stroke patients. This difference could not be explained by age, gender or the Physical Functioning Scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SF- 36. Both patient groups showed no positive correlation between fatigue and physical functioning. Fatigue – as determined with <b>the</b> <b>vitality</b> scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SF- 36 - correlated with the estimated working capacity in MS patients, but not in stroke patients. Conclusions: These findings confirm high fatigue in MS and stroke patients with higher values in MS. Fatigue has a higher impact on working capacity in MS than in stroke. Fatigue in both patient groups is not a direct consequent <b>of</b> physical functioning/impairment. <b>Vitality</b> score <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SF- 36 is a suitable transdiagnostic measure for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> fatigue in stroke and MS...|$|R
