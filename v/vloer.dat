50|$|Joling & Gordon Over de <b>Vloer</b> is a {{television}} program Gerard Joling made with singer Gordon in 2005. There are 3 seasons {{of the series}} which contained the twosome during work and having a laugh.|$|E
50|$|Plafond over de <b>vloer</b> is a Dutch {{television}} show in nine episodes, aired in 1986 by the VPRO and {{written and directed}} by Wim T. Schippers. It derives from the radio show Ronflonflon, and its main character is that show's host, Jacques Plafond.|$|E
50|$|Jacques Plafond, {{besides being}} the show's host, was {{featured}} in many of Schippers' television shows and other productions, such as Opzoek naar Yolanda (1984, scheduled to run concurrently with Ronflonflon) and Plafond over de <b>vloer</b> (1986, a television show based on the radio show).|$|E
5000|$|As ons nou hier in die saal af 'n ry pale sou plant, tien pale, om die laaste tien jaar voor te stel, en aan elke paal 'n merk sou maak op 'n hoogte van die <b>vloer</b> af ooreenkomende met die betreklike skryfgebruik van Afrikaans in die respektiewe jaartal, en 'n streep deur die merke trek van die eerste af hier naby die <b>vloer</b> tot by die laaste daar anderkant teen die solder, dan sou die streep 'n snelstygende boog beskryf, nie net vinnig opgaande nie, maar opgaande na 'n vinnig vermeerderende rede. Laat ons nou in ons verbeelding die boog verleng vir die tien komende jare van nou af. Sien u menere waar die punt sal wees, daar buite in die bloue lug hoog oor Bloemfontein, in die jaar 1924. - C.J. Langenhoven ...|$|E
50|$|Arjen de Vreede (born 26 April 1962), {{known by}} his stage name DJ DNA, is a Dutch DJ and producer. At age seventeen, he {{started as a}} DJ, and became {{a pioneer in the}} Dutch music scene playing hiphop, house, acid house and techno in renowned Dutch clubs such as the Roxy and the Vrije <b>Vloer.</b> He also co-founded the Urban Dance Squad.|$|E
5000|$|Born in Leiden, Tonnus Oosterhoff {{spent most}} {{of life in the}} Dutch {{province}} of Groningen. He studied Dutch literature and linguistics at the University of Groningen. Before publishing literary work, he wrote several anonymous stories for the magazine Mijn Geheim. One of them was republished in his later collection of short stories Dans zonder <b>vloer</b> ("Dance without floor", 2003) with an alternate [...] "less unrealistic" [...] happy end.|$|E
50|$|In the Netherlands, {{the show}} Joling & Gordon over de <b>vloer</b> ("Joling & Gordon in the house") {{was said to}} be {{inspired}} by The Simple Life, but instead of two blonde rich girls the show followed two famous gay singers/hosts: Gerard Joling (Popstars, Shownieuws, Hole in the Wall) and Gordon (Idols, X Factor, Singing Bee). The show became a huge success on Talpa and later on RTL 5, but due to conflicts between the two divas, Gordon decided to make his own reality show, Gillend Naar Huis ("Back Home ASAP").|$|E
50|$|Not all {{programmes}} flopped on Talpa. The controversial show Joling & Gordon over de <b>Vloer</b> (Joling and Gordon {{about the}} house, hosted by openly gay singers Gordon Heuckeroth and Gerard Joling) scored 1.2 million viewers. Other major hits were comedy drama series Gooische Vrouwen (Women from 't Gooi, 1.6 million viewers) and Voetbalvrouwen, the Dutch version of Footballers' Wives (1.4 million viewers). Expeditie Robinson, Miljoenenjacht and Postcodeloterij Miljoenenjacht (1.5 million viewers) and 1 vs. 100 were {{also among the}} reasonably scoring shows, albeit with much smaller audiences than at the former broadcaster.|$|E
50|$|Van Mechelen's first {{on-screen}} {{performance in}} a Schippers show was in Barend is weer bezig, in the 1974 Christmas special Waar heb dat nou weer voor nodig. He also appeared in De lachende scheerkwast (1981 - 1982), Opzoek naar Yolanda (1984), Plafond over de <b>vloer</b> (1986), and We zijn weer thuis (1989 - 1994), shows for which he also was the composer and musical director. He appeared on stage in 1992 in a musical comedy, Tataboulou/In volle vaart, with Neel van der Elst, who played Etna Vesuvia in the Schippers radio show Ronflonflon, and in 1995 in Alleen (met z'n vieren).|$|E
5000|$|The show's {{plot was}} {{intentionally}} unclear, though one plot line involved {{the head of}} a [...] "school with the bible", Rein Schaambergen, whose marriage is threatened when he meets singer Ingrid Gortebroek in the bar [...] "The Old Dick" [...] and decides to produce a record for her. De lachende scheerkwast {{turned out to be a}} play written by writer Jacques Plafond (played by Schippers), and the show itself was a chaotic affair ("anarchist...always derailing") with more emphasis on absurdist, comical scenes and linguistic jokery than on story development. It was a prequel of sorts to Schippers' later radio show Ronflonflon (1984-1991) and his television shows Opzoek naar Yolanda (1984), Plafond over de <b>vloer</b> (1986), and We zijn weer thuis (1989-1994).|$|E
50|$|Gordon is, {{besides being}} a singer and performer, also a radio and {{television}} personality - and openly bisexual. After a few stand ins on the Dutch radio station Radio 538 he got his own show on the station. Later {{he moved to the}} radio station Noordzee FM. On television, Gordon was the host of shows like Gordon's Late Nicht Show (in this context nicht means queer) and Gordon's Life Style. Starting in August 2005, Gordon appeared on the television channel Tien, a channel set up by John de Mol. Together with his colleague Gerard Joling he did the show Joling & Gordon over de <b>vloer,</b> where the two singers visited several very different locations, such as a pig farm, for three days. They were confronted with totally different lifestyles, and were asked to join in and work there for a couple of days. This show was mostly characterized by the laughter on just about anything by Gordon and Joling. The show was very popular, and scored high rankings. Gordon also appeared in the show Thuis and in Vijf tegen Vijf. Thuis was a based on The View, but was stopped after only two months, due to bad viewer rankings.|$|E
5000|$|Urban Dance Squad {{first got}} {{together}} in 1986, at a jam session in De Vrije <b>Vloer,</b> {{a club in}} Utrecht, a jam {{which resulted in the}} first Dutch rock band with a rapper (they borrowed the name from Parliament-Funkadelic's Urban Dancefloor Guerillas); a song, [...] "Struggle for Jive"; and the blending of white and black music in the Netherlands, {{at the same time that}} Fishbone, Living Colour, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers were doing the same in the United States. The band recorded its first album, Mental Floss for the Globe, in Brussels in 1989 (produced by Jean-Marie Aerts, of TC Matic), and came to instant success. It won an Edison Award, and the single [...] "Deeper Shade of Soul" [...] was a hit in Europe, and in the United States, where it charted at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. Two more singles were released from the album, and Urban Dance Squad toured the US in 1991, opening for Living Colour--The Pittsburgh Press described their music as [...] "refried Zeppelin riffs and neo-Hendrix guitar solos complete with sound effects and old soul records to produce an exceedingly loud, densely packed, dissonant garage-rock stew." [...] The UDS had always been a volatile unit with the band members frequently arguing, and this came to a head while touring as the opening act for U2, after the release of Life 'n Perspectives of a Genuine Crossover, when DJ DNA quit abruptly.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The ergonomically ideal {{computer}} lab for {{the enhancement of}} learner security Ergonomics is the discipline which focuses {{on the impact of}} human needs and capabilities on the design of technological systems for the purpose of promoting harmonious cooperation between humankind and technology. In computer studies, it studies the interaction between pupils and the computer environment in order to promote learner well-being. The future health and learning opportunities of learners are at risk if computer skills are not mastered in a safe and healthy environment. Risks associated with computers have increased because of the increased time young people spend with their computers both at school and for recreation. The use of computers as teaching aids has also increased. The {{purpose of this article is}} to report on research that was conducted in {{computer lab}}s in high schools in South Africa about the establishment of an ideal ergonomic environment in order to assure optimal learner security in the computer labs. Caring supervision is a prerequisite for optimal teaching and learning. Security expresses itself in a classroom environment in terms of pedagogical outcomes as well as the physical security and well-being of the pupil. The provision of security in the computer lab is not restricted to the present; it is also prospective in that it is aimed at the future security and health of the pupils. A computer environment that does not comply with ergonomic norms could harbour a number of health risks for students, including muscular-skeletal injuries due to an incorrect posture, also headaches caused by conditions such as a glaring screen or insufficient lighting. Pupils could also become victims of safety hazards such as electrical shorts and fires caused by electric cables lying on the floor, and faulty appliances. There are a number of guidelines available with respect to the design of a computer lab, amongst others concerning equipment and furniture, the support of wrists, the use of the mouse, keyboard, non-reflecting screens, the height of the screen, the adjustability of apparatus, lighting, a good view of the projector screen and white board, the document stand, and the size of the computer stand. An empirical survey was done to establish to what degree computer labs indeed complied with the guidelines and general expectations. A qualitative interpretivistic design was used. The study population (n= 8) consisted of all the Computer Application Technology teachers of high schools in one of the regions of the North-West Province of South Africa. Observations were recorded in all 8 of the schools. Use was made of an observation schedule. In addition to this, several photos were taken to confirm what had been observed. The observations were further confirmed by means of interviews with the teachers based on semi-structured questions. Categories of responses and observations were created on the basis of coding. The same was done with respect to the obstacles encountered by the respondents to change their computer rooms into ergonomically safe places. It was found that none of the computer science labs visited fully complied with the guidelines as stipulated above. Some of them had uneven floors, in others papers were lying around and cables ran over the floors creating electrical hazards, none had wrist support for using the mouse or the keyboard, only three had mouse pads but room to use the mouse was limited, no computer screens were adjustable, most computer stands were too small to place a book onto it, no desk could be adjusted, only two labs had document stands but they were incorrectly placed with respect to the rest of the apparatus, there were no upholstered chairs, no chair provided lower back support, none had footrests, and most did not provide for the addition of such a rest. In most rooms the lighting was inadequate or reflected from the screens, in some it was difficult to see on the data projector screen because of the lighting, the artificial lighting in one room was poor, and in no room any ergonomic awareness posters appeared on the walls. Most computer labs fortunately had recently serviced fire distinguishers. Teachers identified the following as obstacles to overcome before their labs would be ergonomically up to the required standard: ignorance on the part of the teachers, absence of guidelines with respect to safety and health, a shortage of money and the attitudes of all involved. They also had to contend with the possibility of fire and other health hazards such as uneven floors and untidy rooms. In addition to this, they were not aware of their liability due to neglect, and of the fact that the computer labs were actually contributing to the insecurity of their learners in terms of health problems. Teachers, schools and departments of education should take a number of urgent steps, the most simple of which is to resort to creative methods such as using pillows on chairs and books under screens. Schools should immediately draft safety and health guidelines for computer labs, and the ergonomic design of such rooms should enjoy high priority from departments of education. Teachers and principals should also not only be made aware of the need for ergonomically welldesigned classrooms, but should indeed receive in-service training in this regard. OPSOMMING Indien rekenaarlokale in skole nie aan die eise van ergonomiese geborgenheid voldoen nie, kan dit tot groot nadeel strek vir almal wat daarby betrokke is. Vir die leerders kan dit algemene gesondheidsrisko’s soos skeletale afwykings, hoofpyn en sigprobleme inhou, wat dikwels eers in die leerders se volwasse jare begin realiseer. Daarbenewens kan hierdie gesondheidsprobleme wat uit sulke swak ontwerpte lokale voortspruit, tot gevoelens van onsekerheid en niegeborgenheid by die leerlinge aanleiding gee. Vir die betrokke onderwysers en die skool as sorgsame toesighouers van die leerders, kan ’n verwyt van nalatigheid en die moontlikheid van aanspreeklikheid vir skadevergoeding ontstaan. In ŉ kwalitatiewe interpretivistiese studie by al die hoërskole met rekenaarlokale in een bepaalde streek in die Noordwes-provinsie, het dit aan die lig gekom dat nie een van hulle ergonomies korrek ontwerp en bestuur is nie. Voorstelle word gemaak vir die dringende regstelling van hierdie probleem. Die eerste stap is om goedkoop en voor die hand liggende maatreëls toe te pas, deur byvoorbeeld net ŉ kussing op ŉ stoel te plaas, die rekenaarskerm op ŉ paar ou boeke te plaas om dit op te lig, kabels en alle papier wat op die <b>vloer</b> lê en ’n brandgevaar kan veroorsaak, te verwyder. Van die ander aanbevelings wat gemaak word, behels groter betrokkenheid vanaf die kant van die provinsiale onderwysdepartement, meer fondse vir die korrekte inrigting van lokale en groter bewusmaking by onderwysers, skoolhoofde en leerders.
