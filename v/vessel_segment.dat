40|$|In this thesis, two vessel {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} introduced {{in order to}} produce more accurate vesselness measures and vessel direction estimations that are less subject to local intensity abnormalities. Vessel enhancement using local line integrals (VE-LLI) is first proposed which embeds a vessel model by regarding a <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> as a straight line. It uses the second order information of the local line integrals. Quantities similar to eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix are produced, which can be substituted in any existing Hessian-based enhancement methods. A variational optimization (VO) is then introduced to improve qualities of vesselness measures. A more generic curve model is embedded to model vessels and a variational framework is used to locate the possible <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> to which a point belongs. Features on the <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> are then used to generate an optimized vesselness measure. Experiments are conduced on 2 D retinal images. It is experimentally shown that VE-LLI produces more accurate vessel direction estimations than conventional Hessian-based methods. Both VE-LLI and VO can give more accurate vesselness measures...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the flow}} {{resistance}} {{of a single}} <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> is easy to compute, the equivalent resistance {{of a network of}} vessel segments or the entire vasculature of an organ is difficult to determine in an analytic form. Here, we propose what we believe is a novel resistance scaling law for a vascular tree (i. e., the resistance of a <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> scales with the equivalent resistance of the corresponding distal tree). The formulation can be written as (Rs/Rc) ∝(Ls/Lc) (where Rs and Ls are the resistance and length of a <b>vessel</b> <b>segment,</b> respectively, and Rc and Lc are the equivalent resistance and total length of the corresponding distal tree, respectively), which was validated for the coronary vascular systems of the heart. The scaling law was also shown to apply to the vascular systems of the lung, mesentery, muscle, eye, and so on. The novel resistance scaling law, coupled with the 3 / 4 -power scaling law for metabolic rates, can predict several structure-function relations of vascular trees, albeit with a different exponent. In particular, the self-similar nature of the scaling law may serve as a diagnostic tool with the help of noninvasive imaging modalities...|$|E

This research quantifies {{the impact of the}} luminal proteoglycan syndecan as a potential mechanosensor, and the subendothelial matrix as the site of mechanotransduction, in maintaining flow-dependent vasodilatation in healthy and atherosclerotic human coronary arteries. We measured the development of membrane potential and tension in non-atherosclerotic and atherosclerotic segments of human coronary arteries under flow rates of between 5 and 100 ml/min and compared these with the development in de-endothelialised and trypsinised non-atherosclerotic and atherosclerotic segments. Trypsinisation lead to the cleavage of the ectodomain of the luminal proteoglycan syndecan {{as well as to the}} interruption of matrix integrity. The membrane potential was measured intermittently with glass electrodes; vascular wall tension was measured continuously by mounting the segment in the force transduction unit of a flow chamber supplied with aerated, heated Krebs solution at regularly increased flow rates. Untreated non-atherosclerotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> showed a marked flow-dependent hyperpolarisation and a relaxation of 0. 512 g. In de-endothelialised non-atherosclerotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segments,</b> membrane potential and tension were higher at baseline and decreased less under flow, with a net relaxation of 0. 280. Trypsinised non-atherosclerotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> had still higher membrane potential and tension at baseline and showed a marked flow-dependent depolarisation and contraction of 0. 391 g. In untreated atherosclerotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segments,</b> baseline values for membrane potential and tension were higher than in healthy vessel segments; under flow conditions, these segments exhibited a stunted hyperpolarisation and relaxation at low flow rates, with subsequent depolarisation and contraction under higher flow rates (net relaxation 0. 102 g). De-endothelialised atherosclerotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> had higher baseline values than de-endothelialised non-atherosclerotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> and showed a minimal hyperpolarisation after initial depolarisation as well as a minimal relaxation (0. 070 g). Trypsinised atherosclerotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> had a significantly lower baseline membrane potential and tension than untreated atherosclerotic as well as trypsinised non-atherosclerotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> and showed a marked flow-dependent relaxation (0. 612). Based on these values, we calculated the contribution of the luminal flow-sensor syndecan and the subendothelial matrix to overall vasomotion to be 47 % vs. 11 % at flow rates of 5 ml/min, 65 % vs. 25 % at 20 ml/min, 65 % vs. 38 % at 40 ml/min, and 28 % vs. 72 % at 100 ml/min in non-atherosclerotic vessels. In atherosclerotic vessels, endothelium-induced contraction was 18 % at 20 ml/min rising to 43, 8 % at 100 ml/min, with the matrix partly compensating this with a relaxation of 13 % at 5 ml/min and 26 % to 27 % between 20 and 100 ml/min (100 % = 0. 461 g, maximal net relaxation of non-atherosclerotic, intact <b>vessel</b> <b>segments)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Peripheral {{resistance}} was {{examined in the}} microcirculat ion of the rat cremaster muscle using a network-conserved parameter, power dissipation. Previous studies of peripheral resistance used network-sensitive parameters, and their interpretation is limited by tacit assumptions about {{the structure of the}} peripheral vasculature. Power dissipation is directly linked to the resistive process, providing a measure of resistance based on the actual hemodynamics of the network. The dissipation parameter was quantified with the usual vascular parameters of velocity and <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> length; 991 segment lengths were measured in 12 normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats and 16 spontaneously hypertensive rats. Arterial power dissipation was significantly elevated over a wide range of vessel segments; blood flow ranged from 0. 08 to 80 nl/sec. Since the largest vessels showed the greatest power dissipation, the organ resistance elevation seen in hypertension in the cremaster apparently is mediat-ed by the larger vessels in the high flow range. <b>Vessel</b> <b>segment</b> length and number of dissipative vessels were unchanged. The increase in power dissipation was due to a network-averaged reduction in mean vessel diameter. Power dissipation also increased significantly in the fastest flowing venous microves-sels (> 25 nl/sec), also due to a reduction in <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> diameter.

40|$|AbstractWhether exercise-induced {{vasoconstriction}} {{of coronary}} artery stenoses is modified {{by the administration}} of calcium antagonists was examined in 14 patients with classic angina pectoris. In this group the effect of intracoronary diltiazem (2 to 3 mg) on luminal area was evaluated in normal and stenotic segments of epicardial coronary arteries during symptom-limited supine exercise. The luminal area of a normal and a stenotic coronary artery segment was determined by quantitative coronary arteriography with a computer-assisted system. Patients were studied at rest, 6 min after 2 to 3 mg of intracoronary diltiazem, during supine bicycle exercise (96 W) and 5 min after sublingual administration of 1. 6 mg nitroglycerin. Heart rate, mean pulmonary and aortic pressure {{as well as the}} percent change of both normal and stenotic luminal area were determined. Intracoronary administration of diltiazem was associated with mild dilation of both normal (19 %, p < 0. 01) and stenotic coronary luminal area (11 %, p < 0. 05). During subsequent exercise, luminal area of the stenotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> increased by 23 % (p < 0. 001) and that of the normal <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> by 24 % (p < 0. 001), whereas in a previously reported control group, luminal area of the stenotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> decreased by 29 % during exercise. After sublingual administration of nitroglycerin, the luminal area of both the normal and the stenotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> increased further by 19 % (p < 0. 01) and 22 % (p < 0. 01), respectively, compared with the values after intracoronary administration of diltiazem. Thus, intracoronary administration of diltiazem prevents exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenotic coronary arteries, suggesting a direct vasodilating effect on the coronary artery. Diltiazem and nitroglycerin seem to have an additive effect on coronary vasodilation of stenotic vessel segments probably as a result of restoration of endothelial function of the diseased coronary vessel by diltiazem...|$|E
40|$|To support ophthalmologists {{in their}} routine and enable the {{quantitative}} assessment of vascular changes in color fundus photographs a multi-resolution approach was developed which segments the vessel tree efficiently and precisely in digital images of the retina. The algorithm starts at seed points, found in a preprocessing step and then follows the vessel, iteratively adjusting {{the direction of the}} search, and finding the center line of the vessels. As an addition, vessel branches and crossings are detected and stored in detailed lists. Every iteration of the Directional Smoothing Based (DSB) tracking process starts at a given point {{in the middle of a}} vessel. First rectangular windows for several directions in a neighborhood of this point are smoothed in the assumed direction of the vessel. The window, that results in the best contrast is then said to have the true direction of the vessel. The center point is moved into that direction 1 / 8 th of the vessel width, and the algorithm continues with the next iteration.

40|$|Evaluation {{of blood}} supply of {{different}} organs relies on labeling blood with a suitable tracer. The tracer kinetics is linear: Tracer concentration at an observation {{site is a}} linear response to an input somewhere upstream the arterial flow. The corresponding impulse response functions are currently treated empirically without incorporating the relation to the vascular morphology of an organ. In this work we address this relation for the first time. We demonstrate that {{the form of the}} response function in the entire arterial tree is reduced to that of individual <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> under approximation of good blood mixing at vessel bifurcations. The resulting expression simplifies significantly when the geometric scaling of the vascular tree is taken into account. This suggests a new way to access the vascular morphology in vivo using experimentally determined response functions. However, it is an ill-posed inverse problem as demonstrated by an example using measured arterial spin labeling in large brain arteries. We further analyze transport in individual <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> and demonstrate that experimentally accessible tracer concentration in <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> depends on the measurement principle. Explicit expressions for the response functions are obtained for the major middle part of the arterial tree in which the blood flow in individual <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> can be treated as laminar.

40|$|Automatic {{coronary}} artery centerline extraction from 3 D CT Angiography (CTA) has significant clinical importance for diagnosis of atherosclerotic heart disease. The focus of past literature {{is dominated by}} segmenting the complete {{coronary artery}} system as trees by computer. Though the labeling of different vessel branches (defined by their medical semantics) is much needed clinically, this task has been performed manually. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical machine learning approach to tackle the problem of tubular structure parsing in medical imaging. It has a progressive threetiered classification process at volumetric voxel level, <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> level, and inter-segment level. Generative models are employed to project from low-level, ambiguous data to class-conditional probabilities; and discriminative classifiers are trained on the upper-level structural patterns of probabilities to label and parse the vessel segments.

BACKGROUND. Coronary vasomotion {{plays an important role in}} the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia. METHODS. Twenty-nine patients with coronary artery disease were studied at rest and during bicycle exercise with the use of biplane quantitative coronary angiography. Twelve patients without pretreatment (group 1) served as control subjects. Seventeen patients (group 2) received nicardipine, either 0. 2 mg by intracoronary injection (n = 9) or 2. 5 mg intravenously (n = 8) before exercise. RESULTS. In the control group there was exercise-induced vasoconstriction (- 29 %, p < 0. 001) of the stenotic segment but coronary vasodilation (+ 22 %, p < 0. 05) of the normal <b>vessel</b> <b>segment.</b> In group 2, nicardipine induced coronary vasodilation of both the normal (+ 16 %, p < 0. 001) and the stenotic <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> (+ 35 %). During subsequent exercise there was some additional vasodilation of normal (+ 4 %, p = NS) and stenotic arteries (+ 5 %, p = NS).

BackgroundSirolimus-eluting stents have been shown to markedly reduce the incidence of angiographic and clinical restenosis. However, long-term effects of sirolimus on endothelial function are unknown. MethodsCoronary vasomotion was evaluated with biplane quantitative coronary angiography at rest and during supine bicycle exercise in 25 patients with coronary artery disease. Eleven patients were treated with a bare-metal stent (BMS) (control group) and 14 patients underwent SES implantation (sirolimus group) for de novo coronary artery lesions. Both groups were studied 6 ± 1 month after the intervention. Minimal luminal diameter; stent diameter; and proximal, distal, and reference vessel diameter were determined. ResultsThe reference vessel showed exercise-induced vasodilation (+ 13 ± 4 %) in both groups. Vasomotion within the stented <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> was abolished. In controls, the adjacent segments proximal and distal to the stent showed exercise-induced vasodilation (+ 15 ± 3 % and + 17 ± 4 %, respectively). In contrast, there was exercise-induced vasoconstriction of the proximal and distal <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> adjacent to SESs (− 12 ± 4 % and − 15 ± 6 %, respectively; p < 0. 001 vs. corresponding segments of controls).

Myocardial bridge (MB) is rare congenital anomaly of coronary arteries, characterized by systolic compression of the <b>vessel</b> <b>segment.</b> In this article, {{we report on}} {{a case of the}} coexistence of CAE and MB in the same segment of left anterior descending artery (LAD) in a 82 year old patient with acute coronary syndrome. </p...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{studied the}} {{efficacy}} of intracoronary brachytherapy (ICB) after successful coronary stenting in diabetic patients with de novo lesions. BackgroundIntracoronary brachytherapy has proven effective in preventing recurrences in patients with in-stent restenosis. However, the role of ICB {{for the treatment of}} de novo coronary stenoses remains controversial. MethodsNinety-two patients were randomized to either ICB or no radiation after stenting. Primary end points were in-stent mean neointimal area (primary end point of efficacy) and minimal luminal area of the entire <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> (primary end point of effectiveness), as assessed by intravascular ultrasound at six-month follow-up. Quantitative coronary angiography analysis was performed at the target, injured, irradiated, and entire vessel segments. ResultsAt follow-up, the in-stent mean neointimal area was 52 % smaller in the ICB group (p < 0. 0001). However, {{there was no difference in}} the minimal luminal area of the <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> (4. 5 ± 2. 4 mm 2 vs. 4. 4 ± 2. 1 mm 2). Restenosis rates increased progressively by the analyzed segment in the ICB group: target (7. 1 % vs. 20. 9 %, p = 0. 07), injured (9. 5 % vs. 20. 9 %, p = NS), irradiated (14. 3 % vs. 20. 9 %, p = NS), and <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> (23. 8 % vs. 25. 6 %, p = NS). At one year, 1 cardiac death, 6 myocardial infarctions (MIs) (3 due to late stent thrombosis), and 10 target vessel revascularizations (TVRs) (6 due to the edge effect) occurred in the ICB group, whereas in the nonradiation group, there were 11 TVRs and no deaths or MIs. ConclusionsIntracoronary brachytherapy significantly inhibited in-stent neointimal hyperplasia after stenting in diabetic patients. However, clinically this was counteracted by the occurrence of the edge effect and late stent thrombosis...|$|E
30|$|In 2012, Savard et al. [22] {{proposed}} a simplified classification {{based only on}} two angiographic cervico-encephalic subtypes of FMD: the multifocal (presence of ≥ 2 stenoses on a given <b>vessel</b> <b>segment</b> {{with or without the}} typical string-of-beads appearance) and unifocal (presence of a single focal or tubular stenosis) types. Interestingly, Savard et al. showed significant clinical differences depending on the subtype such as median age at diagnosis of FMD, hypertension, sex distribution, initial blood pressure and current smoking.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} vasomotion of {{epicardial}} coronary arteries during exercise and tested the hypotheses that abnormal vasoconstriction {{is related to}} the presence of atherosclerosis and may be related to endothelial dilator dysfunction. During cardiac catheterization quantitative coronary angiography was performed in 21 patients during supine bicycle exercise. 21 of 28 smooth, angiographically normal <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> dilated (14. 0 +/- 1. 8 %) during exercise; four smooth segments did not change whereas only three constricted. In contrast, 15 of 16 <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> with irregularities constricted in response to exercise (17. 0 +/- 0. 1 %) with only one segment dilating. All 10 stenotic segments constricted to exercise (23 +/- 4 %). Six patients also received intracoronary acetylcholine before exercise to test endothelium-dependent dilator function. In five of six patients all nine <b>vessel</b> <b>segments</b> showed the same directional response to acetylcholine and exercise. Three irregular and two stenotic segments constricted with acetylcholine (51 +/- 21 %) and exercise (9. 0 +/- 0. 6 %). In contrast, four smooth segments dilated to acetylcholine (19 +/- 6 %) and exercise (9 +/- 1 %). Both exercise and acetylcholine generally dilated smooth but constricted irregular and stenosed coronary segments. It appears likely that atherosclerosis {{plays an important role in}} the abnormal vasomotion of diseased coronary arteries during exercise and the pattern of abnormality suggests impairment of vasodilator function...|$|R
