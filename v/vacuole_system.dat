40|$|Amoebae of the {{eukaryotic}} microorganism Dictyostelium discoideum {{were found}} to contain an interconnected array of tubules and cisternae whose membranes were studded with 15 -nm-diameter "pegs. " Comparison of the ultrastructure and freeze-fracture behavior of these pegs with similar structures found in other cells and tissues {{indicated that they were}} the head domains of vacuolar-type proton pumps. Supporting this identification, the pegs were observed to decorate and clump when broken amoebae were exposed to an antiserum against the B subunit of mammalian vacuolar H(+) -ATPase. The appearance of the peg-rich cisternae in quick-frozen amoebae depended on their osmotic environment: under hyperosmotic conditions, the cisternae were flat with many narrow tubular extensions, while under hypo-osmotic conditions the cisternae ranged from bulbous to spherical. In all cases, however, their contents deep etched like pure water. These properties indicated that the interconnected tubules and cisternae comprise the contractile <b>vacuole</b> <b>system</b> of Dictyostelium. Earlier studies had demonstrated that contractile vacuole membranes in Dictyostelium are extremely rich in calmodulin (Zhu, Q., and M. Clarke, 1992, J. Cell Biol. 118 : 347 - 358). Light microscopic immunofluorescence confirmed that antibodies against the vacuolar proton pump colocalized with anti-calmodulin antibodies on these organelles. Time-lapse video recording of living amoebae imaged by interference-reflection microscopy, or by fluorescence microscopy after staining contractile vacuole membranes with potential-sensitive styryl dyes, revealed the extent and dynamic interrelationship of the cisternal and tubular elements in Dictyostelium's contractile <b>vacuole</b> <b>system.</b> The high density of proton pumps throughout its membranes suggests that the generation of a proton gradient is likely to be an important factor in the mechanism of fluid accumulation by contractile vacuoles...|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of five predicted proteins (dP 2 XA-E) with homology to vertebrate P 2 X receptors in Dictyostelium discoideum proved {{a unique opportunity}} to explore purinergic receptor function in a simple unicellular eukaryote from outside the animal kingdom. dP 2 XE was shown to be expressed as a trimer and trafficked to the cell surface in Xenopus oocytes. However, no currents were detected to extracellularly applied ligands. This lack of function was potentially due to inaccurate post-translational modifications since dP 2 XE expressed in oocytes and D. discoideum displayed different molecular weights. Unexpectedly for a potential ligand-gated ion channel, dP 2 XE-eGFP displayed a solely intracellular distribution in D. discoideum, localising to the endolysosomal and contractile <b>vacuole</b> <b>systems.</b> Ablation of the p 2 xE gene by homologous recombination revealed a role for dP 2 XE in axenic growth in suspension, associated with a modest defect in cytokinesis, and a potential involvement in the calcium signalling and homeostasis functions of the contractile vacuole. Both this distribution and disruption phenotype were mirrored for p 2 xA. The existence of purinergic signalling in D. discoideum was demonstrated by utilising an apoaequorin expressing strain to show that extracellular ATP and ADP evoked increases in intracellular Caˆ 2,+. Indicative of P 2 X receptor activation, responses were rapid and transient, required extracellular Caˆ 2,+, inhibited by Gdˆ 3,+, modified by extracellular pH and remained unaffected by deletion of either the single heterotrimeric Gβ or iplA genes. ATP/ADP responses were unaffected by ablation of either the p 2 xA or p 2 xE genes leaving dP 2 XB-D as potential candidates. Inhibition of the large P 2 X-like response with Znˆ 2,+ revealed the presence of a much smaller response with a slower time course indicating that P 2 Y-like receptors may also be present. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates that D. discoideum possesses cell surface purinergic receptors for extracellular ATP/ADP and extends our knowledge of the intracellular role of purinergic signalling in this organism.

40|$|The {{contractile}} <b>vacuole</b> (CV) <b>system</b> is the osmoregulatory organelle {{required for}} survival for many free-living cells under hypotonic conditions. We identified a new CV regulator, Disgorgin, a TBC-domain-containing protein, which translocates to the CV membrane at the late stage of CV charging and regulates CV–plasma membrane fusion and discharging. disgorgin− cells produce large CVs due to impaired CV–plasma membrane fusion. Disgorgin {{is a specific}} GAP for Rab 8 A-GTP, which also localizes to the CV and whose hydrolysis is required for discharging. We demonstrate that Drainin, a previously identified TBC-domain-containing protein, lies upstream from Disgorgin in this pathway. Unlike Disgorgin, Drainin lacks GAP activity but functions as a Rab 11 A effector. The BEACH family proteins LvsA and LvsD were identified in a suppressor/enhancer screen of the disgorgin− large CV phenotype and demonstrated to have distinct functions in regulating CV formation.

To elucidate the physiological role of this multifunctional protein, we characterized the enzymatic activity of recombinant DRG fragments in vitro, created DRG-null cells, {{and studied the}} function of the protein in vivo by analysing the phenotypic changes displayed by DRG-depleted cells and DRG-null cells complemented with DRG or DRG fragments. Our results show that DRG-GEF modulates F-actin dynamics and cAMP-induced F-actin formation via Rac 1 -dependent signalling pathways. DRG’s RacE-GAP activity is required for proper cytokinesis to occur. Additionally, we provide evidence that the specificity of DRG is not limited to members of the Rho family of small GTPases.

40|$|Rab GTPases {{play key}} {{roles in the}} delivery, docking and fusion of {{intracellular}} vesicles. However, the mechanism by which spatial and temporal regulation of Rab GTPase activity is controlled is poorly understood. Here we describe a mechanism by which localized calcium release through a vesicular ion channel controls Rab GTPase activity. We show that activation of P 2 XA, an intracellular ion channel localized to the Dictyostelium discoideum contractile <b>vacuole</b> <b>system,</b> results in calcium efflux required for downregulation of Rab 11 a activity and efficient vacuole fusion. Vacuole fusion and Rab 11 a downregulation require the activity of CnrF, an EF hand containing Rab GAP found in a complex with Rab 11 a and P 2 XA. CnrF Rab GAP activity to Rab 11 a is enhanced {{by the presence of}} calcium and the EF-hand domain. These findings suggest that P 2 XA activation results in vacuolar calcium release, which triggers activation of CnrF Rab GAP activity and subsequent downregulation of Rab 11 a to allow vacuole fusion...|$|E

The cytoplasmic transformations of the generative cell included the elimination of plastids, {{increase in the number}} of mitochondria, assumption of a spindle shape with the aid of microtubules and the characteristic development of the <b>vacuole</b> <b>system</b> with the formation of so-called colored bodies. The cytoplasmic transformations of the generative cell encompassed changes in the plastids, which began to accumulate starch soon after the cell was formed, then released it shortly before anthesis, an {{increase in the number of}} mitochondria and an increase in the number of highly active dictyosomes just before anthesis. Changes in the structure of the border region between the differentiating pollen cells were associated mainly with the periodical appearance of a callose wall and the presence of lysosome-like bodies in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell surrounding the generative cell. They arose soon after the disappearance of the callose wall and disappeared shortly before anthesis...|$|E

T 3 S systems of E. coli inject a cocktail of proteins into epithelial cells that enables bacterial attachment and promotes longer-term colonization in the animal. Here, we review recent progress {{in our understanding of}} the regulation of T 3 S in EHEC, focusing on the induction and assembly of the T 3 S system, the co-ordination of effector protein expression, and the timing of effector protein export through the apparatus. Strain variation is often associated with differences in bacteriophages encoding the production of Shiga toxin and in multiple cryptic prophage elements that can encode effector proteins and T 3 S regulators. It is evident that this repertoire of phage-related sequences results in the different levels of T 3 S demonstrated between strains, with implications for EHEC epidemiology and strain evolution...|$|R

This system acts as an osmoregulatory organelle in freshwater amoebae and protozoa.

The tubular channels are associated with the cortical actin network and are capable of moving and fusing. The contractile vacuole complex is separate from vesicles of the endosomal pathway and preserves its identity in a dispersed state during cell division. We outline techniques to visualize the contractile <b>vacuole</b> <b>system</b> by electron and light microscopy. Emphasis is placed on GFP-fusion proteins that allow visualization of the dynamics of the contractile vacuole network in living cells.

We {{identified two}} RhoGDI homologues in Dictyostelium. GDI 1 shares 51 – 58 % similarity to RhoGDIs from diverse species. GDI 2 is more divergent (40 – 44 % similarity) and lacks the N-terminal regulatory arm characteristic for RhoGDI proteins. Both are cytosolic proteins {{and do not}} relocalize upon reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Using a two-hybrid approach, we identified Rac 1 a/ 1 b/ 1 c, RacB, RacC and RacE as interacting partners for GDI 1. Cells lacking GDI 1 are multinucleate, grow slowly and display a moderate pinocytosis defect, but rates of phagocytosis are unaffected. Mutant cells present prominent actin-rich protrusions, and large vacuoles that are continuous with the contractile <b>vacuole</b> <b>system.</b> The actin polymerization response upon stimulation with cAMP was reduced, but the motile behavior toward the chemoattractant was unaffected.

I {{present data}} {{showing that the}} RabGAP RabGAP 1 acts as a switch for discharging the CVs into the extracellular medium in Dictyostelium. rabgap 1 null (rabgap 1 ⁻) cells have highly enlarged CVs whose structure and activity are aberrant. In rabgap 1 - cells, the dynamic fusion of the CV with the plasma membrane is absent and the discharge of CV content is inefficient. RabGAP 1 localizes to the CV membrane whereupon the vacuoles stop charging, become round, and fuse to the plasma membrane. Drainin, another TBC-domain containing protein, and RabGAP 1 sequentially localize to the CV membrane and regulate CV discharge. Rab 8 A and Rab 11 A interact with RabGAP 1, co-localize with RabGAP 1 on the CV, and suppress the rabgap 1 ⁻ large vacuole phenotype. However, Rab 8 A suppresses both the large vacuole phenotype and the abnormal discharging phenotype in drainin⁻ cells. I identified two BEACH family proteins, LvsA and LvsD, as a suppressor and an enhancer of the large CV phenotype, respectively. Analysis of LvsA and LvsD mutant strains in a rabgap 1 ⁻ background revealed that LvsA and LvsD have distinct functions in regulating CV biogenesis by controlling the recycling of CV membranes.

Stably transformed cell lines overexpressing a dominant negative functioning RabD internalized fluid phase marker at 50 % {{of the rate}} of wild-type cells. Mutant cells were also slower at recycling internalized fluid. Microscopic and biochemical approaches indicated that the transport of fluid to large postlysosome vacuoles was delayed in mutant cells, resulting in an accumulation in acidic smaller vesicles, probably lysosomes. Also, RabD N 121 I-expressing cell lines missorted a small but significant percentage of newly synthesized lysosomal alpha-mannosidase precursor polypeptides. However, {{the majority of the}} newly synthesized alpha-mannosidase was transported with normal kinetics and correctly delivered to lysosomes. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that in mutant cells contractile vacuole membrane proteins were associated with compartments morphologically distinct from the normal reticular network. Osmotic tests revealed that the contractile vacuole functioned inefficiently in mutant cells. Our results suggest that RabD regulates membrane traffic along the endosomal pathway, and that this GTPase {{may play a role in}} regulating the structure and function of the contractile <b>vacuole</b> <b>system</b> by facilitating communication with the endosomal pathway...|$|E

The presence {{of only a}} single Qb/c class SNARE in P. tetraurelia is surprising {{in view of the}} multiple genome duplications and the high number of SNAREs found in other classes of this organism. As inferred from the subcellular localization of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct, the protein is localized on a variety of intracellular membranes, and there is a large soluble pool of PtSNAP. Similarly, the PtSNAP that is detected with a specific antibody in fixed cells is associated with a number of intracellular membrane structures, including food vacuoles, the contractile <b>vacuole</b> <b>system,</b> and the sites of constitutive endo- and exocytosis. Surprisingly, using gene silencing, we could not assign a role to PtSNAP in the stimulated exocytosis of dense core vesicles (trichocysts), but we found an increased number of food vacuoles in PtSNAP-silenced cells. In conclusion, we identify PtSNAP as a Paramecium homologue of metazoan SNAP- 25 that shows several divergent features, like resistance to cleavage by botulinum neurotoxins...|$|E

The ultrastructures of both species well agree with the characteristics approved within Ichthyosporea: walled spores produce uniflagellate zoospores lacking a collar or cortical alveoli. The two Dermocystidium species resemble Rhinosporidium seeberi (as described by light microscope), a member of the nearest relative genus, but differ in that in R. seeberi plasmodia have thousands of nuclei discernible, endospores are discharged through a pore in the wall of the sporangium, and zoospores have not been revealed. The plasmodial stages of both Dermocystidium species have a most unusual behaviour of nuclei, although we do not actually know how the nuclei transform during the development. Early stages have an ordinary nucleus with double, fenestrated envelope. In middle-aged plasmodia ordinary nuclei seem to be totally absent or are only seldom discernible until prior to sporogony, when rather numerous nuclei again reappear. Meanwhile single-membrane vacuoles with coarsely granular content, or complicated membranous systems were discernible. Ordinary nuclei may be re-formed within these <b>vacuoles</b> or <b>systems.</b> In D. percae small canaliculi and in D. fennicum minute vesicles may aid the nucleus-cytoplasm interchange of matter before formation of double-membrane-enveloped nuclei.

40|$|The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multi-subunit {{enzyme that}} plays {{important}} roles in eukaryotic cells. In Dictyostelium, it is found primarily in membranes of the contractile vacuole complex, where it energizes fluid accumulation by this osmoregulatory organelle and also in membranes of endolysosomes, where it serves to acidify the endosomal lumen. In the present study, a fusion was created between vatM, the gene encoding the 100 kDa transmembrane subunit of the V-ATPase, and the gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). When expressed in Dictyostelium cells, this fusion protein, VatM-GFP, was correctly targeted to contractile vacuole and endolysosomal membranes and was competent to direct assembly of the V-ATPase enzyme complex. Protease treatment of isolated endosomes indicated that the GFP moiety, located on the C-terminus of VatM, was exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the endosomal membrane {{rather than to the}} lumenal side. VatM-GFP labeling of the contractile vacuole complex revealed clearly the dynamics of this pleiomorphic vesiculotubular organelle. VatM-GFP labeling of endosomes allowed direct visualization of the trafficking of vacuolar proton pumps in this pathway, which appeared to be entirely independent from the contractile <b>vacuole</b> membrane <b>system.</b> In cells whose endosomes were pre-labeled with TRITC-dextran and then fed yeast particles, VatM-GFP was delivered to newly formed yeast phagosomes with the same time course as TRITC- dextran, consistent with transfer via a direct fusion of endosomes with phagosomes. Several minutes were required before the intensity of the VatM-GFP labeling of new phagosomes reached the level observed in older phagosomes, suggesting that this fusion process was progressive and continuous. VatM-GFP was retrieved from the phagosome membrane prior to exocytosis of the indigestible remnants of the yeast particle. These data suggest that vacuolar proton pumps are recycled by fusion of advanced with newly formed endosomes...|$|R
40|$|The yeast ZRT 1 zinc {{transporter}} {{is regulated}} by zinc at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. At the post-translational level, zinc inactivates ZRT 1 by inducing {{the removal of}} the protein from the plasma membrane by endocytosis. The zinc transporter is subsequently degraded in the <b>vacuole.</b> This regulatory <b>system</b> allows for the rapid shut off of zinc uptake activity in cells exposed to high zinc concentrations, thereby preventing overaccumulation of this potentially toxic metal. In this report, we examine the role of ubiquitin conjugation in this process. First, we show that ZRT 1 is ubiquitinated shortly after zinc treatment and before endocytosis. Secondly, mutations in various components of the ubiquitin conjugation pathway, specifically the RSP 5 ubiquitin-protein ligase and the UBC 4 and UBC 5 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, inhibit both ubiquitination and endocytosis. Finally, mutation of a specific lysine residue in ZRT 1 blocks both ubiquitination and endocytosis. This critical lysine, Lys- 195, is located in a cytoplasmic loop region of the protein and may be the residue to which ubiquitin is attached. These results demonstrate that ubiquitin conjugation is a critical step in the signal transduction pathway that controls the rate of ZRT 1 endocytosis in response to zinc...|$|R
40|$|The {{fusion of}} {{cellular}} membranes comprises several steps; membrane attachment requires priming of SNAREs and tethering factors by Sec 18 p/NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor) and LMA 1. This leads to trans-SNARE pairing, i. e. formation of SNARE complexes between apposed membranes. The yeast <b>vacuole</b> <b>system</b> has revealed two subsequent molecular events: trans-complex formation of V-ATPase proteolipid sectors (V 0) and release of LMA 1 from the membrane. We have now identified a hetero-oligomeric membrane integral complex of vacuolar transporter chaperone (Vtc) proteins integrating these events. The Vtc complex associates with the R-SNARE Nyv 1 p and with V 0. Subunits Vtc 1 p and Vtc 4 p control the initial steps of fusion.

In contrast, subunit Vtc 3 p {{is required for the}} latest step, LMA 1 release, but dispensible for all preceding steps, including V 0 trans-complex formation. This suggests that Vtc 3 p might act close to or at fusion pore opening.

Phylogenetic analyses show that these Ca 2 + release channels (CRCs) can be subdivided into six groups (Paramecium tetraurelia CRC-I to CRC-VI), each one with features in part reminiscent of IP 3 Rs and RyRs. We characterize here the P. tetraurelia CRC-IV- 1 gene family, whose relationship to IP 3 Rs and RyRs is restricted to their C-terminal channel domain. CRC-IV- 1 channels localize to cortical Ca 2 + stores (alveolar sacs) and also to the endoplasmic reticulum. This {{is in contrast to}} a recently described true IP 3 channel, a group II member (P. tetraurelia IP 3 RN- 1), found associated with the contractile <b>vacuole</b> <b>system.</b> Silencing of either one of these CRCs results in reduced exocytosis of dense core vesicles (trichocysts), although for different reasons. Knockdown of P. tetraurelia IP 3 RN affects trichocyst biogenesis, while CRC-IV- 1 channels are involved in signal transduction since silenced cells show an impaired release of Ca 2 + from cortical stores in response to exocytotic stimuli. Our discovery of a range of CRCs in Paramecium indicates that protozoans already have evolved multiple ways for the use of Ca 2 + as signaling molecule...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein are force-generating {{molecules}} that move {{in opposite directions}} along microtubules. They have been implicated in the directed transport {{of a wide variety}} of cellular organelles, but it is unclear whether they have overlapping or largely independent functions. Results: We analyzed organelle transport in kinesin and dynein single mutants, and in a kinesin and dynein double mutant of Neurospora crassa. Remarkably, the simultaneous mutation of kinesin and dynein was not lethal and resulted in an additive phenotype that combined the features of the single mutants. The mutation of kinesin and dynein had opposite effects on the apical and retrograde transport, respectively, of vesicular organelles. In the kinesin mutant, apical movement of submicroscopic, secretory vesicles to the Spitzenkörper – an organelle in the hyphal apex – was defective, whereas the predominantly retrograde movement of microscopic organelles was only slightly reduced. In contrast, the dynein mutant still had a prominent Spitzenkörper, demonstrating that apical transport was intact, but retrograde transport was essentially inhibited completely. A major defect in vacuole formation and dynamics was also evident. In agreement with the observations on apical transport, protein secretion into the medium was markedly inhibited in the kinesin mutant but not in the dynein mutant. Conclusions: Transport of secretory vesicles is necessary but not sufficient for normal apical extension. A component of retrograde transport, presumably precursors of the <b>vacuole</b> <b>system,</b> is also essential. Our findings provide new information on the role microtubule motors play in cell morphogenesis and suggest that kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein have largely independent functions within separate pathways...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the requirement of}} the Listeria monocytogenes broad-range phospholipase C (PC-PLC) during infection of human epithelial cells. L. monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen of humans {{and a variety of}} animal species. After entering a host cell, L. monocytogenes is initially surrounded by a membrane-bound vacuole. Bacteria promote their escape from this vacuole, grow within the host cell cytosol, and spread from cell to cell via actin-based motility. Most infection studies with L. monocy-togenes have been performed with mouse cells or an in vivo mouse model of infection. In all mouse-derived cells tested, the pore-forming cytolysin listeriolysin O (LLO) is absolutely required for lysis of primary vacuoles formed during host cell entry. However, L. monocytogenes can escape from primary vacuoles in the absence of LLO during infection of human epithelial cell lines Henle 407, HEp- 2, and HeLa. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} broad-range phospholipase C, PC-PLC, promotes lysis of Henle 407 cell primary vacuoles in the absence of LLO. Here, we have shown that PC-PLC is also required for lysis of HEp- 2 and HeLa cell primary vacuoles in the absence of LLO expression. Furthermore, our results indicated that the amount of PC-PLC activity is critical for the efficiency of vacuolar lysis. In an LLO-negative derivative of L. monocytogenes strain 10403 S, expression of PC-PLC has to increase before or upon entry into human epithelial cells, compared to expression in broth culture, to allow bacterial escape from primary <b>vacuoles.</b> Using a <b>system</b> for inducibl...|$|R
40|$|The {{vesicular}} neurotransmitter transporter VMAT 2 {{is responsible}} for the transport of monoamines into synaptic and storage vesicles. VMAT 2 is the target of many psychoactive drugs and is essential for proper neurotransmission and survival. Here we describe a new expression system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that takes advantage of the polyspecificity of VMAT 2. Expression of rVMAT 2 confers resistance to acriflavine and to the parkinsonian toxin 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP+) by their removal into the yeast <b>vacuole.</b> This expression <b>system</b> allowed identification of a new substrate, acriflavine, and isolation of mutants with modified affinity to tetrabenazine (TBZ), a non-competitive inhibitor of VMAT 2 that is used in the treatment of various movement disorders including Tourette syndrome and Huntington chorea. Whereas one type of mutant obtained displayed decreased affinity to TBZ, a second type showed only a slight decrease in the affinity to TBZ, displayed a higher Km to the neurotransmitter serotonin, but conferred increased resistance to acriflavine and MPP+. A protein where both types of mutations were combined (with only three amino acid replacements) lost most of the properties of the neurotransmitter transporter (TBZ-insensitive, no transport of neurotransmitter) but displayed enhanced resistance to the above toxicants. The work described here shows {{that in the case of}} rVMAT 2, loss of traits acquired in evolution of function (such as serotonin transport and TBZ binding) bring about an improvement in older functions such as resistance to toxic compounds. A process that has taken millions of years of evolution can be reversed by three mutations...|$|R
40|$|The {{strategies}} {{developed by}} plants {{to avoid the}} toxicity of cadmium (Cd) and other heavy metals involve active sequestration of metals into the apoplast and <b>vacuoles.</b> The protein <b>systems</b> excluding heavy metals from the cell cytosol localize to the plasma membrane and tonoplast and are energized either by ATP or by the electrochemical gradient generated by H+-ATPase or by V-ATPase and pyrophosphatase (PPase), respectively. In this work, a comparative study on the contribution of both the plasma membrane and tonoplast in the active detoxification of plant cells after treatment with Cd was performed. The studies using plants treated and untreated with Cd reveal that both, H+-coupled and MgATP-driven efflux of Cd across plasma membranes and tonoplast is markedly stimulated {{in the presence of}} Cd in the environment. Previous studies on plasma-membrane localized H+-coupled Cd efflux together with the present data demonstrating tonoplast H+/Cd 2 + antiport activity suggest that H+-coupled secondary transport of Cd displays a lower affinity for Cd when compared with Cd primary pumps driven by MgATP. In addition, it is shown that MgATP-energized Cd efflux across both membranes is significantly enhanced by cysteine, dithiothreitol, and glutathione. These results suggest that Cd is excluded from the cytosol through an energy-dependent system as a free ion as well as a complexed form. Although both membranes contribute in the active exclusion of ionized and complexed Cd from the cytosol, the overall calculation of Cd accumulation in the everted plasma membranes and vacuolar vesicles suggests that the tonoplast and vacuole have a major function in Cd efflux from the cytosol in the roots of cucumber subjected to Cd stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{neuronal}} ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are a {{group of}} inherited, severe neurodegenerative disorders also known as Batten disease. Juvenile NCL (JNCL) is caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in CLN 3, which encodes a transmembrane protein that regulates endocytic pathway trafficking, though its primary function is not yet known. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is increasingly utilized for neurological disease research and is particularly suited for investigation of protein function in trafficking. Therefore, here we establish new overexpression and knockout Dictyostelium cell lines for JNCL research. Dictyostelium Cln 3 fused to GFP localized to the contractile <b>vacuole</b> <b>system</b> and to compartments of the endocytic pathway. cln 3 - cells displayed increased rates of proliferation and an associated reduction in the extracellular levels and cleavage of the autocrine proliferation repressor, AprA. Mid- and late development of cln 3 - cells was precocious and cln 3 - slugs displayed increased migration. Expression of either Dictyostelium Cln 3 or human CLN 3 in cln 3 - cells suppressed the precocious development and aberrant slug migration, which were also suppressed by calcium chelation. Taken together, our results show that Cln 3 is a pleiotropic protein that negatively regulates proliferation and development in Dictyostelium. This new model system, which allows {{for the study of}} Cln 3 function in both single cells and a multicellular organism, together with the observation that expression of human CLN 3 restores abnormalities in Dictyostelium cln 3 - cells, strongly supports the use of this new model for JNCL research...|$|E
40|$|RabD, a Dictyostelium Rab 14 -related GTPase, localizes in the endo-lysosomal pathway and {{contractile}} <b>vacuole</b> <b>system</b> of membranes. Cell lines expressing dominant-negative RabD were defective in endocytosis, endosomal membrane {{flow and}} homotypic lysosome fusion. In {{support of a}} role for RabD in fusion, cells overexpressing constitutively active RabDQ 67 L accumulated enlarged hydrolase-rich acidic vesicles ringed with GFP-RabD, consistent with RabD directly regulating lysosome fusion. To determine whether RabD also regulated phagocytosis and/or homotypic phagosome fusion (a process stimulated by many intracellular pathogens), cells overexpressing dominant-active (RabDQ 67 L) or dominant-negative (RabN 121 I) RabD were analyzed microscopically and biochemically. The rate of phagocytosis was increased twofold in RabDQ 67 L-expressing cells and reduced by 50 % in RabDN 121 l-expressing cells compared with control cells. To examine the role of RabD {{in the formation of}} muItiparticle phagosomes, we performed a series of pulse-chase experiments using fluorescently labeled bacteria and fluorescent latex beads. The rate of fusion of newly formed phagosomes was five times higher in the RabDQ 67 L-expressing cells and reduced by over 50 % in RabDN 121 l-expressing cells as compared with control cells. GFP-RabDQ 67 L was found to ring muItiparticle spacious phagosomes, which supports a direct role for this protein in regulating fusion. Inhibition of PI 3 -kinase activity, which is known to regulate phagosome fusion in the wild-type cells, reduced the rate of phagosome fusion in RabDQ 67 L+ cells, indicating that RabD acted upstream of or parallel with PI 3 -kinase. We hypothesize that RabD and, possibly, Rab 14, a related GTPase that associates with phagosomes in mammalian cells, are important regulators of homotypic phagosome and endo-Iysosome fusion...|$|E
40|$|Screening of a cDNA library {{revealed}} {{the existence of}} a Dictyostelium cDNA encoding a protein 80 % identical at the amino acid level to mammalian Rab 11. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence studies revealed that DdRab 11 was exclusively associated with the ATPase proton pump-rich contractile vacuole membrane system, consisting of a reticular network and bladder-like vacuoles. Video microscopy of cells expressing GFP-DdRab 11 revealed that this Rab was associated with contractile vacuolar bladders undergoing formation, fusion and expulsion of water. The association of DdRab 11 with contractile vacuole membranes was disrupted when cells were exposed to either hypo-osmotic conditions or an inhibitor of the ATPase proton pump. Cells that overexpressed a dominant negative form of DdRab 11 were analyzed biochemically and microscopically to measure changes in the structure and function of the contractile <b>vacuole</b> <b>system.</b> Compared with wild-type cells, the dominant negative DdRab 11 -expressing cells contained a more extensive contractile vacuole network and abnormally enlarged contractile vacuole bladders, most likely the result of defects in membrane trafficking. In addition, the mutant cells enlarged, detached from surfaces and contained large vacuoles when exposed to water, suggesting a functional defect in osmotic regulation. No changes were observed in mutant cells in the rate of fluid phase internalization or release, suggesting the DdRab 11 -mediated membrane trafficking defects were not general in nature. Surprisingly, the rate of phagocytosis was increased in the dominant negative DdRab 11 -expressing cells when compared with control cells. Our results are consistent with a role for DdRab 11 in regulating membrane traffic to maintain the normal morphology and function of the contractile vacuole...|$|E
40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) fungi colonise a {{wide range}} of plant species and are especially common in soils with a relatively high pH, where phosphorus availability is a limiting factor for primary production. The aim of this thesis was to study the ecophysiology of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi when exposed to different environments. Development of AM fungi and their host plants were investigated with focus on the activity and the location of phosphatases associated with the AM fungal extraradical and intraradical mycelium. Plants and AM fungal mycelium were grown in substrates varying in soil origin, phosphorus content, or pH. The use of the Enzyme-Labelled Fluorescence (ELF) phosphatase substrate in AM fungal research was investigated. The studies in this thesis have led to the following findings. The ELF substrate method is a sensitive method in the determination of acid and alkaline phosphatase activity associated with mycorrhizal mycelium. The AM root colonisation is positively related to the biomass of the extraradical mycelium, however, locally the extraradical mycelium biomass production can respond to the conditions of certain patches. I found no active release of phosphatase activity by AM fungi, indicating that mineralisation of organic P in soil by AM fungi is not through the release of phosphatases. Staining for phosphatase activity is more intense in the intraradical than in the extraradical mycelium. In the intraradical mycelium the proportion of acid phosphatase-active mycelium seems greater than the alkaline phosphatase-active proportion, while in the extraradical mycelium it seems smaller. The high proportion of phosphatase-active arbuscules indicate the importance of phosphatases for the P metabolism in arbuscules and thus for the P transfer to the plant. A tubular <b>vacuole</b> <b>system</b> is present in the extraradical mycelium of a Glomus isolate and a high P content in the growth substrate decreases its motility. Phosphatases associated with the extraradical and intraradical mycelium of AM fungi seem {{to be related to the}} phosphorus uptake by the fungi and phosphorus transfer to the host plant. In this thesis some possible roles of these phosphatases in phosphorus metabolism of AM fungal plants are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Transport {{networks}} are vital components of multi-cellular organisms, distributing nutrients and removing waste products. Animal cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and plant vasculature, are branching trees whose architecture {{is thought to}} determine universal scaling laws in these organisms. In contrast, the transport systems of many multi-cellular fungi do not fit into this conceptual framework, as they have evolved to explore a patchy environment in search of new resources, rather than ramify through a three-dimensional organism. These fungi grow as a foraging mycelium, formed by the branching and fusion of threadlike hyphae, that {{gives rise to a}} complex network. To function efficiently, the mycelial network must both transport nutrients between spatially separated source and sink regions and also maintain its integrity in the face of continuous attack by mycophagous insects or random damage. Here we review the development of novel imaging approaches and software tools that we have used to characterise nutrient transport and network formation in foraging mycelia over a range of spatial scales. On a millimetre scale, we have used a combination of time-lapse confocal imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to quantify the rate of diffusive transport through the unique <b>vacuole</b> <b>system</b> in individual hyphae. These data then form the basis of a simulation model to predict the impact of such diffusion-based movement on a scale of several millimetres. On a centimetre scale, we have used novel photon-counting scintillation imaging techniques to visualize radiolabel movement in small microcosms. This approach has revealed novel N-transport phenomena, including rapid, preferential N-resource allocation to C-rich sinks, induction of simultaneous bi-directional transport, abrupt switching between different pre-existing transport routes, and a strong pulsatile component to transport in some species. Analysis of the pulsatile transport component using Fourier techniques shows that as the colony forms, it self-organizes into well demarcated domains that are identifiable by differences in the phase relationship of the pulses. On the centimetre to metre scale, we have begun to use techniques borrowed from graph theory to characterize the development and dynamics of the network, and used these abstracted network models to predict the transport characteristics, resilience, and cost of the network...|$|E
