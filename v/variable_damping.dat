A viscous damper {{is used as}} a passive control device and a <b>variable</b> <b>damper,</b> developed from an MR (magnetorheological) damper, {{is used as a}} semi-active control device. The study is based on the simplified lumped-mass finite-element model of the 91 / 5 highway bridge in Southern California. The prime aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of viscous dampers and variable dampers with a friction-type damping force scheme and a two-step viscous damping force scheme, with important parametric variation. Velocity-and displacement-dependent models of a <b>variable</b> <b>damper</b> are used. Numerical simulations are conducted by installing the devices between the deck and abutments of the bridge. The seismic response of the bridge is compared with the corresponding uncontrolled case, and controlled by alternative sample control strategies. The results of the investigation clearly indicate that the base shear and mid-span displacement are reduced substantially by these protective devices. It is concluded that variable dampers are quite effective in considerably reducing the large bearing displacements, thereby eliminating the isolator damages.

The <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> profile of the knee during swing extension has been modeled as an initial linear increase with respect to knee angle followed by a quadratic increase at the end of swing.

Preliminary studies on a unilateral, transfemoral amputee have shown that the AAAKP with the proposed damping control strategy is able to more closely emulate the damping profile of the unaffected leg, when compared to a conventional knee prosthesis (Otto Bock C-Leg®).

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{damping force}} {{algorithm}} called the viscous-plus-variable-friction damping force {{algorithm is proposed}} by combining advantageous features of typical viscous and friction dampers. The <b>variable</b> <b>damper</b> with the proposed algorithm can be represented by a viscous element placed in series with a variable-friction element. As a piston velocity increases from zero, the damping force is generated by the viscous element. This is aimed to allow energy dissipation at a small velocity. When the damping force reaches a peak value of the viscous element or a preset force limit, the sliding of the variable-friction element occurs, resulting in a constant <b>damping</b> force. A <b>variable</b> <b>damper</b> with the proposed damping force algorithm was developed using a magnetorheological (MR) damper. A series of cyclic loading tests of a MR damper was conducted to develop the mathematical model of the MR damper for control purpose.

40|$|Damping in a {{multitude}} of engineering applications has a variable threshold requirement based on the input excitation given to the system. In most applications the desired system response is known but the input to the system is a time dependent function with fluctuating amplitudes and frequencies. Therefore for optimal performance the damping characteristics of a given system {{must be able to}} adapt to increase or decrease the amount of energy being absorbed by the system. In most mechanical systems (including vehicles) damping is achieved through a viscous medium; such as hydraulic oil. Although the oil is capable of absorbing the unwanted energy in the system, its passive nature limits its ability to achieve an optimal amount of damping given the excitation. To achieve the requisite functionality of variable damping; {{a multitude}} of solutions have been implemented, proposed, and evaluated at both commercial and academic research levels. These solutions have met the <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> requirements but have significant cant drawbacks associated with them. To address the shortcomings associated with the aforementioned <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> solutions, a hybrid design consisting of a conventional hydraulic damper and a linear motor topology was fused together to produce a hybrid variable damper. In this hybrid design, the oil in the system acts as bias and the linear motor topology allows for variability in the amount of damping being provided to the system. This hybrid design allows for the requisite <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> requirement to be achieved.
