40|$|With the {{development}} of offshore deep water fields, helicopter transportation and consequently helicopter deck becomes {{a vital part of}} these fields that located far from onshore. To ensure helicopter safe operations, aerodynamic hazards around an offshore platform and helideck need to be identified and risks of such disturbances should be minimized. The main sources of environmental hazards around an offshore platform are <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> fluctuation (σz), and temperature increase above the helideck (Morrison, 2001). According to British CAP 437 standard, <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> fluctuation should be less than 1. 75 m/s above the helideck. Furthermore, temperature increase should be less than 2 ◦C according to NORSOK C- 004 and CAP 437 standards. In order to examine such aerodynamic disturbances, Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) and hot air flow is simulated by OpenFOAM® 2. 1. 1 as an open source Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) toolbox. In this thesis, ABL simulation is first done for a simple geometry, and then it is developed for real offshore fixed platform geometry as wind environment disturbed in vicinity of offshore platform as a major obstacle, and turbulent eddies would be generated. Turbulence models applied for helideck simulations are k-ε and RSM turbulence model to assess which one going to present the real situation best. In addition, to examine thermal gradient, hot exhausted air flow is simulated for a simple geometry. To validate simulation results of this project as it is done by an open source code, the models are also simulated by KFX® CFD simulator in parallel by Dr. Giljarhus, and its results compared by simulation results of OpenFOAM. In ABL simulations of simple geometry, results of horizontal velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, dissipation rate and turbulent eddy viscosity are plotted for different location at geometry length against height to assess how theses profile developed from inlet to outlet, and the OpenFOAM results compared with KFX results. In ABL simulation of real platform geometry, σz is calculated as {{it is one of the}} main missions of this report, and the results are plotted for coarse and fine mesh for k-ε and RSM turbulence models, and also turbulent kinetic energy pattern is shown and compared with KFX. For hot plume simulation, the location of 2 ◦C isotherm is identified and the plume pattern and sizing is compared with KFX. ABL simulation results for a simple geometry show a great homogeneity with KFX results especially for velocity profile. Regarding hot plume simulation, the plume pattern and its sizing validated as it is fairly similar compare to KFX result. And finally, In ABL helideck simulations, it is found that vertical airflow fluctuation is acceptable for the defined wind condition, as it is less than 1. 75 m/s criterion. Furthermore, comparison between simulation results of k-ε and RSM turbulence models show that k-ε turbulence model generate more turbulent kinetic energy and consequently more <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> fluctuation compare to RSM model...|$|E

The fluid is gray, absorbing-emitting but non-scattering medium and the Rosseland approximation is used to describe the radiative flux in the energy equation. The dimensionless governing equations are solved using an implicit finite-difference method of the Crank-Nicolson type, which is stable and convergent. The velocity profiles are compared with the available theoretical solution and are found to be in good agreement.

40|$|Atmospheric {{turbulence}} {{can affect}} soil gas transport, and thus violates {{the assumption that}} molecular diffusion is the only relevant transport mechanism in the soil. Due to the oscillating character of turbulence-induced pressure pumping the net <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> into/out of the soil is zero. Yet, the dispersion processes induced by the oscillating air movement in the soil pores enhance the gas exchange in the soil, and should be considered when the gradient method is applied. We developed a simple lab method to test the impact of turbulence-driven pressure pumping on soil gas transport using neon as a tracer gas. The experiment was conducted using soil core samples from three contrasting forest sites. The ratio of air permeability and air-filled pore-volume, k(a) /epsilon, {{was found to be}} suitable to assess the sensitivity of soil gas transport to the pressure-pumping effect. The pressure-pumping effect reached up to 60 % of the diffusive flux rates depending on the intensity of pressure pumping. We conclude that the turbulence effect can substantially influence soil gas transport in field studies, especially at sites with a high k(a) /epsilon value > 1000 mu m(2). Therefore, we recommend taking this effect into account when soil gas flux is determined using the gradient method...|$|E

This research designed and constructed a <b>Vertical</b> <b>Air</b> Classifier in which the fine mineral {{is fed to a}} <b>vertical</b> chamber while <b>air</b> is blown from the bottom. The main variables are <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates and the length of contact between the air and the mineral (at length of 10 and 15 cm). The air is blown in by air compressor and its rate is controlled by a thin plate orifice. Experiments show that the classifier can eliminate more of the size of - 140 mesh as the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate increases. The % fractional recovery at the size of - 140 mesh is found to decrease as the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate increases. The length of contact between the air and the mineral influences the elimination and the % fractional recovery as well.

The road texture has {{a significant role in}} this process, together with the possible porosity of the road pavement. The latter may influence the noise sources in the high frequency range in which air pumping is supposed to contribute. Even on dense road surfaces with no <b>vertical</b> porosity, possible <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> allowed by the road texture in the contact patch is equivalent to the effect of a so-called 'lateral' porosity which is reckoned to have an influence on the source strength. In this paper, the effect of this lateral porosity is studied with a modelling approach using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This approach allows the highlighting of some phenomena occurring in the contact patch such as air compression due to the tyre rolling process or air drainage.

Good agreement, between the numerical and the experimental results, are reported for heat dissipation from the radiators.

Prediction of these hydrometeors using models {{is difficult because}} of limited knowledge of the microphysical properties at the small size ranges due to measurement issues. These phenomena need to be better represented in forecast and climate models; therefore, in addition to remote sensing accurate measurements using ground-based instrumentation are required. An imaging instrument, aimed at measuring ice fog and light snow particles, has been built and is presented here. The ice crystal imaging (ICI) probe samples ice particles into a vertical, tapered inlet with an inlet flow rate of 11 L min− 1. A laser beam across the <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> containing the ice crystals allows for their detection by a photodetector collecting the scattered light.

After this major renovation {{a number of problems}} arose: due to the floor heating System and massive granite floor the church could only be heated stationary. A relatively large thermally driven <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> was the result of it, which lead to thermal discomfort. The air temperature therefore was set rather high. The combination of a large soot production, due to the burning of ten thousands of candles, and the thermally driven vertical air flows lead to a severe contamination of the l 6 th century painted ceiling. Furthermore due to the high floor and air temperatures the energy costs were massive. For many years this church has been monitored. The ceiling paintings are restored at this moment and a number of measures has been taken to prevent the contamination in future. To predict this future contamination an experimental setup has been developed more than two years {{before the start of the}} restoration. This setup consists of two round disks with contamination samples which have been placed in two largo openings in the church ceiling, now for more than two years ago.

Different seed conditioning treatments have been done: prehydration, osmotic and matrix priming, hormonal and disinfection treatments. A densimetric seed separation has been carried out to divide the seed lot in four sublots of different quality and to measure seed answers to hormonal treatments. Moreover, a tetrazolium seed test was carried out to determine the causes of the seed lot low germination rate. In the prehydration essay, seeds were immersed in a circulating water flow from 30 minutes to 24 h. Best results were obtained with the 4 h hydration. Prehydration influences micro-organisms contamination percentage of non-germinated seeds. Furthermore, prehydration was combined to a disinfection using sodium hypochlorite 4 % for 4 minutes. Disinfected seeds lost germination capacity. Hormonal treatment consisted in hydrating seeds on filter paper of different GA 3 concentration solutions during germination test. GA 3 improved germination uniformity but not germination percentage. Best results have been obtained with the 10 mg•L- 1 GA 3 concentracion. In seed separation, differences in germination rate and vigour have been observed in function of seeds medium weight. Seeds were separated in a <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> that divided seeds in four fraction of growing density. A linear correlation between seed germination percentage and one hundred seeds medium weight was determined. It’s possible to separate seeds in different seed sublots of different quality.

In PEG- 6000 seed osmoconditioning, a significant loss of germination was observed. Deionized water and KNO 3 solutions improved seed quality, improving seed germination velocity and uniformity. It has been detected that seed germination uniformity only depends on the period of treatment but not on the solution concentration. Matrix seed priming gave best results with most deteriorated seeds, improving significantly their germination rate but had a few influence on seeds of better quality.

On ground located aerodynamic stand for human flight in a vertical air jet simulates the feelings what is experiencing the skydiver in free flight. If the time of free flight of the skydiver is about one minute, meanwhile the free flight in the on ground located stand, without taking into account economic considerations, is limited only by the human physical abilities. Stands of this type are used as: Ground stands for simulation of long skydiving (AFF Accelerated Free Fall); Training of paratroopers and units of special forces; Testing and experimental blowing of equipments and devices; New type of sport "Bodyflyght"; Sport and entertainment of the public. In the world there is already a large number of aerodynamic stands for free flight of human, which vary in design, dimensions, range of speeds, and ways of creating of a stream. Known aerodynamic stands have closed (i. e. limited with side panels) or an open work area, and should create a long range vertical stream (altitude can reach 20 - 25 meters from the outlet section of the tube). In the cross-sections of work area of a jet flow must be sufficiently uniform and without swirling. Average vertical velocity in a work zone is approximately 60 - 70 m/s at standard atmospheric conditions. Disadvantages of known systems of creation of vertical air jet in open aerodynamic stands are inappropriate design and increased operating costs due to the high losses of flow energy as in separate elements, as well in the system as a whole at the assembly into a single set of elements without taking in to account their reciprocal aerodynamic effects. Standard engineering methods for calculating of wind tunnels represent a sequential selection of parameters of their individual sections based on hydraulic losses generally without taking into account their mutual influence in a common aerodynamic system. As a result is the consistent composition of individual construction elements of wind tunnels which are not agreed among them as a unique aerodynamic system. Various assumptions, as well as the lack of information about the full picture of currents of flow and mutual influences of the considered sections do not allow optimizing the design of the wind tunnel during the engineering process and getting defined characteristics. In this way calculated parameters are approximate and require fine-tuning during field tests, resulting in extensive material costs. As a result, many stand (especially open stands with an open work area), have in the working section of the jet significantly uneven speed profile, high flow swirl and as well as large required power supply. Modern constructions of aerodynamic stands have large dimensions, complex forms, making difficult and expensive implementation of natural or semi-natural experiment, especially if we are talking about an aerodynamic experiment. Therefore, the creation of structures and their optimization is not possible without improving and automating the design, calculation and experiment. Thus the use of modern methods of computer modelling and design of these stands are relevant...|$|E

The optical response of this filter to normal-incident and oblique-incident light proves that utilizing the high-level bandgaps of PCs is an efficient method to lower the difficulties of fabricating PCs, increase the etching depth of semiconductor materials, and reduce the coupling loss at the interface between optical fibers and the PC device.

25|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>air</b> mixing {{was invented}} by Erik Uppstu. His idea is to turn {{traditional}} vertical mixing to horizontal mixing. Closely spaced jets will form a flat plane. In traditional boilers this plane has been formed by secondary air. By placing the planes to 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement improved mixing results. <b>Vertical</b> <b>air</b> has a potential to reduce NOx as staging air helps in decreasing emissions. In <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> mixing, primary air supply is arranged conventionally. Rest of the air ports are placed on interlacing 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement.|$|R
50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> meter, is {{a device}} that {{measures}} <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> i.e. how much <b>air</b> is <b>flowing</b> through a tube. It does not measure {{the volume of the}} air passing through the tube, it measures the mass of <b>air</b> <b>flowing</b> through the device per unit time. Thus <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> meters are simply an application of mass flow meters for a special medium. Typically, mass <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> measurements are expressed in the units of kilograms per second (kg/s).|$|R
40|$|The growing {{interest}} {{in the study of}} natural convection in geometrically complex enclosures with restricted communication has been stimulated by applications involving energy-efficient passive-solar buildings, natural convection cooling of electronic equipment and room heating and ventilation. Airflow through doorways, windows and other large openings are significant ways in which air, pollutants and thermal energy are transferred from one zone of a building to another or to outside. The present paper describes a numerical method for analysing three-dimensional natural convection in rooms connected to the outside through large openings. The calculations made use of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CDF) procedure taking into account the effects of buoyancy, heat sources, thermal radiation heat transfer and <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> turbulence. The CDF predictions agree with the experimentally observed features of the flow field, including the <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> temperature stratification, with a reasonable degree of accuracy...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> mass exchange driven by local circulation in the Himalayas, the volume flux of air mass is estimated in the Rongbuk Valley {{on the northern}} slope of Mount Everest, based on a volume closure method and wind-profiler measurements during the HEST 2006 campaign in June 2006. <b>Vertical</b> <b>air</b> mass exchange {{was found to be}} dominated by a strong downward mass transfer from the late morning to late night. The average <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> volume flux was 0. 09 m s− 1, which could be equivalent to a daily ventilation of 30 times the enclosed valley volume. This <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> mass exchange process was greatly affected by the evolution of the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM), with a strong downward transfer during the SASM break stage, and a weak transfer during the SASM active stage...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1999, a {{statement}} of best practice in primary total hip replacement {{was approved by the}} Council of the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) and by the British Hip Society (BHS) to provide a basis for regional and national auditable standards. We have compared practice in the North West Region of England to this document to ascertain adherence to this guide to best practice. METHODS: A total of 86 surgeons from 26 hospitals were included in a questionnaire study. RESULTS: A mean of 93. 3 % of operations were performed in the surgeon's usual theatre. All of these theatres had <b>vertical</b> laminar <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> systems. Of respondents, 42. 2 % routinely used exhaust suits, 68. 1 % routinely used impermeable disposable gowns, and 26. 1 % used impermeable re-usable gowns. The Charnley femoral and acetabular prostheses were the most commonly used prostheses. All surgeons used some form of anti-thromboembolic prophylaxis: 66. 2 % use a combination of both mechanical and chemical means. All surgeons used antibiotic prophylaxis. The most popular choice of antibiotic was a cephalosporin [...] 70. 7 % used a 3 -dose regimen over 24 h, 2. 6 % of surgeons continued antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 h after surgery, and 93. 7 % of surgeons routinely use antibiotic-loaded cement. All surgeons routinely cleaned, irrigated and dried the acetabulum and femur before cement insertion. Only one surgeon did not use any form of femoral canal occlusion. 69. 4 % used an intramedullary bone block. Retrograde filling of the femoral shaft by means of a cement gun was practised by 65. 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated considerable variation of practice in total hip arthroplasty across the North West Region and significant divergence from the statement of best practice approved by the BOA and BHS. The introduction of a properly funded national hip register will surely help to clarify the effect of such diverse practice on patient outcome. We would recommend that all trusts locally audit their practices and correlate them with these nationally agreed guidelines...|$|R
50|$|The most {{pronounced}} gap wind though the Strait, the Levanter, can produce winds of 20-40 kt (10-20 m/s) {{in and to}} the west of the gap when there is higher pressure to the east, over the Mediterranean, with lower pressure {{to the west of}} Gibraltar. The sinking motions accompanying such anticyclonic conditions cause stability in the low-level <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> strongly suppressing <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> motion and may result in the formation of an inversion within a few thousand feet of the surface. Such an inversion provides a cap that contains the low-level air and results in greater topographic blocking and the acceleration of the airflow through the gap forming the Strait. Under such circumstances, the winds can go from a moderate or fresh easterly over the Alboran Sea (the western part of the Mediterranean) to gale force strength on the western side of the Strait and to its west. Because the flow is accelerating and there is often a significant pressure gradient through the Strait, the strongest winds are not observed mid-Strait, as might be expected if the funnel mechanism was dominant; rather, the strongest winds are in the western Strait and immediately downwind to the west. Levanters are most frequent during the warm season from April until October and often reach a peak in spring, when the Mediterranean is comparatively cool, increasing the stability of the low-level <b>air</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|R
