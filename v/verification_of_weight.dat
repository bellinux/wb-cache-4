Preconizou-se que o desjejum deveria suprir 25 % das necessidades diárias. Foi realizado questionário autoaplicado semiquantitativo e verificação de peso e estatura para cálculo do Índice de Massa Corporal (IMC) percentilar, com 214 adolescentes; 185 (86, 4 %) dos pesquisados eram eutróficos, 19 (8, 9 %) tinham sobrepeso e 10 (4, 7 %), apresentavam baixo peso, na faixa etária entre 15 e 19 anos, de ambos os sexos. Efetuou-se a análise descritiva das variáveis e os testes de Qui-Quadrado de Pearson, teste da Razão de Verossimilhança (Likehood Ratio Chi-Square), teste de Mantel Haenszel e o teste de tendência de Cochran-Armitage. Estabeleceu-se nível de confiança: p valor < 0, 05. Verificou-se que o desjejum foi consumido em casa, pela maioria dos estudantes pesquisados (77, 6 %), entre 6 e 7 horas, com freqüência diária. Relativo às calorias consumidas no desjejum, tanto as alunas quanto os alunos consomem até 25 %, a média por todos os estudantes foi de 16, 5 %. Para o sexo masculino foi de 16, 7 % e para o feminino 16, 4 % das calorias necessárias. O pão e o leite com achocolatados foram os alimentos mais consumidos e, entre os menos consumidos, ovos, presunto, iogurte, frutas e bolo. Conclui-se que esses resultados apontam a necessidade de intervenções nutricionais na categoria estudada, principalmente com relação à escolha de alimentos saudáveis. _________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTStudy {{carried through}} on the {{alimentary}} consumption in relation to breakfast of adolescents, that study in the morning period, of three private schools of the Ensino Médio of the Plano Piloto of Brasilia, DF. One praised was that breakfast would have to supply 25 % of the daily necessities. Ot was maked a semiquantitative auto applied questionnaire and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and height for the calculation of the percentile Body Mass Index (BMI), with 214 adolescents; 185 (86, 4 %) of the searched ones were normals, 19 (8, 9 %) had overweight and, only 10 (4, 7 %), presented low weight, with age band between 15 and 19 years, of both the genre. It was maked descriptive analysis of the variable and the tests of Qui-Quadrado of Pearson, test of the Reason of Probability (Likehood Ratio Chi- Square), test of Mantel Haenszel and the test of trend of Cochran-Armitage. A reliable level of p< 0, 05 was established. It was verified that breakfast was consumed in house, {{for the majority of}} the searched students (77, 6 %), between 6 and 7 hours, with daily frequency. Relative to the calories consumed in the breakfast, all the pupils consume up to 25 %; the average for all the students was of 16, 5 %. For the male gender, it was of 16, 7 % and for female gender, it was 16. 4 % of the necessary calories. The bread and the milk with chocolate had been the foods more consumed and, between less the most consumed, eggs, ham, yoghurt, fruits and cake. It is concluded that these results point the necessity of nutricional interventions in the studied category, mainly with relation to the healthful food choice...|$|E
5000|$|In medieval Europe, baking ovens {{were often}} {{separated}} from other buildings (and sometimes located outside city walls) {{to mitigate the}} risk of fire. Because bread was an important staple food, bakers' production factors (such as bolting yields, ingredients, and loaf sizes) were heavily regulated. For example, Henry III of England promulgated the Assize of Bread and Ale in 1267, subjecting all commercial bakers and brewers to various fees in order to practice their trade and imposing various regulations, such as inspection and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> and measures, quality control, and price controls. Soon after {{the enactment of the}} Assize, [...] "baking became a very stable industry, and was executed much more professionally than brewing, resulting in towns and villages having fewer bakers than brewers."

50|$|The Spanish House (Spaanse Huis), {{situated}} at Turfpoortstraat 27, was originally a church building converted to house migrants. In 1572 Spanish troops conducted a massacre of some 700 inhabitants who had gathered {{to hear a}} peace proposal. The Spanish then fired on the assembled citizens, {{and went on to}} set fire to the town. A plaque above the lintel of the door and below the eaves commemorates the massacre. In 1615, after the population had reestablished itself, they built the city hall on the site. Part of the building was given over to De Waag (The Scales House), the municipal office entrusted with the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> and measures. The building later served a French garrison as a bakery, turning out over 1000 loaves per day. From 1967 until 1992 it served as the Comenius museum.Today, the historic building serves as the Weegschaal Museum.|$|R

The results obtained can be used in the banking industry as guidelines and recommendations for the future design or redesign of websites, as well as a literary base for comparative analyses of this kind in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|THE {{procedure}} of cross-validation {{is a necessary}} step in estab-lishing the predictive power of a prognostic instrument in which weights are applied to the separate parts making up the total score. The technique involves the determination <b>of</b> the &dquo;best&dquo; <b>weights</b> with an initial sample and the subsequent <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> these <b>weights</b> with a second sample from the same population. A total score on the Orleans-Hanna Algebra Prognosis Test and on the Orleans-Hanna Geometry Prognosis Test, is a composite of (a) four student-reported past course-grades, (b) student-predicted course-grade in algebra or geometry, and (c) number right of the Prognosis Test work-sample items. For both of the Orleans-Hanna tests, an a priori <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> two was assigned {{to each of the}} five course-grade variables and a <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> one was assigned to the test score representing the number of work-sample items answered cor-rectly. Validation studies (Orleans and Hanna, 1968 a, b) were undertaken during the norming of the tests to determine the multi-ple regression weights for predicting each of the four criteria of success: mid-year and final course grades, and mid-year and end-of-year achievement test scores.

40|$|AbstractKale is a nutrient-dense, dark-green leafy {{vegetable}} often eaten raw in salads or added to smoothies. The USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Release 26 reports the weight for one cup raw, chopped kale as 67 grams, {{among the highest}} for raw {{leafy vegetable}}s. Objectives: Measure the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> one cup moderately packed raw kale with stems and tough midrib parts removed and evaluate {{the impact of the}} new cup weight on nutrient intake of individuals consumingraw kale. Methods: Six staff members measured curly and lacinato kale using standard procedures and 14 study participantsconsuming 4 - 6 cups raw leafy vegetables/day measured one cup curly kale in their usual manner. Twenty-seven dietary recalls obtained from participants following the Wahls™ diet were entered intothe Nutrition Data System for Research and then recalculated using staff-measured curly kale cup weight. Results: Mean(SE) staff cup weight for lacinato kale was significantly higher than curly kale [21. 3 (1. 4) g vs 16. 0 (1. 4) g; p< 0. 0001]. Percent refuse was also higher for lacinato kale [mean(SD) 42. 0 (11. 4) % vs 28. 5 (3. 9) %; p= 0. 012]. Mean(SD) <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> moderately packed participant-measured cups [17. 5 (6. 4) g]was similar to staff cup weightbutfirmly packed participant cupsweighed more [46. 4 (4. 1) g]. Intake of vitamins K, C, A, manganese, copper, and folatewere significantly lower for diets calculated with the staff cup weight (p< 0. 0001). Conclusions: The new measured cup <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> raw kale is lower than previously reportedand reduces nutrient levels in diets containing raw kale. <b>Verification</b> <b>of</b> cup <b>weights</b> for other raw leafy vegetables may be warranted...|$|R
40|$|The {{microgravity}} {{in space}} affects {{the human body}} in many different ways, leading to postflight problems such as orthostatic intolerance and postural instability. Continuous monitoring is therefore becoming increasingly important, especially when related to the cardiovascular and vestibular system. Weight scales are ideal candidates {{for this type of}} monitoring due to their low cost and ease of use. In this thesis, the electronic design and experimental <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> a <b>weight</b> scale capable <b>of</b> cardiovascular health monitoring and postural analysis is presented. Ballistocardiography (BCG) circuits use strain gauges, amplifiers and filters to measure the forces exerted by accelerating blood onto the body, while an electrocardiography (ECG) circuit records the electrical activity of the heart with an innovative two-electrode set-up integrated with the scale. These circuits can be used to assess cardiovascular health. A two-electrode electromyography (EMG) circuit to monitor the electrical activity of the lower-body muscles may also be used in this system. A center of pressure (COP) circuit is described, based on a combination of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion. The EMG and COP circuits can be used in postural analysis. Designs for each of these circuits are presented, together with the design of a dedicated power supply circuit. The BCG, ECG and EMG circuits were assembled and tested, while the COP and power supply circuits are preliminary designs that will be assembled in the future. Tests with the BCG, ECG and EMG circuits provided signals corresponding to previous measurements with standard equipment. When combined with COP and power supply circuits, the systems developed in this thesis can be used for cardiovascular health monitoring and postural analysis, which has applications in both space physiology and clinical environments.
