50|$|One recent {{method of}} {{speeding}} up all this manual bale handling is the bale shredder, {{which is a}} large <b>vertical</b> <b>drum</b> with rotary cutting/ripping teeth {{at the base of}} the drum. The shredder is placed under the chute and several bales dropped in. A worker then pushes the shredder along the barn aisle as it rips up a bale and spews it out in a continuous fluffy stream of material.|$|E
50|$|Clearly {{the market}} for small steam {{traction}} engines could make use of a novel boiler design that avoided these problems. Following {{the lead of the}} London & Birmingham Railway's Bury locomotives, some small portable engines were already using cylindrical stayless fireboxes. These combined a cylindrical <b>vertical</b> <b>drum</b> with a domed top, both shapes that could support themselves well under pressure. In extreme cases for larger railway locomotives, these became the massive brass-clad 'Haycock' fireboxes that were so distinctive on early Great Western Railway locomotives.|$|E
5000|$|Drum Memory {{system with}} {{controller}} and two <b>vertical</b> <b>drum</b> memory devices. Each drum read and wrote 50 bits {{at a time}} in parallel so transferring data could be done quickly. The drums were organized as 17 fields with 8192 words per field for a total capacity of 139264 words. The motors that rotated the drums required 208 VAC at 45 Hz so a motor generator unit was required to change the frequency from 60 Hz. This added to the noise level in the computer room.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the same}} time as the CJ series were being built with gravity-discharge systems, a {{separate}} series of longer-bodied wagons were constructed with <b>vertical</b> <b>drums</b> and pneumatic discharge; these were originally intended for cement traffic, but later on similar wagons were used for flour, lime and sand traffic. The wagons involved were the JX (three drums) and FX (four drums), later becoming the VPAX/BX/CX and VPFX respectively. Later conversions, all from the VPFX class, created the VPLX and VZGX varieties for carrying lime and specially dried locomotive sand respectively.|$|R
50|$|The boiler is a {{cylindrical}} <b>vertical</b> water <b>drum</b> with a hemispherical domed top. This domed {{shape is}} strong enough not to require staying. The firebox is another hemispherical dome, riveted to the base foundation ring to give a narrow waterspace.|$|R
25|$|Large <b>vertical</b> <b>drums</b> (which the Aztecs called huehuetl) {{were made}} of wood and did not survive. The much lower {{standing}} kettle drums {{that have been found}} - often shaped like a bulbous jar on a pedestal, single or double - are earthenware. In depictions, the membrane is sometimes shown to consist of a jaguar pelt. In the Late-Postclassic Dresden Codex (34a), the drum connects to an open resonance chamber without membrane. Another type of kettle drum was portable and held under the arm. The horizontal slit-drums (tun, Aztec teponaztli) appear only after the close of the Classic Period, probably under Toltec influence. In addition there were tortoiseshell and turtleshell drums played with the hand (Herrera), or with a stick such as a deer antler.|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the gamma-neutron mapper (G@) is to provide {{accurate}} and quantitative spatial information of the gamma-ray and neutron radiation fields as a function of position about the excavation of a radioactive waste site. The GNM is designed to operate remotely and can be delivered to any point on an excavation by the robotic gantry crane developed by the dig-face project at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). It can also be easily adapted to other delivery systems. The GNM can be deployed over a waste site at a predetermined scan rate and has sufficient accuracy to identify and quantify radioactive contaminants of importance. The results reported herein are from a performance test conducted at the Transuranic Storage Area, Building 628, of the Radioactive Waste Management Complex located at the INEL. This building is an active interim-storage area for 55 -gal drums of transuranic waste from the Department of Energy`s Rocky Flats Plant. The performance test consisted of scanning a stack of drums five high by five wide. Prior to the test, radiation fields were measured by a health physicist {{at the center of the}} drums and ranged from 0. 5 mR/h to 35 mR/h. Scans of the drums using the GNM were taken at standoff distances from the <b>vertical</b> <b>drum</b> stack of 15 cm, 30 cm, 45 cm, and 90 cm. Data were acquired at scan speeds of 7. 5 cm/s and 15 cm/s. The results of these scans and a comparison of these results with the manifests of these drums are compared and discussed...|$|E
50|$|The boiler is a {{watertube}} boiler, {{with these}} tubes contained within a <b>vertical,</b> cylindrical outer <b>drum.</b> This drum is double-walled and forms a water jacket around the boiler, {{with a large}} vertical flue within. The inner flue has a complex cross section. It is stepped in three diameters, tapering towards the top. The central region is square in section, rather than round.|$|R
50|$|Made {{on a large}} <b>vertical</b> or {{horizontal}} <b>drums,</b> {{scale ice}} is formed on either the inner or outer surface of the drum by pouring a film of water over it, then contact freezing it into a thin sheet of ice. This ice is sub-cooled down to -7°C {{in order to make}} it brittle, then cracked off by a harvesting blade. The ice then falls by gravity into the ice store. These large, flat pieces are good for layering, and are available with a single evaporator up to 50 tonnes.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} operational problems with an evaporator is the build-up of scale. Its design is tailored to reduce this, and to make its cleaning as effective as possible. The usual design, as developed by Weir and the Admiralty, is for a <b>vertical</b> cylindrical <b>drum,</b> heated by steam-carrying drowned coils in the lower portion. As they are entirely submerged, they avoid the most active region for the deposition of scale, around the waterline. Each coil consists {{of one or two}} spirals in a flat plane. Each coil is easily removed for cleaning, being fastened by individual pipe unions through the side of the evaporator. A large door is also provided, allowing the coils to be removed or replaced. Cleaning may be carried out mechanically, with a manual scaling hammer. This also has a risk of mechanical damage to the tubes, as the slightest pitting tends to act as a nucleus for scale or corrosion. It is also common practice to break light scaling free by thermal shock, by passing steam through the coils without cooling water present or by heating the coils, then introducing cold seawater. In 1957 the trials ship , an obsolete heavy cruiser, was used for the first tests of the 'flexing element' distiller, where non-rigid heating coils flexed continually in service and so broke the scale free as soon as it formed a stiff layer.|$|R
50|$|Corresponds to {{the initial}} explorations of the site, {{composed}} of four structures; {{two of which are}} restored with rectangular shape with columns to the front, that limit spaces between the rooms, these two structures are part of the plaza with pyramidal foundation with central altar and other unexplored structures (mounds to the north and east of the plaza). The highlight of this complex is the circular pyramid, discovered in 1948 by Prof. Jose Corona Nuñez, it is the most important structure of the archaeological site that, from its design and finishing, constitutes {{one of the most beautiful}} works of the prehispanic architecture in western Mexico. “The monument is of round base 24 meters in diameter and 4 meters high, originally was a cylinder with <b>vertical</b> walls (compact <b>drum)</b> crowned with a perforated parapet with small cruciform windows that give the construction the aspect of a large brazier, with five stairs harmonically distributed in its contour”; in the superior part there are two rectangular altars, and it is known as a Quetzalcoatl or Ehécatl temple, due to its architectonic characteristics and elements.|$|R
5000|$|The Clayton forced-circulation steam {{generator}} {{does not have}} a steam drum in the typical sense. A series of small tubes that are part of one giant coil, usually made of steel, have feed water pumped through at great speed. The water is pumped {{from the top of the}} {{steam generator}} down to the bottom and out. The tubes that are arranged in such a way that the combustion gasses pass around the tube subsequently heating the water. Essentially, the arrangement can be best described as having a large thin walled coil of pipe wrapping around the circumference of a <b>vertical</b> steel <b>drum</b> looping around and down until it reaches the bottom. As only some of the water may become steam, it is important to separate the two and send any water back through to absorb more heat. If this separation does not occur, the damage to the system could be costly. If steam goes through the generation tubes inside, the tubes may overheat and become weak, and if water is allowed down into the steam system, corrosion, water hammer, or other ill effects may occur. To combat this, after exiting the steam generator, the mixture is put through a centrifugal steam separator which does exactly that producing steam that is above ninety-nine percent dry saturated steam. If superheated steam is desired, an additional coil is run back through the steam generator. To maintain a constant level of water in the steam separator, the feed pump in conjunction with a leveling system is utilized. A great advantage to this system is that steam can be generated very quickly. However, the downside to this system is the complete dependence on a constant supply of feed water. Without the constant supply, the system may be subject to a massive and expensive damage ...|$|R
40|$|Part 6 of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) {{describes}} {{several types}} of channelizing devices {{that can be used}} to warn road users and guide them through work zones; these devices include cones, tubular markers, <b>vertical</b> panels, <b>drums,</b> barricades, and temporary raised islands. On higher speed/volume roadways, <b>drums</b> and/or <b>vertical</b> panels have been popular choices in many states, due to their formidable appearance and the enhanced visibility they provide when compared to standard cones. However, due to their larger size, drums also require more effort and storage space to transport, deploy and retrieve. Recent editions of the MUTCD have introduced new devices for channelizing; specifically of interest for this study is a taller (> 36 inches) but thinner cone. While this new device does not offer a comparable target value to that of drums, the new devices are significantly larger than standard cones and they offer improved stability as well. In addition, these devices are more easily deployed and stored than drums and they cost less. Further, for applications previously using both drums and tall cones, the use of tall cones only provides the ability for delivery and setup by a single vehicle. An investigation of the effectiveness of the new channelizing devices provides a reference for states to use in selecting appropriate traffic control for high speed, high volume applications, especially for short term or limited duration exposures. This study includes a synthesis of common practices by state DOTs, as well as daytime and nighttime field observations of driver reactions using video detection equipment. The results of this study are promising for the day and night performance of the new tall cones, comparing favorably to the performance of drums when used for channelizing in tapers. The evaluation showed no statistical difference in merge distance and location, shy distance, or operating speed in either daytime or nighttime conditions. The study should provide a valuable resource for state DOTs to utilize in selecting the most effective channelizing device for use on high speed/high volume roadways where timely merging by drivers is critical to safety and mobility...|$|R
