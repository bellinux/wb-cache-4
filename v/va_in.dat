25|$|As Jefferson turned more {{attention}} to Poplar Forest, he brought slaves from Monticello, Elk Hill, Indian Camp, and Judith's Creek, thus increasing the slave population at Poplar Forest. Jefferson kept consistent records of the slaves living at Poplar Forest; these records show that the slave population fluctuated between as few as 28 {{and as many as}} 95 individual slaves were working at Poplar Forest between the years 1774 and 1819. As an active participant in the slave trade, Jefferson sold and purchased slaves throughout the time he owned Poplar Forest, including a sale of 40 slaves from his various properties in Bedford County, <b>VA</b> <b>in</b> the 1790s. The Eppses inherited the house, about 1,075 acres of land, and several enslaved men and women after Jefferson’s death in 1825. The Cobbs and Hutter families also used slave labor on the property through emancipation, and maintained some former slaves as hired workers following.|$|E

On 26 January 2012, the U.S. Center For Disease Control's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry challenged this with their finding that former spray aircraft were indeed contaminated and the aircrews exposed to harmful levels of dioxin.

2500|$|George Stacy (1831–1897) George Stacy was a Civil War, field {{photographer}} {{and later a}} prolific publisher of stereoviews, not necessisarily his own. The first reference to George Stacy being a photographer may be in New Brunswick Canada. A photographer by that name placed and advertisement in a [...] Federicton, New Brunswick newspaper dated July 7, 1857. [...] The advertisement stated: SOMETHING NEW just received in Stacy's Ambrotype room and advertised stereoscopes and other photographic needs. The earliest confirmed Stacy, stereoveiws are a series he took of the Prince of Whales' visit to Portland, ME. Oct. 20, 1860, and the renowned Fortress Monroe series in June 1861. George Stacy had a storefront at 691 Broadway in NY, NY from 1861 to 1865.

In 1959, after {{recovering from the}} ill effects of cyanide poisoning, Whitney sold his Rochester business and moved to New York City, opening a gallery at 585 Broadway with Andrew W. Paradise, Mathew Brady's [...] "right-hand man." [...] Nevertheless, {{during the winter of}} 1861–62, Brady would commission Whitney to take [...] "views of the fortifications around Washington and places of interest for the Government." [...] These would include scenes in and around Arlington, Falls Church and Alexandria, <b>VA.</b> <b>In</b> March 1862, Brady again dispatched Whitney and Brady operator, David Woodbury, to take photographs on the Bull Run battlefield. Whitney also relates that he took views at Yorktown, Williamsburg, White House, Gaines' Mill, and Westover and Berkeley Landings during McClellan's Peninsula Campaign. Whitney personally appears in an unusually large number of photographs from 1861 to 1863, and while {{there is no question that}} Whitney took photographs for Brady, alas, there are no wartime views specifically ascribed to him. Whitney's last documented self-portrait (Anthony, Views in Washington City, 2733) is on March 27, 1863 during which time he documented the Southern Plains Indian Delegation inside the White House's well lit conservatory (2734, 2735). In addition to Anthony's post-war views with back label attributions to Whitney & Paradise, Whitney is also listed as working with a Mr. Beckwith in Norwalk, Connecticut. from 1865 to 1871, and then alone in Norwalk from 1873 to 1880. Lastly he can be placed in Wilton, Connecticut from 1879 to 1886.|$|E
2500|$|African American troops faced {{discrimination}} {{in the form of}} the disproportionate issuance of blue discharges. The blue discharge (also called a [...] "blue ticket") was a form of administrative discharge created in 1916 to replace two previous discharge classifications, the administrative discharge without honor and the [...] "unclassified" [...] discharge. It was neither honorable nor dishonorable. Of the 48,603 blue discharges issued by the Army between December 1, 1941, and June 30, 1945, 10,806 were issued to African Americans. This accounts for 22.2% of all blue discharges, when African Americans made up 6.5% of the Army in that time frame. Blue discharge recipients frequently faced difficulties obtaining employment and were routinely denied the benefits of the G. I. Bill by the Veterans Administration (<b>VA).</b> <b>In</b> October 1945, Black-interest newspaper The Pittsburgh Courier launched a crusade against the discharge and its abuses. Calling the discharge [...] "a vicious instrument that should not be perpetrated against the American Soldier", the Courier rebuked the Army for [...] "allowing prejudiced officers to use it as a means of punishing Negro soldiers who do not like specifically unbearable conditions". The Courier specifically noted the discrimination faced by homosexuals, another group disproportionately discharged with blue tickets, calling them [...] "'unfortunates' of the Nation...being preyed upon by the blue discharge" [...] and demanded to know [...] "why the Army chooses to penalize these 'unfortunates' who seem most in need of Army benefits and the opportunity to become better citizens under the educational benefits of the GI Bill of Rights". The Courier printed instructions on how to appeal a blue discharge and warned its readers not to quickly accept a blue ticket out of the service because of the negative effect it would likely have on their lives.|$|E
