50|$|Since verbose textual {{messages}} are stressing bandwidth limits for debug, so-called catalog {{messages are}} provided. Catalog messages are compact binary messages that replace strings with numeric values. The translation from this {{value to the}} <b>verbose</b> <b>message</b> {{is done by the}} trace receiving analysis tool with the help of XML collateral information. This information is provided by the software build process using an XML schema {{that is part of the}} specification as well.|$|E
5000|$|Operating {{procedures}} were insecure at first. Operators {{were forced to}} transmit <b>verbose</b> <b>messages</b> on fixed frequencies and at fixed times and intervals. This allowed German direction finding teams time to triangulate their positions. After several operators were captured or killed, {{procedures were}} made more flexible and secure. The SOE wireless operators were also known as [...] "The Pianists".|$|R

2500|$|Support for {{replaceable}} GINA DLLs {{was introduced}} with Windows NT Server 3.51 and Windows NT Workstation 4.0 SP3. Successive versions of Windows have introduced additional functionality into Winlogon, resulting in additional functionality {{that can be}} implemented by a replacement GINA. [...] Windows 2000, for example, introduced support for displaying status <b>messages</b> (including <b>verbose</b> <b>messages</b> that can be turned on through Group Policy) about the current state to the user (e.g. [...] "Applying computer settings..."), and starting applications in the user's context; this facilitates restarting Windows Explorer automatically if it crashes, as well as starting the Task Manager. Windows XP introduced support for Fast User Switching, Remote Desktop and a more interactive, simplified and user-friendly full-screen logon.|$|R
50|$|Despite its {{widespread}} adoption, many programmers {{have criticized}} the C++ language, including Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, and Ken Thompson. Issues include a lack of reflection or garbage collection, slow compilation times, perceived feature creep, and <b>verbose</b> error <b>messages,</b> particularly from template metaprogramming.|$|R
40|$|Background Making system {{functionality}} available via {{multi-channel access}} (MCA) {{can be achieved}} through exposing functions and business processes as software services. When offering MCA to a business process, system performance is an important consideration due to network limitations and <b>verbose</b> <b>messaging</b> in service-oriented technologies. Aims The first {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the potential impact on system performance and agility that may occur when an underlying business process is exposed for MCA. The second aim is to investigate if reengineering a system as a service-oriented architecture (SOA) improves agility. The work also aims to create an MCA reengineering method to transform systems from single-channel into multi-channel. Methods A case study was used, along with an experiment, to compare the performance and agility of native language calls (NLC) and protocol based messaging (PBM) for service messaging in a business process. The case study also investigated if reengineering a system as an SOA improves agility by comparing system and code metrics. A multi-channel access reengineering method (McARM) was created and evaluated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|DR DOS {{offered some}} {{extended}} command line tools with command line help, <b>verbose</b> error <b>messages,</b> sophisticated command line history and editing (HISTORY directive) {{as well as}} support for file and directory passwords built right into the kernel. It was also cheaper to license than MS-DOS, and was ROMable right from the start. The ROMed version of DR DOS was also named ROS (ROM Operating System). DRI was approached {{by a number of}} PC manufacturers who were interested in a third-party DOS, which prompted several updates to the system.|$|R
50|$|A {{fruitful}} {{source of}} cribs was re-encipherments of messages {{that had previously}} been decrypted either from a lower-level manual cipher or from another Enigma network. This was called a kiss and happened particularly with German naval messages being sent in the dockyard cipher and repeated verbatim in an Enigma cipher. One German agent in Britain, Nathalie Sergueiew, code named Treasure, who had been turned to work for the Allies, was very <b>verbose</b> in her <b>messages</b> back to Germany, which were then re-transmitted on the Abwehr Enigma network. She was kept going by MI5 because this provided long cribs, not because of her usefulness as an agent to feed incorrect information to the Abwehr.|$|R
40|$|All {{functions}} {{have been}} tested and found to work well on Arduino 1. 6. x. Please report any issues and I will {{do my best to}} fix them. Change log v 2. 1. 1 Fixed bugs that prevented the following functions from working properly powerDown() powerUp() suspendProg() resumeProg() v 2. 1. 0 Arduino Due compatible - refer to wiki for further details Fixed bug with write/readByteArray Added write/readCharArray Added a proper error checking function that gets called when #ifdef RUNDIAGNOSTIC is uncommented in SPIFlash. cpp. This function returns a <b>verbose</b> error <b>message</b> to the Serial console instead of the terse error codes of the previous version. The following functions have been deleted to enable bug fixes and uniformity in coding style. writeBytes() readBytes() They have been replaced with readByteArray() and writeByteArray(). v 2. 0. 0 BIG update in terms of speed. Sped up all functions atleast 25 x Compatible with ATTiny 85 All Read/Write/Erase functions can now take either (page number & offset) or (address) as arguments (Except readPage()) getAddress() can now return either a 32 -bit address or a page number & offset - Refer to Readme. md The following functions are deprecated to enable compatibility with other AVR chips. _printPageBytes() printPage() printAllPages() readSerialStr() They can be used by uncommenting them in the SPIFlash. cpp file. However, be warned, this particular block of code has only been tested with the Arduino IDE (1. 6. 5) and only with 8 -bit AVR based Arduino boards and will not be supported any further than v 2. 0. 0 of this librar...|$|R
40|$|MODIStsp is a "R" package {{devoted to}} automatizing the {{creation}} of time series of rasters derived from MODIS Land Products data. MODIStsp allows to perform several preprocessing steps (e. g., download, mosaicking, reprojection and resize) on MODIS data available within a given time period. Users {{have the ability to}} select which specific layers of the original MODIS HDF files they want to process. They also can select which additional Quality Indicators should be extracted from the aggregated MODIS Quality Assurance layers and, in the case of Surface Reflectance products, which Spectral Indexes should be computed from the original reflectance bands. For each output layer, outputs are saved as single-band raster files corresponding to each available acquisition date. Virtual files allowing access to the entire time series as a single file can be also created. All processing parameters can be easily selected with a user-friendly GUI, although non-interactive execution exploiting a previously created Options File is possible. Stand-alone execution outside an "R" environment is also possible, allowing to use scheduled execution of MODIStsp to automatically update time series related to a MODIS product and extent whenever a new image is available. MODIStsp v 1. 2. 1 Release Notes v 1. 2. 1 was released on 20 / 04 / 2016 Major Changes 	 	Modified format of "R" output time series from rts objects to RasterStack objects with temporal information added in the "z" attribute via setZ() 	 	 	Major changes/improvements in MODIStsp_extract function: 	 		Use of plain rasterstack with "z" attribute instead than rasterstackts 		Use of gdal_rasterize (gdalUtils) instead of rasterize (rgdal) to improve speed. Temporary shapes and rasters necessay are saved in "R" temporary folder and removed automatically 		Fixed bugs on functionality for point/lines shapefiles, according to what specified by the "small" and "small_method" parameters 		Added functionality for retrieving data for small polygons 		Added out_format selection - xts or plain data. frame 		Added possibility to use a shp filename as input directly 		Added conformity checks on inputs 		Added functionality to run without specifying start and end dates 		Added id_field parameter for choosing which column of the input SP object should be used for "naming" the columns of the output 	 	 	 	Removed possibility to use "complex" resampling methods when reprojecting (e. g., bilinear, cubic, etc.) to avoid incorrect resampling on categorical variables and "contamination" of good pixels' data. 	 Minor Changes 	Changed the input method for starting and ending dates selection in the GUI. Now a text field is used 	Added functionaluty for writing data ignore value on ENVI files 	Removed automatic deletion of XML files created by writeRaster to keep metadata information 	Changed names of products in the GUI for products with both TERRA and AQUA dataset to M*D 09 A 1, M*D 13 Q 1, etc [...] . 	Modified code syntax to satisfy R code styling guidelines 	Modified roxygen parameters so that only required functions are imported from imported packages 	Updated and corrected the list of dependencies 	Updated required "R" version to 3. 2, and minimum versions for dependent packages to current versions. 	Added Welcome message 	Updated links to LPDAAC product description pages 	Changed all "print" and "cat" calls to show messages/warnings to "message" or "warning" to allow easy disabling MODIStsp <b>verbose</b> <b>messages</b> 	Using "R" tempfile/tempdir to save vrt files Bug Fixes 	Corrected a bug that threw an error in case incorrect bounding box specifie...|$|R
