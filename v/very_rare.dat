Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E

40|$|In 1907 Dreibladt first {{described}} this rare tumor as ′pseudoadenoma admantium′ {{and since it}} is peculiar to the mouth and contains some cells with a superficial resemblance to the internal enamel epithelium, it is often linked, with the ameloblastoma - a tumor with neither the clinical nor the histopathological feature of this very benign lesion. This case presents the <b>very</b> <b>rarest</b> extraosseous example of the tumor of a 20 year old female, with the painless gingival swelling in right maxillary permanent canine region...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{etiology}} of eosinophilic cholecystitis is still obscure, the postulated causes include allergies, parasites, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. It is sometimes accompanied by several complications, but a simultaneous onset with pericarditis is <b>very</b> <b>rares.</b> A 28 -year-old woman complained of acute right hypocondrial pain and dyspnea associated with systemic eruption. Several imaging modalities revealed acute cholecystitis and pericarditis with massive pericardial effusion. A marked peripheral blood eosinophilia was observed, and the eruption was diagnosed as urticaria. Her serum had a high tite...|$|R
5|$|Adrenal {{tumors are}} {{commonly}} found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging.

5000|$|This {{garden was}} {{significant}} {{in that it}} allowed Castor and fellow scientists like Pliny to encounter up close what they might have only read about in rare scientific texts, which might be vague in their botanical descriptions, and largely lacked illustration. In the 16th century, German botanist Hieronymus Bock cited Castor {{as an example of}} why illustrations in botanical texts were of low value: the pioneers in the field would simply grow their own examples, and only needed illustrations of the <b>very</b> <b>rarest</b> specimens. (Other scholars have suggested that Bock was simply trying to justify omitting illustrations {{in order to keep the}} cost of his books down.) ...|$|R

5|$|Congenital {{malformation}} or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more similar}} is the <b>very</b> <b>rare</b> Lactarius semisanguifluus. Its milk also discolours within 5 to 8minutes to maroon. The cap of older fruit bodies is nearly {{completely}} greenish. It is also common under pines. The most similar {{and also the}} most closely related fungus is Lactarius fennoscandicus, a boreal to subalpine species. Its cap is distinctly zoned and brown-orange. Sometimes the cap has purple-grey tones. The stem is pale to blunt orange-ochre.|$|E

Knox, previously brand director for Robertson's and later Chief Operating Officer of the Culinary Brands Division of RHM, told The Herald newspaper in Scotland in 2001 {{that the decision to}} remove the Golly symbol from Robertson's jam and marmalade jars was taken after research found that children were not familiar with the character, although it still appealed to the older generations. [...] "We sell 45 million jars of jam and marmalade each year and they have pretty much all got Golly on them," [...] said Ms Knox. [...] "We also sell 250,000 Golly badges to collectors and only get 10 letters a year from people who don't like the Golliwog image."

2500|$|In 1987, {{the former}} {{president}} of Capitol Records, Alan Livingston, released for sale 24 [...] "first state" [...] butcher covers from his private collection. When the original cover was scrapped in June 1966, Livingston took a case of already-sealed [...] "Butcher" [...] albums from the warehouse before they were to be pasted over with the new covers, and kept them in a closet at his home. These albums were first offered for sale at a Beatlefest convention at the Marriott Hotel near Los Angeles International Airport on Thanksgiving weekend 1987 by Livingston's son. These still-sealed pristine items, which included nineteen mono and five stereo versions, are the <b>very</b> <b>rarest</b> [...] "pedigree" [...] specimen [...] "Butcher Covers" [...] in existence.
