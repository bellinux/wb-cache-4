5|$|By April 2008, Ezarik {{had largely}} reduced her lifecasting {{productions}} {{to a less}} frequent basis. She had resumed pursuit of her web designer and <b>video</b> <b>editor</b> career and was living in Carnegie. Her new equipment by Nokia enabled her to lifecast and produce streaming video live without a computer connection. She continued to make weekly appearances on her own iJustine website at www.ijustine.tv. Still a Carnegie resident at the time, Ezarik planned to be vacationing in North Carolina when the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 and hoped to find an AT wireless store to upgrade while on vacation. That June, Ezarik was named by Intel and its PR firm Ogilvy & Mather to a 10-member social media strategy advisory board. In late 2008, she relocated her base of operation from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Los Angeles, California.|$|E

500|$|Peterson {{has made}} three cameo {{appearances}} in the films of Gus Van Sant, and as of 1995 had appeared in more Van Sant films than any other actor. His first was Drugstore Cowboy, in which a Peterson commercial plays on the television. Van Sant later cast Peterson in a non-speaking role as a police chief in My Own Private Idaho and used another Peterson commercial in To Die For. Peterson also appeared in Mr. Holland's Opus, which was filmed in Portland. Van Sant related to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "So many people responded that I decided to keep using him." [...] Van Sant and Peterson have used the same <b>video</b> <b>editor,</b> Wade Evans, and Van Sant bought his Magic Chef refrigerator from Peterson.|$|E
500|$|The in-game {{features}} {{added in}} the port were well received. The addition of the <b>Video</b> <b>Editor</b> was met with positive reactions; GameSpot's Calvert called it [...] "a {{great way to get}} creative", while Kieron Gillen of Eurogamer criticised the unpredictability in its timing. Critics also praised the addition of the customisable radio station, which allows players to listen to their own choice of music; Tom Chick of 1UP.com named it the best feature of the port, and Steven Hopper of GameZone called it a [...] "great touch". The port's upgrade to 32 concurrent players in the online multiplayer mode, as opposed to the console version's 16 players, was also met with positive feedback; Eurogamer's Gillen said that the [...] "possibility for mayhem... increases", while Will Tuttle of GameSpy felt that the player increase [...] "changes the action significantly".|$|E
500|$|Drakengard 2 was {{announced}} in December 2004. Producer Takamasa Shiba and character designer Kimihiko Fujisaka returned to the team, alongside actor Shinnosuke Ikehata, who voiced the dragon Angelus and its partner Caim in the previous game. The original director, Yoko Taro, originally proposed a space adventure involving dragons, but this was vetoed at an early stage. Yoko {{was not involved in}} creating the narrative as he had been in Drakengard, being mostly tied up with another project, though he was able to observe the project's progress. He and Drakengard 2s director Akira Yasui suffered from creative differences, with the result that Yoko termed their relationship on the project as a [...] "love-hate" [...] story in a 2013 interview concerning the series. Their relationship inspired one of the stories created for an in-game weapon. Yoko was eventually brought on fairly late in the game's production to act as <b>video</b> <b>editor</b> for the CGI cutscenes and trailers. The game's cast featured multiple film and television actors, including Ryo Katsuji, Saki Aibu, Koyuki and veteran actor Yoshio Harada. Shiba commented {{at the time that he}} felt they had gathered a very good voice cast for the game.|$|E

[...] Murphy saw Harvey perform and the collaboration began with her requesting him to take promotional photographs for Let England Shake in July 2010. In addition to the album's photography, originally Harvey and Murphy planned to record a documentary of the recording process of the album; however, instead, twelve short films, one for each of the album's songs, were made. Each film incorporates a mix of still photography and video documenting the album's themes [...] "in the manner of classic photographic reportage - recording real & spontaneous situations." [...] Murphy travelled throughout England alone [...] "with little equipment", due to a low budget and lack of assistants, and after photography, directing and producing the films solely by himself, edited the final product in Berlin, Germany with <b>video</b> <b>editor</b> Sebastian Gollek.|$|E
