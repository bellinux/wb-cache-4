She was laid up in reserve in March 1946 and converted in 1952 to a research vessel for Canadian Department of Marine and Fisheries, a role she served in until the early 1980s when she was acquired by the trust. She has been restored to her wartime appearance and serves in the summer months as a museum ship on loan to the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia, while wintering securely in the naval dockyard at CFB Halifax {{under the care of}} Maritime Forces Atlantic, Maritime Command. Sackvilles presence in Halifax is considered <b>very</b> <b>appropriate,</b> given the port was an important North American convoy assembly port during the war. Sackville makes her first appearance each spring when she is towed by a naval tug from HMC Dockyard to a location off Point Pleasant Park on the first Sunday in May to participate in the Commemoration of the Battle of the Atlantic ceremonies held at a memorial in the park overlooking the entrance to Halifax Harbour. Sackville typically hosts several dozen RCN veterans on this day and has also participated in several burials at sea for dispersing the ashes of RCN veterans of the Battle of the Atlantic at this location.|$|E
500|$|Other mythos {{elements}} were devised as the series progressed. The writers had originally envisioned only spending small portions of episodes within the parallel universe, {{but as they}} wrote these episodes within Season 3, they brought out the idea of setting entire episodes within the parallel universe. This necessitated {{the development of the}} alternate versions of the main characters, which Pinkner considered [...] "a great playground just for imagination". The actors themselves found this concept exciting, as it allowed them to play different characters but with the same background and considered it a creative challenge. Similarly, having Peter erased from the timeline as part of the finale for Season 3 was an idea that grew over the course of that season. The writers were aware this would be a risky move but felt the idea was <b>very</b> <b>appropriate</b> for Fringe, and opted to write towards this after considering all the consequences. Pinkner noted that this gave them an opportunity to [...] "reset the character relationships" [...] and determine the key aspects that would remain without Peter, as well as [...] "making the audience uncomfortable at times". The cast was not initially sold with the idea, but came around as the fourth season progressed.|$|E

40|$|Techniques {{devoted to}} {{generate}} a triangular mesh from images either take as starting point a segmented image or generate a mesh without distinguish-ing different structures contained in the image. The pre-segmentation {{and the absence of}} well defined structures may impose difficulties in using the result-ing mesh in some applications, as for example numerical simulations. In this work we present a new technique for mesh generation that aims at eliminat-ing the need for pre-processing by building the segmentation into the mesh generation process. Furthermore, the proposed technique generates theoreti-cally guaranteed quality meshes, rendering our framework <b>very</b> <b>appropriated</b> for applications in numerical simulation as well as in image modeling. In fact, the effectiveness of our approach in both applications are presented and discussed. ...|$|R

In this paper, a new proportional jitter scheduling algorithm, called Proportional Average Jitter (PAJ), is created for the Model of Proportional Jitter Differentiated Services. In addition, its quality, in terms of long-terms and short-term jitter within only one hop, is also analyzed. Furthermore, the performance of Proportional Jitter Differentiated model using PAJ as scheduling algorithm is compared to this model but using Relative Jitter Packet Scheduling, and to Proportional Delay Differentiated model using Waiting Time Priority, is compared, too...|$|R

[...] In a similar vein, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan wrote: [...] "Harvard appears to have quietly expelled a few deviates while avoiding a public scandal that would have ruined their reputations and damaged Harvard’s good name.

2500|$|Since its 1970 revision, the Roman Missal {{no longer}} categorizes Mass as High or Low (in Latin, solemnis or lecta), and distinguishes Mass only as celebrated with a {{congregation}} (with a subdivision according {{as it is}} celebrated {{with or without a}} deacon) or with participation by only one minister, and as celebrated with or without concelebrating priests. It recommends singing at all Masses, saying, for instance: [...] "Although it is not always necessary (e.g., in weekday Masses) to sing all the texts that are of themselves meant to be sung, every care should be taken that singing by the ministers and the people is not absent in celebrations that occur on Sundays and on holy days of obligation"; and: [...] "It is <b>very</b> <b>appropriate</b> that the priest sing those parts of the Eucharistic Prayer for which musical notation is provided." [...] The distinction between High and Low Mass is necessarily observed where the Tridentine form of the Roman Rite continues to be used.

2500|$|On the April 25 show, {{the theme}} of which was Greatest Love Songs and {{featured}} guest coaches Andrea Bocelli and David Foster, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe forced contestant Taylor Hicks to change his song a day before air time (and {{the same day as}} the dress rehearsal).

Hicks changed his song at the last minute to [...] "Just Once" [...] (James Ingram) and appeared very uncomfortable on stage. Hicks fans were distressed, feeling that a) Hicks' original choice of song was <b>very</b> <b>appropriate</b> to the theme; b) The producers changed the song at the last minute even though they must have known Hicks' choice the previous week as they must obtain clearance for all songs; c) Lythgoe's statement {{that it was not a}} song Andrea Bocelli would sing was dubious, as other song choices that were approved were songs sung by Bryan Adams ("Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman," [...] sung by Chris Daughtry) and Donny Hathaway ("A Song for You," [...] sung by Elliott Yamin).|$|E
2500|$|Renaissance art, heavily {{influenced}} by the [...] "rebirth" [...] (French: renaissance) {{of interest in the}} art and culture of classical antiquity, initially continued the trends of the preceding period without fundamental changes, but using classical clothing and architectural settings which were after all <b>very</b> <b>appropriate</b> for New Testament scenes. However a clear loss of religious intensity is apparent in many Early Renaissance religious paintings – the famous frescoes in the Tornabuoni Chapel by Domenico Ghirlandaio (1485–90) seem more interested in the detailed depiction of scenes of bourgeois city life than their actual subjects, the Life of the Virgin and that of John the Baptist, and the Magi Chapel of Benozzo Gozzoli (1459–61) is more a celebration of Medici status than an Arrival of the Magi. Both these examples (which still used contemporary clothes) come from Florence, the heart of the Early Renaissance, and the place where the charismatic Dominican preacher Savonarola launched his attack on the worldliness of the life and art of the citizens, culminating in his famous Bonfire of the Vanities in 1497; in fact other preachers had been holding similar events for decades, but on a smaller scale. Many Early Renaissance artists, such as Fra Angelico and Botticelli were extremely devout, and the latter was one of many who fell under the influence of Savonarola.|$|E

The vegetation index obtained by multispectral satellite data, when properly calibrated and standardized, can be used synergistically for a quantitatiive analysis of land surface change. Satellite observations provide an ideal data set to monitor changes of arid and semi-arid regions, due to its spatial resolution, its temporal frequency, and its span of observation for different spectral bands. The "Campos Rupestres" predominates over other physiognomies which comprises the "Serra do Cipó" located in Minas Gerais-­Brasil.
