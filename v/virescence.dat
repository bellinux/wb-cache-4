50|$|<b>Virescence</b> is the {{abnormal}} {{development of}} green pigmentation in plant parts {{that are not}} normally green, like shoots or flowers (in which case it is known as floral <b>virescence).</b> <b>Virescence</b> is closely associated with phyllody (the abnormal development of flower parts into leaves) and witch's broom (the abnormal growth of a dense mass of shoots from a single point). They are often symptoms of the same disease affecting the plants, typically those caused by phytoplasmas. The term chloranthy is also sometimes used for floral <b>virescence,</b> though it is more commonly used for phyllody.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} {{is also known}} as phyllomorphy or frondescence; though the latter may sometimes refer more generically to foliage, leafiness, or the process of leaf growth. Phyllody is usually differentiated from floral <b>virescence,</b> wherein the flowers merely turn green in color, but otherwise retain their normal structure. However, floral <b>virescence</b> and phyllody (along with witch's broom and other growth abnormalities), commonly occur together as symptoms of the same diseases. The term chloranthy is also often used for phyllody (particularly flowers exhibiting complete phyllody, such that it resembles leaf buds more than flowers), though in some cases it may refer to floral <b>virescence.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chlorophyll {{may also}} develop in tissues {{normally}} devoid of it. Thus usually white or colored tissue becomes green in color. This is called as <b>virescence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In many {{cultivated}} plants, phyllody {{is caused}} by infections of plant pathogens and/or infestations of ectoparasites. Aside from exhibiting phyllody, they may also exhibit other symptoms like <b>virescence,</b> witch's brooms, chlorosis, and stunted growth. Examples of these biotic factors include: ...|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "phyllody" [...] {{was coined}} by the English {{botanist}} Maxwell T. Masters {{in his book}} on plant abnormalities, Vegetable Teratology (1869). The term is derived from Scientific Latin phyllodium, which is itself derived from Ancient Greek φυλλώδης (phullodes, 'leaf-like'). Like Morren, Masters also distinguished phyllody from <b>virescence.</b> He acknowledged [...] "frondescence" [...] and [...] "phyllomorphy" [...] as synonyms of phyllody.|$|E
5000|$|Phyllody of {{the petals}} can be {{expressed}} more mildly as a simple change in shape and color (in which case, it's more accurately <b>virescence),</b> or it {{can be expressed}} as fully formed leaves. It is more common among flowers which exhibit corollas of distinct petals (...) than in flowers in which the petals are fused into a single tube or bowl-like structure (...) [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} {{designed}} by a famous architect. The neighborhood contains a lake and many trees and it makes the neighborhood seem like a park. The acreage of <b>Virescence</b> takes up 80% of the neighborhood. Many kinds of trees are planted in the neighborhood, such as poplar, Firmiana simplex, willow and others. Besides {{the trees in the}} neighborhood, there are also many flowers, including gardenias (Chinese:栀子花), roses, peach blossoms, and orchids.|$|E
5000|$|The {{range of}} {{characteristic}} symptoms varies by the phytoplasma strain, timing of infection, plant species, temperature, age, {{and size of}} the plant. [...] The symptoms can be mistaken for herbicide damage. They include vein clearing until the entire leaf becomes chlorotic, stunting, deformation, <b>virescence</b> (greening of flowers), phyllody (development of leaf-like flower petals), reddening of foliage, reduced root system, and sterility. [...] Aster yellows does not typically kill perennial host plants.|$|E
5000|$|In 1832, the German-American {{botanist}} George Engelmann {{described the}} same condition {{in his work}} De Antholysi Prodromus. He gave it the name [...] "frondescence". Nineteen years later, the Belgian botanist Charles Jacques Édouard Morren also investigated the phenomenon in his book Lobelia (1851). Morren called the condition [...] "phyllomorphy", and unlike Engelmann, Morren explicitly distinguished phyllomorphy (wherein the floral parts are replaced by leaf-like structures) from <b>virescence</b> (wherein the affected parts, not necessarily floral, turn green but retain the original form or structure).|$|E
50|$|Phytoplasmas can infect {{and cause}} various {{symptoms}} {{in more than}} 700 plant species. One characteristic symptom is abnormal floral organ development including phyllody, (i.e., the production of leaf-like structures in place of flowers) and <b>virescence</b> (i.e., the development of green flowers attributable {{to a loss of}} pigment by petal cells). Phytoplasma-harboring flowering plants may nevertheless be sterile. The expression of genes involved in maintaining the apical meristem or in the development of floral organs is altered in the morphologically affected floral organs of phytoplasma-infected plants.|$|E
5000|$|A phytoplasma {{effector}} protein, SAP54, {{has been}} shown to induce <b>virescence</b> and phyllody when expressed in plants. SAP54 homologs have been identified in various phytoplasma species. Two SAP54 homologs, PHYL1 of the onion yellows phytoplasma and PHYL1PnWB of the peanut witches’ broom phytoplasma, induce phyllody-like floral abnormalities. These results suggest that PHYL1, SAP54, and their homologs form a phyllody-inducing gene family, the members of which are termed phyllogens. MADS-box transcription factors (MTFs) of the ABCE model play critical roles in floral organ development in Arabidopsis. Phyllogens interact directly with class A and class E MTFs, inducing protein degradation in a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent manner. [...] The accumulation of mRNAs encoding class B MTFs, the transcription of which is positively regulated by class A and class E MTFs, is drastically decreased in Arabidopsis constitutively expressing PHYL1. Phyllogens induce abnormal floral organ development by inhibiting the functions of these MTFs.|$|E
5000|$|Aster yellows is a chronic, {{systemic}} {{plant disease}} {{caused by a}} bacterium-like organism called a phytoplasma. The aster yellows phytoplasma (AYP) affects 300 species in 38 families of broad-leaf herbaceous plants, primarily in the aster family, as well as important cereal crops such as wheat and barley. Symptoms are variable and can include phyllody, <b>virescence,</b> chlorosis, stunting, and sterility of flowers. The aster leafhopper vector, Macrosteles quadrilineatus, moves the aster yellows phytoplasma from plant to plant. [...] Its economic burden is primarily felt in the carrot (Daucus carota ssp. sativus) crop industry, {{as well as the}} nursery industry. No cure is known for plants infected with aster yellows. [...] Infected plants should be removed immediately to limit the continued spread of the phytoplasma to other susceptible plants. However, in agricultural settings such as carrot fields, some application of chemical insecticides has proven to minimize the rate of infection by killing the vector.|$|E
40|$|Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum indicum L.) is an {{important}} floriculture crop grown {{in different parts of}} Karnataka, India for its beautiful cut flowers. Recently, there has been a decline in flower quality due to major pests and diseases. A field survey conducted during 2012 - 2013 in chrysanthemum-growing areas revealed the occurrence of <b>virescence</b> with an incidence of 5 to 10 % in nearly 6 to 8 ha of chrysanthemum fields in Mandya and Mysore districts. Symptoms including malformed flowers with greenish florets and reduced flower size and floral <b>virescence</b> with sepaloidy were observed. Diseased leaves and flower parts were collected and used for identification of the causative agent. Ten samples (6 symptomatic, 2 healthy, and 2 phytoplasma-associated with phyllody of Catheranthus roseus as positive control) were used for total genomic DNA isolation using GenElute Plant Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and the DNA was used as template to amplify the phytoplasma-specific 16 SrDNA gene using P 1 /P 7 primers followed by nested PCR using R 16 F 2 n/R 16 R 2 primers (Gundersen and Lee 1996). The expected 1. 25 -kb amplicon was detected only with DNA from symptomatic and positive control samples. Nested PCR products of all six phytoplasma-associated samples were purified and sequenced from both the directions using a ABIx 370 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA). The 16 SrDNA sequences were aligned using CodonCode Aligner (Centerville, MA) and analyzed by BLASTn. The analysis revealed that all six sequences shared 100 % identity with Cassava witches broom (KM 280680. 1) and Peanut witches broom (JX 403944. 1) phytoplasma. The in-silico RFLP pattern of F 2 n/R 2 primed region of 16 SrDNA gene analyzed by using iPhyClassifier (Zhao et al. 2009) revealed that the sequence shared 99. 8 % nucleotide sequence similarity with coefficient value of 1. 00 to the reference strain RFLP pattern of 16 Sr group II, subgroup A (Peanut witches broom phytoplasma; Accession No. L 33765. 1). Based on 16 SrDNA sequences and in-silico RFLP analysis, the phytoplasma associated with the chrysanthemum <b>virescence</b> was identified as a member of 16 SrII-A group. The representative sequence was deposited in GenBank with Accession Number KP 027534. 1. Phytoplasma associated with little leaf and witches broom of chrysanthemum have been reported earlier from India and were assigned to groups 16 SrI-A and 16 SrII, respectively (Kumar et al. 2012; Raj et al. 2007). Chrysanthemum <b>virescence</b> phytoplasma belonging to Candidatus phytoplasma aurantifolia has been reported from Japan and has not been assigned to any group (Naito et al. 2007). The occurrence of <b>virescence</b> is of great importance as it affects the overall productivity and quality of flowers, which reduces the market value of chrysanthemum. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a group 16 SrII-A phytoplasma associated with chrysanthemum <b>virescence</b> in India...|$|E

40|$|Phytoplasmas are insect-transmitted {{bacterial}} plant pathogens {{that cause}} considerable {{damage to a}} diverse range of agricultural crops globally. Symptoms induced in infected plants suggest that these phytopathogens may modulate developmental processes within the plant host. We report herein that Aster Yellows phytoplasma strain Witches’ Broom (AY-WB) readily infects the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Columbia, inducing symptoms that are characteristic of phytoplasma infection, such as the production of green leaf-like flowers (<b>virescence</b> and phyllody) and increased formation of stems and branches (witches’ broom). We found {{that the majority of}} genes encoding secreted AY-WB proteins (SAPs), which are candidate effector proteins, are expressed in Arabidopsis and the AY-WB insect vector Macrosteles quadrilineatus (Hemiptera; Cicadellidae). To identify which of these effector proteins induce symptoms of phyllody and <b>virescence,</b> we individually expressed the effector genes in Arabidopsis. From this screen, we have identified a novel AY-WB effector protein, SAP 54, that alters floral development, resulting in the production of leaf-like flowers that are similar to those produced by plants infected with this phytoplasma. This study offers novel insight into the effector profile of an insect-transmitted plant pathogen and reports to our knowledge the first example of a microbial pathogen effector protein that targets flower development in a host...|$|E

40|$|Using {{molecular}} tools, {{the spread}} of phytoplasma diseases in a papaya plantation was investigated for 3 years to identify phytoplasma strains affecting papaya. insect vectors and alternative plant hosts. Five phytoplasma strains (SPLL-V 4, TBB, CaWB, StLL and WaLLvar) were associated with papaya yellow crinkle disease and one phytoplasma strain (PDB) was associated with papaya dieback disease. The most prevalent strains were TBB and SPLL-V 4 which occurred in 94 % of infected papaya. There was a significant correlation between phyllody and TBB. and <b>virescence</b> and SPLL-V 4. although other phytoplasma types could also be associated with either phyllody or <b>virescence.</b> No mixed infections were detected in diseased papaya. Disease progress curves for TBB and SPLL-V 4 showed a sigmoid response reaching a maximum disease incidence of 16 % after 24 months. The rate of disease spread was best described by a logistic model which showed that TBB spread at a slightly higher rate than SPLL-V 4. Ten phytoplasma strains were detected in 14 alternative plant species, however. TBB and SPLL-V 4 were present {{in only a few}} individual plants of some of these species, so these alternative hosts would probably not have provided a significant infection source to papaya.
