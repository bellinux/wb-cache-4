40|$|AbstractThe American Society for Virology, {{the very}} first such Society to be formed anywhere, was founded {{at a meeting of}} some 40 <b>virologists</b> at Chicago O'Hare International airport on June 9, 1981. They met after {{a decade and a half}} of intense {{discussion}} that originated at the 9 th International Congress of Microbiology in Moscow in 1966 when a small group of <b>virologists</b> requested the International Association of Microbiological Societies to form a Virology Section within IAMS, and this request was rejected. <b>Virologists</b> therefore held their own First International Congress of Virology in Helsinki in 1968 which was very successful and generated intense informal discussion among leading <b>virologists</b> in this country as to the desirability of founding an American society for <b>virologists.</b> Proposals were circulated and discussed which resulted in the informal Chicago meeting that created the mechanism for founding the ASV and organizing its 1 st Annual Meeting at Cornell in Ithaca in August 1982...|$|R

5|$|The first {{candidate}} polio vaccine, {{based on}} one serotype of a live but attenuated (weakened) virus, {{was developed by the}} <b>virologist</b> Hilary Koprowski. Koprowski's prototype vaccine was given to an eight-year-old boy on 27 February 1950. Koprowski continued to work on the vaccine throughout the 1950s, leading to large-scale trials in the then Belgian Congo and the vaccination of seven million children in Poland against serotypes PV1 and PV3 between 1958 and 1960.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly {{reproduce}} HeLa cells {{in a laboratory}} setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research. For example, by 1954, Jonas Salk was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the polio vaccine. To test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced in the first-ever cell production factory. Additionally, Chester M. Southam, a leading <b>virologist,</b> injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, and healthy individuals in order to observe if cancer could be transmitted {{as well as to}} examine if one could become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune response.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Railly gives {{a lecture}} about the Cassandra complex {{to a group}} of scientists. At the post-lecture book signing, Dr. Peters points out to Railly that apocalypse alarmists {{represent}} the sane vision, while humanity's gradual destruction of the environment is the real lunacy. Cole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it, and when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and set out in search of him. When they confront him, however, Goines denies any involvement with the group and says that in 1990 Cole originated the idea of wiping out humanity with a virus stolen from Goines' <b>virologist</b> father.|$|E

In 1935 American biochemist and <b>virologist</b> Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it to be mostly made from protein. A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts. A problem for early scientists was {{that they did not know}} how to grow viruses without using live animals. The breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs, but this problem was solved in 1949 when John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins grew polio virus in cultures of living animal cells. Over 5,000 species of virus have been discovered.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{experienced}} {{an outbreak of}} 58,000 and 35,000 polio cases, respectively, up from a typical number of some 20,000 a year. Amid this U.S. polio epidemic, millions of dollars were invested in finding and marketing a polio vaccine by commercial interests, including Lederle Laboratories in New York {{under the direction of}} H. R. Cox. Also working at Lederle was Polish-born <b>virologist</b> and immunologist Hilary Koprowski of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, who tested the first successful polio vaccine, in 1950. His vaccine, however, being a live attenuated virus taken orally, was still in the research stage and would not be ready for use until five years after Jonas Salk's polio vaccine (a dead-virus injectable vaccine) had reached the market. Koprowski's attenuated vaccine was prepared by successive passages through the brains of Swiss albino mice. By the seventh passage, the vaccine strains could no longer infect nervous tissue or cause paralysis. After one to three further passages on rats, the vaccine was deemed safe for human use. On 27 February 1950, Koprowski's live, attenuated vaccine was tested {{for the first time on}} an 8-year-old boy living at Letchworth Village, an institution for the physically and mentally disabled located in New York. After the child suffered no side effects, Koprowski enlarged his experiment to include 19 other children.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{first part}} of this review {{discussed}} the facilities that are needed to provide a competent diagnostic virology service {{at the turn of the}} century. Just as important is to consider who will run it. Hitherto, there have been specialist <b>virologists</b> in most countries. Their roles have evolved with time, developing and running a variety of diagnostic tests, often to answer local needs and their own curiosity, and frequently linked to their research projects. Recently, the advent of an increasingly long list of commercial tests has raised the real possibility of introducing standardized centrally validated testing methods, and using them to bring laboratories up to a similarly uniform level. Unfortunately, they have also had the effect of seeming to make specialist <b>virologists</b> unnecessary, except in a few central reference laboratories. As a consequence, and because of increasing pressure on health service resources, vacated senior virology posts have remained unfilled and this now threatens the career structure of those who want to become, and continue as, <b>virologists.</b> This review explores these issues and offers a possible solution...|$|R
5000|$|Cold War {{tensions}} caused Western {{scientists to}} refuse the {{reports from the}} Russians {{about the effectiveness of}} the Sabin vaccine. [...] However, mass vaccinations of Sabin’s vaccine spread throughout Eastern Europe from 1960-1963. [...] Just as some Soviet <b>virologists</b> did not trust the Western Salk vaccine, Americans had similar reservations about the Sabin vaccine from the Soviet side. [...] However other Soviet <b>virologists</b> argued that the Salk vaccine could be considered safe, since the Americans tested it on their own people. [...] They considered that the Sabin vaccine must be potentially dangerous because the Americans did not wish to test it on their own society.|$|R

40|$|This article aims {{to open up}} the biographical {{black box}} of three experts working in the {{boundary}} zone between science, policy and public debate. A biographical-narrative approach is used to analyse the roles played by the <b>virologists</b> Albert Osterhaus, Roel Coutinho and Jaap Goudsmit in policy and public debate. These figures were among the few leading <b>virologists</b> visibly active in the Netherlands during the revival of infectious diseases in the 1980 s. Osterhaus and Coutinho in particular are still the key figures today, as demonstrated during the outbreak of novel influenza A (H 1 N 1). This article studies the various political and communicative challenges and dilemmas encountered by these three <b>virologists,</b> and discusses the way in which, strategically or not, they handled those challenges and dilemmas during the various stages of the field’s recent history. Important in this respect is their pursuit of a public role that is both effective and credible.
