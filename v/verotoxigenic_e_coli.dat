5000|$|Shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) and <b>verotoxigenic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (VTEC) are {{strains of}} the {{bacterium}} Escherichia coli that produce either Shiga toxin or Shiga-like toxin (verotoxin). Only {{a minority of the}} strains cause illness in humans. The ones that do are collectively known as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and are major causes of foodborne illness. When infecting humans, they often cause gastroenteritis, enterocolitis, and bloody diarrhea (hence the name [...] "enterohemorrhagic") and sometimes cause the severe complication of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). The group and its subgroups are known by various names. They are distinguished from other pathotypes of intestinal pathogenic E. coli including enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC).|$|E
40|$|Porcine verotoxigenic Escherichia coli were {{characterized}} {{with respect to}} frequency of occurrence, serogroup, and association with disease, weaning, and selected properties of the bacterium. Of 668 strains of E. coli from southern Ontario pigs with enteric disease, 32 (4. 8 %) produced verotoxin at 10 (3) - 10 (7) cytotoxic doses per mL of culture supernatant. Of 22 isolates which belonged to O serogroups 138, 139 and 141, 15 produced verotoxin. Among other enterotoxigenic types of E. coli, two of 57 isolates of O 157 :K"V 17 " and two of 96 isolates of O 149 :K 91 were verotoxigenic. The remaining 13 <b>verotoxigenic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> belonged to O groups 2, 107, 120, 121 and 130. An additional 21 <b>verotoxigenic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> belonging to O groups 138, 139 and 141 and three to O 157 :K"V 17 " were identified {{in a collection of}} 47 E. coli recovered from weaned pigs with enteric disease. <b>Verotoxigenic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> were associated with postweaning diarrhea, bloody stools, sudden death and edema disease. They were isolated at similar frequencies (14 %) from healthy weaned pigs, and from weaned pigs with enteric disease. Isolation rates from neonates were low and significantly different from rates in weaned pigs. Neutralizing antibody to verotoxin was not detected in the sera of 45 pigs, which included pigs from herds with a history of edema disease. Verotoxin was not associated with production of colicin, hemolysin, or enterotoxins or with any of 23 biochemical properties of the organisms. The serological data indicate that porcine <b>verotoxigenic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> are not a common source of <b>verotoxigenic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> for humans.

40|$|From {{one hundred}} samples {{collected}} from diarrhoeic calves, aging from 1 day to three weeks, {{a total of}} 81 isolates of Escherichia coli was isolated. Different areas were covered, Khartoum State, Khartoum North, Butri, Masoudia, Um Haraz (Northern Gezira), River Nile State and Kenana (White Nile State) for sample collection. The highest numbers of samples were received from The Clinic of Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Khartoum (25. 9 %). Preliminary identification of the isolates was carried out {{on the basis of}} morphology, Gram staining reaction and biochemical tests. They were Gram negative rods, mostly motile, aerobic and facultatively anaerobic, oxidase negative, but catalase, methyl red and indole positive. They fermented glucose, lactose, mannitol, trehalose and Arabinose with production of acid and gas, but failed to produce acetylmethylcarbinol, urease and H 2 S in TSI and to utilize citrates as a sole carbon source. Exceptionally, however, 16 isolates were non-motile (19. 7 %), six anaerogenic (7. 4 %) and one non-lactose fermenter (1. 3 %). Twelve isolates of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> were submitted to a reference laboratory in Germany, for serotyping. Four were reported as O untypable. The rest were typed as belonging to O 4, O 8, O 9, O 21, O 88 and O 153 somatic serogroups. Further characterization was performed for grouping of isolates into enterotoxigenic, <b>verotoxigenic</b> and fimbriated <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> Entrotoxigenicity, identification of heat-stable and heat-labile toxins using suckling mouse test and verocell monolayer assay, was done for 14 and 34 isolates, respectively; twelve and ten isolates were positive, respectively. Furthermore, fifty-one isolates of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> were tested with EIA detection kits to determine heat-stable toxin (STa); only ten isolates were positive. 12 Fimbriated isolates of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> were detected by fimbrex kits. Seventy-one isolates were tested using this agglutination test. Thirty of them were found to possess either one of the fimbrial antigens F 41, K 99 and K 88. None of the isolates tested had a 987 P antigen. Drug sensitivity test was performed on forty-four of the identified <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> isolates using nine antimicrobial drugs. They were Nalidixic acid, Neomycin, Tetracycline, Chloramphenicol, Ampicillin, Gentamycin, Sulfamethoxa- zole/Trimethoprim, Streptomycin, and Erthromycin. A considerable variation in their pattern of sensitivity was shown. Almost all isolates showed sensitivity to Chlora- mphnicol. On the other hand, the isolates were all insensitive to Erythromycin. Fortyone patterns of drug susceptibility reactions were obtained. Each pattern was represented by a single isolate with the exception of three of them which included two isolates each. A scheme of drug susceptibility patterns is put forward for use in routine clinical diagnosis as well as epidemiological investigations.

40|$|The {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli EDL 933 {{is known}} to cause infection in the intestine. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 {{is used as a}} probiotic strain to prevent infection (63). When the mouse intestine is pre-colonized with <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 it prevents <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 from growing up in the intestine. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 is not eliminated from the intestine; it stays at the level in which it was fed to the mice. The P 41 L envZ missense mutation was previously shown to causes an increase in the level of phosporylated OmpR (OmpR~P) produced (67). <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655 with the P 41 L missense envZ mutation is referred to as <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655 mot- 1. These changes result in an improvement of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655 colonization ability in the mouse intestine. The EnvZ/OmpR system positively regulates the small RNAs omrA and omrB (29). omrA and omrB were shown to negatively regulate a number of outer membrane genes including ompT, cirA, fepA, and fecA, (29). omrA and omrB work by hybridizing to mRNA thereby preventing translation from occurring (28). The mutant envZ gene was transferred to <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 to create <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1). The mutant envZ gene results in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 having improved colonization ability. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) grows slower than <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 wildtype on many sugars and in cecal mucus. The <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) mutant grows slower on galactose than <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 wildtype. When the ability to utilize galactose is eliminated from <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) it can no longer grow up in the mouse intestine in the presence of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 wildtype. This displays the importance of galactose utilization in the intestine for <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1). <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) may have access to a niche where galactose is being utilized that <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 is unable to inhabit. If <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 was able to inhabit that niche then it would seem likely that <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 would out compete <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) due to its superior ability to utilize galactose. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) was then colonized against <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 to see if its improved colonization ability also results in improved probiotic potential.

One type of pathogenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli,</b> Enterohemorrhagic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (EHEC), produces toxins called Shiga toxins (similar to the toxin produced by Shigella) and for this reason these <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> are commonly referred to as Shiga toxinproducing <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (STEC). The most well known type of STEC is <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 157, but there are many other types that can cause illness, such as <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 111 and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 26...|$|R
40|$|In the past, biofilm-related {{research}} has mainly focused on axenic biofilms. However, in nature, biofilms are often composed of multiple species {{and the resulting}} polymicrobial interactions influence industrially and clinically relevant outcomes such as performance and drug resistance. In this study we show that Escherichia coli does not affect Candida albicans tolerance to amphotericin or caspofungin in an <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> / C. albicans biofilm. In contrast, ofloxacin-tolerance of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> is significantly increased in a polymicrobial <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> / C. albicans biofilm as compared to an axenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> biofilm. The increased ofloxacin-tolerance of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> is mainly biofilm-specific as ofloxacin-tolerance of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> is less pronounced in polymicrobial <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> / C. albicans planktonic cultures. Moreover, we found that ofloxacin-tolerance of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> decreased significantly when <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> / C. albicans biofilms were treated with matrix-degrading enzymes such as the - 1, 3 -glucan-degrading enzyme lyticase. In line with a role for - 1, 3 -glucan in mediating ofloxacin-tolerance of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in a biofilm, we found that ofloxacin-tolerance of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> increased even more in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> / C. albicans biofilms consisting of a high - 1, 3 -glucan-producing C. albicans mutant. In addition, exogenous addition of laminarin, a polysaccharide mainly composed of poly-β- 1, 3 -glucan, to an <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> biofilm also resulted in increased ofloxacin-tolerance. All these data indicate that - 1, 3 -glucan from C. albicans increases ofloxacin-tolerance of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in an <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> / C. albicans biofilm. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|During {{the wild}} boars hunting season (2012 - 2013), 6508 adults were shot in Lazio Region, Viterbo territory. Out of the 6508, 393 {{subjects}} were sampled {{to be tested}} for the detection of Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, E. coli VTEC and Trichinella spp. For this purpose, diaphragm and skeletal muscles samples were collected after the shooting, and tested at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Lazio and Toscana laboratories, Rome, Italy. Samples were tested respectively by polymerase chain reaction, enzyme linked immunofluorescent assay, microbiological and parasitological assays. The positivity percentages are 3. 6 % for Salmonella spp., 14. 8 % (out of 230 samples tested) for Yersinia enterocolitica, 4. 6 % for E. coli VTEC (vtx 1 and 2 genes). Each positive sample for vtx 1 and 2 was tested to isolate <b>Verotoxigenic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains; none of them was positive for the same virulence genes.

40|$|The {{activity}} of a peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme was optimized {{to be used}} as a catalytic label in a stem-loop genosensor construction for quantifying the gene sequence Shiga-like toxin I of <b>verotoxigenic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> Experimental conditions such as pH, buffer composition, potassium ion concentration, and hemin-to-oligonucleotides ratio, were analyzed to maximize optical and electrochemical responses using microvolumes. Different stem-loop constructions were evaluated to obtain the optimum response against the target concentration. Linear ranges of 0. 05 - 0. 5 µM and limits of detection of 174 nM and 144 nM were estimated for the optical and electrochemical measurements, respectively. Selectivity was proved by assaying other verotoxigenic, enterotoxigenic and enteroinvasive sequences. The results show that, if a combination of small-volume electrochemical cells and low-cost untreated screen-printed electrodes with a relatively high geometric area is used, electrochemical measurements present similar sensitivity and limits of detection to the more usual optical ones, allowing the development of low-cost electrochemical biosensors based on the use of soluble DNAzymes as labels...|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli {{are one of}} {{the most}} diverse species of {{bacteria}} found in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of vertebrates. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> usually reside harmlessly, confined to the intestinal lumen of mammals, however certain groups of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> can cause a wide spectrum of intestinal and extraintestinal diseases in humans and animals. Based on clinical pathogenesis and genetic make up <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> is broadly classified into three major groups: extraintestinal pathogenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (ExPEC), intestinal pathogenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (enteric or diarrheagenic) and commensal <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> Diseases caused by <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> result in considerable economic loss around the world. Consequently, considerable focus has been given to understand pathogenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> The resultant is a reduced focus on the commensal form of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> and therefore a deficit in the knowledge base. To improve our knowledge of commensal <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> and the different microenvironmental niches it inhabits, this study focuses on understanding the genetic constituents of all three groups of <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> In this study we utilised a human model for the understanding of ExPECs by focusing on urinary tract infection causing <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> These strains are readily available from human clinical cases. For investigating commensal and pathogenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> that colonise the gastrointestinal tract we utilised a porcine model as we were able to access different intestinal regions for analysis.

Strain-specific PCR data were analysed using hierarchical clustering. The resulting dendrogram clearly separated O 157 from non-O 157 strains. The former clustered typical high-risk seropathotype (SPT) A strains from all regions, including Sweden and Spain, which were homogenous by Cramer's V statistic, and strains with less typical O 157 features mostly from Hungary. The non-O 157 strains divided into a high-risk SPTB harbouring O 26, O 111 and O 103 strains, a group pathogenic to pigs, and a group with few virulence genes other than for verotoxin.
