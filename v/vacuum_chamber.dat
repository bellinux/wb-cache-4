5|$|Stars {{condense}} from {{regions of}} space of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> These regions – known as molecular clouds – consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium {{and a few}} percent heavier elements. One {{example of such a}} star-forming region is the Orion Nebula. Most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{the first}} p-block noble gas, and the first element with a true octet of electrons. It is inert: {{as is the case}} with its lighter analogue, helium, no {{strongly}} bound neutral molecules containing neon have been identified. The ions +, +, and + have been observed from optical and mass spectrometric studies. Solid neon clathrate hydrate was produced from water ice and neon gas at pressures 0.35–0.48 GPa and temperatures ca. –30°C. Ne atoms are not bonded to water and can freely move through this material. They can be extracted by placing the clathrate into a <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> for several days, yielding ice XVI, the least dense crystalline form of water.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} also investigated electromagnetic isotope separation. At Princeton University, a {{group led by}} Henry D. Smyth and Robert R. Wilson developed a device known as an isotron. Using a klystron, {{they were able to}} separate isotopes using high-voltage electricity rather than magnetism. Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the calutron, work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties. At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator. They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> In February 1942, their team was consolidated with Lawrence's in Berkeley.|$|E
40|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>chambers</b> {{coated with}} nonevaporable getter (NEG) {{materials}} {{have been used}} in straight sections of synchrotron light sources for the past 10 years. The MAX II storage ring, where four NEG-coated insertion device <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers</b> and three NEG-coated dipole <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers</b> have been installed, is the first synchrotron light source to also use NEG-coated dipole <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers.</b> In connection with the installation of the latest two NEG-coated dipole chambers in April 2009, the evolution of the pressure and lifetime-limiting effects in MAX II has been determined from measurements with movable scrapers. The results have been compared with results from scraper measurements done in 2003, before any NEG-coated <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers</b> were installed in the storage ring. Less than three months after the installation of the latest dipole <b>chambers</b> the <b>vacuum</b> system in MAX II was performing well with a pressure already lower than the pressure measured in 2003.

5|$|When the {{calutron}} {{was first}} operated on 2 December 1941, {{just days before}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, a uranium beam intensity of 5 microamperes (μA) was received by the collector. Lawrence's hunch about the effect of the air molecules in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> was confirmed. A nine-hour run on 14 January 1942 with a 50 μA beam produced 18 micrograms (μg) of uranium enriched to 25% uranium-235, about ten times as much as Nier had produced. By February, improvements in the technique allowed it to generate a 1,400 μA beam. That month, 75 μg samples enriched to 30% were shipped to the British and the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} oxygen {{atmosphere was}} consistent with that {{that had been used}} successfully in the Mercury and Gemini programs. The pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out the nitrogen-containing air and replace it with pure oxygen, and also to seal the plug door hatch cover. During launch, the pressure would have been gradually reduced to the in-flight level of , providing sufficient oxygen for the astronauts to breathe while reducing the fire risk. The Apollo 1 crew had successfully tested this procedure with their spacecraft in the Operations and Checkout Building altitude (<b>vacuum)</b> <b>chamber</b> on October 18 and 19, 1966, and the backup crew of Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham had repeated it on December 30. The investigation board noted that, during these tests, the Command Module had been fully pressurized with pure oxygen four times, for a total of six hours and fifteen minutes, {{two and a half hours}} longer than it had been during the plugs-out test.|$|E

25|$|Electron-beam {{physical}} vapor deposition, or EBPVD, {{is a form}} {{of physical}} vapor deposition in which a target anode is bombarded with an electron beam given off by a charged tungsten filament under high vacuum.

25|$|Again, {{this happens}} with {{electrons}} before it happens with heavier particles. For example, the electrons used by Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer in 1927, accelerated by 54 volts, had a wavelength of 0.167nm, which was {{long enough to}} exhibit a single diffraction side lobe when reflecting {{from the face of}} a nickel crystal with atomic spacing of 0.215nm. With a larger <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber,</b> it would seem relatively easy to increase the angular resolution from around a radian to a milliradian and see quantum diffraction from the periodic patterns of integrated circuit computer memory.|$|E
25|$|PCBs {{intended}} for extreme environments {{often have a}} conformal coating, which is applied by dipping or spraying after the components have been soldered. The coat prevents corrosion and leakage currents or shorting due to condensation. The earliest conformal coats were wax; modern conformal coats are usually dips of dilute solutions of silicone rubber, polyurethane, acrylic, or epoxy. Another technique for applying a conformal coating is for plastic to be sputtered onto the PCB in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> The chief disadvantage of conformal coatings is that servicing of the board is rendered extremely difficult.|$|E
25|$|Pulsed laser {{deposition}} (PLD) is {{a physical}} vapor deposition (PVD) technique where a high-power pulsed laser beam is focused inside a <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> to strike a target of the material {{that is to be}} deposited. This material is vaporized from the target (in a plasma plume) which deposits it as a thin film on a substrate (such as a silicon wafer facing the target).

Y. Ng [4]. The latest calculations of A. Macridin et al. [5] revealed some disagreement with Ref. [4]; this fact stimulated us to get our own results on that matter.
