50|$|Some devices, {{including}} uninterruptible {{power supplies}} (UPSs), have ratings both for maximum <b>volt-amperes</b> and maximum watts. The VA rating {{is limited by}} the maximum permissible current, and the watt rating by the power-handling capacity of the device. When a UPS powers equipment which presents a reactive load with a low power factor, neither limit may safely be exceeded.

5000|$|A <b>volt-ampere</b> (VA) is {{the unit}} {{used for the}} {{apparent}} power in an electrical circuit, equal to the product of root-mean-square (RMS) voltage and RMS current.

50|$|In {{electric}} power transmission and distribution, <b>volt-ampere</b> reactive (var) is a unit by which reactive power is expressed in an AC {{electric power}} system. Reactive power exists in an AC circuit when the current and voltage are not in phase. The correct symbol is var and not Var, VAr, or VAR, but all three terms are widely used, and VAR is widely used throughout the power industry infrastructure. The term var was proposed by the Romanian electrical engineer Constantin Budeanu and introduced in 1930 by the IEC in Stockholm, which has adopted it as the unit for reactive power.|$|E
50|$|Knowledge of leakage {{inductance}} is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel. It {{can be shown}} that if the percent impedance and associated winding leakage reactance-to-resistance (X/R) ratio of two transformers were hypothetically exactly the same, the transformers would share power in proportion to their respective <b>volt-ampere</b> ratings (e.g. 500 kVA unit in parallel with 1,000 kVA unit, the larger unit would carry twice the current). However, the impedance tolerances of commercial transformers are significant. Also, the Z impedance and X/R ratio of different capacity transformers tends to vary, corresponding 1,000 kVA and 500 kVA units' values being, to illustrate, respectively, Z ≈ 5.75%, X/R ≈ 3.75 and Z ≈ 5%, X/R ≈ 4.75.|$|E

50|$|Power {{ratings are}} usually given in watts for real power and <b>volt-amperes</b> for {{apparent}} power, although for devices {{intended for use}} in large power systems, both may be given in a per-unit system. Cables are usually rated by giving their maximum voltage and their ampacity. As the power rating depends on the method of cooling, different ratings may be specified for air cooling, water cooling, etc.|$|R

50|$|Units {{are rated}} in <b>volt-amperes</b> (most commonly, kilo-volt amperes KVA) (or more rarely, amperes) and are rated for {{a percent of}} voltage drop or rise. For example, a {{buck-boost}} transformer rated at 10% boost will raise a supplied voltage of 208 V AC to 229 V AC. A rating of 10% buck will yield the result of 209 V AC if the actual incoming supplied voltage is 230 V AC.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} changes of <b>volt-ampere</b> {{characteristics}} of Yuan-Primary acupoints in women before, {{during and after}} menstruation, {{and to find out}} the relationships between Qi-blood in human body and <b>volt-ampere</b> characteristics of acupoints, so as to develop a new method for quantitative analysis on changes of Qi-blood. Methods: A high-sensitive detection system of <b>volt-ampere</b> characteristics of acupoint was applied to detecting the <b>volt-ampere</b> characteristics of Taiyuan (LU 9), Daling (PC 7) and Shenmen (HT 7) in healthy women before, during and after menstruation. Results: The resistances on LU 9, PC 7 and HT 7 with some certain scan currents were quite different among the women before, during and after menstruation. For such changes, PC 7 was of the most obvious change, LU 9 was of the less and HT 7 was of the least. The total ratio of the scanning spots with significantly increasing changes of resistances on these three acupoints along with the menstrual process was 70. 6 %. Conclusion: The <b>volt-ampere</b> characteristics of acupoints vary with the menstrual process, which is of the acupoint specificity. The resistances on the acupoints increase with the menstrual process, and such results {{may be due to the}} blood loss during menstruation. The <b>volt-ampere</b> characteristics can be used as a quantitative index to study on the change of Qi and blood...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{unbalanced}} three-phase load may {{be transformed}} into balanced load by {{the implementation of the}} reactive compensator. The balanced operation of the three-phase load requires an unbalanced reactive compensator, by that more amount of harmonics are generated. A three- phase reactive compensator includes thyristor- controlled reactors and switched capacitors is developed in this paper to evaluate the optimum values of reactive volt- amperes generated by the compensator. The calculations of reactive volt- amperes are {{based on the fact that}} the addition or subtraction of the same <b>volt-amperes</b> for three brunches of unbalanced TCR does not change the balanced operation of the load, but can modulate the amount of harmonics generated by the reactive compensator. This balanced-change in <b>volt-amperes</b> of TCR can be equalized by the three-phase thyristor-switched capacitor (TSC). Different sets of firing angles for thyistors are determined. All sets of firing angles balance the load and generate different amount of harmonics. Optimum values of firing angles required for a balance load and minimum generation of harmonics were defined...|$|R
