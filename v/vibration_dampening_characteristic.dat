50|$|The slide {{is guided}} by taper gibs with a minimum play, or {{hydraulically}} operated gibs which can be preloaded to eliminate play, {{in order to obtain}} the necessary rigidity. Recently, preloaded linear ways have also been used.

50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} of electro-pneumatic tools now offer vibration reduction systems {{to reduce the}} vibration felt by the operator. For example, the Hilti TE 3000-AVR has approximately the same impact energy of a 60 lb pneumatic hammer, but the vibration felt by the operator is significantly less (7 meters per second squared). Other manufacturers such as Makita, DeWalt and Bosch also offer electric tools with <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening.</b>|$|R
50|$|The hull of {{the tank}} has been {{modified}} at the back and sides. The fuel tank {{has been replaced by}} a new, repairable one. The transmission has been changed so the tank's turret can rotate 360 degrees. Also, additional <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> systems have been added to protect sensitive electronic components.

5000|$|Head's latest <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> {{system is}} EDS (Electronic Dampening System) {{which is being}} {{implemented}} into the newer rackets, such as the HEAD Protector. It works by using piezoelectric fibers, which convert mechanical into electronic energy, controlled by a microchip. EDS recognizes the damping mode and electronically creates a cancelling counter vibration. This reduces shock impact by more than 50% and residual vibrations {{twice as fast as}} in a conventional racquet period.|$|R
50|$|Like {{metallic}} {{gear and}} disc couplings, grid couplings {{have a high}} torque density. A benefit of grid couplings, over either gear or disc couplings, is the ability their grid coupling spring elements have to absorb and spread peak load impact energy over time. This reduces the magnitude of peak loads and offers some <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> capability. A negative of the grid coupling design is that it generally is very limited {{in its ability to}} accommodate the misalignment.|$|R

Weight reduction is necessary for better dynamic performance and energy efficiency. Theproblem is that by reducing mass, rigidity and <b>vibrations</b> <b>dampening</b> are affected. Thedeveloped method tries to eliminate this problem by applying alternative technologiessuch as: using alternative materials, applying ribs and cut outs, obtaining a box typeshape, filling the interior space with metallic aluminum foam...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To detect {{efficiency}} of pregnancy belt during the {{low back pain}} condition in the late stage of pregnancy based on literature search, theory and experiment. Methods: Two participants in the late stage of pregnancy with low back pain condition participated in this experiment. We focused on <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> capacity of a pregnant abdomen using Qualisys a Kistler technique, while using different types of pregnancy belt as a support of the lumbopelvic area. In {{the second part of}} the experiment we tested particular pregnancy belt - CellacareÂ® Materna and its effectiveness on reduction of low back pain at twelve pregnant women, for this purpose we used one standardised questionnaire - Roland-Morris Low Back Pain and Disability Questionnaire. Results: It appears that there is no difference in reduction of <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> capacity of pregnant abdomen even if different types of pregnancy belts used. Conclusion: Upon the gained results we can say that the pragnancy belt reduces low back pain in the late stage of pregnancy but probably not by the reduction of the abdomen vibration. It can be supposed that by using the pregnancy belt we can change ballasted characterisations of the lumbar area - the pain disappears.

50|$|The SQUID {{itself is}} mounted onto a {{cantilever}} and operated either in {{direct contact with}} or just above the sample surface. The position of the SQUID is usually controlled by some form of electric stepping motor. Depending on the particular application, different levels of precision may be required in the height of the apparatus. Operating at lower-tip sample distances increases the sensitivity and resolution of the device, but requires more advanced mechanisms in controlling the height of the probe. In addition such devices require extensive <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> if precise height control is to be maintained.|$|R

5000|$|Maple is {{traditionally}} {{used for the}} backs and sides of violin family instruments. It is also frequently seen in acoustic guitars and mandolins. Most Fender electric guitars feature maple necks (it {{is one of the}} hardest and most stable tonewoods, so it is often used in the neck because of its ability to withstand high tension). Hard-rock maple is commonly used for wooden tripods for its <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> properties. Variations of maple (commonly maple wood with flamed or quilted grains) are used on the tops of electric guitars for aesthetic purposes. The very sturdy frame of the modern piano is usually made of maple or of beech.|$|R

50|$|The November class attack {{submarines}} were considerably noisier than diesel submarines and {{the early}} American nuclear-powered submarines, despite the streamlined torpedo-like hull, limited number of holes in the hull, special low-noise variable-pitch propellers, <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> of main equipment, and antisonar coating of the hull (used {{for the first time}} on nuclear-powered submarines). Soviet reactors were superior to American ones in compactness and power-to-weight ratio, but the vibrations of Soviet reactors were much more pronounced. Novembers detected submarine targets during active service (for example, there were 42 detections in 1965 when regular cruises of Soviet nuclear-powered submarines began). The Soviet hydroacoustic equipment on the Novembers was not intended for submarine hunting, and had relatively limited capabilities.|$|R
30|$|The {{increase}} in ÎD during the deposition of chitosan indicates {{the formation of}} a more viscoelastic film (Fig. 3 b).

50|$|Before the Second World War, metal was the {{standard}} material used for surface plates, however, the war efforts of various countries put {{a strain on}} the availability of metal. A monument and metal shop owner (Wallace Herman) in Dayton, Ohio, along with his inventive employee Donald V. Porter, started using granite in place of metal for his surface plates. Today most surface plates continue to be made of black granite, more accurately referred to as black diabase, with the more wear-resistant surface plates being made of quartz-bearing granite. The quartz content of these granite surface plates increases the wear resistance of the plate as quartz is a harder stone. Black granite is dominantly used in machine bases, granite accessories, and custom applications for its superior stiffness, excellent <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening,</b> and improved machinability. Quartz-bearing granite (usually pink, white, or grey) is often made thicker than black granite to provide equal load-bearing capabilities of the types of material used for surface plates as it is not as stiff as black granite.|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ For {{effective}} energy regeneration and <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening,</b> energy regenerative suspension systems have received more studies recently. This paper presents the dynamic modeling and a test system of a regenerative shock absorber system which converts vibration motion into rotary motion through the adjustment of hydraulic flow. Hydraulic circuit configuration achieves the one way flow and energy regeneration during both compression and extension strokes. The dynamic modeling is performed {{for the evaluation}} of design concept and the feasibility studies of regenerative shock absorber system theoretically. Based on simulated results, the efficiency of hydraulic transmission is optimized and validated in test system. The results show that the performance of hydraulic fluid, the features of rotary motion and the capability of energy regeneration are verified and compared between dynamic modeling and experiments. Meanwhile, the average power of 118. 2 W and 201. 7 W with the total energy conversion of 26. 86 % and 18. 49 % can be obtained based on experiments under sinusoidal inputs with 0. 07854 m/s and 0. 1256 m/s respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{coating of}} {{piezoelectric}} materials with diamond particles, or fashioning an abrasive material coated to a piezoelectric material using a laser, has enabled {{the production of}} truly flat substrates so that features can be created on materials using a manufacturing process known as "nanogrinding with abrasives. " The principle of the process relies on applying an electric current to the abrasivecoated piezoelectric material that causes the material to strain in various directions. When the piezoelectric material is touching the substrate material, the abrasive particles remove small pieces of the substrate. The magnitude of the applied current controls the material removal rate. The process {{can be used to}} process many materials especially in the production of nanoscale channels that are used in micro- and nanofluidic devices. To achieve the generation of flat surfaces, the process must be executed within a specially constructed <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> machine tool.

40|$|AbstractPolymer {{concrete}} (PC) displays superb <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> {{qualities and}} is dimensionally and thermally stable, dense, rigid, {{resistant to water}} and chemicals and will not twist or bend in reaction to stress. Therefore PC has become the preferred base to ensure rigidity in a machine tool. Hybrid polymer concrete beds composed of steel structures and polymer concrete are challenging for the grinding process, due to the completely different material properties of steel and PC. Which complicates the selection of suitable grinding tool and limits the achievable material removal rates. A promising technique to overcome these technological constraints {{is the use of}} High Efficiency Deep Grinding (HEDG), where high cutting speeds and material removal rates are utilized. This paper presents the experimental investigation of HEDG of a hybrid material consisting of polymer concrete and integrated steel inserts. A vitrified bond CBN-grinding wheel was utilized and the grinding parameters are optimized in this study. The obtained results show that the application of HEDG can increase the material removal rates considerably. There was no evidence of thermal damages on the surface and subsurface of ground workpieces. The microscopic studies of the induced chips by the HEDG process showed, that both brittle and ductile grinding modes occur during the applied HEDG process...|$|R
