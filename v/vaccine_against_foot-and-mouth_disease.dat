40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} work performed, {{primarily for the}} development of a porcine mucosal <b>vaccine</b> <b>against</b> <b>Foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus. Here we evaluate different peptide based vaccines as well as different adjuvants for their capacity to induce both systemic, as well as mucosal immunity in swine, when administered intransally. We also attempt to describe a method of vaccine design based on driving immune responses away from epitopes responsible for type-specificity, and towards more conserved viral epitopes. In the work we determine that peptide vaccination coadministered with adjuvants through the intranasal route of swine, can induce effective anti-peptide responses. We also determine that detoxified mucosal adjuvants, with reduced or abrogated ADP ribosylation activity are capable of adjuvanting immune responses similar to native holotoxins. Finally we show that driving immune responses towards sub-dominant epitopes is possible through substitutions of the type-specific, immunodominant epitopes. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a {{completely}} safe immunogen to replace the traditional inactivated vaccine, a tandem-repeat multiple-epitope recombinant <b>vaccine</b> <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) virus (FMDV) type O was developed. It contained three copies each of residues 141 to 160 and 200 to 213 of VP 1 of the O/China/ 99 strain of FMDV coupled with a swine immunoglobulin G heavy-chain constant region (scIgG). The data showed that the multiple-epitope recombinant vaccine elicited high titers of anti-FMDV specific antibodies in swine at 30 days postvaccination (dpv) and conferred complete protection against a challenge with 10 (3) 50 % swine infective doses of the O/China/ 99 strain. The anti-FMDV specific antibody titers {{were not significantly different}} between the multiple-epitope recombinant vaccine and the traditional vaccine (t test, P > 0. 05). The number of 50 % pig protective doses was 6. 47, which is higher than the number recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health. The multiple-epitope recombinant vaccine resulted in a duration of immunity of at least 6 months. We speculate that the multiple-epitope recombinant vaccine is a promising vaccine that may replace the traditional inactivated vaccine for the prevention and control of FMD in swine in the future...|$|E
40|$|We {{constructed}} {{foot-and-mouth disease}} virus (FMDV) mutants bearing independent deletions of the two stem-loop structures predicted in the 3 ′ noncoding region of viral RNA, SL 1 and SL 2, respectively. Deletion of SL 2 was lethal for viral infectivity in cultured cells, while deletion of SL 1 resulted in viruses with slower growth kinetics and downregulated replication associated with impaired negative-strand RNA synthesis. With the aim of exploring the potential of an RNA-based <b>vaccine</b> <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> using attenuated viral genomes, full-length chimeric O 1 K/C-S 8 RNAs were first inoculated into pigs. Our results show that FMDV viral transcripts could generate infectious virus and induce disease in swine. In contrast, RNAs carrying the ΔSL 1 mutation on an FMDV O 1 K genome were innocuous for pigs but elicited a specific immune response including both humoral and cellular responses. A single inoculation with 500 μg of RNA was able to induce a neutralizing antibody response. This response could be further boosted by a second RNA injection. The presence of the ΔSL 1 mutation was confirmed in viruses isolated from serum samples of RNA-inoculated pigs or after transfection and five passages in cell culture. These findings suggest that deletion of SL 1 might contribute to FMDV attenuation in swine and support the potential of RNA technology {{for the design of}} new FMDV vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{transgenic}} plants expressing immunogenic proteins of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) {{have been}} used as oral or parenteral <b>vaccines</b> <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD). They exhibit advantages like cost effectiveness, absence of processing, thermostability, and easy oral application. FMDV VP 1 protein of single serotype has been mostly used as immunogen. Here we report the development of a bivalent vaccine with tandem-linked VP 1 proteins of two serotypes, A and O, present in transgenic forage crop Crotalaria juncea. The expression of the bivalent protein in the transgenic plants was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Guinea pig reacted to orally or parenterally applied vaccine by humoral as well as cell-mediated immune responses including serum antibodies and stimulated lymphocytes, respectively. The vaccine protected the animals against a challenge with the virus of serotype A as well as O. This is the first report on the development of a bivalent FMD vaccine using a forage crop...|$|R
40|$|A {{large-scale}} vaccination experiment {{involving a}} total of 138 cattle was carried out to evaluate the potential of synthetic peptides as <b>vaccines</b> <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b> Four types of peptides representing sequences of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) C 3 Argentina 85 were tested: A, which includes the G-H loop of capsid protein VP 1 (site A); AT, in which a T-cell epitope {{has been added to}} site A; AC, composed of site A and the carboxy-terminal region of VP 1 (site C); and ACT, in which the three previous capsid motifs are colinearly represented. Induction of neutralizing antibodies, lymphoproliferation in response to viral antigens, and protection against challenge with homologous infectious virus were examined. None of the tested peptides, at several doses and vaccination schedules, afforded protection above 40 %. Protection showed limited correlation with serum neutralization activity and lymphoproliferation in response to whole virus. In 12 of 29 lesions from vaccinated cattle that were challenged with homologous virus, mutant FMDVs with amino acid substitutions at antigenic site A were identified. This finding suggests the rapid generation and selection of FMDV antigenic variants in vivo. In contrast with previous studies, this large-scale vaccination experiment with an important FMDV host reveals considerable difficulties for vaccines based on synthetic peptides to achieve the required levels of efficacy. Possible modifications of the vaccine formulations to increase protective activity are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} and devastating disease affecting livestock that causes significant financial losses.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} whether Cedivac-FMD, an emergency <b>vaccine</b> <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD), {{is suitable for}} use conjointly with a screening program intended to confirm freedom from disease in vaccinated herds based on evidence of virus replication in vaccinates. Different sets of sera were tested using the Ceditest® FMDV-NS ELISA {{for the detection of}} antibodies against non-structural proteins (NSPs) of FMD virus. During a vaccine safety study, serum samples were collected from 10 calves, 10 lambs and 10 piglets following administration of a double dose and a repeat dose of high payload trivalent Cedivac-FMD vaccine. All serum samples collected both 2 weeks following the administration of a double dose as well as those collected 2 weeks after the single dose booster (given 2 weeks after the double dose) were negative in the Ceditest® FMDV-NS ELISA. In a series of vaccine potency experiments, serum samples were collected from 70 vaccinated cattle prior to and following exposure to infectious, homologous FMD virus. When testing cattle sera collected 4 weeks after vaccination with a regular dose of monovalent > 6 PD 50 vaccines, 1 of 70 animals tested positive in the NSP antibody ELISA. After infection with FMD virus, antibodies to NSP were detected in 59 of 70 vaccinated cattle and 27 of 28 non-vaccinated control animals within 7 days. Cedivac-FMD vaccines do not induce NSP antibodies in cattle, pigs or sheep following administration of a double dose or a repeat dose. FMD-exposed animals can be detected in a vaccinated group within 7 ¿ 14 days. Because Cedivac-FMD does not induce NSP antibodies, the principle of `marker vaccine¿ applies...|$|E

40|$|Guinea pigs immunized intranasally with {{a keyhole}} limpet hemocyanin-linked peptide, {{corresponding}} to the prominent G-H loop of the VP 1 protein of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus, raised substantial levels of antipeptide and virus-neutralizing antibodies in sera and of peptide-specific secretory immunoglobulin A in nasal secre-tions. In groups of animals immunized intranasally without adjuvant, 86 percent were fully protected upon challenge with homotypic virus. Surprisingly, animals given the peptide conjugates plus the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin were afforded only partial protection in that primary lesions were observed in most animals, although spread to other feet was prevented. These results indicate that intranasal inoculation with the peptide offers a potential route of vaccination <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> and may be useful for eliciting protection in the upper respiratory tracts of susceptible animals.

40|$|Vaccination of {{susceptible}} animals <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) is a {{well established}} strategy for helping to combat the disease.

In 2001, the use of vaccine was considered but not implemented in the United Kingdom (1), whereas vaccine was used to help to control FMD in The Netherlands (2, 3). Canadian contingency plans provide for the use of vaccine; Canada {{is a member of the}} North American <b>Foot-and-Mouth</b> <b>Disease</b> Vaccine Bank, which could supply vaccine if needed.

40|$|Vaccination <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) {{might be}} one of the control {{measures}} used during an FMD epidemic depending on the local epidemiological situation, the status of the country, and the opinion of policy makers. A sound decision on vaccination can be made only if there is sufficient scientific knowledge on the effectiveness of vaccination in eliminating the virus from the population. An important question is whether a single vaccination applied as an emergency vaccine can contribute to the control of an epidemic. This paper presents the results of transmission experiments on vaccine efficacy in groups of cattle, pigs, and sheep and concludes that vaccination seemed to be effective in cattle and sheep, but was less effective in pigs.

40|$|We aim {{to develop}} a method that confers rapid {{protection}} <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) by passive immunization with recombinant llama single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs). Previously constructed genetic fusions of two VHHs (VHH 2 s) that either neutralizes FMDV or binds to porcine immunoglobulin to increase the serum half-life, conferred only limited protection to pigs. We therefore now generated VHH 3 s containing an additional FMDV binding VHH. Two VHH 3 s neutralized FMDV more potently than single VHHs and were highly produced by yeast cells. Injection of a mixture of these two VHH 3 s 24 h before FMD challenge infection of pigs reduced and delayed the development of clinical disease, viraemia and viral shedding. Furthermore, it significantly (P = 0. 023) delayed FMD transmission. Thus, we have shown a proof of concept of passive FMD immunoprophylaxis using VHH...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} viral {{lymphoproliferative}} response of pigs vaccinated <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) has been characterized.

The response was heterotypic, being induced by all FMDV serotypes tested (C, A and O) after only two vaccinations with FMDV of serotype C (C-$ 8). Each individual structural protein assessed (VP 1, VP 2 and VP 3) induced proliferation, with VP 3 and VP 1 being more effective stimulators.

50|$|Cattle raising is {{the most}} {{widespread}} agricultural activity in Colombia, accounting for 74 percent of Colombia's agricultural land in 2005. Nevertheless, cattle traditionally were not a particularly important or consistent net export for Colombia, and coffee's dominance within the country's agricultural exports remains largely unchallenged.

That fund has generated resources to tackle five major issues: sanitation, commercialization, research and development (R&D), training, and promotion of consumption. Although progress has been made on all five fronts, perhaps the most remarkable achievements have occurred in sanitation.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that medicinal herbs and their ingredients enhance immune responses to vacci-nation against infectious diseases (Liu & Xiao, 1992; Rajput et al., 2007 a). Medicinal herbs {{have a variety}} of effects on immune responses and co-administration of vaccine with herbal extracts shows an increase in antibody response as well as enhancement in prolife-rative response of T cells (Hu et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2007). Some adjuvants such as Quillaja saponaria-A extracts (Quil-A) or extracts from Cochinchina mo-mordica seed (ECMS) have proven to be very effective for enhancing immune responses with the commercial <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) vaccine (Xiao et al., 2007 a,b,c). Quil-A is produced from the bark of Quilla-ja saponaria Molina, a tree of the rose family which is indigenous to South America; it is a triterpenoid sa-ponin which has been used {{over the past three decades}} as adjuvant in vaccines (Remington et al., 1918; Kensil, 1996). ECMS is a crude extract made from seed of the Chinese traditional medicinal plant Momordica cochinchinensis and its immunomodulatory effects have been reported in <b>vaccines</b> <b>against</b> influenza-H 5 N 1 (Rajput et al., 2007 b), infectious bursal disease (Rajput et al., 2010) and newcastle disease (Xiao et al., 2009) in chicken.

40|$|Lymphoproliferation <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) {{virus was}} {{examined}} using {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from vaccinated cattle. Ten weeks after revaccination the optimum conditions for proliferation were obtained with 1 ~tg/ml of purified virus after 5 to 6 days in culture. This {{contrasted with the}} response at 20 months post-revaccination, when the response required less antigen and showed a peak response after 3 to 4 days in culture. Proliferation was specific for FMD virus, but was cross-reactive between serotypically distinct strains of the virus. The prolifera-tive response to isolated virus proteins (VP) involved all three major capsid proteins (VP 1,- 2 and- 3), although the proliferation of lymphocytes from heterotypically vaccinated cattle was due to VP 3. Furthermore, the response induced by purified virus, chemically fixed virus and subunit virus particles was indistinguishable and thus it is likely that processing was required for the induction of proliferation. Together these data strongly suggest that FMD virus-induced lymphoproliferation is T cell-mediated and that VP 3 may contain dominant, cross-reactive sequences...|$|R

40|$|Emergency {{vaccination}} {{as part of}} {{the control}} strategies <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) has the potential to limit virus spread and reduce large-scale culling. To reduce the time between vaccination and the onset of immunity, immunostimulatory CpG was tested for its capacity to promote early protection against FMDV challenge in pigs. To this end, CpG 2142, an efficient inducer of alpha interferon, was injected intramuscularly. Increased transcription of Mx 1, OAS, and IRF- 7 was identified as a sensitive measurement of CpG-induced innate immunity, with increased levels detectable to at least 4 days after injection of CpG formulated with Emulsigen. Despite this, CpG combined with an FMD vaccine did not promote protection. Pigs vaccinated 2 days before challenge had disease development, which was at least as acute as that of unvaccinated controls. All pigs vaccinated 7 days before challenge were protected without a noticeable effect of CpG. In summary, our results demonstrate the caution required when translating findings from mouse models to natural hosts of FMDV...|$|R

40|$|DNA vaccine {{has been}} tested for {{protection}} <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease.</b> However, the relatively low efficacy of DNA vaccine in inducing immune responses in large animals has restricted its practical use. Interleukin- 1 plays {{an essential role in}} amplifying both the cellular and humoral immune responses to foreign antigens, and may therefore represent a good candidate as an adjuvant of DNA vaccines. Since the inflammatory activity of IL- 1 may restrict its application in DNA vaccine treatment, we explored the possibilities of augmenting immune responses without unwanted inflammatory effects using the IL- 1 beta fragment (amino acids (aa) 163 - 171), which is essential for IL- 1 receptor- 1 binding. The DNA fragment encoding the human IL- 1 beta fragment (aa 163 - 171) was fused to <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) DNA vaccine, and injected into mice to analyse its immune response. Compared with control mice receiving FMDV DNA vaccine alone, significant increases in the FMDV-specific antibody response and also in T cell proliferation were observed in mice receiving IL- 1 beta (163 - 171) FMDV. These results suggested that DNA fragment encoding IL- 1 beta 163 - 171 peptide might represent a good candidate for an adjuvant of FMDV DNA vaccine...|$|R

Treatment of FMDV-infected BHK- 21 cells with 77 muM 2 '-C-MetCyt resulted in a (1. 6 - 3. 2) x 10 (3) -fold reduction of infectious virus yield. Time-of-drug addition experiments suggest that 2 '-C-MetCyt interacts with viral replication at a time point that coincides with the onset of intracellular viral RNA synthesis. In contrast to emergency vaccination, a potent and selective antiviral agent may provide almost immediate (prophylactic/therapeutic) protection against infection and thus constitute an important alternative/supplementary option to contain outbreaks such as those caused by FMDV. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the seroprevalence and serotype-specificity of the circulating antibodies <b>against</b> <b>Foot-and-Mouth</b> <b>Disease</b> Virus (FMDV) in cattle in K asese and Bushenyi districts in Uganda. A total of 309 serum samples were collected and tested for antibodies against Non-Structural (NS) and Structural Proteins (SP) using Ceditest® FMDV-NS and C editest® FMDV type O test kits. Seroprevalences were much higher in Kasese in both tests (61 and 43 %, respectively) than in Bushenyi (3 and 4 %, respectively). A high proportion of sera, that tested positive in the NSP test, were subjected to seven serotype specific blocking ELISAs for antibodies against the seven FMDV serotypes (O, A, C, Asia 1, SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3). The study showed presence of antibodies against four FMDV serotypes with decreasing magnitude as follows: O> SAT 1 > SAT 3 /SAT 2. It is recommended to develop sampling schemes to include virus recovery and identification, as well as to focus serum sampling on young unvaccinated stock...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether intradermal (ID) vaccination <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (FMD) is suitable as an alternative for the usually used intramuscular (IM) route. We compared vaccine efficacy in groups of pigs in which vaccine administration differed with respect to antigen payload of the vaccine, administrated volume and administration route. When compared with pigs that were IM vaccinated with a full dose vaccine with a standard antigen payload, pigs vaccinated ID with 1 / 10 dose of the same vaccine were equally protected against clinical disease and subclinical virus shedding. The ID vaccinated pigs were protected against virus shedding at a significant lower VN-titre as compared to IM vaccinated pigs, suggesting that immune responses other than neutralising antibodies also contributed to protection. We conclude that the ID route might be a good alternative for IM application, as ID application might induce a very efficient immunological response against FMD and, moreover, because the dose required by the ID route is lower compared to the IM route, ID application may reduce the production costs per dose of FMD vaccine markedl...|$|R
40|$|Investigations using a liquid-phase {{blocking}} sandwich {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) for {{the measurement}} of antibodies <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) in sera from sheep and from cattle are reported, and results compared with those obtained by virus neutralization (VN) tests. Serum antibody titres in sheep after primary vaccination and in cattle challenged with a natural aerosol after vaccination were similar by ELISA and VN. However, the antibody levels detected in sera of cattle during early infection and of vaccinated cattle after intradermolingual challenge were clearly greater by ELISA than by VN. The ELISA titres in cattle sera following synthetic peptide vaccination indicated some relationship to protection and were clearly different from those recorded by VN. On the other hand, the antibody levels following conventional vaccination showed that ELISA and VN titres in cattle sera were related to protection. Although {{there was a good}} agreement between the ELISA antibody titre and protection for the four vaccines used, by VN the titre which afforded protection varied depending on the vaccine used. The ELISA was considered therefore to be more reliable than the VN and may prove useful for evaluating the immunological response of animals following infection and following vaccination...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{dendritic}} cells (DC) in {{the initiation}} of immune responses <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) is poorly understood. We analyzed the innate response of freshly isolated swine skin DC to the virus and show a rapid induction of beta interferon (IFN-β) mRNA but not IFN-α mRNA. However, these DC secreted both IFN-α and IFN-β proteins in response to live virus but not killed virus. Furthermore, the surface expression of swine major histocompatibility complex class II (SLA II) or CD 80 /CD 86 molecules and antigen processing functions were not affected by FMDV exposure. Given the demonstrated sensitivity of FMDV to IFN-α/β, there was no productive or nonproductive infection of these cells. Finally, freshly isolated skin DC constitutively expressed intracellular IFN-α protein {{in the absence of}} stimulation, with no detectable secretion of the cytokine until virus exposure. In situ analysis of these DC showed that these cells express and store IFN-α in uninfected animals. This is the first demonstration of the constitutive expression of IFN-α in resident, tissue-derived DC and indicates that skin DC can {{play an important role in}} the innate immune response of swine to viral infections...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of the induction of virus neutralizing antibodies to provide protection <b>against</b> <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) infection is well established. However, recent studies with recombinant adenovirus expressing the precursor polypeptide of the viral capsid (P 1) indicate that cattle inoculated with this recombinant vector developed partial protection against FMDV infection, {{in the absence of}} a detectable specific humoral response. Other viral vectors have been widely used to induce protective immunity against many pathogens, and it has been reported that the use of different vectors for priming and boosting injections can provide a synergistic effect on this response. In this work, we determined the immunogenicity of two recombinant viruses (adenovirus and vaccinia) expressing P 1 -FMDV, administered either individually or sequentially, and the protection that they induced against FMDV challenge in pigs. A double immunization with the adeno-P 1 virus was the most effective strategy at inducing protective immunity. In contrast to previous reports, the use of two different vectors for priming and boosting did not show a synergistic effect on the protection induced against FMD. Interestingly, immunized pigs developed FMDV-specific T cell responses but not detectable antibodies. Thus, the protection observed was likely to be mediated by a cellular immune response...|$|R
