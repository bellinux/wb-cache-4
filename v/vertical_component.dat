5|$|The {{instrumentation}} included ten smoked paper analog seismometers {{that were}} configured {{to allow for}} 48 hours of continuous single-component data recording. Six digital recorders built by the Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg were also used to record signals from three-component seismometers. Eight of the selected sites were equipped with a <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> velocity transducer along with an FM telemetry link to transfer data back to a central station where a three-component unit was stationed. There the seismic signals were digitized, along with an internal time signal and an external DCF77 time signal, and stored on magnetic tape. The tapes were then played back and the P-wave and S-wave arrival times were used to automatically determine aftershock locations. Approximately two hundred aftershocks were recorded each day for the first several days of the expedition {{and at the end}} of the recording period in February the equipment was still picking up around 100 shocks per day. The team then set out to determine an accurate velocity model using data from the more accurate telemetry network. The soviet geophysicists detonated 100 kilograms of TNT in a hole drilled near the mainshock epicenter and the resulting shock waves were detected and used to help pinpoint a more accurate crustal velocity value of 5.3 to 5.4km/s.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} {{resident}} {{populations of the}} yellow-faced honeyeater throughout its range, {{it is for the}} most part a seasonal, latitudinal, daytime migrant. During the autumn (March to May) it migrates north along the highlands and coastal fringe of eastern Australia to southern Queensland, to return in the spring (August to October) of the same year. The birds commonly move in flocks of 10 to 100 birds, but occasionally in larger groups of up to 1,000 or more birds. The groups can include other species such as the white-naped honeyeater, fuscous honeyeater, noisy friarbird and silvereye. They move in successive flocks at a rate of up to several thousand birds an hour. Over 100,000 birds were recorded passing Hastings point in New South Wales {{over the course of a}} single day in May 1965. The species is able to detect geomagnetic fields and uses them to navigate while migrating. Experiments where the <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> of the magnetic field was reversed indicate that the magnetic compass of the yellow-faced honeyeater is based on the inclination of the field lines and not on polarity, meaning they distinguish between the direction of the equator and poles, rather than north and south. While their flight is in one general direction, it is not in a straight line as the flocks stay in vegetated areas, negotiate gaps in the mountain ranges and detour around cities.|$|E

30|$|The EOF {{analysis}} {{is performed using}} the program “pca” from the QOCA package (Dong et al., 2006). The east and north components were simultaneously analyzed so that both components share the same principal components {{so as to make}} the modes corresponding to earthquakes and afterslip easier to identify, whilst in Chang and Chao (2011) analyzed each component separately. I did not include the <b>vertical</b> <b>components</b> in the EOF analysis since the large noises in the <b>vertical</b> <b>components</b> affect the estimated principal components (and eigenvectors) significantly. Instead, I calculated eigenvectors for the <b>vertical</b> <b>components</b> using the least-squares method, while assuming that the <b>vertical</b> <b>components</b> share the same principal components as the horizontal ones.|$|R

25|$|This also {{explains}} why high speed projectiles that travel west are deflected down, {{and those that}} travel east are deflected up. This <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> of the Coriolis effect is called the Eötvös effect.|$|E
25|$|The next pair of {{illustrations}} {{is that of}} left-handed, counter-clockwise {{circularly polarized}} light when viewed by the receiver. Because it is left-handed, the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) horizontal component is now lagging the <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> by one quarter of a wavelength rather than leading it.|$|E
25|$|Water-air {{interfaces}} provide {{another source}} of circular polarization. Sunlight that gets scattered back up towards the surface is linearly polarized. If this light is then totally internally reflected back down, its <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> undergoes a phase shift. To an underwater observer looking up, the faint light outside Snell's window therefore is (partially) circularly polarized.|$|E

25|$|Now, if we're given a {{vector field}} Y over M (but not the {{principal}} bundle) {{but we also}} have a connection over the principal bundle, we can define a vector field X over the principal bundle such that its horizontal component matches Y and its <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> agrees with the connection. This is the covariant Lie derivative.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{quarter-wave plate}} {{is made of}} a {{birefringent}} material, when in the wave plate, the light travels at different speeds depending on the direction of its electric field. This means that the horizontal component which is along the slow axis of the wave plate will travel at a slower speed than the component that is directed along the vertical fast axis. Initially the two components are in phase, but as the two components travel through the wave plate the horizontal component of the light drifts farther behind that of the vertical. By adjusting {{the thickness of the}} wave plate one can control how much the horizontal component is delayed relative to <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> before the light leaves the wave plate and they begin again to travel at the same speed. When the light leaves the quarter-wave plate the rightward horizontal component will be exactly one quarter of a wavelength behind the <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> making the light left-hand circularly polarized when viewed from the receiver.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} this process, {{refer to the}} illustration on the right. It is absolutely identical to the earlier illustration even though the circularly polarized light at the top is now considered to be approaching the polarizer from the left. One can observe from the illustration that the leftward horizontal (as observed looking along the direction of travel) component is leading the <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> and that when the horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength it will be transformed into the linearly polarized light illustrated {{at the bottom and}} it will pass through the linear polarizer.|$|E

Then,observations of crustal deformation by these rotationmeters in the Osakayama tunnel of theformer Tokaido Line. General tiltmeters record sum of the vertical deflection and the horizontal gradient of thevertical displacement of the crustal deformation, but these <b>vertical</b> <b>components</b> of therotationmeter record only horizontal gradients. Comparing these observations by these rotationmeters with those by tiltmeters, the deflectionof the vertical is derived...|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} main types of fault, {{all of which}} may cause an {{interplate}} earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is {{in the direction of}} dip and movement on them involves a <b>vertical</b> <b>component.</b> Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where {{the two sides of the}} fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip.|$|E
25|$|Beams 2 through 9 were {{projected}} in horizontal array; 10 through 17 (although 10 actually lies in {{the horizontal}} row) were grouped as the <b>vertical</b> <b>component.</b> All beams of each group were powered simultaneously. Except for being controlled by a master timing signal, {{each of the eight}} channels operated independently of the others. Each transmitter was on a slightly different frequency to prevent interaction with the others. The transmitted pulse, 2000 microseconds long, was coded, or tagged, by being passed through a tapped delay line which may reversed the phase at 20-microsecond intervals. Upon reception the returned signal was passed through the same tapped delay line and compressed 100:1, to 20 microseconds in order to increase the accuracy and resolution of the range measurement, which was of course a function of the interval between transmission and return.|$|E
25|$|The Mona Lisa example pictured {{at right}} {{provides}} a simple illustration. Each {{point on the}} painting can be represented as a vector pointing {{from the center of}} the painting to that point. The linear transformation in this example is called a shear mapping. Points in the top half are moved to the right and points in the bottom half are moved to the left proportional to how far they are from the horizontal axis that goes through the middle of the painting. The vectors pointing to each point in the original image are therefore tilted right or left and made longer or shorter by the transformation. Notice that points along the horizontal axis do not move at all when this transformation is applied. Therefore, any vector that points directly to the right or left with no <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> is an eigenvector of this transformation because the mapping does not change its direction. Moreover, these eigenvectors all have an eigenvalue equal to one because the mapping does not change their length, either.|$|E

Our main result is the following criterion for openness of complex analytic maps: Let f:X→Y be an analytic map of analytic spaces, with X being puredimensional and Y being locally irreducible of dimension n. Then f is open if and only if there are no isolated algebraic <b>vertical</b> <b>components</b> in the nth fibre power X{n}...|$|R
30|$|A set of {{dedicated}} tools to perform vertical transport evacuation modelling is also available, e.g., ELVAC (Klote and Alvord 1992), ELEVATE (Peters 2002), Building Traffic Simulator (BTS) (Siikonen 1993). The main limitation of these tools {{is that the}} simulated human factors are generally homogeneous and simplified (Kinsey 2011). In addition, since the models are specifically designed for vertical evacuation modelling, the interactions between horizontal and <b>vertical</b> egress <b>components</b> are represented implicitly. For example, ELVAC includes a “trip inefficiency” component in order to represent additional and/or sub-optimal elevator time components (i.e. time needed to empty floors and trips to pick up latecomers). ELEVATE and BTS assume that the bottlenecks are placed around the <b>vertical</b> <b>components</b> and exits, i.e., behaviours outside these areas are represented implicitly through varying arrival rates to the <b>vertical</b> <b>components.</b> Dedicated {{studies are needed to}} evaluate the possibility of using these models in conjunction with egress models. Given {{the current state of the}} art, these models alone are not considered suitable for analysing scenarios involving both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>components.</b>|$|R

500|$|The United States Geological Survey {{operates}} {{a series of}} strong motion stations in the Imperial Valley and {{while the majority of}} stations in the array recorded ground accelerations that were not unexpected, station number six registered an unusually high <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> reading of 1.74g which, at the time, was the highest yet recorded as the result of an earthquake. One explanation of the anomaly attributed the amplification to path effects and a separate theory put forth described supershear effects that generated a focused pulse directly at the station. A later proposal stated that both multipath and focusing effects due to a [...] "lens like effect" [...] produced by a sedimentary wedge at the junction of the Imperial and Brawley faults (under the station) may have been the cause of the high reading.|$|E

500|$|The CSMIP Cape Mendocino {{station was}} {{installed}} in 1978 and was located just [...] from the epicenter on the slope of a ridge in the coast ranges. The instruments there had been mounted on a concrete platform adjacent to a roadway and remained firmly secured to the rock platform following the shocks. A landslide came within [...] of the device and left debris on the road, but a lack of large rocks close to the instrument and no cracking of the rocks near the platform left geologists with no clear explanation for the extraordinarily high <b>vertical</b> <b>component</b> reading of 1.85g. The tri-axial analog accelerometer that was in use was physically limited to that value and all three traces had uniformly significant values at three seconds into the recording. A post-earthquake lab test of the seismometer and an inspection of the photographically enlarged accelerogram revealed that the limit was hit twice, with a maximum deflection of 31mm, as the needle bounced off the unit's mass. An extrapolation of the vertical record led to a maximum acceleration estimate of 2.2g for that site, and the unit was eventually replaced with a higher capacity digital device.|$|E
