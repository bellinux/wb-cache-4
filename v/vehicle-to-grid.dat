5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E
5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Demand {{response}} devices {{could receive}} {{all sorts of}} messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This would allow electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent {{of the time of}} day. The <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> suggestion would use a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.|$|E
25|$|E-bike sharing is {{becoming}} more popular. The e-bikes are generally recharged upon parking them at their station. E-bikes extend {{the range of the}} bikes and make cities with more difficult topographies more accessible to biking. In 2009, Chiyu Chen proposed the Hybrid2-system which stores some of the pedal power on a (ultra) capacitor. Similar to <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> systems, the energy is then fed back to the main electricity grid. The Ohio State University announced plans to integrate electric assist bicycles as part of its bicycle share program launching in 2015.|$|E
25|$|In November 2005, {{more than}} 50 leaders from public power utility {{companies}} across the United States {{met at the}} Los Angeles Department of Water and Power headquarters to discuss plug-in hybrid and <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> technology. The event, which {{was sponsored by the}} American Public Power Association, also provided an opportunity for association members to plan strategies that public power utility companies could use to promote plug-in hybrid technology. Greg Hanssen and Peter Nortman of EnergyCS and EDrive attended the two-day session, and during a break in the proceedings, made an impromptu display in the LADWP parking lot of their converted Prius plug-in hybrid.|$|E
25|$|In September 2006, the California Air Resources Board held a Zero Emission Vehicle {{symposium}} {{that included}} several presentations on V2G technology. In April 2007, Pacific Gas and Electric Company showcased a PHEV at the Silicon Valley Leadership Alternative Energy Solutions Summit with <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> capability, and demonstrated {{that it could}} be used as a source of emergency home power in the event of an electrical power failure. Regulations intended to protect electricians against power other than from grid sources would need to be changed, or regulations requiring consumers to disconnect from the grid when connected to non-grid sources will be required before such backup power solutions would be feasible.|$|E
25|$|PHEVs {{and fully}} {{electric}} cars may allow for more {{efficient use of}} existing electric production capacity, much of which sits idle as operating reserve most of the time. This assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during off peak periods (i.e., at night), or equipped with technology known as charge control to shut off charging during periods of peak demand. Another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads. This is accomplished with <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> technology. By using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power, such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities {{as well as their}} owners. Even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of nighttime electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the daytime, and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure.|$|E

2500|$|Lately, upload sources {{typically}} {{originate from}} renewable sources (e.g., wind turbines, photovoltaic cells), or gas or steam turbines, {{which are often}} found in cogeneration systems. Another potential upload source that has been proposed is plug-in hybrid car batteries (<b>vehicle-to-grid</b> power systems). [...] This requires a [...] "smart grid," [...] which includes meters that measure electricity via communication networks that require remote control and give customers timing and pricing options. [...] <b>Vehicle-to-grid</b> systems could be installed at workplace parking lots and garages and at park and rides and could help drivers charge their batteries at home at night when off-peak power prices are cheaper, and receive bill crediting for selling excess electricity back to the grid during high-demand hours.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2007 Ford {{delivered}} the first Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid of {{a fleet of}} 20 demonstration PHEVs to Southern California Edison. As part of this demonstration program Ford also developed the first ever flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid SUV, which was delivered in June 2008. [...] This demonstration fleet of plug-ins has been in field testing with utility company fleets in the U.S. and Canada, and {{during the first two}} years since the program began, the fleet has logged more than 75,000 miles. In August 2009 Ford {{delivered the}} first Escape Plug-in equipped with intelligent <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> (V2G) communications and control system technology, and Ford plans to equip all 21 plug-in hybrid Escapes with the <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> communications technology.

2500|$|Jon Wellinghoff, {{from the}} US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, [...] {{coined the term}} [...] "Cash-Back Hybrids" [...] to {{describe}} payments to car owners for putting their batteries on the power grid. Batteries could also be offered in low-cost leasing or renting or by donation (including maintenance) to the car owners by the public utilities, in a <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> agreement.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2005, five Toyota {{engineers}} and one Asian AW engineer published an IEEE technical paper detailing a Toyota-approved project to add <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> capability to a Toyota Prius. Although the technical paper described [...] "a method for generating voltage between respective lines of neutral {{points in the}} generator and motor of the THS-II (Toyota Hybrid System) to add a function for generating electricity", it did not state {{whether or not the}} experimental vehicle could be charged through the circuit, as well. However, the vehicle was featured in a Toyota Dream House, and a brochure for the exhibit stated that [...] "the house can supply electricity to the battery packs of the vehicles via the stand {{in the middle of the}} garage", indicating that the vehicle may have been a plug-in hybrid.|$|E
2500|$|Plug-in hybrids' greenhouse-gas emissions, during {{operation}} in their all-electric range mode, {{depend on the}} type of power plant used to feed the electrical grid when the battery is charged. (See [...] "Greenhouse gas emissions", below.) If the batteries are charged directly from renewable sources off the electrical grid, then the tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions are zero when running only on battery power. Other benefits include improved national energy security, less frequent fill-ups at the filling station, the convenience of home recharging, opportunities to provide emergency backup power in the home, and <b>vehicle-to-grid</b> (V2G) applications. Several countries, including the United States, China, and several European countries, have enacted laws to ease the introduction of PHEVs through grants and tax credits, emissions mandates, and financing research and development in advanced batteries and related technology.|$|E
2500|$|Recharging a large {{battery pack}} {{presents}} a high {{load on the}} electrical grid, but this can be scheduled for periods of reduced load or reduced electricity costs. In order to schedule the recharging, either the charging station or the vehicle can communicate with the smart grid. Some plug-in vehicles allow the vehicle operator to control recharging through a web interface or smartphone app. Furthermore, in a <b>Vehicle-to-grid</b> scenario the vehicle battery can supply energy to the grid at periods of peak demand. This requires additional communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle electronics. SAE International is developing a range of standards for energy transfer {{to and from the}} grid including SAE J2847/1 [...] "Communication between Plug-in Vehicles and the Utility Grid". ISO and IEC are also developing a similar series of standards known as ISO/IEC 15118: [...] "Road vehicles -- Vehicle to grid communication interface".|$|E
2500|$|Plug-in hybrid or {{electric}} cars [...] {{could be used}} [...] for their energy storage capabilities. [...] <b>Vehicle-to-grid</b> technology can be employed, turning each vehicle with its 20 to 50kWh battery pack into a distributed load-balancing device or emergency power source. This represents 2 to 5 days per vehicle of average household requirements of 10kWh per day, assuming annual consumption of 3650kWh. This quantity of energy is equivalent to between [...] of range in such vehicles consuming 0.5 to 0.16kWh per mile. These figures can be achieved even in home-made electric vehicle conversions. Some electric utilities plan to use old plug-in vehicle batteries (sometimes resulting in a giant battery) to store electricity However, a large disadvantage of using vehicle to grid energy storage {{is the fact that}} each storage cycle stresses the battery with one complete charge-discharge cycle. Conventional (cobalt-based) lithium ion batteries break down with the number of cycles – newer li-ion batteries do not break down significantly with each cycle, and so have much longer lives. One approach is to reuse unreliable vehicle batteries in dedicated grid storage [...] as they are expected to be good in this role for ten years [...] [...] If such storage is done on a large scale it becomes much easier to guarantee replacement of a vehicle battery degraded in mobile use, as the old battery has value and immediate use.|$|E
