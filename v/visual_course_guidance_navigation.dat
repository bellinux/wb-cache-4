The SMAP spacecraft is a complicated dual-spinning design with a large 6 meter deployable mesh reflector mounted on a platform that spins at 14. 6 rpm while the <b>Guidance</b> <b>Navigation</b> and Control algorithms maintain precise nadir pointing for the de-spun portion of the spacecraft.

40|$|The Solar Sail Propulsion {{project is}} engaged in an ambitious program to raise the Technology Readiness Level of solar sails and prepare for a {{validation}} flight via a series of hardware ground demonstrations and development {{of a number of}} high fidelity simulations and models. <b>Guidance,</b> <b>navigation,</b> and control of solar sails is a key part of this effort. The large flexible structure and optical nature of solar sails create a considerable challenge for attitude control, thrust modeling, and navigation. In this paper, we present an overview and comparison of two recently delivered prototype solar sail <b>guidance,</b> <b>navigation,</b> and control software tools currently funded by the Solar Sail Propulsion project. The results of some key test cases are presented. Where possible, we also make comparisons to other software tools. We discuss the implications of the results of these comparative studies to the future direction and scope of development efforts for <b>guidance,</b> <b>navigation</b> and control software for solar sails, including the relationship to hardware test efforts such as the Thrust Vector Control Authority Demonstration...|$|R
