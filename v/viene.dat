Despite the triumph, Calvino grew increasingly worried by his inability to compose a worthy second novel. He returned to Einaudi in 1950, responsible this time for the literary volumes.

40|$|Jaime Humberto Hermosillo’s film {{adaptation}} of Elena Poniatowska’s short story “De noche vienes,” De noche <b>vienes,</b> Esmeralda (1997), questions and challenges gender norms and patriarchal power, just as Sor Juana did in her writings. Unlike the seventeenth–century author, however, he demonstrates women’s power through sexuality and emotion, revealing how such impulses can undermine and disrupt the Law of the Father. The film {{opens up the}} possibility of exploring, exploiting, and taming the male gaze—historically a device used {{as part of the}} apparatus that suppresses women—and offers an alternative polymorphous “female” gaze, one that counters the effects of patriarchy. De noche <b>vienes,</b> Esmeralda carefully and repeatedly invites the spectator’s active ocular participation in the process of re–defining the power plays of sexuality and gender. While questioning patriarchal convention and tradition, it also asks us to put aside (unconscious) assumptions about propriety and investigate alternative paradigms regarding Mexican national gender roles and sexuality. The protagonist Esmeralda, the ultimate embodied being, strips away the veneer to reveal the emptiness beneath the rules and regulations of patriarchal capitalism, in its nationalistic Mexican form. Taking on the stance of a polymorphic female gaze, spectators of the film can begin to participate in an alternative worldview, one that allows for free expression of love and sexuality, outside the forms created by church and state...|$|R

40|$|Según Danièle Moyal-Sharrock y Avrum Stroll, hay razones de peso para hablar de un “tercer Wittgenstein” cuyo corpus estaría formado por todas las obras que el filósofo <b>vienés</b> escribió con posterioridad a 1946, incluida la segunda parte de sus Investigaciones filosóficas. Entre las principales razones se encuentran el desarrollo de una nueva forma de fundamentalismo en la que el fundamento pertenece a una categoría distinta de lo fundamentado; la gramaticalización de la experiencia; la disolución del problema mente-cuerpo y la desmitificación del escepticismo. En este artículo no sólo analizo dichos argumentos, sino que también parto de las principales diferencias entre los que se han venido llamando “primer” y “segundo Wittgenstein” para concluir que no tiene sentido hablar de un “tercer Wittgenstein”. According to Danièle Moyal-Sharrock and Avrum Stroll, {{there are}} {{compelling}} reasons for {{talking about a}} “third Wittgenstein” whose corpus would {{be made up of}} all the works written by the Viennese philosopher following 1946, including the second part of his Philosophical Investigations. The main reasons are the description of a new form of foundationalism in which foundational items and the items which rest upon them do not belong to the same category; the grammaticalization of experience; the dissolution of the mind-body problem, and the demystification of scepticism. In this paper, I will not only analyze these arguments, but I will also bear in mind the main differences between the so-called “first” and “second Wittgenstein” to conclude that it doesn’t make sense to talk about a “third Wittgenstein”...|$|R
40|$|La Flauta Mágica, estrenada en Viena en septiembre de 1791, es la última ópera del gran músico austríaco, quien muere unos meses más tarde. El texto de esta obra, escrito por Emanuel Schikaneder, también actor y propietario del teatro (Freihaustheater) donde se representa por primera vez, combina el carácter de cuento para niños dramatizado según la tradición del teatro popular <b>vienés,</b> con sus personajes 'buenos' y 'malos' y de misterio o rito escénico en que se representan los valores e ideales humanistas de la Ilustración preconizados por la masonería, institución a la que pertenecían los autores. Por la complejidad de su contenido, la ópera ha merecido numerosas interpretaciones. En este artículo se destacan las de orientación psicoanalítica: según Erwin Ringel, quien pone de relieve el contenido humanista de la obra y la enseñanza de que en todo ser humano existen aspectos positivos y negativos y según Bernd Deinninger y Helmut Remmler quienes la caracterizan como la descripción del tránsito del individuo hacia la constitución de su personalidad adulta y la ubican en el marco del conflicto entre individuo e instituciones. En el artículo también se desarrollan los aspectos que remiten a la mitología clásica, en especial la relación con el mito de Orfeo. The Magic Flute is {{the last}} opera Mozart composed, in 1791, some months before dying, on the 5 th december. The text was written by Emanuel Schikaneder, {{who was at the}} same time an actor and the owner of the theater, called Freihaustheater in Wieden, in the {{outskirts}} of Vienna, where the first performance took place (september that year). The text is a happy mixture of a tale of enchantment with 'good'and 'wicked' characters cherished by the viennese, and a scenic Mysterium which reflects the ideals of the age of Enlightment and masonic ideology. Both Mozart and Schikaneder belonged to a massonic lodge. The text, which is rather complex, has been subject to a great deal of analysis from different music critics, scene directors and music lovers. This article deals with a specific kind of interpretation: one based on psychoanalitical cathegories. By Erwin Ringel, a viennese psychoanalist, who focuses the analysis of the piece on its humanitarian message and the concept that every human being has traces of goodnes and evil in itself, and by Bernd Deininger and Helmut Remmel who analyze the analogy between the contents of the opera and the psychical evolution of the self and with the conflict among individual and institutions. The article includes an overview of the mithological contents implicit in the piece, specially the Orpheus myth...|$|R
