2500|$|Gibson Trini Lopez- Bell's main guitar with Beady Eye; classic cherry {{body with}} Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Bell {{also uses}} a custom made guitar by Philippe Dubreuille, {{modelled}} over a Gibson Les Paul with handgraved metal cover and Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Lonnie Mack {{has used}} a 1958 Flying V {{fitted with a}} Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece</b> since the first year the Flying V was manufactured. He refers to it a [...] "No. 7", {{as he was told}} that it was the seventh guitar off the {{production}} line. In the mid-1990s Gibson issued a limited-edition [...] "Lonnie Mack" [...] model of the guitar.|$|E
50|$|The guitar {{has been}} {{produced}} {{both as a}} single-pickup instrument (ES-330T) and as a dual-pickup instrument (ES-330TD). Somewhat unusually, the ES-330T had its pickup mounted halfway between the bridge {{and the end of}} the neck, not in one of the usual neck or bridge positions. It has been available in sunburst, cherry, natural, walnut, and sparkling burgundy finishes. Tailpieces used are usually trapeze or Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpieces.</b> Due to its lack of popularity compared to the other Gibson thinline guitars (such as the ES-335, ES-345, and ES-355), the ES-330 was discontinued by Gibson in 1972. Since then, it has been reissued a few times by the Gibson Custom Shop division.|$|R
5000|$|Models {{produced}} between 1961 and 1965 {{have the}} original small pickguard; in 1966 the guitar was redesigned slightly {{with a different}} neck joint, and the modern larger semi-symmetrical [...] "batwing" [...] pickguard first appeared in 1966. This design continued until 1971, when variations of the SG were sold with a raised Les Paul style pickguard and a front-mounted control plate. The low-end SG-100 and the P-90 equipped SG-200 appeared during this time, {{as well as the}} luxurious SG Pro and SG Deluxe guitars. <b>Vibrato</b> (tremolo arm) <b>tailpieces</b> were also introduced as options.|$|R
2500|$|While the Raconteurs {{were still}} in development, White {{commissioned}} [...] Randy Parsons to create what White called the Triple Jet—a custom guitar styled after the Duo Jet double-cutaway guitar. Parsons's first product was painted copper color, however he decided to create a second version with a completely copper body, which White began to use instead. For the Raconteurs first tour, White also played a Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with a Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece</b> and three Filtertron pickups. He later added a custom Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with two cutaways, a lever-activated mute system, a built-in and retractable bullet microphone, and a light-activated theremin next to the Bigsby. White has dubbed this one the [...] "Green Machine", and it is featured in It Might Get Loud. He sometimes played a Gibson J-160E, a Gretsch Duo Jet in Cadillac Green, and a second Gretsch Rancher acoustic guitar. For the Raconteurs' 2008 tour, he had Analog Man plate all of his pedals in copper.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, new Standard model {{retained}} most specifications of the 1957 Goldtop, including PAF humbucker pickups, a maple top, and a tune-o-matic {{bridge with}} a stop tailpiece or Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece.</b> The gold color used since 1952 {{was replaced by}} a cherry-red version of the Sunburst finish long used on Gibson's flat-top and archtop acoustic and hollow electric guitars. Since the maple cap was now visible, tops were made either with a solid [...] "plaintop" [...] piece of maple or two bookmatched pieces of figured (curly or quilted) maple. To differentiate from the earlier Goldtop model, the new Les Paul was referred to as The Les Paul Standard. Specifications during 1958–60 varied from year to year and also from guitar to guitar. Typical 1958 Les Paul Standard necks had a thicker neck, thinner frets and lower fret height, which changed during the course of 1959 to develop into typical 1960 necks with a thinner cross-section and wider, higher frets. The cherry dye used on the 1958–59 models faded rapidly from ultraviolet light exposure, so in early 1960 Gibson switched to a new, fade-resistant formulation which was also less translucent and slightly more orange; this is sometimes called the [...] "tomato soup burst." [...] Original production of the Standards lasted from 1958 to early 1961. Only about 1,700 of these early models were made and have subsequently become highly valuable.The 1958–60 Standard is one of the highest priced vintage guitar models on the market, ranked at # on the 2011 Top 25 published by Vintage Guitar, and worth between $225,000 and $375,000.|$|E

5000|$|The Bigsby <b>Vibrato</b> <b>Tailpiece,</b> {{introduced}} in the late 1940s and used in close to original form on many guitars (including Gibson, Gretsch and Rickenbacker guitars) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Floyd Rose <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece</b> on the guitars {{was later}} {{replaced}} with the Vintage tremolo seen more often on Fender Stratocasters in the early 90's after a lawsuit with Rose himself over royalties.|$|E
50|$|The ES-355 was {{available}} with a Vibrola vibrato unit or a Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece.</b> It was also available with a stereo output and Varitone tone filter circuitry. When fitted with the optional stereo wiring and Varitone, {{the model was}} known as the ES-355TD-SV.|$|E
5000|$|The Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece</b> (or Bigsby for short) {{is a type}} of {{mechanical}} vibrato device for electric guitar designed by Paul A. Bigsby. The device allows musicians to bend the pitch of notes or entire chords with their pick hand for various effects.|$|E
50|$|The Epiphone {{company also}} {{produces}} an ES-175 model, {{available only in}} golden and black colours. The Epiphone model has an arched back as well. It is also equipped with two AlNiCo wax-dipped humbuckers. It also produced an ES-295, with all the original trimmings, plus a B-7 bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wide vibrato, {{as wide as}} a whole-tone, is {{commonly}} used among electric guitar players and adds the signature vocal-like expressiveness to the sound. This effect can be achieved both by the movement of fingers on the fretboard and {{by the use of}} a <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece,</b> a lever that adjusts the tension of the strings.|$|E
50|$|Many tremolo systems {{cannot be}} fitted to an archtop {{owing to the}} need to cut large holes in the belly to {{accommodate}} the mechanism, {{with the exception of the}} Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece</b> and the long tailpiece versions of the Gibson Vibrola. These vibrato systems mount on the surface of the guitar and need no body routing.|$|E
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of the shape is {{the difficulty in}} obtaining a suitable guitar case, owing to the large upper tail horn. Also some patterns of tremolo arm, for example the Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece,</b> the Mustang trem and the long pattern Gibson Vibrola, cannot be accommodated owing to the nearness of the bridge {{to the edge of}} the body.|$|E
50|$|The Mustang {{introduced}} the Fender Dynamic <b>Vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece,</b> which {{together with a}} floating bridge forms the Mustang vibrato system. The floating bridge concept is common to the Fender floating vibrato developed for the Jazzmaster, but on the Mustang the saddles have only a single string slot, while on other Fender guitars there are multiple slots to allow limited adjustment of the string spacing.|$|E
5000|$|J5 Bigsby Signature Telecaster, {{outfitted}} with a Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece,</b> a Fender Custom Shop Twisted Tele pickup in the neck position, and a Seymour Duncan Hot Rails humbucking pickup in the bridge position. The body has white binding {{on the top and}} back. This model also has a three-way blade style switch on the control plate instead of the usual three-way toggle.|$|E
5000|$|Vibrola tailpieces {{include a}} {{licensed}} {{version of the}} Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece,</b> earlier version of [...] using roller bridge ( [...] filed in 1961, issued in 1964), and several in-house Gibson designs. The Gibson designs {{did not have the}} impact of the Bigsby and Fender designs, and have inspired few if any copies, but they competed reasonably successfully and continue to sell.|$|E
5000|$|The SG {{generally}} {{has a solid}} mahogany body, with a black pickguard. The 24.75" [...] scale mahogany neck joins the body at the 22nd fret. The SG's set neck is shallower than the Gibson Les Pauls. The SG features the traditional Gibson combination of two humbucker pickups or P90 pickups and a Tune-o-matic bridge assembly, wraparound bridge, (or <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece,</b> depending on the model).|$|E
50|$|The {{versions}} with {{a master}} tone knob are equipped with Dynasonic (aka DeArmond) pickups, which are extremely popular for a classic full-bodied, low frequency tone. Most associated {{with the sound of}} guitarist Duane Eddy, Dynasonics are single coil pickups, and have been used on certain Gretsch models since the 1950s. Most models of the guitar come equipped with a Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece</b> in conjunction with a rocker bridge.|$|E
50|$|Another type of B-Bender is {{activated}} by the picking hand, like the Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece.</b> Unlike the Parsons/White model, this type {{does not require}} any structural modifications to the guitar body, and simply installs with a few screws. Examples are the Bigsby Palm Pedal, the Bowden B Bender (non-defacing to guitar - inventor, Richard Bowden), the Hipshot Palm Lever, and the Duesenberg Guitars Multibender. Each of these can bend multiple strings using different levers.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Gretsch tweaked the Falcon. The block inlays on the ebony {{fretboard}} {{were replaced}} with half-moon shaped inlays in 1957, the original single-coil DeArmond Dynasonic pickups were replaced with Filter'Tron humbuckers in 1958, and {{that same year}} the Melita bridge was replaced with a Space Control bridge; the Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece</b> was standard starting in 1962. A stereo version (model 6137) became available as well. It also switched to a twin-cutaway body beginning in 1962.|$|E
5000|$|Discontinued in 1959, it was reissued in 1994 {{with the}} earlier P-90 pickup design, as opposed to humbuckers it had been {{equipped}} with since 1957, and a Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece,</b> replacing the original trapeze tailpiece design. [...] Epiphone released a Korean made ES-295 model, also with P-90s and a Bigsby. Gibson Memphis released a recreation of a 1952 ES-295 with P-90s and original trapeze tailpiece design, offered in Bullion Gold and a limited edition Sixties Cherry stain.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "synchronised tremolo" [...] was {{introduced}} in 1954 on the first Stratocaster guitar. The only previously successful [...] "tremolo arm" [...] was the Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece,</b> often simply called a [...] "Bigsby". In 1958, Fender reinforced his usage with the [...] "Fender floating tremolo" [...] on the Jazzmaster and some subsequent guitars. The [...] "synchronised tremolo" [...] became the most copied of these three basic patterns of [...] "tremolo arm", although both of the others continue to have some following.|$|E
5000|$|Still another {{design was}} {{used on the}} student model Fender Bronco, {{released}} mid-1967. This was simply known as the Fender <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece,</b> or sometimes the Fender steel vibrato. It was again designed by Leo Fender although he had sold the company {{by the time it}} appeared. Basically a synchronized tremolo simplified to reduce cost, it had little popularity, and [...] was the only Leo Fender vibrato arm design not available on any current Fender model.In 1981 G&L released the F-100 guitar with a Dual-fulcrum Vibrato designed by Leo Fender, one of G&L's owners.|$|E
5000|$|White's design {{called for}} adding a third humbucker pickup to a Gretsch Double Jet, and putting an MXR Micro Amp inside the guitar. Selecting the middle pickup {{produces}} an instant overdriven sound.The electronics, {{coupled with the}} weight of the solid copper top, makes the guitar heavier than most [...] "commercial" [...] guitars. It has a Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece.</b> The Triple Jet guitars were built by American luthier Randy Parsons in Seattle, Washington. This similar to Pete Townshend's concept for the 3-pickup Les Pauls he used during the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The Casino, also {{designated}} by Epiphone as model E230TD, is a thinline hollow-bodied guitar with two Gibson P-90 pick-ups. Although generally {{fitted with a}} trapeze-type tailpiece, often a Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece</b> is used in its place (either as a factory direct feature or as an aftermarket upgrade). Unlike semi-hollow body guitars such as the Gibson ES-335, which have a center block to promote sustain and reduce feedback, the Casino and its cousin, the Gibson ES-330 are true hollow-bodied guitars. This makes it lighter, and louder when played without an amplifier, but much more prone to feedback than semi-hollow or solid-body electrics.|$|E
5000|$|Bernard Joseph Butler (born 1 May 1970) is an English musician, {{songwriter}} {{and record}} producer. He {{is best known}} as the first guitarist with Suede, until his departure in 1994. He has been hailed by some critics as the greatest guitarist of his generation; BBC journalist Mark Savage called him [...] "one of Britain's most original and influential guitarists". He was voted the 24th greatest guitarist of the last 30 years in a national 2010 BBC poll and is often seen performing with a 1961 cherry red Gibson ES-355 TD SV (Stereo Varitone) with a Bigsby <b>vibrato</b> <b>tailpiece.</b>|$|E
