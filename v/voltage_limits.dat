2500|$|When the {{collector}} current {{rises above the}} data sheet limit [...] a new breakdown mechanism become important: the second breakdown. This phenomenon is caused by excessive heating of some points (hot spots) in the base-emitter region of the bipolar junction transistor, which give rise to an exponentially increasing current through these points: this exponential rise of current in turn gives rise to even more overheating, originating a positive thermal feedback mechanism. While analyzing the [...] static characteristic, {{the presence of this}} phenomenon is seen as a sharp collector voltage drop and a corresponding almost vertical rise of {{the collector}} current. At the present, {{it is not possible to}} produce a transistor without hot spots and thus without second breakdown, since their presence is related to the technology of refinement of silicon. During this process, very small but finite quantities of metals remain in localized portions of the wafer: these particles of metals became deep centers of recombination, i.e. centers where current exists in a preferred way. While this phenomenon is destructive for Bipolar junction transistors working in the usual way, it can be used to push-up further the current and <b>voltage</b> <b>limits</b> of a device working in avalanche mode by limiting its time duration: also, the switching speed of the device is not negatively affected.

40|$|Independently {{controlled}} multimotor drives {{are typically}} realized {{by using a}} common dc link and independent sets of three-phase inverters and motors. In {{the case of an}} open-circuit fault in an inverter leg, one motor becomes single phase. To enable continued controllable operation by eliminating single phasing, the supply for the motor phase with the faulted inverter leg can be paralleled to a healthy leg of another inverter using hardware reconfiguration. Hence, the two motors are now supplied from a five-leg inverter, which has inherent voltage and current limitations.
