40|$|Anterior chamber {{aspiration}} and <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> {{were evaluated}} as diagnostic procedures for establishing a specific microbiological diagnosis in the rabbit model of hematogenous Candida endophthalmitis. <b>Vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> {{was the most}} successful procedure, confirming the diagnosis of hematogenous Candida endophthalmitis in 62 % of eyes with documented intraocular infection. When animals with only the most severe clinical endophthalmitis were considered, <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> confirmed the diagnosis in 89 % of eyes evaluated. <b>Vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> correlated well with the extent of clinical endophthalmitis, {{as well as with}} postmortem, whole-vitreous cultures. Gram staining of the aspirate was additive to culture results in confirming the diagnosis. Anterior chamber aspiration was positive in only 1 of 58 eyes evaluated (1. 7 %). Additionally, muscle biospy was evaluated in this study as a tool for establishing a microbiological diagnosis in the rabbit model of disseminated candidiasis. Only 2 of 131 biospy specimens contained detectable Candida. Although <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> may be associated with ocular complications, in certain clinical settings this procedure may be valuable in establishing the definitive microbiological diagnosis of hematogenous Candida endophthalmitis...|$|E
40|$|A patient {{presented}} with a posterior uveitis. An inferior plaque of retinal exudation was seen. Full investigation failed to establish a cause until six weeks later, when cryptococcal meningitis developed. The patient was immunocompetent.

40|$|This {{report of}} 54 {{suspected}} cases of endophthalmitis emphasizes the following findings: 1. That <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> is more sensitive {{in making a}} culture proven diagnosis than anterior chamber paracentesis. 2. That Staphylococcus epidermidis {{is a much more}} common cause of endophthalmitis than previously apprediated. 3.

30|$|Further {{diagnostic}} {{evaluation of}} the patient revealed peripheral eosinophilia, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was negative for cerebral larvae. Based on its appearance, gnathostomiasis was high on the differential diagnosis. A 23 -gauge pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the foreign body was performed. Intraoperatively, the presumed worm was noted {{to be associated with}} superficial retinal hemorrhages and resist aspiration. The worm was eventually aspirated with a <b>vitreous</b> cutter using <b>aspiration</b> only. The specimen, within the tip of the vitreous cutter, was sent for microscopic evaluation by the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. The patient was discharged on oral ivermectin and recovered well.|$|R
40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} {{the choice of}} different treatments for malignant glaucoma. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, 21 malignant glaucoma patients(21 eyes) admitted in Wuhan General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command from May 2012 to May 2013 were analyzed. Sixteen eyes(76 %) developed malignant glaucoma after filtration surgery, 3 eyes(14 %) after EX-PRESS glaucoma filtration device, 2 eyes(10 %) after glaucoma filtration Ahmed valve implantation. Main Outcome of corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure(IOP), anterior chamber depth and complications were detected. RESULTS: IOP recovered by drug control in 13 eyes, anterior chamber depth. Four eyes were treated by <b>vitreous</b> water-bag <b>aspiration</b> combined with anterior chambers reconstructing. Two eyes were treated by cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. Two eyes were treated by posterior capsule excision combined with anterior vitrectomy. IOP before and after treatment was 29. 81 ± 4. 98, 12. 71 ± 3. 77 mmHg, respectively(P = 0. 00). Anterior chamber depth before and after treatment was 0. 41 ± 0. 34, 2. 13 ± 0. 54 mm, respectively(P = 0. 00). Corrected visual acuity before treatment was 0. 19 ± 0. 17, after treatment was 0. 20 ± 0. 16 (P = 0. 36). Except for vitreous hemorrhage in 1 eye, there were no ocular or systemic adverse events observed in all patients. CONCLUSION: It is good to diagnose malignant glaucoma in early period, and treated it step by step. For this can reduce IOP and restore anterior chamber...|$|R
30|$|As the {{posterior}} uvea {{is the most}} common location of infection, posterior uveitis is commonly associated with infectious origin, but the anterior uveitis often has idiopathic origin so commonest indication for ocular fluid tap for PCR analysis in our series too was posterior uveitis (38 %). However, analysis of aqueous was more commonly performed because anterior chamber tap is a less invasive and hazardous procedure than the <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> and can also be performed in the OPD.|$|E

40|$|Dina Joy K Abulon Medical Affairs, Alcon Research, Ltd, Lake Forest, CA, USA Purpose: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} effects of instrument settings on porcine vitreous flow rates through dual pneumatic high-speed vitrectomy probes. Methods: The CONSTELLATION® Vision System was tested with 250, 450, and 650 mmHg of vacuum using six ULTRAVIT® vitrectomy probes of each diameter (25 +®, 25, 23, and 20 gauge) operated from 500 cuts per minute (cpm) up to 5, 000 cpm. Duty cycle modes tested included biased open, 50 / 50, and biased closed. Flow rates were calculated by assessing {{the change in}} weight of porcine eyes during <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration.</b> Volumetric flow rate was measured with a computer-connected electronic scale. Results: At lower cut rates, the biased open mode produced higher flow than did the 50 / 50 mode, which produced higher flow than did the biased closed mode. In the biased closed and 50 / 50 modes, vitreous flow rates tended to increase with increasing cut rate. Vitreous flow rates in the biased open duty cycle mode remained relatively constant across cut rates. Conclusion: Vitreous flow rates through dual pneumatic vitrectomy probes could be manipulated by changing the duty cycle modes on the vitrectomy system. Differences in duty cycle behavior suggest that high-speed cut rates of 5, 000 cpm may optimize <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration.</b> Keywords: enhanced 25 -gauge vitrectomy, 25 -gauge vitrectomy, 20 -gauge vitrectomy, 23 -gauge vitrectomy, aspiration, Constellation Vision Syste...|$|E
30|$|To {{confirm the}} {{presence}} of a specific etiology, <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> and diagnostic vitrectomy followed by a culture and histological examination are commonly used [16, 43, 51]. The need for a diagnostic vitrectomy is dependent on the clinician’s judgment. Vitrectomy has a higher diagnostic yield for culture (92  %) compared to a vitreous aspirate (44  %) as shown by Lingappan et al. [5]. Similar results were obtained in another study with needle biopsy negative cases growing organisms on culture following vitrectomy [52]. The study showed that vitreous samples during vitrectomy were taken near the retinal surface, which can potentially explain the lower yield of needle biopsy as early or localized infection located near the retinal surface might be missed by a needle biopsy [16].|$|E

40|$|Vitreous {{specimens}} can {{be useful}} for diagnosis of intraocular infection, inflammation, and neoplasms. Concern has been raised that obtaining vitreous specimens through a guillotine cutter might result in suboptimal cytologic changes. To determine if aspiration yields better cytologic information than vitrectomy, the authors performed experimental vitreous biopsies on rabbit eyes with vitritis to compare specimens taken by aspiration or vitrectomy with cutting rates of 100, 300, 600 per minute. The specimens were processed by cytospin preparations and stained with Papanicolaou and May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain. There {{was no difference in}} the adequacy of the specimens. Cell loss or damage to cell morphologic features when obtaining specimens through aspiration or vitrectomy at different cutting rates could not be differentiated by a blinded cytologic evaluation. A theoretical model of shear stress on cells passing through a guillotine cutter was also developed. The experimental and theoretical data show that vitrectomy with a cutting rate as fast as 600 per minute yields an adequate specimen with a sufficient number of well preserved cells to make definite cytologic interpretations, and that <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> is not necessary...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{report a}} case of {{postoperative}} endophthalmitis caused by Fusarium species successfully treated with intravitreal and systemic voriconazole after treatment failure with amphotericin B. Methods. Clinical case report of a 60 -year-old immunocompetent woman who presents with endophthalmitis of unknown origin 4 weeks after uneventful cataract extraction and IOL implantation surgery. IOL explantation, vitrectomy with capsular bag removal, <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> for culture, and intravitreal injection of amphotericin B (5 [*]μg/ 0. 1 [*]mL) were performed. Diagnosis was established by culturing the vitreous aspirate on a Sabouraud agar medium and staining with lactophenol blue solution. Five days later, there was no clinical response. The {{decision was made to}} administer a single dose of intravitreal voriconazole (2. 5 [*]μg/ 0. 1 [*]mL) and oral voriconazole (200 [*]mg BID) for 30 days. Results. Fusarium sp. grew on culture. Treatment with local and systemic voriconazole was started after no improvement with vitrectomy, IOL explantation, and intravitreal amphotericin B. After 1 month of treatment, the infection resolved and best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 25. Conclusion. In patients with endophthalmitis caused by Fusarium sp., topical and systemic voriconazole treatment should be considered in cases resistant to intravitreal amphotericin B...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. In here we {{described}} {{cytomegalovirus retinitis}} (CMVR) in 12 -year-old male patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who was on maintenance phase therapy. Methods. He was referred to our clinic for seeing of spots with the right eye for 3 days. At presentation, his best corrected visual acuity was 20 / 20 in the right eye and 20 / 20 in the left eye. Slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination of the anterior chamber of the left eye was within normal limits, whereas we observed 3 + anterior chamber cellular reaction in the right eye. On retinal examination, we found active retinitis lesions (cream-colored lesions associated with hemorrhages) and perivascular cuffing in the retinal periphery in the right eye. Left eye was normal. Results. On the basis of clinical picture, we made the diagnosis of CMVR in the right eye. <b>Vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> was performed and 23096 [*]copies/mL of CMV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.

30|$|The precise {{etiology}} of VKH disease is unclear, {{and it has}} been postulated that pathogenesis involves an autoimmune process directed against melanocytes triggered by an infectious agent in genetically susceptible individuals [[1]], leading to the loss of melanocytes and subsequent depigmentation [[14],[15]]. The potential role of infection in the pathogenesis of VKH disease is supported by the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> of a patient with VKH disease [[16]], and cross-reactions between melanocyte peptides and cytomegalovirus envelope glycoprotein resulting in melanocyte proliferation [[17]]. However, a causative association between viral agents and VKH disease has not yet been established. The autoimmune response against melanocytes is complex and involves innate, humoral, and cellular immunity. CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes, as well as Th 17 and regulatory T cells, have all been implicated in the pathogenesis [[18]]. High titres of IgG against KU-MEL- 1, an antigen expressed by human melanocytes, have been detected in patients with VKH disease [[19]]. Innate immunity may also {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of VKH disease as evidenced by the presence of histiocytic and multinucleated giant cell infiltrates in enucleated eyes with VKH disease [[14]]. In combination with environmental factors, genetic factors are of paramount importance in various immune processes in VKH disease. This review aims to provide an overview on the role of genetics in the development of VKH disease and the clinical importance and implications of genetics in VKH disease.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the changes of anterior scleral thickness in acute angle-closure glaucoma patients with high intraocular pressure(IOP) after phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation with ultrasound biomicroscope. METHODS: The prospective clinical study enrolled 65 cases(72 eyes) with primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and cataract of whom IOP {{were all over}} 50 mmHg. IOP of all patients were still over 45 mmHg with shallow anterior chamber after general and topical medical management. Phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation combined with goniosynechialysis were performed after <b>vitreous</b> <b>aspiration</b> in all patients. Ultrasound biomicroscope was performed preoperatively and at 1, 6 mo postoperatively. The anterior chamber depth(ACD), anterior scleral thickness(AST) and angle opening distance at 500 μm from the scleral spur(AOD 500) were measured at superior, temporal, nasal and inferior to detect the changes of anterior segment parameters. RESULTS: The ACD were 1. 532 ± 0. 316, 3. 337 ± 0. 652 and 3. 458 ± 0. 482 mm preoperatively and at 1 and 6 mo postoperatively, and {{there were significant differences}} between before and postoperatively(P P P > 0. 05).
