5000|$|In a <b>valve</b> <b>regulated</b> <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> battery (VRLA) the {{hydrogen}} and oxygen produced in the cells largely recombine into water. Leakage is minimal, although some electrolyte still escapes if the recombination cannot keep up with gas evolution. Since VRLA batteries do not require (and make impossible) regular checking of the electrolyte level, they have been called maintenance free batteries. However, this is somewhat of a misnomer. VRLA cells do require maintenance. As electrolyte is lost, VRLA cells [...] "dry-out" [...] and lose capacity. This can be detected by taking regular internal resistance, conductance or impedance measurements. Regular testing reveals whether more involved testing and maintenance is required. Recent maintenance procedures have been developed allowing [...] "rehydration", often restoring significant amounts of lost capacity.|$|E
50|$|GM {{launched}} a hybrid {{version of the}} Silverado/Sierra in 2004, becoming the first ever GM hybrid passenger vehicle. Known within GM as the Parallel Hybrid Truck or PHT it is not actually a parallel hybrid by the current definition, but a type of micro hybrid design. The electric motor housed within the transmission flywheel housing, serves only to provide engine cranking/starting, battery charging, and powering accessories. The engine automatically shuts down as the truck {{comes to a stop}} and uses 42 Volt electric power to the starter/generator unit to restart the engine as the brake pedal is released. Besides the typical 12 V automotive battery the PHT uses three additional 12 V <b>valve</b> <b>regulated</b> <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> (VRLA) batteries mounted under the rear seat to store and provide power. The truck uses a 5.3 L Vortec 5300 V8 for primary propulsion power. These trucks were also purchased back from customers for more than what they were worth in the late 2000s.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new {{improved}} coulomb counting {{method is}} proposed {{to estimate the}} State-of-Charge (SOC) of a 12 V <b>valve</b> <b>regulated</b> <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> (VRLA) battery. The conventional coulomb counting method estimates the SOC with a high error rate for high discharge current. Experimental results show the error in the conventional SOC estimation {{is as high as}} 16 % for higher discharge currents. This error in the SOC estimation is due to the underestimation of the battery capacity. To compensate this error, a new charging coefficient is proposed.

40|$|In most {{autonomous}} off-grid {{wind energy}} systems {{it is necessary}} to store energy at times when there is an excess and release it at times when there is a deficit.

Replacement costs factor significantly into the life-cycle costs of battery systems and one of the shortcomings of the conventional battery is its relatively short cycle life.

40|$|We tested whether <b>valve</b> <b>regulated,</b> {{intermittent}} flow of urine from catheterized bladders decreases catheter encrustation. Materials and Methods Laboratory {{models of the}} catheterized bladder were infected with Proteus mirabilis. Urine was allowed to drain continuously through the catheters or <b>regulated</b> by <b>valves</b> to drain intermittently at predetermined intervals. The time that catheters required to become blocked was recorded and encrustation was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Results When a manual valve was used to drain urine from the bladder at 2 -hour intervals 4 times during the day, catheters required significantly longer to become blocked than those on continuous drainage (mean 62. 6 vs 35. 9 hours, p = 0. 039). A similar 1. 7 -fold increase occurred when urine was drained at 4 -hour intervals 3 times daily. Experiments with an automatic valve in which urine was released at 2 or 4 -hour intervals through {{the day and night}} also showed a significant increase in mean time to blockage compared with continuous drainage (p = 0. 001). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that crystalline biofilm was less extensive on <b>valve</b> <b>regulated</b> catheters. Conclusions <b>Valve</b> <b>regulated,</b> {{intermittent flow}} of urine through catheters increases the time that catheters require to become blocked with crystalline biofilm. The most beneficial effect was recorded when urine was released from the bladder at 4 -hour intervals throughout the day and night by an automatic valve. ...|$|R

The results showed that the hydrogen evolution reaction rates of the alloys {{had an impact on the}} corrosion areas with the maximum thickness of the alloys and the depth of corrosion layers.

40|$|It is very {{important}} {{to have the ability to}} determine the available capacity, the state of charge (SoC), and the state of health (SoH) of a battery; this ensures that the battery has the available power for the system requirements. A battery is aged by charging and discharging cycles; this process degrades the chemical composition of the battery. An undercharged battery has sulphation and stratification effects that shorten the lifetime of the battery. Overcharging causes gassing and water loss. This paper describes a novel two-pulse test to determine the AHC, SoC, and SoH of a <b>valve</b> <b>regulated</b> <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> (VRLA) and a lithium ion battery. These parameters are related to the voltage drop after each pulse of current discharge. The first pulse stabilizes the battery relative to its previous history, and the second pulse establishes the parameters.

40|$|Cycle life {{tests have}} been carried out to {{evaluate}} the influence of safety valve pressure on <b>valve</b> <b>regulated</b> lead/ acid batteries under deep cycling applications. Batteries were cycled at 5 hour rates at 100 % DOD, and safety valve pressure was set to 1. 08 and 2. 00 bar, respectively. The batteries lost 248. 3 g and 235. 3 g of water for each case after about 1, 200 cycles, but the cyclic performances of the batteries were comparable. Most of the gas of the battery during discharging was hydrogen, and the oxygen concentration increased to 18 % after 3 hours of charging. The micro structure of the positive active materials was completely changed and the corrosion layer of the positive grid was less than 50 µm, regardless of the pressure of the safety valve after cycle life tests. The cause of discharge capacity decrease was found to be water loss and the shedding of the positive active materials. The pressure of safety valve does not give little effect to the cyclic performances and the failure modes of the gelled electrolyte valve-regulated <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries...|$|R
