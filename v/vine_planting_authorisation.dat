In the Introduction, {{the significance of}} the study is represented by showing why the study for use of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> in Japan is belated to those in Europe and America and also the possibility of the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> being used extensively in the urban green and landscaping projects in Japan. In Chapter 1, the characteristics of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are investigated theoretically, and a methodological framework for case study and analysis is examined. First, the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are classified in seven categories {{from the point of view}} that they are organs climbing on other objects, and to these is added one category for other plants showing similar properties to the lianas, being specified as 2 ̆ 2 lianoid plants. 2 ̆ 2 Thus, the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are classified in total eight categories according to their characteristics for application. On the other hand, the structures on which the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are dependent are classified in fifteen types. Then, theoretically possible combinations of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> and their supports are investigated, and a table serving as a basis for analysis is prepared. In Chapter 2, the result of investigation and analysis of the cases of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> mainly in the urban area in Tokyo is shown, and the problems to be resolved hereafter are discussed. The findings of the investigation are generally as follows: a) The <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> used over a wall of a large scale are comprised overwhelmingly of Japanese ivy which has a strong adsorptive force shows a growth coming up to a height of 20 m in about 10 years; b) With the new type commercial high-rise buildings, nutant characteristics of the plants of the hedera genus are generally employed; c) With the tea houses, restanrants and other similar shops, the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are used in order to give an impression of Western style; d) In the independent houses, use of a variety of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> is seen; e) For the trellis, the traditional wisteria is used generally...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} <b>vines</b> <b>planted</b> at Hanzell are {{purported to}} be the oldest continually producing Chardonnay and Pinot noir vines in the Western Hemisphere. The original Chardonnay <b>vines</b> <b>planted</b> at Hanzell are Wente Clone and arrived at Hanzell {{by way of the}} McCreas' Stony Hill vineyard in St. Helena, which obtained its cuttings from the Wente Livermore Vineyard in 1948. [...] The original Pinot noir <b>vines</b> <b>planted</b> at Hanzell were derived from Martin Ray estate cuttings (now commonly referred to as the Mount Eden clone). The original Pinot noir vines at Mount Eden Vineyards were pulled out in 1997, and the original block of Pinot noir at Chalone planted in 1946 was replaced in 2003. [...] As of 2010, the 1953 blocks (C53 and N53) at Hanzell continue to produce, and the grapes are typically blended with grapes from the <b>vines</b> <b>planted</b> in subsequent years. From time to time, Hanzell bottles wines derived solely from these original blocks and dubs them [...] "Ambassador's 1953 Vineyard" [...] wines.|$|R

40|$|Araneofauna of {{vineyards}} {{is relatively}} known in Central Europe {{but we have}} a lack of knowledge about araneofauna which occur directly on the <b>vine</b> <b>plants.</b> Our investigation was focused on spiders which live on <b>vine</b> <b>plants,</b> especially on the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> trunks. We investigated spiders in six vineyards in southern Moravia (Šatov, Mikulov, Popice, Morkůvky, Nosislav and Blučina). Vineyards were under different soil management, traps were placed on different parts of particular locality (terraced and plain) and all localities were under integrated pest management. We employed two types of cardboard traps for spider collecting during whole vegetation season. Altogether, we collected 21 spider species which belong to seven families. The most important species was Marpissa nivoyi (Lucas, 1836), which is mentioned in the Red List as vulnerable (VU) and Sibianor tantulus (Simon, 1868) which had unknown distribution in the Czech Republic. The other very interesting result is that the most common species is myrmecomorph Synageles venator (Lucas, 1836), which is scarcely recorded in such huge numbers as we documented in our study...|$|R

The <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> at a sown area of 1  ha were sprayed once with the preparation in the budding–florescence phase. The development of powdery mildew of grapes was reduced to 54 % comparing with 91 % in control (untreated plants) (Table  1).

On the whole, the yield of grapes increased by 1.5 times in comparison with that in control (without treatment) [42].|$|R

5000|$|Trichosanthes dioica, {{also known}} as parval or pointed gourd, is a <b>vine</b> <b>plant</b> in the Cucurbitaceae family, similar to {{cucumber}} and squash, though unlike those it is perennial. It is a dioecious (male and female <b>plants)</b> <b>vine</b> (creeper) <b>plant</b> with heart-shaped leaves (cordate) and is grown on a trellis. The fruits are green with white or no stripes. Size can vary from small and round to thick and long [...] - [...] 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 cm). It thrives well under a hot to moderately warm and humid climate. The plant remains dormant during the winter season and prefers a fertile, well-drained sandy loam soil due to its susceptibility to water-logging.|$|R

50|$|The west {{slope of}} the Howell Mountains is noted for its {{vineyards}} and wineries, {{which tend to be}} located where the soils are derived from rhyolite tuffs. Although rhyolitic rocks generally weather to soils that are considered to be nutrient poor, the Howell Mountain American Viticultural Area and other wine appellation districts located on the west slope claim that grape <b>vines</b> <b>planted</b> in these soils are stressed and as a consequence produce wine grapes that are superior in quality for wine making when compared to grapes grown on unstressed <b>vines</b> <b>planted</b> in the richer loams of the valley floor. Despite the observation that volcanic soils on the east slope (Suisun Valley side) are similar to those on the west slope (Napa Valley side), cattle grazing predominates on the east slope and vineyards are few.|$|R
