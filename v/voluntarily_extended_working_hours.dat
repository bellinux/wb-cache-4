40|$|Abstract: A {{literature}} review of 105 {{studies on the}} effects of <b>extended</b> daily <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> was conducted. Potential negative effects of <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> are discussed: More accidents on the job; more accidents off the job; reduced duration and quality of sleep due to moonlighting; sleepiness; reduced alertness; fatigue; adverse effects on performance; prolonged toxic exposure; adverse effects on health; increased absenteeism; problems communicating with managers; and problems while driving home. Potential positive effects of <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> are discussed: Less travel time and costs; more time for the family, social life, and domestic duties; increased satisfaction with working hours; fewer handovers; and less overtime. No firm conclusions can be drawn because of the partly contradictory results and the methodological problems of many studies. However, caution is advised when considering the introduction of extended work shifts, particularly where public safety is at stake. A checklist is provided (concerning work load, breaks, staffing level, systematic assessments of health and safety factors) to support decisions for or against the use of extended work shifts...|$|R

Pakistan being a developing country where traditionally males are the bread earners and females are considered to be the home makers, the trend is changing. Females are now considered equal partners in sustaining family livelihood. This change has brought in numerous problems especially of family wellbeing. The research was conducted in the banking sector and sample consisted of both partners working in the banking industry. Sample was selected through non-probability purposive sampling. The results of the study show that two of the dimensions of <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> namely work life balance and work stressors have significant impact on the wellbeing of the family where as the third dimension inflexible work schedule does not have significant impact. The results of the study are consistent with the past researches and show that Pakistani dual earners are no more different than their counterparts elsewhere in the world and face similar problems that are being faced by them.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this review}} {{is to examine the}} effect of shift work and <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> on {{occupational}} injuries. A calculation based on four studies shows that the risk of occupational injury during afternoon shifts was 6 % lower than that during morning shifts. The same kind of calculation showed that the risk of occupational injury during night shifts was 15 % lower than during morning shifts. A review of eight studies showed that the risk of occupational injury was 41 % higher for 10 -hour working days compared to 8 -hour working days. On the other hand, working 12 -hour days increased the risk of occupational injury by 14 %. When working more than 12 hours per day, three studies showed a 98 % increase in involvement in occupational injury. The results of this study showed that shift work considerably increased the risk of occupational injury in the USA, but not in the other countries. <b>Extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> was related to elevated risk of occupational injury. Thus shift work and long work hours did not suit for all employees...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the potential energy cost savings {{of this approach}} for three real cases. The savings can be largely estimated by comparing whole-campus electricity consumptions between typical weekdays and weekends (or holidays). Energy overheads caused by the <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> (two more <b>hours</b> per <b>working</b> day) were also estimated. A limited shutdown scenario (similar to a typical weekend schedule) and a more aggressive shutdown scenario (similar to a typical holiday schedule) during the weekend periods are presented. The potential savings opportunities were from 0. 32 % to 1. 53 % of the annual electricity bills for different universities. The recent budget cuts campaign mandated by the governor?s office had all state agencies in Texas {{looking for ways to}} reduce revenue spending. One of the cost savings opportunities perceived by many university officials is to convert a typical 5 -workday week into a 4 -workday week (e. g., Monday to Thursday) with 10 <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> each day during the universities summer session. The potential savings come {{from the fact that the}} universities can be partially shut down during the prolonged weekends (Friday to Sunday). It is believed that the savings from partially shutting down an extra workday is much more significant than the marginal energy increase caused by the <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> during workday...|$|R

40|$|Background: Work-family {{conflict}} {{is related to}} poor psychological and physical health, absence and deterioration of relationship quality at home. Work-life balance is related to improved well-being, motivation and productivity. Objectives: To examine the relation of demands and resources at work and work-family conflict and work-family balance based on the job demands-resources model. Material and method: The analyses were conducted {{on the basis of}} data from European Social Survey Round 5 2010 / 2011. The sample used consisted of Norwegian workers with at least one child living at home. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted, in order to examine the significance of demands and resources related to both directions of work-family conflict and work-family balance. Results: Work pressure, number of work <b>hours</b> and <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> are associated with work-family conflict. Opportunities for advancement and support from co-workers are associated with reduced work-family conflict. A secure job and a job which requires learning new things are associated with reduced family-work conflict. Number of <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> are associated with reduced work-family balance, while autonomy, support from co-workers, appropriately pay and the opportunity for advancement are associated with work-family balance. Conclusion: Demands at work have a great significance for both work-family conflict and work-family balance, and indicate that reducing demands at work can reduce conflict and promote a balance. Resources also have significance, and indicate that resources at work can reduce the level of conflict and promote a balance...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on {{qualitative}} and survey research {{in a number}} of organisations, we report on some of the causes and effects of <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>Extended</b> hours were mostly employer-driven, where workplace regulation of hours was weak so employees were not compensated for extra hours worked, though in a minority of instances it was jointly driven by employers and employees who benefited from overtime pay. Workplace culture was important in shaping extended hours. Employees internalised pressure to work long hours, so that without adequate say on their workload, employees with higher say in their <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> tended to work longer hours. Yet many full-time employees were <b>working</b> more <b>hours</b> than they wanted, and there was strong support for an upper limit on hours.

This paper provides the idea how productivity levels changes at different time during normal <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> in apparel industries. A noble approach is also proposed to optimize the productivity level. There are many factors which act as obstacles to higher productivity. Unskilled workers, physical fatigue from <b>extended</b> <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> without rest, misplacement of worker at workstation, lack of training, lack of knowledge, awareness are few factors related to worker which directly affect the productivity. Fatigue lowers average productivity, measured as output per worker hour, for almost all of the apparel industries. As the overall daily performance of each worker is not same and the change in their performance defer from one worker to another worker bottleneck creates in the assembly line. During the investigation attention is concentrated on how physical fatigue of workers influences the daily production rate and how to optimize the productivity. If physical fatigue exists, loss due to fatigue can be reduced to a remarkable label. Here, a study has been carried out to find out the effect of fatigue on productivity and to form a framework to improve the productivity based on the overall performance of workers by reducing fatigue...|$|R

In a female dominated profession, we find the profession resisting attempts to make the profession more accessible to women with young children. The career progression of women with children is inhibited and this is driven in part by a determination to maintain ‘traditional’ employment practices. It develops Heilman's argument that gender perceptions, by both males and females can be biased against women and these produce gender inequalities in employment. These findings are relevant across many areas of employment and they are significant in relation to broadening the debate around equal opportunities for women...|$|R
