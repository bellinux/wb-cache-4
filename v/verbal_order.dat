5|$|Despite Lee's {{hope for}} an early start, it took all morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's <b>verbal</b> <b>order</b> or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E
5|$|On 14August1942, Herring {{was ordered}} to Esk, Queensland, to assume command of II Corps with the {{temporary}} rank of Lieutenant General. As such, {{he was responsible for}} the defence of Brisbane. At this time he was criticised in Federal Parliament by Arthur Calwell for allegedly issuing a <b>verbal</b> <b>order</b> whilst commander of the 6th Division that no officer was to be commissioned unless they had at least attained an Intermediate Certificate. There was no evidence that such an order was ever issued, but the allegation reflected a suspicion that Herring was an elitist.|$|E
500|$|The Charge {{itself and}} the tragedy that {{resulted}} was blamed on both Lucan and Nolan by William Howard Russell–Nolan, for misunderstanding the order and issuing a confusing message, and Lucan, for not properly {{keeping an eye on}} the terrain. Raglan himself primarily blamed Lucan, who was infuriated by this and wrote a letter to Horse Guards Parade disputing Raglan's claim. This was too much for Viscount Hardinge, the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, who had Lucan resign his command and return to Britain. With Hardinge unwilling to give him a court martial, Lucan wrote a pamphlet titled A Vindication of the Earl of Lucan from Lord Raglan's Reflections and a series of letters to The Times that revealed Raglan's order to have been highly ambiguous and [...] "not the kind of dispatch required by an officer on the battlefield". At the same time, Nolan's method of delivery had been imperious, and he had insisted the urgency of the attack – something clear in Raglan's <b>verbal</b> <b>order</b> to him, but not in the written order. Public opinion became divided; people both attacked Nolan and rallied to his defence. The major newspapers, at least, maintained that with Nolan's status as a mere messenger it was inconceivable that he alone could have destroyed the Light Brigade without failings by Lucan. Lord Cardigan defended Nolan by saying the Captain [...] "did not have the least idea of the mistake which was about to be perpetrated." [...] Within the Crimea, however, the majority [...] "roundly damned" [...] Nolan. The Charge was soon overshadowed by other scandalous and bloody military failures such as the continued failure of the Siege of Sevastopol.|$|E

While serving there he ran foul of Jervis, who had him court-martialled in 1796 {{on a charge of}} disobeying a <b>verbal</b> <b>order.</b> At the trial [...] Jervis's captain of the fleet Robert Calder swore that no order had been given, and the lieutenant who was supposed to have transmitted it swore he had not received one. The charge was therefore dismissed, but this appears to have been the start of a personal enmity of Jervis against Knowles.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Churubusco (20 August 1847) {{took place}} {{about four months}} after the defeat at Cerro Gordo. Gen. Santa Anna gave a <b>verbal</b> <b>order</b> to [...] "preserve the point at all risk". The San Patricio Companies {{initially}} met the attackers outside the walls of the convent at a tête-de-pont, which was about [...] from a fortified convent. A battery of three to five heavy cannons were used from this position to hold off the American advance along with support from Los Independencia Batallón and Los Bravos Batallón. The Americans were under the command of Col. William Hoffman. Several U.S. charges towards the bridgehead were thrown off, with the San Patricio companies serving as an example to the supporting battalions. Unlike the San Patricios, most of whom were veterans (many having served in the armies of the United Kingdom and various German states), the supporting Mexican battalions were simply militia (the term 'National Guard' is also used) who had been untested by battle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{scale of}} the mobilization may have been motivated by concerns of insubordination. [...] Xu Qinxian, {{the commander of the}} 38th Army, the best-equipped army corps of the Beijing Military Region, refused to enforce the martial law order. [...] Xu said he could not comply with a <b>verbal</b> <b>order</b> to mobilize and demanded to see a written order. [...] When told by the Beijing Military Regional command that it [...] "was wartime" [...] and a written order would be provided later, Xu, who had spent time in Beijing earlier in the spring, said there was no war and reiterated his refusal to carry out the order. [...] President Yang Shangkun sent Zhou Yibing, the commander of the regional command to Baoding to persuade Xu. Xu asked Zhou whether the three principals of the Central Military Commission had approved the martial law order. [...] Zhou replied that while Deng Xiaoping, the chairman, and Yang Shangkun, the secretary-general, had approved, Zhao Ziyang, the first vice-chairman, had not. [...] Without Zhao's approval, Xu refused to act on the order and asked for sick leave. [...] He was court-martialled and the 38th Army under his replacement mobilized to enforce the martial law order.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} {{claims that the}} {{infantry}} {{were the first to}} retire and that, due to a communications breakdown, the 53rd (Welsh) Division made a complete and premature retirement. However, that infantry division had not been told of the movement of the 54th (East Anglian) Division and was still in position. It was not until just before 19:00 that Chetwode phoned Dallas, commander of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, to inform him of the withdrawal of the mounted troops, and the need for him to move his right to reestablish contact with the 54th (East Anglian) Division. Dallas {{was under the impression that}} he was to move back to Sheikh Abbas, [...] from his right on Clay Hill, while Chetwode meant that the two divisions would reconnect [...] north of Mansura and not much over [...] from the 161st (Essex) Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division, at Green Hill. Dallas protested, instead asking for reinforcements to close the gap between the two divisions. This request was denied and when he prevaricated, asking for time to consider the order, Chetwode gave him the <b>verbal</b> <b>order,</b> believing the 53rd (Welsh) Division was moving its right back to gain touch with the 54th (East Anglian) Division near Mansura. [...] "Dallas states that he had explained on the telephone the full extent of his withdrawal to General Chetwode; the latter states that he did not understand his subordinate to mean that he was abandoning anything like so much ground. In any case the responsibility rests upon Desert Column Headquarters, since General Dallas had telegraphed to it the line he was taking up." ...|$|E

5000|$|The labels {{seven or}} eight are linked {{together}} in a chain, with the last one attached back to the parabola, but here we see just one are shaped like suitcase labels, and represent the static world of words, e.g., [...] "apple", giving imperfect accounts of dynamic reality. An object called an [...] "apple" [...] left in a jar for months becomes a putrid liquid (because of its underlying, dynamic, sub-microscopic structure), but the label [...] "apple" [...] does not change. The word [...] "steak", at a lower <b>verbal</b> <b>order,</b> may imply [...] "something to eat" [...] at a higher <b>verbal</b> <b>order,</b> but in the sub-microscopic domain, a particular steak may be contaminated with poisons created by harmful bacteria that we could see only on microscopic levels. Thus the differential sets up a hierarchy of order, with the submicroscopic domain of dynamic change coming first, the relatively stable universe conveyed non-verbally by our senses coming next, and then the verbal levels. A label is what we attach to a non-verbal experience {{in order to identify}} this experience in verbal terms; when we identify an [...] "apple", we attribute to this identification various non-verbal experiences.|$|E
