50|$|A <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> (<b>VCF)</b> is a processor, {{a filter}} whose {{operating}} characteristics (primarily cutoff frequency) {{can be controlled}} {{by means of a}} control voltage applied to control inputs. It can be considered to be a frequency-dependent amplifier. Although popularly known for their use in analog music synthesizers, in general, they have other applications in military and industrial electronics.|$|E
5000|$|A four-way {{joystick}} {{was provided}} to control low-frequency oscillation (LFO) modulation as well as pitch bending. Pulling the joystick bender towards you also allowed control over <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> (<b>VCF)</b> as well. Around the back panel are jacks for headphones, stereo line out (to plug into a keyboard amplifier, PA system, mixing board, etc.), pedal inputs for damper, portamento and [...] "program up" [...] are provided. Also available are two sockets for tape recorder interface to facilitate offline patch backup and storage of sounds and other data. Electrical power was supplied via a two-pin IEC C9-type connection cable rather than the rather more ubiquitous C13 type, which can potentially {{be a source of}} frustration if lost.|$|E
5000|$|Early analog synthesizers used {{technology}} from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment. They were generally [...] "modular" [...] synthesizers, {{consisting of a}} number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators. Synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filters</b> (<b>VCFs),</b> and <b>voltage-controlled</b> amplifiers (VCAs). The control voltage varied frequency in VCOs and VCFs, and attenuation (gain) in VCAs. Additionally, they used envelope generators, low-frequency oscillators, and ring modulators.Some synthesizers also had effects devices, such as reverb units, or tools such as sequencers or sound mixers. Because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them, an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system.|$|R
50|$|Most SD synthesizers use {{a single}} DCO (plus a digital noise {{generator}} for certain waveforms) per voice, and offer 32 possible waveforms. The top-of-the-line Casio HT-6000 offered 64 possible waveforms, 4 DCO's per voice, velocity, detuning, ring-modulation, and an expanded SD parameter set. In SD synthesis, an analog <b>voltage-controlled</b> resonant <b>filter</b> (<b>VCF)</b> {{is used to}} shape the DCO's waveform (whereas on Casio CZ Synthesizers the phase distortion engine could only emulate a resonant filter). The SD sound is further shaped by a digitally controlled amplitude (DCA) envelope. Both the VCF and DCA are programmed with traditional 4-stage attack/decay/sustain/release (ADSR) curves the CZ line used sophisticated 8-stage envelopes and also included a pitch envelope. Finally, like on the CZ's, a low-frequency oscillator (LFO) is programmable to modulate the DCO pitch, but unfortunately it cannot modulate the VCF or DCA. Nearly all of the SD synth parameters had 5-bit precision, allowing a stepwise range of 0-31.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> (<b>VCF)</b> and voltage-controlled {{amplifier}} (VCA) each {{have their own}} ADSD envelope generator (or Attack-Decay-Sustain-Decay). Musicians {{who are familiar with}} more modern synthesizers might expect the last letter to be R for [...] "Release" [...] (as in ADSR). However, on the Minimoog, the envelopes are ADSD, as the decay setting also sets the time for what is regularly known as release. In other words, there are three knobs to control 4 sections of the sound (most modern synths have four knobs, one for each section) [...] - [...] a [...] "shortcoming" [...] that doesn't seem to diminish the Minimoog's popularity in any way. There is also a switch above the pitch and modulation wheels to engage the final decay stage as well as a switch for engaging the glide circuit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{synthesizer}} {{voices are}} based on the Curtis Electronics CEM 3394 chip. This allows for one voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) per voice, with on/off toggles for any combination of sawtooth, triangle and variable pulse waveforms. There are coarse (up to 4 octaves) and fine (to just under a semitone) tuning parameters. A [...] "poly mod" [...] parameter allows the audio output of one voice to feed another's <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> (<b>VCF)</b> when they are layered in [...] "double" [...] mode. This results in a sound with 4-voice polyphony with no audio from the second voice's oscillators, processed through two filters in series. The single low-frequency oscillator (LFO) is free-running (i.e. doesn't restart when a key is depressed), with programmable rate (0.25 to 20 Hz according to the manual), and has programmable depth and waveform (triangle or square). This can modulate any combination of filter cutoff frequency, pitch, or oscillator pulse-width. There is a chorus with fixed rate and frequency. Filter cutoff frequency, resonance (to self-oscillation), keyboard tracking (off, half or full) and envelope amount can be programmed, but the envelope cannot be inverted. The two ADSR envelopes modulate the VCA and the 24 dB/octave VCF. The rate for the polyphonic portamento is programmable. [...] "Unison" [...] (monophonic mode) can be programmed for each patch. In this mode, the envelopes are re-triggered only after all keys are released ("legato", with low-note priority), and a delay of four oscillators relative to the other four can be programmed (fixed at 20, 40 or 80 milliseconds). A program can be [...] "linked" [...] to another so that both are called up and assigned correctly in a split or layer. There is also a programmable output level for each patch to help balance loud and soft sounds.|$|E
50|$|Features include four voltage-controlled {{oscillators}} (VCOs) with tuning, footage (16, 8, 4, 2), waveshape (triangle, saw, pulse-width, and pulse-width modulated), and amplitude. The first oscillator is {{the master}} oscillator as far as fine tuning goes. Two direct modifiers to the VCOs are a detune control that only affects oscillators 2 and 4, and a Pulse Width control that goes to cancellation either side of 50% phase symmetry of a square wave; pulse width can be routed to MG1, MG2, or <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> (<b>VCF)</b> envelope. There is one independent noise generator with an amplitude control (frequency and shape is modified by the VCF). There is one 24/db octave exponential low-pass VCF with resonance, scaling and invertible envelope control shared across all four VCOs. One voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) envelope with triggering and dampering controls is shared across all four VCOs. There are two low frequency modulators: MG1 controls VCO Pitch/Pulse-width, 'EFFECTS' and VCF cutoff; MG2 controls the tempo of the arpeggiator, and Pulse-Width. There is one arpeggiator with on/off/latch control, up/down/up-down pitch control, and 1/2/full keyboard control (44 notes). The arpeggiator can cycle through each oscillator in POLY mode, or all four {{at a time in}} MONO. There is an 'EFFECTS' section which includes an amplitude modulator (X-MOD) with hard-sync control, and a frequency modulator with which the frequency of the modulator can be altered by the VCF envelope or MG1. For both modulators there is the option of single modulation of all oscillators, or two carriers, and two modulators (using the VCOs). Controller Interfaces are external inputs/outputs for CV/Trigger, VCF and VCO mod inputs, arpeggiator, portamento, and the pitch/MG1 mod wheels can be assigned to control VCO1 pitch, pitch or the filter. Bender goes to 2.5 octaves +/- for Pitch and full range for VCF cutoff. There are 5 different oscillator assignment modes: 'Hold' drones the oscillators until force dampered or Chord Memory is activated; 'Chord Memory (MONO)' allows 2-4 oscillators (VCOs) to be set to any arrangement across 44 keys (for example, in organ or rave chords); 'Unison (MONO)' stacks all 4 oscillators; and 'Unison/Share', which defaults to Unison with one note played, but divides the oscillators across the notes as 2 or more are played. Poly is without explanation, and oscillators always play in sequenced order from 1-4.|$|E

50|$|Like the {{original}} Minimoog, the Voyager has six sound sources. Five of these (three voltage-controlled oscillators with switchable waveforms, a noise generator, and an external line input) pass to a mixer with independent level controls. The mixed {{output of the}} sources is then passed through the <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> and a <b>voltage-controlled</b> amplifier, {{each of which has}} its own ADSR (Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release) envelope generator. The <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> can itself be made to oscillate, thus comprising the Voyager's sixth sound source.|$|R

In this paper, the filter is analyzed in continuous time and then several transformations of the filter into discrete time are analyzed for various properties such as efficiency, ease of implementation, and the retention of certain of the original filter's good properties, such as constant-Q, and separability of the Q and tuning controls.

This involves linear electronic circuits as well as non-linear ones. The former are, for instance, passive filters, active filters, additive mixers, integrators and delay lines. Non-linear circuits include compandors, multiplicators (frequency mixers and <b>voltage-controlled</b> amplifiers), <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filters,</b> <b>voltage-controlled</b> oscillators and phase-locked loops.|$|R

30|$|The {{method of}} VTE {{prophylaxis}} used in DIONYS was mainly pharmacological {{and the most}} prescribed agent during the whole study was enoxaparin (81.3 Â %). It is universally admitted that the VTE prophylaxis may be pharmaceutical, mechanical or combined.

In the presence of such loops, the discrete-time filter network is solved by iterating over a fixed-point scheme. Simulations running at 176. 4 kHz show reasonable fidelity of the model in the regimes of interest, as well as shorter computation time compared to previous implementations of the same system. While reducing aliasing, such a sampling rate optimizes also the computation time as it requires fewer fixed-point iterations. The new model represents an improved alternative to previously developed <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> designs in the field of virtual analog...|$|R

50|$|The DCW of an {{oscillator}} is {{the magnitude}} of distortion that {{is applied to the}} reading angle of that oscillator's selected waveform. The DCW can be modified over time using an ADSR envelope, thus changing the timbre of the sound over time.
