5|$|Greys Anatomy has {{received}} high viewership and ratings since its debut. The first four seasons {{of the program}} each {{ranked in the top}} ten among all viewers, reaching its peak Nielsen ratings in the second season, attracting an average of 19.44 million viewers per episode, and ranking at fifth place overall. Following the show's time-slot being relocated, overall rankings steadily declined, dropping below the top ten in its fifth season. Grey's Anatomy made its greatest fall from its sixth to seventh season, slipping from seventeenth place to thirty-first. The series is on a steady decline in terms of overall viewership and rankings, yet Grey's Anatomy still holds value in charts when numbers are pulled from the digital <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (DVR). It was the most recorded show between 2007 and 2011, based on cumulative totals, and has been for several years in a row.|$|E
5|$|The first {{handheld}} {{game console}} in the PlayStation series, the PlayStation Portable or PSP, sold {{a total of}} 80 million units worldwide by November 2013. Its successor, the PlayStation Vita, which launched in Japan on December 17, 2011 and in most other major territories in February 2012, had sold over 4 million units by January 2013. PlayStation TV is a microconsole and a non-portable variant of the PlayStation Vita handheld game console. Other hardware released {{as part of the}} PlayStation series includes the PSX, a digital <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> which was integrated with the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, though it was short lived due to its high price and was never released outside Japan, as well as a Sony Bravia television set which has an integrated PlayStation 2. The main series of controllers utilized by the PlayStation series is the DualShock, which is a line of vibration-feedback gamepad having sold 28 million controllers as of June 28, 2008.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 2006, Nielsen Media Research (NMR) {{reported}} {{the results of}} having, for the first time, monitored viewers who use a digital <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> to record shows for later viewing. NMR reported that 30 Rock adds nearly 7.5% to its total audience every week {{as a result of}} viewers who use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its initial airing. A March 2007 report from MAGNA Global, based on NMR data about viewership ranked by among adults 25–54, shows that as of the time of the report 30 Rocks viewers have a median income of $65,000, high enough to place the show tied at 11th in affluence with several other shows. This is during a period where for the season 30 Rock is tied at number 85 in the 18–49 demographic. During its second season, 30 Rock ranked in fourth place, against all primetime programming, for television series which are watched by viewers with income above $100,000. Following Fey's popular impressions of Alaskan governor Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live, the third-season premiere was seen by 8.5million viewers, making it the highest-viewed episode in the series. The premiere earned a 4.1 preliminary adults 18–49 rating, an increase of 21% from the second-season premiere.|$|E

50|$|MVaaS is {{an acronym}} for managed video as a service. It refers to a systems {{architecture}} used by companies that provide or enable video monitoring services, to allow them and their customers to more easily manage large numbers of digital <b>video</b> <b>recorders</b> (DVRs) or network <b>video</b> <b>recorders</b> (NVRs).|$|R
50|$|The term managed video {{refers to}} the fact that in this architecture, the {{customer}}’s video remains on the <b>video</b> <b>recorders</b> at the customer premises and is not stored in the central database. The central database holds all the information that mediates access to this video and is important for maintaining and configuring the <b>video</b> <b>recorders,</b> but does not contain the video itself. This ensures that the customer always has ultimate control of their video, and frees the customer and the video monitoring company from having to continuously consume bandwidth to transfer video from the <b>video</b> <b>recorders</b> to the central database.|$|R

25|$|In January 2006, Smith began {{circulating}} a {{draft of}} the Digital Content Protection Act of 2006. The legislation would grant the Federal Communications Commission the authority to authorize a technology known as the broadcast flag. This technology would enable the producers of television programming to ensure the programs cannot be recorded by viewers in their homes, for instance using a digital <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> or onto recordable DVDs.|$|E

25|$|As <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> {{technology}} improved {{it became}} possible to modify them and use analogue to digital converters (codecs) for digital sound recording.

The digital recording was played back providing a high quality analogue signal to master the lacquer–aluminium cut.|$|E

25|$|DTTV is {{received}} either via a digital set-top box (STB), TV gateway or integrated tuner included with television sets, that decodes the signal received via a standard television antenna. Some set-top-boxes and TV gateways include digital <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (DVR) functionality. However, due to frequency planning issues, an aerial capable of receiving a different channel group (usually a wideband) {{may be required}} if the DTTV multiplexes lie outside the reception capabilities of the originally installed aerial. This is quite common in the UK; see external links.|$|E

More recently, though, Sanyo decided against supporting Sony's format, the Blu-ray Disc, and instead gave its backing to Toshiba's HD DVD.
