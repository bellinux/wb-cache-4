50|$|Appointed Democratic Senator Thomas G. Burch {{retired after}} filling the vacancy {{caused by the}} death of Senator Carter Glass. Absalom Willis Robertson {{defeated}} Republican Robert H. Woods and was elected to <b>finish</b> <b>Glass's</b> term in office.|$|R
5|$|Güell's {{first task}} for Gaudí, that same year, was {{the design of}} the {{furniture}} for the pantheon chapel of the Palacio de Sobrellano in Comillas, which was then being constructed by Joan Martorell, Gaudí's teacher, {{at the request of the}} Marquis of Comillas, Güell's father in law. Gaudí designed a chair, a bench and a prayer stool: the chair was upholstered with <b>velvet,</b> <b>finished</b> with two eagles and the Marquis's coat of arms; the bench stands out with the motif of a dragon, designed by Llorenç Matamala; the prayer stool is decorated with plants.|$|R
50|$|The 1946 United States Senate special {{election}} in Virginia {{was held on}} November 5, 1946. Appointed Democratic Senator Thomas G.

Woods and was elected to <b>finish</b> <b>Glass's</b> term in office.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, {{small pieces}} of {{refractory}} brick can be eroded by the molten glass from the internal walls of the furnace during processing and become embedded in the <b>finished</b> <b>glass.</b> These are also known as [...] "stones", and can also break the glass when the glass is heated, as they create thermal anomalies.|$|R
50|$|Breaker-grozier pliers are pliers used by {{glaziers}} {{to break}} and <b>finish</b> <b>glass</b> {{in a controlled}} manner. They are dual purpose pliers, with a flat jaw that is used for breaking out scores and a curved jaw that is used for grozing flares {{from the edge of}} broken glass. Both jaws are serrated for removing flares and tiny points of glass.|$|R

50|$|Corning Incorporated also {{manufactures}} a high-purity {{fused silica}} employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized {{in the construction}} of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or <b>finished</b> <b>glass</b> of many types.|$|R

50|$|The delia {{was usually}} {{fashioned}} from wool, cotton, or <b>velvet,</b> and <b>finished</b> with fur. The typical delia had short, loose, unsewn sleeves, and was fastened with metal buttons over the breast. The delia was of eastern origin {{and the word}} itself came to Poland in the mid-16th century from Turkey.|$|R
25|$|Two {{types of}} molds, namely single-piece mold and multi-piece mold, are {{frequently}} {{used to produce}} mold-blown vessels. The former allows the <b>finished</b> <b>glass</b> object to be removed in one movement by pulling it upwards from the single-piece mold and is largely employed to produce tableware and utilitarian vessels for storage and transportation. Whereas the latter is made in multi-paneled mold segments that join together, thus permitting {{the development of more}} sophisticated surface modeling, texture and design.|$|R

60|$|The sport at the Kneipe is for two {{students}} to insult each other (in play, of course), and to then challenge {{each other to}} a drinking duel. An umpire is appointed, two huge glasses are filled, and the men sit opposite each other with their hands upon the handles, all eyes fixed upon them. The umpire gives the word to go, and in an instant the beer is gurgling down their throats. The man who bangs his perfectly <b>finished</b> <b>glass</b> upon the table first is victor.|$|R
40|$|Semi <b>finished</b> <b>glass</b> {{pieces are}} moulded in the furnace to {{template}} forms {{not only to}} fit their shape but also to reduce internal stresses. Thermal differences are unwanted {{and have to be}} minimized in the cooling procedure of the glass pieces. Simulations of various types and sizes of shaping forms and complex model cooling were accomplished. The aim of these simulations was to optimise geometric parameters, clamping conditions and material of the form, so that thermal differences at glass are minimized during the cooling...|$|R
5|$|The ancient Egyptians could {{fabricate}} a {{wide variety}} of objects from glass with great skill, {{but it is not clear}} whether they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the <b>finished</b> <b>glass.</b> A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{the change}} in the {{refractive}} index, as a light beam travels from air (refractive index of ~1) into glass or acrylic (refractive index of ~1.5) and then back into air, these transitions cause part of the light to be reflected. While [...] "anti-glare" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "non-glare" [...] or matte <b>finish)</b> <b>glass</b> treatments focus on scattering the light, [...] "anti-reflective" [...] coatings actually reduce the amount of light, which is reflected from each glazing surface, which has the benefit of increasing the amount of light transmitted through the glazing.|$|R

30|$|The {{variations}} in composition between glass groups are subtle, but may suggest {{the possibility of}} more than one glassmaking centre in the eastern Mediterranean during the Hellenistic period: at least one in the Syro-Palestinian Levant, and one at Rhodes (see also [15 : p. 96]). Shortland and Schroeder [55 : pp. 962 – 963] also suggested that several primary production workshops in the eastern Mediterranean could have produced glass from imported Levantine sands. Although this remains unproven, we do know that raw and <b>finished</b> <b>glass</b> were both traded around the region (see also [10 : p. 282]).|$|R
40|$|A {{baseline}} sequence for {{the manufacture}} of solar cell modules was specified. Starting with silicon wafers, the process goes through damage etching, texture etching, junction formation, plasma edge etch, aluminum back surface field formation, and screen printed metallization to produce finished solar cells. The cells were then series connected on a ribbon and bonded into a <b>finished</b> <b>glass</b> tedlar module. A number of steps required additional developmental effort to verify technical and economic feasibility. These steps include texture etching, plasma edge etch, aluminum back surface field formation, array layup and interconnect, and module edge sealing and framing...|$|R
5000|$|The {{additions}} {{project is}} located in the historical part of the compound. While the existing buildings remain for the most part untouched, their facades are clad in reflective red panels wherever the new building borders onto them. Additionally, the existing facade of the Ferrari historical factory is clad in reflective red steel sheets. The principal materials that are used for the exterior of the new buildings are stainless steel with a mirror <b>finish,</b> <b>glass,</b> and painted red steel panels. The glass modules are composed of a reflective glass to approximate the mirrored steel, as well as to control solar penetration.(2) ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>finished</b> <b>glass</b> {{pieces are}} {{illuminated}} by either a neon sign transformer or a switched-mode power supply, usually running at voltages ranging between 2-15 kV and currents between 18 and 30 mA (higher currents available on special order.) [...] These power supplies operate as constant-current sources (a high voltage supply {{with a very}} high internal impedance), since the tube has a negative characteristic electrical impedance. Standard tube tables established {{in the early days}} of neon are still used that specify the gas fill pressures, in either Ne or Hg/Ar, as a function of tube length in feet, tube diameter and transformer voltage.|$|R

50|$|Some later shelf clocks {{featured}} two artistically <b>finished</b> <b>glass</b> tablets {{which were}} beside the circular dial. The whole clock was mounted on lion paws. Willard's shelf clocks were produced until the 1830s. The Willard Brothers revolutionized the clock manufacturing by both labor division and using multiple previously molded parts. However, {{it is commonly}} accepted that historically their clocks were not definitively popular. Instead, Eli Terry popularized the clock ownership among common American people. Nowadays, Simon Willard's clocks are recognized as American masterpieces. As such, they are avidly sought by both antiquarians and museums. A Simon Willard clock in perfect condition can be purchased for anywhere from $50,000 up to $250,000.|$|R
