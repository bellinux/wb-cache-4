5|$|A {{study of}} central bank {{interventions}} on the US dollar and Deutsche mark found only limited {{evidence of any}} substantial effect on deviations from UIRP.

Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar <b>versus</b> <b>the</b> Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta <b>versus</b> <b>the</b> British pound, have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E
