40|$|AIMS [...] To analyse {{the breath}} of {{patients}} with schizophrenia {{for the presence of}} abnormal <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> METHODS [...] A case comparison study was performed in two community hospitals in Staten Island, New York. Twenty five patients with schizophrenia, 26 patients with other psychiatric disorders, and 38 normal controls were studied. Alveolar breath samples were collected from all participants, and <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in the breath were assayed by gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy. Differences in the distribution of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> between the three groups were compared by computerised pattern recognition analysis. RESULTS [...] Forty eight different <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> were observed in the breath samples. Three separate pattern recognition methods indicated an increased differentiation capability between the patients with schizophrenia and the other subjects. Pattern recognition category classification models using 11 of these <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> identified the patients with schizophrenia with a sensitivity of 80. 0 % and a specificity of 61. 9 %. <b>Volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in breath were not significantly affected by drug therapy, age, sex, smoking, diet, or race. CONCLUSIONS [...] Microanalysis of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in breath combined with pattern recognition analysis of data may provide a new approach to the diagnosis and understanding of schizophrenia. The physiological basis of these findings is still speculative...|$|R

40|$|International audienceVegetal species emit {{biogenic}} <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> at elevated temperatures. Because {{of their}} combustibility, biogenic <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> can modify the wildland fires propagation dynamics, changing {{them from a}} moderate behavior to an explosive propagation. This phenomenon is known as an accelerating forest fire. The origin of such phenomena can be the accumulation of biogenic <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in concentrations close to their lower flammability limit in seasons where the plants are themselves very flammable. There {{is a lack of}} information on the biogenic <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> emissions of vegetal species typically found in wildland fires at temperatures higher than ambient temperature. In this work, we used a flash pyrolysis device linked to a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer to investigate experimentally the biogenic <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> emissions of Thymus vulgaris, Lavandula stOEchas, and Cistus albidus between 70 degrees C and 180 degrees C. High amounts of terpenoid compounds were found, except for C. albidus emissions, including thymol, l-fenchone, and 3 -hexen- 1 -ol. The information provided in this work could help to improve the characterization of thermal degradation of vegetal fuels and to incorporate the biogenic <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> combustion in physical forest fires models.

2500|$|On February 18, 2005, Page {{was granted}} the deed on a 9000-sq ft Spanish Colonial Revival {{architecture}} house in Palo Alto, California designed by American artistic polymath Pedro Joseph de Lemos, a former {{curator of the}} Stanford Art Museum {{and founder of the}} Carmel Art Institute, after the historic building had been on the market for years with an asking price of US$7.95 million. A two-story stucco archway spans the driveway and the home features intricate stucco work, as well as stone and tile in California Arts and Crafts movement style built to resemble de Lemos family's castle in Spain. The hacienda was constructed between 1931-41 by de Lemos. It is also on the National Register of Historic Places.In 2009 Page began purchasing properties and tearing down homes adjacent to his home in Palo Alto to make room for a large ecohouse. The existing buildings were [...] "deconstructed" [...] and the materials donated for reuse. The ecohouse was designed to [...] "minimize the impact on the environment." [...] Page worked with an arborist to replace some trees that were in poor health with others that used less water to maintain. Page also applied for Green Point Certification, with points given for use of recycled and low or no-VOC (<b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound)</b> materials and for a roof garden with solar panels. The house's exterior features zinc cladding and plenty of windows, including a wall of sliding-glass doors in the rear. It also includes eco-friendly elements such as permeable paving in the parking court and a pervious path through the trees on the property.

2500|$|On June 18, Baton Rouge {{refinery}} representatives {{told the}} LDEQ that ExxonMobil's chemical team {{determined that the}} June 14 spill was actually a level 2 incident classification which means that a significant response to the leak was required.

Because the spill estimate and the actual amount of chemicals spilled varied drastically, the LDEQ launched an in-depth investigation on June 16 to determine the actual amounts of chemicals spilled as well as to find out what information the refinery knew and when they knew it. [...] On June 20, ExxonMobil sent an official notification to the LDEQ saying that the leak had actually released 28,688 pounds of benzene, 10,882 pounds of toluene, 1,100 pounds of cyclohexane, 1,564 pounds of hexane and 12,605 pounds of additional <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound.</b> After the spill, people living in neighboring communities reported adverse health impacts such as severe headaches and respiratory difficulties.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{removal of}} <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> from {{biological}} treatment processes occurs through several mechanisms. These include biodegradation, adsorption onto solids, and air stripping or volatilization to the atmosphere. Volatilization results in fugitive emissions to the atmosphere, which is largely uncontrolled. Recent regulations {{have called for}} increased evaluation and control of inadvertent <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> emissions from treatment processes. The use oxygen as a parallel volatile compound is extremely useful for prediction of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> removal by air stripping. In this study, the simultaneous biodegradation and air stripping of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> based on steady state mass balance are examined and a general approach to estimating the dominant removal mechanism is developed. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to estimate air stripping {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions. Several <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> were selected for this study. The results showed the values drived from the model correspond with the experimental data for benzene, toluene, methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, and methyl isobutyl ketone...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Boston UniversityVolatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> are a {{topic of}} {{interest}} for researchers {{in a variety of}} fields. These areas include the postmortem interval (PMI), cadaver dogs, postmortem toxicology, search and rescue, human scent as a biometric measure, human scent as an attractant to mosquitoes, and cancer biomarkers. In the research of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> associated with human decomposition, a number of methods and techniques are being used, which leads to inconsistencies in the compounds detected. The difficulty in the procurement of human tissues for research also adds to the inconsistencies and the limitations of current research. The domestic pig is often used as a substitute for human research because it has been determined to be the best model corpse. Due to the many restrictions associated with testing on human cadavers, pigs are often substituted because of their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans. This study analyzed the <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> associated with the decomposition of pig tissue {{as a model for the}} <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> associated with human decomposition. Heated passive headspace concentration with activated carbon as the adsorbent material followed by analysis with GC/MS was tested for its reliability in recovering and detecting <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> of decomposition. The <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> detected were examined for their applicability in determining the postmortem interval and for their use as cadaver dog training aids. The <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> detected were compared to <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> reported in the literature and examined to determine their reliability in using the domestic pig as a research model for humans. The results of this study demonstrated the need for a reliable, consistent method for analyzing <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> associated with decomposition. It also demonstrated the need for procurement of human tissue for further research. The results of this research further demonstrated the variability surrounding the decomposition process and the difficulty in determining the postmortem interval based on the <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> detected. This research corroborated that the compounds detected from decomposition are not unique or specific to human decomposition and exposes a number of areas that require further research and exposes aspects of current research that need to be reexamined...|$|R
