5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and <b>vulcanised</b> rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and <b>vulcanised</b> caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E

25|$|The 19th century saw {{a series}} of {{significant}} changes. Wide deliveries were outlawed in 1811. The circumference of the ball was specified {{for the first time}} in 1838 (its weight had been dictated 60 years earlier). Pads, made of cork, became available {{for the first time in}} 1841, and these were further developed following the invention of <b>vulcanised</b> rubber, which was also used to introduce protective gloves in 1848. In the 1870s, boundaries were introduced – previously, all hits had to be run; if the ball went into the crowd, the spectators would clear a way for the fieldsman to fetch it. The biggest change, however, was in how the ball was delivered by the bowler.|$|E
25|$|Nixon's {{innovations}} {{can be seen}} as {{a response}} to the increase in fast-bowling in Cricket from the 1840s. He experimented with cork batting pads before introducing Malayan malacca and cane rattan open pads in 1853. He also used the strength and flexibility of cane in bat design. His cane-handled bat helped to absorb the shock imparted to the batsman by the fast round-arm bowlers of the day. Nixon also took out on a patent on his 'Balista' bowling machine in 1862. This contraption was designed as an improvement on the 'Catapult' machine in being able to replicate round-arm bowling. The ball was propelled by a <b>vulcanised</b> rubber sling which could be modified to provide variations in the speed and length of delivery. By 1864 the Balista was being demonstrated in Australia where local reporters attested to the ingenuity of the machine.|$|E
500|$|Kim Cattrall plays Valeris, the Enterprises new {{helmsman}} and {{the first}} Vulcan to graduate {{at the top of}} her class at Starfleet Academy. Valeris becomes the protégé of Captain Spock, who intends her to be his replacement. Initially, the character of Saavik, who appeared in the second through fourth Star Trek films, was intended to be the traitor, but Gene Roddenberry objected to making a character loved by fans into a villain. Cattrall was unwilling to be the third actress to play Saavik (a part she had originally auditioned for), but accepted the role when she became a different character. Cattrall chose the Eris element of the character's name, for the Greek goddess of strife, which was <b>Vulcanised</b> by the addition of the [...] "Val" [...] at the behest of director Nicholas Meyer. Cinefantastique reported that during filming, Cattrall participated in a photo shoot on the empty Enterprise bridge, where she wore nothing but her Vulcan ears. The story claimed Nimoy personally ripped up all of the photographs and negatives when he learned about the unauthorized photo session, because he feared harm to the franchise if it ever came to light.|$|E

40|$|Two new {{prototype}} assembly {{methods have}} been evaluated for biosensors that combine an integrated circuit (IC) sensor with a culture chamber. The first method uses a poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) mould to mask the IC sensor during application of a room temperature <b>vulcanising</b> (RTV) silicone elastomer used to insulate the bondpads and bondwires. The second method utilises the 'partial encapsulation' service offered by Quik-Pak, USA. Both methods were shown to provide good electrical insulation and demonstrated biocompatibility with the NG 108 - 15 cell line. These methods are particularly useful for the assembly of low-cost ICs with a small (4 mm 2) sensor area...|$|R
2500|$|Development of space-suits in the 1960s {{led to the}} pressure-tight zipper, first {{manufactured}} by B.F. Goodrich, and first used on a dry suit by Bev Morgan in 1956. The suit was in expanded neoprene and had an oral inflator and latex seals. This {{was followed by the}} Unisuit, by Poseidon Industri AB of Sweden, also in neoprene, and which included a low pressure inflator valve and exhaust valves. The zipper ran from mid-back to mid-chest via the crotch. This design became the industry standard for a while and use was widespread. Overpressure valves were installed in the ankles, wrists and neck of dry suits to remove excessive air introduced [...] through the face mask to prevent discomfort created by squeeze, which also increased the insulation capacity of the undergarments. These were called constant volume dry suits. Also in Sweden, Stig Insulán and Jorn Stubdal developed a <b>vulcanised</b> rubber drysuit, and Insulán patented the semi-automatic variable volume drysuit exhaust valve in 1971 which combined with the low pressure inflator valve gave the diver precise and trouble-free buoyancy control, in the variable volume dry suit.|$|E

60|$|The {{deck of the}} Great Eastern is double, or cellular, {{after the}} plan of the Britannia Tubular Bridge. The upper deck runs flush and clear from stem to stern, and he who takes four turns up and down it from stem to stern walks upwards of a mile. The {{strength}} of this deck is so enormous that if the ship were taken up by its two extremities, with all its cargo, passengers, coals, and provisions on board, it would sustain the whole. The deck has been covered with teak planking, and has been planed and scrubbed to man-of-war whiteness. Not even a stray rope's end breaks the wonderful effect produced by its immense expanse. Her fleet of small boats, which are {{about the size of}} sailing cutters, hang at the davits, ten on each side. There are six masts and five funnels. The three centre square-rigged masts are of iron. They were made by Mr Finch of Chepstow, and are the finest specimens of masts of the kind that were ever manufactured. Each is made of hollow wrought iron in eight-feet lengths, strengthened inside by diaphragms of the same material. Between the joints, as they were bolted together, was placed a pad of <b>vulcanised</b> india-rubber, which gives a spring and buoyancy to the whole spar greater than wood, {{while at the same time}} it retains all the strength of the iron. The other masts are made of wood, and the canvas that can be spread is no less than 6500 square yards. On deck are four small steam winches or engines, each of which works a pair of cranes on both sides of the vessel; and with these five thousand tons of coals can be hoisted into the vessel in twenty-four hours.|$|E

In the current work, MRE samples were prepared using Room temperature <b>vulcanising</b> Silicone as matrix material and 2 different samples of carbonyl iron powder (3. 15 μm and 6. 25 μm diameters) were used as particle ingredients. Microstructure of the sample were studied under Confocal microscope, which showed the smaller diameter powders results in more agglomeration even though the distribution of powders in the matrix were fairly uniform. A test set up was made to conduct dynamic tests to investigate the influence of particle size on the dynamic performance of the prepared MRE samples. Test results in these experiments showed that smaller diameter particle ingredients results in better MR effect...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study in}} which EPDM-based rubber composites were investigated aiming at developing formulations subjected to restrictions on cost and {{the properties of the}} material. The contents of components other than calcium carbonate, paraffinic oil, and CBS <b>vulcanising</b> accelerator, as well as additives and processing conditions, were kept constant. Fractional factorial design coupled with computational numerical optimisation was used to minimise the number of mixtures. The results demonstrate that statistical design of experiments and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithms are promising methods to design composition variables. Mixture costs as low as 1. 92 [*]US$/kg can be achieved in compositions containing, for example, 107 [*]phr of calcium carbonate, 95 [*]phr of paraffinic oil, and 1. 13 [*]phr of CBS accelerator. The corresponding composite property-predicted values were 66. 8 [*]Shore A for hardness, tensile strength of 7. 8 [*]MPa, 570. 8 % elongation at break, and 23. 0 % rebound resilience.

40|$|Corrosion of the pin of {{high voltage}} {{porcelain}} and glass cap-and-pin insulators, which is {{mainly caused by}} leakage currents, can severely compromise the mechanical integrity of the insulator, leading to a shorter service life. This paper investigates the potential for room temperature <b>vulcanising</b> silicone (RTV) coatings on high voltage insulators in Queensland. These silicone coatings are designed to improve the pollution performance of the insulators, reducing the leakage currents seen by the insulator. This in turn, would reduce the problem of pin corrosion. To effectively assess this potential, high voltage testing was performed on coated and uncoated insulators under artificial pollution conditions. It was found that silicone coatings reduced the leakage currents across the insulators, a conclusion that has been confirmed by others in the field. Along with this, a detailed cost analysis was performed, looking into the costs involved with installing and maintaining high voltage insulators in a large transmission network. Alongside this, the costs of silicone coatings were assessed, and from these costings, {{it was found that}} silicone coatings would only need to extend the service life of the insulator by a small margin to be cost effective...|$|R
40|$|Mortality {{trends for}} 1059 {{production}} workers at a rubber chemicals plant in Nitro, West Virginia were examined to find {{whether they had}} increased mortality from cancer associated with exposure to 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT). This chemical and its derivatives are <b>vulcanising</b> agents that have been manufactured at the plant since 1935. Analyses were conducted on MBT exposed employees by cumulative exposure and time since first exposure, and were also stratified by past assignment to p-aminobiphenyl (PAB) related departments; PAB is a potent bladder carcinogen that was used at the plant between 1935 and 1955. There was an excess of bladder cancer in MBT workers who had PAB related assignments (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) = 3200, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1286 - 6593). In employees without a job assignment with exposure to PAB, there were no associations between exposure to MBT and increased rates of most malignant neoplasms. The SMR for bladder cancer was increased based on three deaths (SMR = 455, 95 % CI 94 - 1328), although these results were too few to evaluate trends by cumulative exposure category. The possibility of confounding by PAB for exposures for jobs that covered {{all areas of the}} plant for these three cases must be considered {{in the light of the}} potency of PAB as a bladder carcinogen. There were no deaths from bladder cancer among MBT workers hired after the end of manufacture and use of PAB, but the expected number of deaths was only 0. 03...|$|R
