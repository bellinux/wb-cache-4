5|$|Despite a {{thorough}} search, the revolutionaries discovered only seven prisoners in the Bastille, rather fewer {{than had been}} anticipated. Of these, only one – de Whyte de Malleville, an elderly and white-bearded man – closely resembled the public image of a Bastille prisoner; despite being mentally ill, he was paraded through the streets, where he waved happily to the crowds. Of the remaining six liberated prisoners, four were convicted forgers who quickly <b>vanished</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Paris streets; one was the Count de Solages, who had been imprisoned on the request of his family for sexual misdemeanours; the sixth was a man called Tavernier, who also proved to be mentally ill and, along with Whyte, was in due course reincarcerated in the Charenton asylum.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} the Pindaris was carried out as planned. The Pindaris were attacked, and their homes were {{surrounded}} and destroyed. General Hislop from the Madras Residency attacked the Pindaris {{from the south and}} drove them beyond the Narmada river, where governor general Francis Rawdon-Hastings was waiting with his army. Karim Khan surrendered to the British and was given lands in Gorakhpur. The principal routes from Central India were occupied by British detachments. The Pindari forces were completely broken up, scattered {{in the course of a}} single campaign. They made no stand against the regular troops, and even in small bands they were unable to escape the ring of forces drawn around them. The Pindaris rapidly dispersed over the country. The Pindari chiefs were reduced to the condition of hunted outlaws. The desperate Pindaris expected the Marathas to help them, but none dared to give them even a place of shelter for their families. Karim and Setu had still 23,000 men between them but such a force was no match for the armies that surrounded them. In whatever direction they turned they were met by British forces. Defeat followed defeat. One gang made their escape to the south, leaving all their baggage behind them. Many fled to the jungles and perished. Others sought refuge in the villages, but were killed without mercy by the villagers who had not forgotten the sufferings they had been inflicted upon by the Pindaris. The Pindari chiefs Karim Khan and Wasil Mohammed had been present with their Durras at the battle of Mahidpur. Since by this time the Maratha powers had been reduced significantly, the pursuit of Setu and the other leaders was resumed with vigor. All the leaders had surrendered before the end of February and the Pindari system and power was brought to a close. They were removed to Gorakhptir where they obtained grants of land for their subsistence. Karim Khan became a farmer on the small estate he received beyond the Ganges in Gorakpur. Wasil Mohammed attempted to escape. He was found and committed suicide by taking poison. Setu, a Jat by caste, was hunted by John Malcolm from place to place until he had no followers left. He <b>vanished</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> jungles of Central India in 1819 and was killed by a tiger.|$|E

500|$|The Austrians {{suffered}} 303 killed, 1,690 wounded, and 1,077 captured. The French lost 193 killed, 817 wounded, and 697 captured. Expecting {{to fight}} a major battle the following day, the Austrian generals were {{surprised to find that}} the French evacuated Haag and <b>vanished</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deep woods. Though Lauer counseled caution, the victory elated the inexperienced Archduke John, the aggressive Weyrother, and the army staff. They became convinced that they only faced French rear guards. [...] "This erroneous idea prompted Austrian headquarters to ignore all normal precautions in the haste to come to grips [...]" [...] John ordered a pursuit toward Hohenlinden by the columns of Riesch, Latour, and Kollowrat, while drawing in FML Michael von Kienmayer's 16,000-strong column to form his northern flank. They chased after the French into the Ebersberg forest, but Moreau waited for the Austrian and Bavarian force in the Hohenlinden plain with four divisions and his cavalry reserve and ambushed them as they emerged from the forest. [...] To complete the victory at Hohenlinden, MG Antoine Richepanse's division accomplished a surprise envelopment of the Austrian left flank.|$|E

[...] The prologue {{in the game}} manual states the Dark Angels, a force of Space Marines, had repelled a Genestealer incursion in the Tolevi system many centuries before current events in the game. [...] A Dark Angel hero was leading his men aboard the invading space hulk, Sin of Damnation, when it <b>vanished</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> warp. [...] The first mission in the campaign sends the player's squad to investigate the Tolevi system for a distress call of Dark Angels' origin. [...] A nest of Genestealers is uncovered on the planet Ma'Caellia, and the player's forces are ordered to destroy the aliens' Hive Mind. [...] However, {{there are too many}} Genestealers, and the Marines are forced to withdraw. [...] Without any other options, the Marines destroy the infestation and all other life forms on the planet through exterminatus with virus bombsbiological weapons of mass destruction. [...] As they are doing so, the Sin of Damnation re-enters the system, and the player receives orders to invade the hulk. [...] Aboard the vessel, the player's squads destroy the Genestealers' gene banks and their Patriarch. [...] The end of the campaign tasks the player to control a lone Marine as he goes deep into the hulk to find the source of the distress call.|$|E

Operation Đỗ Xá achieved the following results: a communication network of the Viet Cong command composed of five stations was destroyed, {{one of which was}} used to communicate with North Vietnam, and the other four to link with provincial Viet Cong units; the enemy lost 62 killed, 17 captured, two 0.51 caliber machine guns, one 0.30 caliber machine gun, 69 individual weapons, and a large quantity of mines and grenades, engineer equipment, explosives, medicine, and documents; in addition, 185 structures, 17 tons of food and [...] of crops were destroyed.|$|E

Although Harrison believed it was Heston who rejected the idea of Nova's pregnancy, those scenes were deleted, according to screenwriter Michael Wilson, [...] "at the insistence of a high-echelon Fox executive who found it distasteful. Why? I suppose that, if one defines the mute Nova as merely [...] "humanoid" [...] and not actually human, it would mean that Taylor had committed sodomy." [...] It was also decided that Nova's pregnancy would detract from the film's ending. In any case, all Harrison's scenes with Heston and Hunter in the sequence of Nova's pregnancy were cut.

2500|$|In October 1920, the Greek army {{advanced}} further east into Anatolia, {{with the}} encouragement of Lloyd George, who intended to increase pressure on the Turkish and Ottoman governments to sign the Treaty of Sèvres. This advance began under the Liberal government of Eleftherios Venizelos, but soon after the offensive began, Venizelos fell from power {{and was replaced by}} Dimitrios Gounaris. The strategic objective of these operations was to defeat the Turkish Nationalists and force Mustafa Kemal into peace negotiations. The advancing Greeks, still holding superiority in numbers and modern equipment at this point, had hoped for an early battle in which they were confident of breaking up ill-equipped Turkish forces. Yet they met with little resistance, as the Turks managed to retreat in an orderly fashion and avoid encirclement. Churchill said: [...] "The Greek columns trailed along the country roads passing safely through many ugly defiles, and at their approach the Turks, under strong and sagacious leadership, <b>vanished</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> recesses of Anatolia." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 6, 1992, Christopher McCandless' {{body was}} found inside an {{abandoned}} bus in Alaska (...) [...] One year later, author Jon Krakauer retraced McCandless' steps during the two years between college graduation and his demise in Alaska. McCandless shed his legal name early in his journey, adopting the moniker [...] "Alexander Supertramp", after W.H. Davies. He spent time in Carthage, South Dakota, laboring for months in a grain elevator owned by Wayne Westerberg before hitchhiking to Alaska. Krakauer interprets McCandless' intensely ascetic personality as possibly influenced by the writings of Henry David Thoreau and McCandless' favorite writer, Jack London. He explores the similarities between McCandless' experiences and motivations, and his own as a young man, recounting in detail Krakauer's own attempt to climb Devils Thumb in Alaska. Krakauer also relates the stories of some other young men who <b>vanished</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wilderness, such as Everett Ruess, an artist and wanderer who went missing in the Utah desert during 1934, at age 20. In addition, he describes at some length the grief and puzzlement of McCandless' parents, sister Carine, and friends.|$|E
