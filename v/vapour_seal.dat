40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the realisation of a usable rubidium atomic beam inside a <b>sealed</b> <b>vapour</b> cell. A velocity selective optical pumping scheme was implemented to enable the detection of atoms of a particular velocity class travelling between two separated laser beams. This re{{presents a}} new spectroscopic technique, the usefulness of which has been demonstrated through its applications. In the present work, the vapour cell atomic beam has been used to measure Larmor precession of polarised atoms in a magnetic field and one-dimensional laser cooling...|$|R
40|$|Single {{crystals}} of trans-cinnamic {{acid and}} {{of a range of}} derivatives of this compound containing halogen substituents on the aromatic ring have been reacted with 165 Torr pressure of bromine <b>vapour</b> in a <b>sealed</b> desiccator at 20 degrees C for 1 week. Infrared and Raman microspectroscopic examination of the crystals shows that bromination of the aliphatic double bond, but not of the aromatic ring, has occurred. It is demonstrated also that the reaction is truly gas-solid in nature. A time-dependent study of these reactions shows that they do not follow a smooth diffusion-controlled pathway. Rather the reactions appear to be inhomogeneous and to occur at defects within the crystal. The reaction products are seen to flake {{from the surface of the}} crystal. It is shown, therefore, that these are not single crystal to single crystal transitions, as have been observed previously for the photodimerisation of trans-cinnamic acid and several of its derivatives. It is shown that there are no by-products of the reaction and that finely ground samples react to form the same products as single crystals...|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} been speculated that {{there appears to be}} a partial overlap between mm wave radar and {{terahertz}} radar. Some of the public source information suggests that there are some possibilities for terahertz radar, which lies between mm wave radar and long infra-red in the electromagnetic spectrum. Namely, there is at least some penetration with terahertz radar as it is used for thickness and density measurement and biomedical scanning, and is suggested for detecting weapons under clothing. It can detect specific chemicals, including explosives, in vapour phase by the adsorption spectra. This should be able to detect explosives <b>vapours</b> inside a <b>sealed</b> package, provided there is some air void in the package when sealed. Some prototypes for area security scanning have been tested in the field, but the results as not publicly known. The status may be ‘under development’ rather than operational, but the capabilities appear to be better than given for mm wave radar. Ideally, a fully developed terahertz radar system might have the sensitivity of ultrasonic scanning, positive identification of explosives chemicals, and non-contact scanning as well as reducing the inconvenience to travellers. However, such a development may be far in the future.|$|R
40|$|In Norway, an {{emerging}} method in ensuring {{the air and}} vapour tightness of light weight timber framed walls, positions a sealed wind barrier at the exterior and a <b>sealed</b> <b>vapour</b> barrier to the interior. It {{has been found that}} the exterior layer alone is often sufficient in ensuring an acceptable level of air tightness. In terms of the overall airtightness requirements set on the building, it is thought that the interior vapour barrier could be left unsealed as the wall possesses a certain degree of redundancy. It is then important to assess whether the durability of the envelope is compromised due to moisture ingress from the interior driven by convection and diffusion. This project investigates the effect of convection on moisture accumulation, and mould growth potential, in a light-weight timber frame wall system where the air barrier is situated at the exterior and the unsealed vapour retarder at the interior. A two dimensional numerical HAM (Heat, Air and Moisture) model is used. The model is constructed and verified in COMSOL Multiphysics to evaluate the hygrothermal behaviour of a light-weight timber frame wall system with the previously described attributes. The studied wall is subject to climate conditions representative of the Gothenburg region of Sweden over one year. The light-weight timber wall system assessed is comprised of bitumen impregnated soft fibreboard with a treated exterior surface as the exterior air barrier, mineral wool as the cavity insulation and orientated strand board type 3 (OSB/ 3) as the interior vapour retarder. The unsealed nature of the interior vapour retarder is represented by the introduction of two 1 mm gaps in the layer. As means of comparison a wall assembly possessing a sealed interior OSB layer is simulated separately (no gaps). The mould growth potential of the wall system is assessed and compared utilizing the data output from the numerical model simulations and a material specific mould growth index. The results suggest that the joints of the interior vapour retarder need not be sealed considering the exterior air barrier, wall geometry, material properties and imposed boundary conditions. While the degree of moisture accumulation is comparatively larger behind the exterior air-tight layer of the simulated wall assembly possessing an unsealed interior OSB layer, especially {{at the top of the}} wall section, the influence on mould growth potential is limited. This is because the disparities in moisture accumulation between the two wall assemblies is only apparent during the winter months when low exterior temperatures prevent any kind of mould growth regardless of critical humidity values...|$|R
