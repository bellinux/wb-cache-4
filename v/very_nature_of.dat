5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the scientific method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{music was}} also crucial in {{relation}} to courtships due to the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried {{men and women to}} intermingle. Traditionally, unmarried daughters were kept in a special chamber in the attic called a lamin, off-limit to visitors and suitors. It was only when she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was rare socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E

5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|When {{appealing}} {{for military}} {{aid from the}} American Government {{in the aftermath of}} the Whitman massacre, the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government: The <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy, is such that the ties of political union could not be drawn so closely as to produce that stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government. This union between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of allegiance to their respective governments. Political jealousy and strong party feeling have tended to thwart and render impotent the acts of a government, from its very nature weak and insufficient.|$|E

25|$|ODI {{conclusions}} {{were that}} the IMF's <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> promoting market-oriented approaches attracted unavoidable criticism.

25|$|Also {{called the}} True Black Hand, the sect was secretive and {{claimed to have}} infiltrators in all other factions.

25|$|According {{to their}} {{external}} history, {{four types of}} creoles have been distinguished: plantation creoles, fort creoles, maroon creoles, and creolized pidgins. By the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> a creole language, the phylogenetic classification of a particular creole usually {{is a matter of}} dispute; especially when the pidgin precursor and its parent tongues (which may have been other creoles or pidgins) have disappeared before they could be documented.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the ethnic}} {{minority}} people work their land on sloping terraces since {{the vast majority of}} the land is mountainous. Their staple foods are rice and corn. Rice, by its <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> being a labour-intensive crop, makes the daily fight for survival paramount. The unique climate in Sa Pa has a major influence on the ethnic minorities who live in the area. With sub-tropical summers, temperate winters and 160 days of mist annually, the influence on agricultural yields and health-related issues is significant.|$|E
25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific {{context in which they}} were first enunciated.|$|E
