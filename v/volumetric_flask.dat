50|$|Calibration and toleration {{standards}} for <b>volumetric</b> <b>flasks</b> are {{defined in the}} following standard specifications and practices: ASTM E288, E542, E694, ISO 1042, and GOST 1770-74. According to these specifications, <b>volumetric</b> <b>flasks</b> come in two different classes. The higher standard flasks (Class A, Class 1, USP or equivalent depending on the country) are made with a more accurately placed graduation mark, and have a unique serial number for traceability. Where this is not required, a lower standard (Class B or equivalent) is used for qualitative or educational work.|$|R
30|$|The {{standard}} {{stock solution}} of 1000  μg/mL of chlorthalidone and guaifenesin (internal standard) was prepared by dissolving 10  mg of chlorthalidone and guaifenesin in separate 10  mL <b>volumetric</b> <b>flasks</b> using methanol.|$|R
50|$|At the opening(s) at top of {{the neck}} of some glass flasks such as round-bottom flasks, retorts, or {{sometimes}} <b>volumetric</b> <b>flasks,</b> there are outer (or female) tapered (conical) ground glass joints. Some <b>flasks,</b> especially <b>volumetric</b> <b>flasks,</b> come with a stopper or cap for capping the opening at the {{top of the}} neck. Such stoppers can be made of glass or plastic. Glass stoppers typically have a matching tapered inner (or male) ground glass joint surface, but often only of stopper quality. Flasks which do not come with such stoppers or caps included may be capped with a rubber bung or cork stopper.|$|R

50|$|Beakers {{are often}} graduated, that is, {{marked on the}} side with lines {{indicating}} the volume contained. For instance, a 250 mL beaker might be marked with lines to indicate 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mL of volume. These marks are not intended for obtaining a precise measurement of volume (a graduated cylinder or a <b>volumetric</b> <b>flask</b> {{would be a more}} appropriate instrument for such a task), but rather an estimation. Most beakers are accurate to within ~10%.|$|E

50|$|A typical {{procedure}} involves preparing several solutions {{containing the}} same amount of unknown, but different amounts of standard. For example, five 25 mL <b>volumetric</b> <b>flasks</b> are each filled with 10 mL of the unknown. Then the standard is added in differing amounts, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mL. The flasks are then diluted to the mark and mixed well.|$|R
50|$|Graduated {{cylinders}} {{are often}} {{used to measure the}} volume of a liquid. Graduated cylinders are generally more accurate and precise than laboratory flasks and beakers, but they should not be used to perform volumetric analysis; volumetric glassware, such as a <b>volumetric</b> <b>flask</b> or volumetric pipette, should be used, as it is even more accurate and precise. Graduated cylinders are sometimes used to measure the volume of a solid indirectly by measuring the displacement of a liquid.|$|E
50|$|Volumetric {{pipettes}} or bulb pipette {{allow the}} user to measure a volume of solution extremely precisely (precision of four significant figures). These pipettes have a large bulb with a long narrow portion above with a single graduation mark as it is calibrated for a single volume (like a <b>volumetric</b> <b>flask).</b> Typical volumes are 10, 25, and 50 mL. Volumetric pipettes are commonly used to make laboratory solutions from a base stock as well as prepare solutions for titration.|$|E

The absorbance of each solution was measured at respective λmax (370 and 350  nm, for 2 -APT and 3 -APT, respectively) against corresponding reagent blank. For finding optimum amount of reagent required known aliquot of reagent solution was taken in a set of 25 -mL <b>volumetric</b> <b>flasks,</b> each containing 10  mL of buffer solutions and fixed amount of metal ion.

For mole ratio method 10  mL of buffer solution, constant amount of metal ion and known and varying aliquots of the reagent solutions were added in a series of 25 -mL <b>volumetric</b> <b>flasks.</b> The contents of each flask were made to the mark with distilled water.

The {{composition of}} the complex was ascertained from the plot between the absorbance and the volume of the reagent.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>volumetric</b> <b>flask</b> (measuring flask or {{graduated}} flask) is a {{piece of}} laboratory glassware, a type of laboratory flask, calibrated to contain a precise volume at a particular temperature. Volumetric flasks are used for precise dilutions and preparation of standard solutions. These flasks are usually pear-shaped, with a flat bottom, and made of glass or plastic. The flask's mouth is either furnished with a plastic snap/screw cap or fitted with a joint to accommodate a PTFE or glass stopper. The neck of the volumetric flasks is elongated and narrow with an etched ring graduation marking. The marking indicates the volume of liquid contained when filled up to that point. The marking is typically calibrated [...] "to contain" [...] (marked [...] "TC" [...] or [...] "IN") at 20 °C and indicated correspondingly on a label. The flask's label also indicates the nominal volume, tolerance, precision class, relevant manufacturing standard and the manufacturer’s logo. The volumetric flasks are of various sizes, containing from 1 to 20 000 mL of liquid.|$|E
