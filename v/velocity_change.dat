25|$|To {{study the}} Sun at all latitudes the probe {{needed to change}} its orbital {{inclination}} and leave {{the plane of the}} Solar System – to change the orbital inclination of a spacecraft a large change in heliocentric velocity is needed. However the necessary amount of <b>velocity</b> <b>change</b> to achieve a high inclination orbit of about 80° far exceeded the capabilities of any launch vehicle. Therefore, to reach the desired orbit around the Sun a gravity assist manoeuvre around Jupiter was chosen, but this Jupiter encounter meant that Ulysses could not be powered by solar cells – the probe instead was powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG).|$|E
25|$|MESSENGER made a flyby of Mercury on January 14, 2008 (making {{its closest}} {{approach}} of 200km {{above the surface}} of Mercury at 19:04:39 UTC), followed by a second flyby on October 6, 2008. MESSENGER executed a final flyby on September 29, 2009, further slowing down the spacecraft. Sometime during the closest approach of the last flyby, the spacecraft entered safe mode. Although this {{had no effect on}} the trajectory necessary for later orbit insertion, it resulted in the loss of science data and images that were planned for the outbound leg of the fly-by. The spacecraft had fully recovered by about seven hours later. One last deep space maneuver, DSM-5, was executed on November 24, 2009, at 22:45 UTC to provide the required <b>velocity</b> <b>change</b> for the scheduled Mercury orbit insertion on March 18, 2011, marking the beginning of the orbital mission.|$|E

30|$|We {{examined}} seismic <b>velocity</b> <b>changes</b> at Sakurajima from 2011 to 2014 {{by combining}} coda-wave interferometry {{analysis of the}} repeated active seismic experiments and seismic interferometry analysis of ambient seismic noise. The sources of active seismic experiments are located near the ground surface, which enabled us to directly compare seismic <b>velocity</b> <b>changes</b> from these two techniques. We compare the results obtained from two techniques for all reference years and combinations of two shot years. In all cases, the results from these two techniques are consistent with each other. The values of mean relative <b>velocity</b> <b>changes</b> in coda-wave interferometry are within the variability among station pairs in seismic interferometry between 2012 and 2014 in 2 – 4 and 4 – 8  Hz band. Almost annual <b>change</b> in relative <b>velocity</b> <b>changes</b> is clearly found in both of the estimated seismic <b>velocity</b> <b>changes</b> and geodetic signals from GNSS receivers, which is a clear example that seismic velocity is well correlated with geodetic signals at a volcano.

2500|$|Traveling to Mercury {{requires}} an extremely large <b>velocity</b> <b>change</b> (see delta-v) because Mercury's orbit is {{deep in the}} Sun's gravity well. [...] On a direct course from Earth to Mercury, a spacecraft is constantly accelerated as it falls toward the Sun, and will arrive at Mercury with a velocity too high to achieve orbit without excessive use of fuel. For planets with an atmosphere, such as Venus and Mars, spacecraft can minimize their fuel consumption upon arrival by using friction with the atmosphere to enter orbit (aerocapture), or can briefly fire their rocket engines to enter into orbit followed by a reduction of the orbit by aerobraking. However, the tenuous atmosphere of Mercury is far too thin for these maneuvers. [...] Instead, MESSENGER extensively used gravity assist maneuvers at Earth, Venus, and Mercury to reduce the speed relative to Mercury, then used its large rocket engine to enter into an elliptical orbit around the planet.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the single-station cross-correlation (SC) technique of processing ambient seismic noise and compare its results with the established cross-correlation (CC) and autocorrelation (AC) techniques. While CC is {{the correlation of}} the signals of two seismic stations {{with each other and}} AC is the correlation of a signal with itself, SC is the correlation of two different components of a single three-component seismic sensor. The comparison of the three different correlation techniques shows that CCs give the best results at frequencies below 0. 5 [*]Hz and that SCs give the best results at higher frequencies. In all three processing techniques, ambient seismic noise is correlated in order to reconstruct the Green's function describing the wave propagation between the first and the second sensor. By relating the coda parts of the daily Green's functions with the long-term reference Green's functions, shear wave <b>velocity</b> <b>changes</b> are determined. Here, we apply this technique to the data of 20 seismic stations in the surroundings of the fault zone of the Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake (MW= 6. 9), which occurred on 2008 June 13, UTC (2008 June 14, Japan Standard Time) {{in the northern part of}} the Japanese island Honshu. The data range from 2008 January to 2011 June and therefore include the Tohoku earthquake (MW= 9. 0), which occurred on 2011 March 11, off the coast of northern Honshu. The data are analysed in five different frequency ranges between 0. 125 and 4. 0 [*]Hz. The data show coseismic <b>velocity</b> <b>changes</b> for both earthquakes followed by a post-seismic velocity recovery. In general, the coseismic <b>velocity</b> <b>changes</b> increase with frequency. For the Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake, the strongest <b>velocity</b> <b>changes</b> occur close to the fault zone. Quickly recovering coseismic <b>velocity</b> <b>changes</b> can be separated from changes not recovering during the study period.

For the Tohoku earthquake, the modelling shows that different parts of the study area are affected in different ways, some showing shallow changes, others deeper <b>changes.</b> Furthermore, seasonal <b>velocity</b> variations occur, which are compatible for the different stations above 0. 5 [*]Hz, with velocity maxima in autum...|$|R
