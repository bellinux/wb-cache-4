5|$|Vampire bats are bats whose {{food source}} is blood, a dietary trait called hematophagy. Three bat species feed solely on blood: the common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> (Desmodus rotundus), the hairy-legged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> (Diphylla ecaudata), and the white-winged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> (Diaemus youngi). All three species are {{native to the}} Americas, ranging from Mexico to Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Because the hairy-legged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> {{feeds on}} bird blood {{and it is}} the ancestral <b>vampire</b> <b>bat,</b> it is likely that all vampire bats {{initially}} fed on bird blood.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> lineage diverged {{from its}} family 26 million years ago. The hairy-legged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> likely diverged {{from the other}} two species of vampire bats 21.7 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|Desmodus is a genus of bats often {{referred}} to as the <b>vampire</b> <b>bats.</b> Along with the genera, Diaemus and Diphylla, Desmodus makes up the subfamily Desmodontinae of family Phyllostomidae, the <b>vampire</b> <b>bats.</b>|$|R
40|$|In the rainforest, <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> (Desmodus rotundus) {{have large}} mammals such as tapirs, deer, peccaries, cattle, monkeys, birds, and {{sometimes}} humans, among their victims (Albuja et al., 2012; Tirira, 2007). <b>Vampire</b> <b>bats</b> have been listed as carriers and reservoir host of rabies (Streicker et al., 2012; Corrêa et al., 2014). Here, we report photographic evidence obtained from camera- traps of <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> feeding on lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Vampire</b> <b>bats</b> are in {{a diverse}} family of bats with many food sources, {{including}} nectar, pollen, insects, fruit, fish, and meat. The three species of <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> are the only mammals that have evolved to feed exclusively on blood.Hematophagy is likely uncommon due {{to the number of}} challenges to overcome for success: a large volume of liquid potentially overwhelming the kidneys and bladder, the risk of iron poisoning, and coping with excess protein.There are multiple hypotheses for how <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> evolved.|$|R
5|$|Vampire bats hunt {{only when}} it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and {{fish-eating}} bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> feeds mostly on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> and white-winged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> feed on the blood of birds. Once the common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to predation by {{birds of prey}} such as the peregrine falcon, this small martin has been recorded in the diet of the greater false <b>vampire</b> <b>bat,</b> Megaderma lyra.|$|E
5|$|The {{stomach lining}} rapidly absorbs the blood plasma, which is quickly {{transported to the}} kidneys, {{and on to the}} bladder for excretion. A common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> begins to expel urine within two minutes of feeding.|$|E
500|$|Although many {{cultures}} have stories about them, <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> {{have only recently}} {{become an integral part}} of the traditional <b>vampire</b> lore. <b>Vampire</b> <b>bats</b> were integrated into vampire folklore after they were discovered on the South American mainland in the 16th century. There are no <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> in Europe, but bats and owls have long been associated with the supernatural and omens, mainly because of their nocturnal habits, and in modern English heraldic tradition, a bat means [...] "Awareness of the powers of darkness and chaos".|$|R
5|$|Recent {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> arose from insectivores, which discount the frugivore, carnivore, and nectarivore hypotheses of origin. Within 4 million years of diverging from other Phyllostomids, <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> had evolved all necessary adaptations for blood-feeding, {{making it one}} of the fastest examples of natural selection among mammals.|$|R
5|$|There are {{multiple}} hypotheses for how <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> evolved.|$|R
5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} cull <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> {{populations in}} areas where human-wildlife {{conflict}} is a concern. Vampire bats are captured with mist nets and coated {{with a combination of}} petroleum jelly and warfarin. The bat returns to its roost {{and other members of the}} roost become poisoned as well by ingesting the warfarin after reciprocal grooming. Suspected <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> roosts may also be coated in the warfarin solution, though this kills other bat species and remains in the environment for years. The efficacy of killing vampire bats to reduce rabies transmission is questionable, however; a study in Peru showed that culling programs did not lead to lower transmission rates of rabies to livestock and humans.|$|E
5|$|A typical female <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> weighs 40grams and can consume over 20grams (1 fluid ounce) {{of blood}} in a 20-minute feed. This feeding {{behavior}} is facilitated by its anatomy and physiology for rapid processing and digestion of the blood to enable the animal to take flight soon after the feeding.|$|E
5|$|A <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> has {{front teeth}} that are {{specialized}} for cutting {{and the back}} teeth are much smaller than in other bats. The inferior colliculus, {{the part of the}} bat's brain that processes sound, is well adapted to detecting the regular breathing sounds of sleeping animals that serve as its main food source.|$|E

5|$|Although rare, {{infection}} of humans by rabies from <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> bites has been documented; {{for example in}} 2010 four children in Peru died after being bitten. The highest occurrence of rabies in vampire bats occurs in the large populations found in South America. However, the risk of infection to the human population is less than to livestock exposed to bat bites. Only 0.5% of bats carry rabies, {{and those that do}} may be clumsy, disoriented, and unable to fly.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|Unlike fruit bats, {{the vampire}} bats have short, conical muzzles. It also lacks a nose leaf, instead having naked pads with U-shaped grooves at the tip. The common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat,</b> Desmodus rotundus, also has {{specialized}} thermoreceptors on its nose, which aid the animal in locating {{areas where the}} blood flows close to the skin of its prey. A nucleus {{has been found in}} the brain of vampire bats that has a similar position and similar histology to the infrared receptor of infrared-sensing snakes.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{determined}} that <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> engage in social grooming much more than other types of bats to promote {{the well-being of the}} group. Facing higher levels of parasitic infection, <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> engage in cleaning one another as well as sharing food via regurgitation. This activity prevents ongoing infection while also promoting group success.|$|R

5|$|While {{shedding}} {{much of the}} blood's liquid facilitates flight takeoff, the bat {{still has}} added almost 20–30% of its body weight in blood. To take off from the ground, the bat generates extra lift by crouching and flinging itself into the air. Typically, within two hours of setting out in search of food, the common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> returns to its roost and settles down {{to spend the rest}} of the night digesting its meal.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} diurnal or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active. Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it interferes with their echolocation, {{and they are}} unable to locate their food. A few species such as the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> are agile on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle section}} of the column, forming a type of capital, is a high-relief {{sculpture}} {{of the head of}} a bat executed in the curved lines of the Maya style, with small eyes and eyebrows formed by two small volutes. The leaf-shaped nose is characteristic of the Common <b>Vampire</b> <b>Bat</b> (Desmodus rotundus). The mouth is open, exposing the partly preserved fangs, and a prominent tongue extends downwards. A band of double triangles runs around the sculpture with a carved cord or rope and may symbolise the bat's wings.|$|E

25|$|Common <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> (Desmodus rotundus) have {{specialized}} IR sensors {{in their}} nose-leaf. <b>Vampire</b> <b>bats</b> {{are the only}} mammals that feed exclusively on blood. The IR sense enables Desmodus to localize homeothermic animals such as cattle and horses within a range of about 10 to 15cm. This infrared perception {{may be used in}} detecting regions of maximal blood flow on targeted prey.|$|R
5|$|A few species, {{specifically}} the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged vampire bats, exclusively consume animal blood (hematophagy). The common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> typically feeds on large mammals such as cattle, while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds instead. Vampire bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing. Heat sensors {{in the nose}} help them to detect blood vessels near {{the surface of the}} skin. They pierce the animal's skin with their teeth, biting away a small flap, and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva.|$|E
5|$|The {{three species}} of vampire bats are all endemic to Latin America, {{and there is}} no {{evidence}} to suggest that they had any Old World relatives within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the <b>vampire</b> <b>bat.</b> The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the Oxford English Dictionary records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The vampire bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.|$|E
5|$|In a hierarchy, {{individuals}} are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant {{while the others}} are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals {{where there is a}} top individual and a bottom individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> (Desmodus rotundus), may be more strict.|$|E
