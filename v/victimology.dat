25|$|The term heterophobia is {{confusing}} {{for some people}} for several reasons. On the one hand, some {{look at it as}} just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of <b>victimology</b> in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of <b>victimology</b> and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, {{domestic}} violence {{has been seen}} as a heterosexual family issue and little interest has been directed at violence in same-sex relationships, but {{domestic violence}} can occur in same-sex relationships as well. The Encyclopedia of <b>Victimology</b> and Crime Prevention states, [...] "For several methodological reasons– nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others– {{it is not possible to}} assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between gay male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tagore opposed imperialism and {{supported}} Indian nationalists, and these views were first revealed in Manast, which was mostly composed in his twenties. Evidence produced during the Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial and latter accounts affirm his {{awareness of the}} Ghadarites, and stated that he sought the support of Japanese Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake and former Premier Ōkuma Shigenobu. Yet he lampooned the Swadeshi movement; he rebuked it in The Cult of the Charkha, an acrid 1925 essay. He urged the masses to avoid <b>victimology</b> and instead seek self-help and education, {{and he saw the}} presence of British administration as a [...] "political symptom of our social disease". He maintained that, even for those at the extremes of poverty, [...] "there can be no question of blind revolution"; preferable to it was a [...] "steady and purposeful education".|$|E

In the early 2000s, Ben-David developed and published a new theoretical approach to <b>victimology</b> - Normative <b>Victimology</b> or <b>Victimology</b> of the Victim.|$|E

50|$|The idea of {{creating}} an international journal in <b>victimology</b> was conceived at the Third International Symposium on <b>Victimology,</b> which was held in 1979 in Munster (Germany). Finding a publisher who was interested in bringing out the journal {{was not an easy}} task. Finally, John Freeman found AB Academic Publishing, a small privately owned company, which was owned by Ena Adams. ABA continued to publish the journal until 2011 when it was sold to SAGE. Since its start, the Review has been published in association with the World Society of <b>Victimology,</b> though it is editorially independent from the WSV.|$|E

50|$|Positive {{criminology}} {{and positive}} <b>victimology</b> are conceptual approaches, {{developed by the}} Israeli criminologist Natti Ronel and his research team, that follow principles of positive psychology and apply them into the fields of criminology and <b>victimology,</b> respectively. Positive criminology and <b>victimology</b> both place an emphasis on social inclusion and on unifying and integrating forces at individual, group, social and spiritual levels {{that are associated with}} the limiting of crime and recovery from victimization. In traditional approaches the study of crime, violence and related behaviors emphasizes the negative aspects in people's lives that are associated with deviance, criminality and victimization. A common understanding is that human relationships are affected more by destructive encounters than by constructive or positive ones. Positive criminology and <b>victimology</b> argue that a different approach is viable, based on three dimensions - social integration, emotional healing and spirituality - that constitute positive direction indicators.|$|E

50|$|The International Review of <b>Victimology</b> {{was first}} {{published}} in 1989 under the leadership of John Freeman and Leslie Sebba. The new journal was meant to reflect current developments in the field of <b>victimology,</b> in which leading experts in the field would have an input, not only as contributors, but also in terms of editorial policy and via the peer review process. Unfortunately, at the time of publishing the first issue, it was already clear that John Freeman would have to retire as editor due to health problems. David Miers, originally the Associate Editor, succeeded John Freeman as editor, working with Leslie Sebba, and Joanna Shapland became Associate Editor. As the number of submissions and interest in the field of <b>victimology</b> increased, so it was necessary to increase the numbers of editors. Joanna Shapland became Editor (subsequently Executive Editor) in 2002.|$|E

5000|$|The Journal focuses upon {{traditional}} {{areas of}} victimological research, such as offender typologies, victim-offender Relationship, victimization surveys, victim compensation, {{the victim in}} the criminal justice system, reparation and restitution by offenders and crime prevention for victims. The International Review of <b>Victimology</b> also looks at broader theoretical issues such as definitions of victimization and the philosophy of <b>victimology.</b> This in turn opens the door to the consideration of political and human rights issues, including victims of war crimes, and contribution with a comparative perspective. Occasionally, there are special issues dealing with specific topics. Each issue contains reviews of relevant books.|$|E
