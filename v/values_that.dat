5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, it was always following rather than leading a national agenda. It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to town meetings, but still relied on a network of now forgotten non-militant supporters who organised and campaigned on the ground level. And, although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense of pride and <b>values</b> <b>that</b> contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E

5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist <b>values</b> <b>that</b> rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E

5|$|Colin Renfrew {{has pointed}} out the dangers of {{applying}} modern values of art to past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic <b>values</b> <b>that</b> distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the many}} ethnic sub-groups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, {{practices}} and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, {{there are a number}} of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by <b>values</b> <b>that</b> emphasize fihavanana (solidarity), vintana (destiny), tody (karma), and hasina, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.|$|E
