40|$|Abstract—Today’s {{manufacturing}} companies are facing multiple and dynamic customer-supplier-relationships embedded in nonhierarchical production networks. This complex environment leads to problems with delivery reliability and wasteful turbulences {{throughout the entire}} network. This paper describes an operational model based on a theoretical framework which improves delivery reliability of each individual customer-supplier-relationship within non-hierarchical production networks of the European machinery and equipment industry. By developing a non-centralized coordination mechanism based on determining the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> reliability and derivation of an incentive system for suppliers the number of in time deliveries can be increased and thus the turbulences in the production network smoothened. Comparable to an electronic stock exchange the coordination mechanism will transform the manual and nontransparent process of determining penalties for delivery delays into an automated and transparent market mechanism creating delivery reliability.

Inorganic phosphate handling by the nephron {{was investigated}} using renal micropuncture techniques in fasted rats undergoing sustained saline diuresis and in controls. The early distal {{and the late}} accessible proximal convolutions of the same nephron were micropunctured. Despite the presence of decreased fractional volume reabsorption {{at the end of}} the proximal tubule during saline diuresis, the tubular fluid to plasma phosphate ratio was unaffected. Fractional phosphate delivery at this site was not significantly higher. Fractional phosphate delivery at the early distal and late proximal segments of the same nephron were significantly correlated in both groups. The slopes of the regression lines were not different. The delivery of phosphate to the early distal tubule, for a given <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> from the late proximal, was lower during saline diuresis. Mean fractional phosphate reabsorption between the late proximal and the early distal tubules was twice as high during saline diuresis as in controls. This observation may account for the decreased fractional phosphate excretion in ureteral urine observed in fasting animals. Clearance studies indicated a different behavior between fed and fasted rats undergoing saline diuresis. Fractional phosphate excretion increased in the former and decreased in the latter...|$|E

40|$|A general {{approach}} {{is presented to}} value the stocks and flows of water {{as well as the}} physical structure of the basin on the basis of an arbitrary process-based hydrological model. This approach adapts concepts from the economic theory of capital accumulation, which are based on Lagrange multipliers that reflect market prices in the absence of markets. This permits to derive a financial account complementing the water balance in which the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> by the hydrological system fully balances with the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> resources, including physical characteristics reflected {{in the shape of the}} functions in the model. The approach naturally suggests the use of numerical optimization software to compute the multipliers, without the need to impose an immensely large number of small perturbations on the simulation model, or to calculate all derivatives analytically. A novel procedure is proposed to circumvent numerical problems in computation and it is implemented in a numerical application using AQUA, an existing model of the Upper-Zambezi River. It appears, not unexpectedly, that most end value accrues to agriculture. Irrigated agriculture receives a remarkably large share, and is by far the most rewarding activity. Furthermore, according to the model, the economic value would be higher if temperature was lower, pointing to the detrimental effect of climate change. We also find that a significant economic value is stored in the groundwater stock because of its critical role in the dry season. As groundwater comes out as the main capital of the basin, its mining could be harmful. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

However, the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> particular aspects of experiences <b>of</b> healthcare <b>delivery</b> – relative {{to each other and}} to other healthcare outcomes – is unclear. This paper considers how economic techniques have been and might be used to generate quantitative estimates <b>of</b> the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> particular experiences <b>of</b> healthcare <b>delivery.</b> A recently published conceptual map of patients' experiences served to guide the scope and focus of the enquiry. The map represented both what health services and staff are like and do and what individual patients can feel like, be and do (while they are using services and subsequently). We conducted a systematic search for applications of economic techniques to healthcare delivery. We found that these techniques have been quite widely used to estimate the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> features of healthcare systems and processes (e. g. <b>of</b> care <b>delivery</b> by a nurse rather than a doctor, or of a consultation of 10  minutes rather than 15  minutes), but much less to estimate the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the implications of these features for patients personally. To inform future research relating to the valuation of experiences <b>of</b> healthcare <b>delivery,</b> we organised a workshop for key stakeholders. Participants undertook and discussed ‘exercises’ that explored the use of different economic techniques to <b>value</b> descriptions <b>of</b> healthcare <b>delivery</b> that linked processes to what patients felt like and were able to be and do.

40|$|The T-Bond futures {{contract}} has {{traded on the}} Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) for approximately 20 years, {{and is now the}} most actively traded derivative product in the world. A voluminous amount of research has accordingly attempted to analyse the contract, and many have tried to establish a theoretical price which fully reflects all of the contract specifications. One factor that complicates this process is the series <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> options which are embedded in the T-bond {{futures contract}}, and which give the short position some flexibility in their choice of the particular bond to be delivered as well as when delivery should be made. While the valuation of both the futures (and futures options) should obviously consider the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> these implicit <b>delivery</b> options, there is no existing methodology with which to estimate the values on an aggregate, and consistent basis. All of the previous methods for valuing the delivery options can be conveniently separated into two main groups, each having some distinct advantages and disadvantages. The first uses historical price data to simply measure the payoffs that would have accrued to an investor who follows a trading strategy that optimally utilises the delivery options available to a short futures position. Such an approach can usefully quantify the ex-post <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the options at expiration, and has the advantage that it does not require use of a particular option valuation formula. It is difficult however to generalise these results and does not provide any way to value the options prior to expiration on an ex-ante basis. That is the aim of the second approach, which specifies and applies a pricing model in an attempt to measure the amount by which futures prices should be bid down in equilibrium to reflect the options’ <b>value.</b> The success <b>of</b> the second approach obviously depends on the suitability of the specified valuation formula. It is clear that the current <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>delivery</b> options is some function of the possible future changes to the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the T-bonds that underlie the futures contract. These values are themselves dependant on innovations in the term structure of interest rates between the valuation date and the last day of trading in the futures contract. Accurate estimates <b>of</b> the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the embedded options are therefore clearly reliant on the adequacy of the term structure model used in the analysis...|$|R

40|$|Unlike {{agricultural}} and urban demands, environmental demands in the CALVIN model are not represented in terms <b>of</b> the economic <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Instead, environmental demands are represented as monthly minimum instream flow requirements on river and Delta reaches and minimum water supply requirements for refuge areas. These requirements vary by {{month and year}} and are intended to represent the minimum acceptable amount of water for environmental uses at their current (pre-CVPIA) levels. This chapter explains CALVIN's approach and assumptions in modeling minimum instream flow requirements, refuge demands, and the associated limitations. MINIMUM INSTREAM FLOW REQUIREMENTS Although minimum instream flow requirements are used throughout the state, CALVIN's aggregated modeling approach limits these flow constraints to those directly applicable to a canal or river reach included on the CALVIN schematic. Many minimum instream flow requirements vary monthly and by year type. Year types (wet, above normal, normal, below normal, dry, and/or critical) are classified by some type of index. A monthly pattern of flow requirements then corresponds with each year type, and a times series of minimum flows can be constructed from year types for the 1922 - 1993 hydrologic sequence modeled in CALVIN. Other more complex requirements depend on concurrent storage, flow, water quality, or other conditions. These latter relationships cannot be to represented dynamically in CALVIN’s network flow programming formulation. Instead, a pre-determined time series of minimum flows from a simulation of concurrent conditions is used in CALVIN. Because CALVIN is calibrated to match DWRSIM run 514 surface storage and flow conditions, DWRSIM run 514 time series are generally used for these more complex minimum flow requirements. Table F- 1 summarizes the links in CALVIN with the minimum instream flow requirements and indicates the data source and basis of each requirement...|$|R
