5|$|<b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg and {{his colleagues}} {{designed}} the EG Vapor Crystal Growth System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided {{that it would be}} easier to train a crystal growth scientist to become an astronaut, than it would be the other way around. NASA asked EG and <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg to compile a list of eight people who would qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a Payload Specialist. <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg to the list, joking with <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.|$|E
5|$|After he had {{completed}} his doctoral study, {{he was offered}} a job at EG Corporation Energy Measurements in Goleta, California, to work on crystal growth. EG was a defense contractor of the United States government and dealt with sensitive information and science. In 1975, this required <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg gathered years of research and management experience {{in the preparation of}} crystalline materials—in particular, the growth of single crystals of chemical compounds, and the investigation of associated defect chemistry and electronic properties. He became an international authority on vapor growth techniques with an emphasis on mercuric iodide crystals and its application in the nuclear industry as gamma ray detectors. During his work at EG, <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg asked NASA for permission to conduct crystal growth experiments in space, which NASA approved.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the mission, <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg had {{traveled}} over 2.9 million miles in 110 Earth orbits, and logged over 168 hours in space.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Tottenham's Pat <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Hauwe was cautioned by Holbrook for getting tangled with Arsenal's David Rocastle, in spite Rocastle {{indicating}} that the player used an elbow– a bookable offence. Moments after, Rocastle was shown a yellow card for attempting to get his own back on <b>Van</b> <b>Den</b> Hauwe, by tackling the player without intent. <b>Van</b> <b>Den</b> Hauwe was later booked for a wild challenge on Lee Dixon. Arsenal dominated possession during the second half, with Tottenham infrequently troubling their opponent's defence and relying on counterattacks to fashion goal-scoring chances. Smith had a chance saved in the 75th minute by goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, when the ball was back-passed across the penalty area by Steve Sedgley. In the final seconds of the match substitute Andrew Cole, who had replaced Campbell, shot from 20 yards and into the side-netting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg {{was born}} on March 24, 1932, in Sluiskil, Netherlands. <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg was educated in the Netherlands where he {{attended}} the Delft University of Technology from 1949 to 1961 and earned his Engineer's degree in chemical engineering. He then moved to the United States to continue studying at the University of Delaware, where he obtained a MSc degree in applied science, followed by a PhD degree in 1974, also in applied science.|$|E

5|$|Rossier {{first arrived}} in Japan in 1859, {{at a time when}} early {{experiments}} in photography were being conducted in Kyūshū, particularly in Nagasaki. The city was the centre of rangaku, the study of Western science, and it was here that physicians Jan Karel <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Broek and J.L.C. Pompe van Meerdervoort were instrumental in teaching their Japanese students not only medicine but also chemistry and photography. Neither <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Broek nor Pompe van Meerdervoort was an experienced photographer, and their attempts to produce photographs were largely failures. Nevertheless, in turn they taught wet-collodion process photography to Keisai Yoshio, Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano Teizō, Maeda Genzō, Ueno Hikoma, and Horie Kuwajirō, among others.|$|E
5|$|When Thorpe {{broke the}} 200m {{freestyle}} Olympic {{record in the}} heats the following morning, his main rival Pieter <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Hoogenband of the Netherlands (with World No. 2 ranked and teammate Michael Kim bypassing the 200 metres) conceded defeat. However, <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Hoogenband showed {{his hand in the}} semi-finals by cutting more than a second off his personal best, to set a new world record of 1min 45.35s. Thorpe qualified second with a personal best of his own, 0.02s slower, and was under immense pressure to win the final the following day after his double gold on the first night. <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Hoogenband started quickly and Thorpe chased him, reaching the 100m mark just 0.04s behind. Both swimmers turned at 150m in identical times. As a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe faded as <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Hoogenband drew away to claim gold and equal his world record, stunning the home crowd. Thorpe touched in 1min 45.83s, {{the first time that he}} had swum slower in the final than in the qualifying rounds. Thorpe though would never again lose to <b>Van</b> <b>Den</b> Hoogenband in a long course 200 metres race again. Thorpe returned to victory when he led off the 4×200m freestyle relay the following night, setting up a 10m lead over American Scott Goldblatt in the first leg. Although Thorpe was unable to reclaim the individual world record, he, Klim, Kirby and Todd Pearson lowered their world record to 7min 07.05s, over five seconds ahead of the Americans—the largest winning margin in an Olympic relay for half a century. Thorpe rounded off his Olympics by swimming in the heats of the 4×100m medley relay, and collected a silver medal when the finals quartet finished behind the Americans. Thorpe's performances as Australia's leading medalist for the Games were recognised when the Australian Olympic Committee granted him the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony. With three gold and two silver medals, Thorpe was the most successful athlete at the 2000 Olympic Games. At year's end, he was again named by Swimming Australia as the Swimmer of the Year, but <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Hoogenband usurped him as the leading male swimmer chosen by Swimming World Magazine.|$|E
5|$|As a {{co-investigator}} of the Vapor Crystal Growth System (VCGS) experiment, <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg {{was responsible}} for the crystal growth aspects of the VCGS experiment. He had intimate knowledge of VCGS and Fluid Experiment System (FES) hardware, and had participated in all major design and science reviews of those systems.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch officers' {{report was}} not mistaken: {{early in the}} morning, two Spanish scouts had found the track of the Dutch force {{crossing}} the river, and Mondragón, anticipating them, had deployed his cavalry beyond a beechwood, the countryside southwards the Lippe being covered by small woods alternating with moorlands. Besides the troops guarding the convoy, Juan de Córdoba had the command of at least seven cavalry companies: those of Hendrik <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Bergh, Girolamo Caraffa, Carlo Maria Caracciolo, Paulo Emilio Martinengo, his own company, 's-Hertogenbosch lances under Adolf <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Bergh and Sancho de Leyva's company. Other authors also list Alonso Mendo's company. Mondragón had informed the guard of the convoy of the Dutch intentions and encouraged the soldiers to hold their ground, promising them that he was behind them with the whole Spanish army to come in relief.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands {{have won}} seven awards, {{through the efforts}} of Inge de Bruijn (3) and Pieter <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Hoogenband (4), who led the sprinting world for women and men {{at the turn of the}} century. Russian or Soviet {{swimmers}} have won seven awards, all of them male.|$|E
5|$|Commanding 75 lances from Kinsky's company, and {{followed}} by {{the bulk of his}} force, Nassau passed through a narrow path in a small forest, and, coming out to open field, was surprised by the Spanish troops, namely by those under Hendrik <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Bergh, followed by Carlo Maria Caracciolo and the 's-Hertogenbosch lances. <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Bergh's harquebusiers, discovering the Dutch column emerging from the forest, fired a volley and, turning right, clashed with the Dutch scouts, starting the action. There was then a firece fight. The Dutch troops were formed into eight squadrons, but caught by surprise in a narrow passage, the Dutch soldiers were unable to use their lances, so they were forced to defend themselves with swords and pistols. Philip of Nassau, his brothers and their cousin Ernst von Solms were seriously wounded and dismounted at the beginning the fight. Kinsky's and Balen's troops, coming in relief, were unable to rescue the wounded commanders, and some Dutch soldiers started to flee from the battlefield. Nicholas Parker, however, managed to collect the fugitives and, renewing the action, he put disorder into the Spanish cavalry. The encounter turned then a general action out the wood, in open ground.|$|E

5|$|With the 2001 Australian Championships held in Hobart in March, Thorpe {{added the}} 800m {{freestyle}} to his repertoire, after FINA had added the {{event for the}} 2001 World Aquatics Championships. Thorpe began his campaign by successfully defending his 400m title with a time just 0.17s outside his world record. The following night in the 800m event, he drew away from Hackett in the last 100m to break Kieren Perkins' 1994 world record by over four seconds. He earned his third title by cutting 0.66s from <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Hoogenband's 200m world record to set a new mark of 1min 44.69s. This performance made him the third male after John Konrads and Tim Shaw to hold world records over three distances simultaneously. His subsequent victory in the 100m freestyle in a new personal best of 49.05s made him the first since Konrads in 1959 to hold all Australian freestyle titles from 100m to 800m. This indicated that he could swim faster at the subsequent World Championships in Fukuoka, where he was looking to regain the ascendancy from <b>van</b> <b>den</b> Hoogenband.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, <b>Van</b> <b>den</b> Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the International Atomic Energy Agency.|$|E
