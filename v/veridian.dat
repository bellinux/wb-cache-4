5|$|Better Off Ted {{revolves}} around the employees of a stereotypically evil company. The company, <b>Veridian</b> Dynamics, experiments on its employees, twists the truth, and will stop at nothing to achieve its goals. It has been mentioned that <b>Veridian</b> has swayed presidential elections, created killer pandas and robots, and weaponized pumpkins, {{and that there are}} only three governments left in the world which are more powerful than <b>Veridian.</b> Although not promoted as such, and rarely the focus of storylines, the show's frequent references to futuristic technologies, killer robots, sentient computers, etc., places Better Off Ted at least partially in the science fiction genre.|$|E
5|$|Jay Harrington, {{who plays}} Ted Crisp on the show, serves {{both as a}} main {{character}} and as an on-camera narrator. Throughout the show, he breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to viewers, offering inside information and observations while the action continues around him. Another plot element {{involves the use of}} mock commercials for <b>Veridian</b> Dynamics, thematically related to individual episodes and placed at the end or beginning of actual commercial breaks in all but a couple of episodes.|$|E
5|$|Portia de Rossi as Veronica Palmer: Veronica is Ted's {{boss and}} {{immediate}} supervisor at <b>Veridian</b> Dynamics. She maintains a fierce and unapproachable workplace demeanor, and many employees {{have a deep}} fear of her. She seems cold and calculating, {{but it is also}} clear that she has more than grudging respect for Ted, and often recognizes what moral action is necessary to maintain balance in the workplace. An ongoing subplot touched on sporadically in the first season but more frequently in the second sees Veronica becoming a mentor to Linda and, to a lesser degree, Rose.|$|E
5|$|Written by Nabil Shaban (better {{known as}} Sil from the Colin Baker Doctor Who stories Vengeance on Varos and The Trial of a Time Lord) {{who was a}} {{longtime}} fan of Doctor Who and had previously suggested himself to replace the late Roger Delgado as the Master. In offering this script to the production office in 1980, Shaban also put himself forward as a potential successor to Tom Baker as the Doctor. Nothing came of Invasion of the <b>Veridians.</b> Nabil Shaban had only written the first episode, it was written around the early 1970s, and was very much influenced by the Troughton/Pertwee era. Nabil believes that the only copy has now been lost in time, as he no longer has it.|$|R
5|$|Victor Fresco, the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop a show about the disconnection between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach their kids to be moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to Fresco, Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. Fresco stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base <b>Veridian</b> Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name {{was based on the}} idea that a person is better off if they are Ted, that essentially the average person wants to be Ted. Fresco has stated that he wasn't a fan of the show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{entering}} the <b>Veridian</b> system, Enterprise makes {{contact with the}} Duras Bird of Prey. Picard offers himself to the sisters in exchange for La Forge, but insists that he be transported to Soran's location first. La Forge is returned to Enterprise, but he inadvertently reveals Enterprises shield frequency, allowing the Duras sisters to inflict crippling damage on Enterprise. Enterprise destroys the Bird of Prey, but has sustained irreversible damage to its warp core. Commander William Riker orders an evacuation to the forward saucer section of the ship which separates from the star drive. The shock wave from the star drive's destruction sends the saucer crashing {{to the surface of}} <b>Veridian</b> III.|$|E
25|$|McCarthy {{expanded}} his brassy style for the film's action sequences, {{such as the}} battle over <b>Veridian</b> III and the crash-landing of the Enterprise. For Picard's trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard's discovery of his family. The film's only distinct theme, a broad fanfare, first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. The theme blends McCarthy's theme for Picard from The Next Generations first season, notes from the theme for , and Alexander Courage's Star Trek theme.|$|E
25|$|Worf avoided romantic {{attachments}} with non-Klingons {{during his}} first few years on board the Enterprise-D. As Worf explained to both Commander Riker and Guinan, he felt that non-Klingon females would be too fragile, {{and that he would}} have to restrain himself too much. He eventually developed strong feelings for Counselor Deanna Troi, and explored a relationship with her for a time, which at times strained his relationship with her former romantic interest, Commander Riker. Worf and Troi ended their relationship following the destruction of the Enterprise-D at <b>Veridian</b> III and Worf's reassignment to Deep Space Nine.|$|E
25|$|Leaving the Nexus, the two {{arrive on}} <b>Veridian</b> III minutes before Soran {{launches}} the missile. Kirk distracts Soran {{long enough for}} Picard to lock the missile in place, causing it to explode on the launchpad and kill Soran. Kirk is fatally injured by a fall during the encounter; as he dies, Picard assures him {{that he made a}} difference. Picard buries Kirk on a hillside before a shuttle arrives to transport him to the wreckage of the Enterprise saucer. Three Federation starships enter orbit to retrieve Enterprises survivors, but the ship itself cannot be salvaged. As Riker laments that he will never sit in the Captain's chair of the ship, Picard muses that given the name's legacy, this won't be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.|$|E
25|$|The climactic {{battle between}} Enterprise and the Klingons over <b>Veridian</b> III was all {{accomplished}} using traditional motion control, {{but without the}} budget for practical explosions and special breakaway models, the impacts and battle damage were simulated with practical compositing tricks and computer-generated effects, while the final destruction of the Bird of Prey was a straight reuse of footage from The Undiscovered Country. The weapons fire and energy bolts were hand-animated, but Knoll had a different idea for the photon torpedoes. A fan of the impressive, arcing look of the torpedoes from The Motion Picture, Knoll scanned in footage from the film and turned to computer-generated effects. A simulator program created a similar look that could be animated from any point the effects artists wanted, without the expense and tedium required to replicate the original effect, produced by shining lasers through a crystal in a smoky environment.|$|E
500|$|Jay Harrington as Theodore Margaret [...] "Ted" [...] Crisp: Ted is the titular character, {{and also}} the show's narrator. He is the senior {{vice-president}} of the Research and Development department at <b>Veridian</b> Dynamics, and is well respected and loved {{by most of the}} employees – and even members of the otherwise difficult upper management. He balances his desire to maintain his position at the company with his feeling that he must demonstrate a moral center to his daughter. He has had sexual relations with his immediate supervisor, although she remains emotionally distant. He also has interest in Linda, who was a new hire to <b>Veridian</b> Dynamics at the launch of the series.|$|E
500|$|Better Off Ted {{focuses on}} the protagonist, Ted Crisp (Jay Harrington), a single father and the well-respected and beloved head of a {{research}} and development department at the fictional, soulless conglomerate of <b>Veridian</b> Dynamics. Ted narrates the series' events by regularly breaking the fourth wall and directly addressing the audience as the show's on-camera narrator. [...] Supporting characters include Ted's supervisor Veronica Palmer (Portia de Rossi), co-worker and love interest Linda Zwordling (Andrea Anders), his daughter Rose (Isabella Acres), and laboratory scientists Phillip Myman (Jonathan Slavin) and Lem Hewitt (Malcolm Barrett).|$|E
500|$|Isabella Acres as Rose Crisp: Rose is Ted's preteen daughter. She {{attends the}} <b>Veridian</b> Dynamics daycare program when her nanny is not available, but prefers {{to stay at}} home. According to Ted, [...] "her mom ran off to Africa to go save the world." [...] She is often the voice of reason on the show. When Ted talks with her about work she points out the terrible choices the company makes, and often helps Ted focus on {{what needs to be}} done to set things straight. She attends Eugene Debs Elementary School.|$|E
2500|$|The {{events of}} Star Trek Generations. The USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) is destroyed– the stardrive section by a warp core breach; the saucer section {{containing}} the crew makes a forced landing on <b>Veridian</b> III. The ship is subsequently declared a total loss. [...] James T. Kirk reappears from the temporal continuum {{in which he}} had been since his disappearance in 2293; Kirk is killed on <b>Veridian</b> III (Kirk is resurrected a month later in a subsequent story).|$|E
2500|$|The film's climax on <b>Veridian</b> III {{was filmed}} over eight days on an {{elevated}} plateau in the [...] "Valley of Fire", north of Las Vegas, Nevada. The rise's height and sloped sides required {{cast and crew}} to climb 160 vertical feet using safety ropes and carry all provisions and equipment with them. The 110-degree heat was difficult for all involved, especially Shatner, as his character wore an all-wool uniform. Safety harnesses and wires were used to keep performers safe from tumbling off a precipice, and were then removed digitally.|$|E
2500|$|Guinan, Enterprises bartender, tells Captain Jean-Luc Picard {{more about}} Soran; {{they were among}} the El-Aurians rescued by the Enterprise-B in 2293. Guinan {{explains}} that Soran is obsessed with reentering the [...] "Nexus", an extra-dimensional realm where time has no meaning and anyone can experience whatever they desire. Picard and Data determine that Soran, unable to fly a ship into the ribbon due to the uncertainty that the ship will survive long enough to ensure his success, is instead altering the path of the ribbon by destroying stars, and that he will attempt to re-enter the Nexus on <b>Veridian</b> III by destroying its sun—and, by extension, a heavily populated planet in the system.|$|E
2500|$|In Star Trek Generations, Captain Picard finds Kirk {{living in}} the {{timeless}} Nexus, {{despite the fact that}} history recorded his death during the Enterprise-B's maiden voyage, Kirk having fallen into the Nexus in the incident that caused his [...] "death". [...] Picard convinces Kirk to return to Picard's present to help stop the villain Soran from destroying <b>Veridian</b> III's sun. Although Kirk initially refuses the offer, he agrees after realizing the Nexus cannot give him the one thing he has always sought: the ability to make a difference. The two leave the Nexus and stop Soran. However, Kirk is mortally wounded; as he dies, Picard assures him that he helped to [...] "make a difference". Picard buries Kirk on the planet.|$|E
2500|$|Picard {{fails to}} talk Soran {{out of his}} plan and {{is too late to}} stop him from {{launching}} his missile. The collapse of the <b>Veridian</b> star alters the course of the Nexus ribbon as predicted, and it sweeps Picard and Soran away while the shock wave from the star obliterates everything in the system. In the Nexus, Picard finds himself surrounded by the family he never had, including a wife and children, but realizes it is an illusion. He is confronted by an [...] "echo" [...] of Guinan. After being told that he may leave whenever he chooses and go wherever and whenever he wishes, Guinan sends him to meet Kirk, also safe in the Nexus. Though Kirk is at first reluctant to leave, Picard convinces Kirk to return to Picard's present and stop Soran by assuring him that it will fulfill his desire to make a difference.|$|E
2500|$|The {{previous}} Star Trek films {{had used}} conventional motion control techniques to record multiple passes of the starship models and miniatures. For Generations, the effects artists began using computer-generated imagery and models for certain shots. No physical shooting models were ever {{built for the}} refugee ships, although George recalled that he {{found it easier to}} create a quick physical miniature for CG modeler Rob Coleman to iterate from, rather than try to articulate his feedback without it. Other CGI elements included the solar collapses, and the <b>Veridian</b> III planet. Knoll also used a digital version of the Enterprise-D for the warp effect; the limitations of the motion-control programming and slitscan effect for the original meant that the effect [...] "barely holds up", Knoll said, whereas the CG recreation could keep consistent lighting throughout. While digital techniques were used for many sequences and ships, a few new models were physically built, including the observatory, built by model shop foreman John Goodson.|$|E
