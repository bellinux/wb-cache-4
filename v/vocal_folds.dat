5|$|As in {{all other}} tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds, and a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and {{surrounding}} musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate. The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using <b>vocal</b> <b>folds,</b> {{as opposed to the}} vocal cords seen in birds and reptiles. The movement or tenseness of the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both oral and nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such as a dog whine, are generally soft sounds, and oral sounds, such as a dog bark, are generally loud.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds,</b> which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E
5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Henry Dion {{appears to be}} a composite of several real life serial killers. His fondness for conversing with his victims' bodies and the gregarious demeanour shown during this seems to be based on Milwaukee-based murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who would also, like Dion, document his victims photographically. The habit of photographing victims, and the notion of killing women to use them as props, stems from killer Henri Nadeau, who murdered several women in order to use them as mannequins for his photography. The use of an overbearing matriarchal figure as a stressor harkens to Edmund Kemper, who was driven to kill young women by his hatred of his mother, who he eventually murdered before turning himself in; both Dion and Kemper cut their mother's <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> from their throats after killing them.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals {{have a large}} larynx {{and thus}} a {{low-pitched}} voice, namely the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) where the larynx can take up {{the entirety of the}} thoracic cavity while pushing the lungs, heart, and trachea into the abdomen. Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch, as in the low-pitched roars of big cats. The production of infrasound is possible in some mammals such as the African elephant (Loxodonta spp.) and baleen whales. Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produced ultrasound, which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and cochlea. Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might have been important during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating. Toothed whales also use echolocation, but, as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds,</b> they have a melon to manipulate sounds. Some mammals, namely the primates, have air sacs attached to the larynx, which may function to increase the volume of sound.|$|E
25|$|Phonation is {{the process}} of {{producing}} vocal sound by the vibration of the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract. It takes place in the larynx when the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> are brought together and breath pressure is applied to them {{in such a way that}} vibration ensues causing an audible source of acoustic energy, i.e., sound, which can then be modified by the articulatory actions of the rest of the vocal apparatus. The <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> are brought together primarily by the action of the interarytenoid muscles, which pull the arytenoid cartilages together.|$|E

40|$|Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders under NIH [R 01 DC 005522 - 09]In this paper, {{the role}} of <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> {{elongation}} in governing glottal movement dynamics was theoretically and experimentally investigated. A theoretical model was first proposed to incorporate <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> elongation into the two-mass model. This model predicted the direct and nondirect components of the glottal time series {{as a function of}} <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> elongation. Furthermore, high-speed digital imaging was applied in excised larynx experiments to visualize <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> vibrations with variable <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> elongation from - 10 % to 50 % and subglottal pressures of 18 - and 24 -cm H(2) O. Comparison between theoretical model simulations and experimental observations showed good agreement. A relative maximum was seen in the nondirect component of glottal area, suggesting that an optimal elongation could maximize the <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> vibratory power. However, sufficiently large <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> elongations caused the nondirect component to approach zero and the direct component to approach a constant.

40|$|Background/PurposeThere are few {{objective}} measurements {{to assess}} the results of surgery for <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> polyps. This study investigated the effects of surgery on the phonation threshold pressure (PTP) in patients with <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> polyps. MethodsProspectively, 32 consecutive patients with <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> polyps were enrolled. PTP was measured 1 day before and 6 weeks after laryngomicrosurgery, {{by means of an}} airflow interruption method. An accelerometer was used to detect the <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> vibration instead of using an acoustic signal. ResultsIn all 32 patients, the average preoperative PTP was 0. 51 ± 0. 23 kPa, and 6 weeks after surgery, it was 0. 28 ± 0. 17 kPa; this difference was statistically significant (p < 0. 001). Individually, PTP decreased in 31 patients after surgery. PTP increased after surgery in only one patient, from 0. 74 to 0. 75 kPa. Subjectively, all patients could phonate with less effort after surgery. Use of an accelerometer to sense <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> vibration was feasible and made it easier to identify the time point of cessation of <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> vibration, which is important for PTP measurement. ConclusionLaryngomicrosurgery can lower PTP in patients with <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> polyps and improve the ease of phonation. PTP is one of the objective measurements for assessing the effects of surgery in patients with <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> polyps. Use of an accelerometer to detect <b>vocal</b> <b>fold</b> vibration improved the measurement of PTP...|$|R
25|$|Mature human <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> are {{composed}} of layered structures which are quite different at the histological level. The topmost layer comprises stratified squamous epithelium which is bordered by ciliated pseudostratified epithelium. The inner lining surface of this squamous epithelium is covered by a layer of mucus (acting as a mucociliary clearance), which is composed of two layers: a mucinous layer and serous layer. Both mucus layers provide viscous and watery environment for cilia beating posteriorally and superiorly. The mucociliary clearance keeps the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> essentially moist and lubricated.|$|E
25|$|Some voice teachers, however, {{organize}} registers differently. There {{are over}} a dozen different constructs of vocal registers in use within the field. The confusion which exists concerning what a register is, and how many registers there are, {{is due in part}} to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest pitches of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds</b> are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been shown that a more {{powerful}} voice may be achieved with a fatter and fluid-like vocal fold mucosa. The more pliable the mucosa, the more efficient the transfer of energy from the airflow to the <b>vocal</b> <b>folds.</b>|$|E
