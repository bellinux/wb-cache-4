40|$|THE {{metabolic}} {{activity of}} the lens has been very extensively studied, and something is known of its internal ionic composition (Lebensohn, 1936; Langham and Davson, 1949; Harris, Gehrsitz, and Nordquist, 1953) and its permeability to certain ions (Friedenwald, 1930; Langham and Davson, 1949; Pau and Stuttgen, 1951).

25|$|There {{are various}} causes for the {{appearance}} of floaters, of which the most common are described here. Simply stated, any damage to the eye that causes material to enter the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour</b> can result in floaters.|$|E
25|$|Patients with retinal tears may {{experience}} floaters if {{red blood cells}} are released from leaky blood vessels, and those with uveitis or vitritis, as in toxoplasmosis, {{may experience}} multiple floaters and decreased vision due to the accumulation of white blood cells in the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{causes for}} {{floaters}} include cystoid macular edema and asteroid hyalosis.

40|$|The {{eye lens}} is avascular, {{deriving}} nutrients from the aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humours.</b> It is, however, unclear which mechanisms mediate {{the transfer of}} solutes between these humours and the lens' fibre cells (FCs). In this review, we integrate the published data with the previously unpublished ultrastructural, dye loading and magnetic resonance imaging results. The picture emerging is that solute transfer between the humours and the fibre mass is determined by four processes: (i) paracellular transport of ions, water and small molecules along the intercellular spaces between epithelial and FCs, driven by Na+-leak conductance; (ii) membrane transport of such solutes from the intercellular spaces into the fibre cytoplasm by specific carriers and transporters; (iii) gap-junctional coupling mediating solute flux between superficial and deeper fibres, Na+/K+-ATPase-driven efflux of waste products in the equator, and electrical coupling of fibres; and (iv) transcellular transfer via caveoli and coated vesicles for the uptake of macromolecules and cholesterol. There {{is evidence that the}} Na+-driven influx of solutes occurs via paracellular and membrane transport and the Na+/K+-ATPase-driven efflux of waste products via gap junctions. This micro-circulation is likely restricted to the superficial cortex and nearly absent beyond the zone of organelle loss, forming a solute exchange barrier in the lens...|$|R

Inoculation of bacilli was by the intravenous or intraperitoneal route or directly into the hind footpads; eyes were not directly inoculated in this study. During periods of up to 3 years under laboratory conditions no animal showed evidence of impaired vision or blindness, and the external appearance of both eyes was normal. The ocular histopathology and the sites of accumulation of bacilli are described. In immunologically normal mice infected with M. lepraemurium bacilli were much commoner in extraorbital tissues, but they were, nevertheless, found in various tissues within the orbit, including the ciliary body and sclera.

25|$|While {{surgeries}} {{do exist}} to correct for severe cases of floaters, {{there are currently}} no medications (including eye drops) that can correct for this vitreous deterioration. Floaters are often caused by the normal aging process and will usually disappear as the brain learns to ignore them. Looking up/down and left/right will cause the floaters to leave the direct field of vision as the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour</b> swirls around due to the sudden movement. If floaters significantly increase in numbers and/or severely affect vision, {{then one of the}} below surgeries may be necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{floaters}} is shrinkage of the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour.</b> This gel-like substance consists of 99% water and 1% solid elements. The solid portion consists of a network of collagen and hyaluronic acid, with the latter retaining water molecules. Depolymerization of this network makes the hyaluronic acid release its trapped water, thereby liquefying the gel. The collagen breaks down into fibrils, which ultimately are the floaters that plague the patient. Floaters caused in this way tend to be few in number and of a linear form.|$|E
25|$|As {{the disease}} progresses, severe nonproliferative {{diabetic}} retinopathy enters an advanced or proliferative (PDR) stage, where blood vessels proliferate/grow. The {{lack of oxygen}} in the retina causes fragile, new, blood vessels to grow along the retina and in the clear, gel-like <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour</b> that fills {{the inside of the}} eye. Without timely treatment, these new blood vessels can bleed, cloud vision, and destroy the retina. Fibrovascular proliferation can also cause tractional retinal detachment. The new blood vessels can also grow into the angle of the anterior chamber of the eye and cause neovascular glaucoma.|$|E
40|$|Aim: This study {{compared}} systemic and intraocular {{concentrations of}} erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{in patients with}} type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) with levels in patients without diabetes, and looked for possible correlations between the concentrations found and other variables analyzed. Methods: Concentrations of EPO and VEGF were measured in the aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humours</b> and serum of patients undergoing vitrectomy for PDR (33 patients) or for macular holes or puckers (20 control patients). EPO was assayed by radioimmunoassay, with a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 1. 0 mIU/mL. VEGF was assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with a lower LOD of 10. 0. pg/mL. Results: EPO concentrations in serum {{did not differ significantly}} between the two groups, whereas EPO in vitreous and aqueous were higher in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients. VEGF in serum was lower in diabetic patients than in non-diabetics; conversely, VEGF concentrations in vitreous were significantly higher in diabetic patients. A direct correlation was found between vitreous and aqueous EPO concentrations, and between vitreous EPO and blood glucose concentrations. A significant, negative correlation between vitreous EPO concentration and age was also recorded. Conclusion: High EPO concentrations in the vitreous of patients with PDR and its correlation with blood glucose suggest that EPO could {{play a role in the}} pathogenesis of PDR. All possible factors affecting serum and ocular concentrations of EPO and VEGF should be determined to identify compounds able to prevent and control this serious microvascular complication of diabetes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFibroblast {{growth factors}} {{play a key}} role in {{regulating}} lens epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation via an anteroposterior gradient that exists between the aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humours.</b> FGF- 2 is the most important for lens epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. It has been proposed that the presentation of FGF- 2 to the lens epithelial cells involves the lens capsule as a source of matrix-bound FGF- 2. Here we used immunogold labelling to measure the matrix-bound FGF- 2 gradient on the inner surface of the lens capsule in flat-mounted preparations to visualize the FGF- 2 available to lens epithelial cells. We also correlated FGF- 2 levels with levels of its matrix-binding partner perlecan, a heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) and found the levels of both to be highest at the lens equator. These also coincided with increased levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (pERK 1 / 2) in lens epithelial cells that localised to condensed chromosomes of epithelial cells that were Ki- 67 positive. The gradient of matrix-bound FGF- 2 (anterior pole: 3. 7  ±  1. 3  particles/μm 2; equator: 8. 2  ±  1. 9  particles/μm 2; posterior pole: 4  ±  0. 9  particles/μm 2) and perlecan (anterior pole: 2. 1  ±  0. 4  particles/μm 2; equator: 5  ±  2  particles/μm 2; posterior pole: 1. 9  ±  0. 7  particles/μm 2) available at the inner lens capsule surface was measured for the bovine lens. These data support the anteroposterior gradient hypothesis and provide the first measurement of the gradient for an important morphogen and its HSPG partner, perlecan, at the epithelial cell-lens capsule interface...|$|R
50|$|Helmholtz—The {{most widely}} held theory of {{accommodation}} is that proposed by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1855. When viewing a far object, the circularly arranged ciliary muscle relaxes allowing the lens zonules and suspensory ligaments {{to pull on}} the lens, flattening it. The source of the tension is the pressure that the <b>vitreous</b> and aqueous <b>humours</b> exert outwards onto the sclera. When viewing a near object, the ciliary muscles contract (resisting the outward pressure on the sclera) causing the lens zonules to slacken which allows the lens to spring back into a thicker, more convex, form.|$|R
25|$|The main {{structures}} of the bird eye {{are similar to those}} of other vertebrates. The outer layer of the eye consists of the transparent cornea at the front, and two layers of sclera — a tough white collagen fibre layer which surrounds the rest of the eye and supports and protects the eye as a whole. The eye is divided internally by the lens into two main segments: the anterior segment and the posterior segment. The anterior chamber is filled with a watery fluid called the aqueous humour, and the posterior chamber contains the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour,</b> a clear jelly-like substance.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{appearance}} of floaters has to be attributed to dark specks in the tear film of the eye. Technically, these are not floaters, but they do look the same {{from the viewpoint of}} the patient. Persons with blepharitis or a dysfunctional meibomian gland are especially prone to this cause, but ocular allergies can also cause the problem. To differentiate between material in the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour</b> of the eye and debris in the tear film, one can look at the effect of blinking: debris in the tear film will move quickly with a blink, while floaters are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true floaters and macular degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} Stickler {{syndrome}} are very nearsighted (described as having high myopia) {{because of the}} shape of the eye. People with eye involvement are prone to increased pressure within the eye (ocular hypertension) which could lead to glaucoma and tearing or detachment of the light-sensitive retina of the eye (retinal detachment). Cataract may also present as an ocular complication associated with Stickler's Syndrome. The jelly-like substance within the eye (the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour)</b> has a distinctive appearance in the types of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL2A1 and COL11A1 genes. As a result, regular appointments to a specialist ophthalmologist are advised. The type of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL11A2 gene does not affect the eye.|$|E

40|$|Background/aims To {{determine}} if patients with inactive chorioretinitis lesions who experience chronic toxoplasmic uveitis test PCR positive for Toxoplasma in their ocular fluids. Methods Two patients undergoing long-term anti-toxoplasmic treatment developed chronic uveitis and vitritis. They underwent therapeutic and diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy. Patient specimens were tested for toxoplasmosis by real-time PCR and nested PCR. Patient specimens were also {{tested for the}} presence of Toxoplasma antibodies that recognise allelic peptide motifs to determine parasite serotype. Results Patients tested positive for Toxoplasma by real-time PCR at the B 1 gene in the <b>vitreous</b> and aqueous <b>humours</b> of patient 1, but only the vitreous of patient 2. Patients were not parasitemic by real-time PCR in plasma and blood. During surgery, only old hyperpigmented toxoplasmic scars were observed; {{there was no sign of}} active retinitis. Multilocus PCR-DNA sequence genotyping at B 1, NTS 2 and SAG 1 loci established that two different non-archetypal Toxoplasma strains had infected patients 1 and 2. A peptide-based serotyping ELISA confirmed the molecular findings. Conclusions No active lesions were observed, but both patients possessed sufficient parasite DNA in their vitreous to permit genotyping.

25|$|The {{human eye}} {{functions}} by focusing light onto {{a layer of}} photoreceptor cells called the retina, which forms the inner lining {{of the back of}} the eye. The focusing is accomplished by a series of transparent media. Light entering the eye passes first through the cornea, which provides much of the eye's optical power. The light then continues through the fluid just behind the cornea—the anterior chamber, then passes through the pupil. The light then passes through the lens, which focuses the light further and allows adjustment of focus. The light then passes through the main body of fluid in the eye—the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour,</b> and reaches the retina. The cells in the retina line the back of the eye, except for where the optic nerve exits; this results in a blind spot.|$|E
25|$|Floaters {{present at}} birth usually remain lifelong, while those that appear later may {{disappear}} within weeks or months.

A survey of optometrists in 2002 suggested that an average of 14 patients per month per optometrist presented with symptoms of floaters in the UK. However, floaters are more than a nuisance and a distraction to those with severe cases, especially if the spots seem to constantly drift through the field of vision. The shapes are shadows projected onto the retina by tiny structures of protein or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour.</b> Floaters can even be seen when the eyes are closed on especially bright days, when sufficient light penetrates the eyelids to cast the shadows.

The diagnosis {{was based on}} clinical findings, ophthalmological examination, and isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from <b>vitreous</b> and/or aqueous <b>humours</b> of 19 patients (definite diagnosis), and from other ocular specimens of 17 patients (probable diagnosis). The mean (± SD) age was 69. 3 (± 16. 5) years (range 1. 5 – 89 years), and 20 (55. 5 %) patients were male. The origin of endophthalmitis was considered exogenous for 34 (94. 5 %) patients. The most common predisposing factors were previous ocular surgery (n = 25, 69. 4 %), ocular trauma (n = 5, 13. 9 %), and close-to-eye radiotherapy (n = 3, 8. 3 %). Eleven (30. 5 %) patients underwent evisceration as the first therapeutic measure (primary evisceration), and evisceration was performed after antibiotic treatment failure (secondary evisceration) for six (16. 7 %) patients. Primary evisceration was performed more commonly (63. 6 %) during 1998 – 2004, while secondary evisceration was only performed during 1986 – 1997. Eighteen (50 %) patients received intra-vitreous antibiotics (mainly vancomycin), and 31 (86. 1 %) patients were given systemic antibiotic therapy. The most frequent pneumococcal serogroups isolated were 6, 19, 9, 15 and 23. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of 23 isolates revealed that four belonged to the international clones Spain 23 F- 1, Spain 6 B- 2, Spain 9 V- 3 and Sweden 15 A- 25. Non-susceptibility rates (i. e., intermediately-resistant and resistant) were: co-trimoxazole, 44. 8 %; penicillin, 33. 3 %; tetracycline, 31. 0 %; erythromycin, 21. 9 %; chloramphenicol, 17. 9 %; rifampicin, 7. 4 %; cefotaxime, 5. 9 %; and levofloxacin, 0 %.

2500|$|Eye {{floaters}} {{are suspended}} in the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour,</b> the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye. The <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour,</b> or vitreous body, is a jelly-like, transparent substance that fills {{a majority of the}} eye. It lies within the vitreous chamber behind the lens, {{and is one of the}} four optical components of the eye. Thus, floaters follow the rapid motions of the eye, while drifting slowly within the fluid. When they are first noticed, the natural reaction is to attempt to look directly at them. However, attempting to shift one's gaze toward them can be difficult as floaters follow the motion of the eye, remaining to the side of the direction of gaze. Floaters are, in fact, visible only because they do not remain perfectly fixed within the eye. Although the blood vessels of the eye also obstruct light, they are invisible under normal circumstances because they are fixed in location relative to the retina, and the brain [...] "tunes out" [...] stabilized images due to neural adaptation. This stabilization is often interrupted by floaters, especially when they tend to remain visible.|$|E
2500|$|Nearly {{every person}} who {{undergoes}} a vitrectomy—without ever having had cataract surgery—will experience progression of nuclear sclerosis after the operation. This may be because the native vitreous humor is different to the solutions used to replace the vitreous (vitreous substitutes), such as BSS Plus. This may also be because the native <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour</b> contains ascorbic acid which helps neutralize oxidative damage to the lens and because traditional vitreous substitutes do not contain ascorbic acid. [...] As such, for phakic patients requiring a vitrectomy {{it is becoming increasingly}} common for ophthalmologists to offer the vitrectomy with a combined prophylactic cataract surgery procedure to prophylactically prevent cataract formation.|$|E

Due to their microscopic size they cannot be seen by doctors. They only appear as big as they do because of their proximity to the retina. This type of floater is still described occasionally in people in their 30s and very rarely occurs in people in their 40s.|$|E
2500|$|... transparent, {{but as one}} ages, {{imperfections}} gradually develop. The {{common type}} of floater, which is present in most persons' eyes, is due to degenerative changes of the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour.</b> The perception of floaters is known as myodesopsia, or less commonly as myodaeopsia, myiodeopsia, or myiodesopsia. They are also called Muscae volitantes (Latin: [...] "flying flies"), or mouches volantes (from the French). Floaters are visible because of the shadows they cast on the retina or refraction of the light that passes through them, and can appear alone or together with several others in one's visual field. They may appear as spots, threads, or fragments of cobwebs, which float slowly before the observer's eyes. As these objects exist within the eye itself, they are not optical illusions but are entoptic phenomena. They {{are not to be}} confused with visual snow, although these two conditions may co-exist.|$|E
2500|$|The first proto-eyes evolved among animals [...] {{about the}} time of the Cambrian explosion. The last common {{ancestor}} of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision, and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96% of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla. In most vertebrates and some molluscs, the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive panel of cells, known as the retina, {{at the rear of the}} eye. The cone cells (for colour) and the rod cells (for low-light contrasts) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision. The visual signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. Such eyes are typically roughly spherical, filled with a transparent gel-like substance called the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour,</b> with a focusing lens and often an iris; the relaxing or tightening of the muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil, thereby regulating the amount of light that enters the eye, and reducing aberrations when there is enough light. The eyes of most cephalopods, fish, amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes, and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens—similar to how a camera focuses.|$|E

The eye (Figure 8) has a tough, dense, outer coat, the {{sclerotic}} (sc.), {{within which}} is a highly vascular and internally pigmented layer, the choroid, upon which the percipient nervous layer, the retina (r.) rests. The chief chamber of the eye is filled with a transparent jelly, the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humour</b> (v.h.). In front of the eye, the white sclerotic passes into the transparent cornea (c.). The epidermis is continued over the outer face {{of this as a}} thin, transparent epithelium. The choroid coat is continued in front by a ring-shaped muscle, the iris (ir.) the coloured portion of the eyes. This iris enlarges or contracts its central aperture (the black pupil) by reflex action, as the amount of light diminishes or increases. Immediately behind this curtain is the crystalline lens (l.), the curvature of the anterior face or which is controlled by the ciliary muscle (c.m.). In front of the lens is the aqueous humour (a.h.).
