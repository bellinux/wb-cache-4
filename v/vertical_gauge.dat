F-theory on such spaces gives rise to discrete gauge symmetries in the effective action. We generalize the transversality conditions on gauge fluxes known for elliptic fibrations by taking into account the properties of the available multi-section. We test these general conditions by constructing all <b>vertical</b> <b>gauge</b> fluxes in a bisection model with gauge group SU(5) x Z 2. The non-abelian anomalies are shown to vanish. These flux solutions are dynamically related to fluxes on a fibration with gauge group SU(5) x U(1) by a conifold transition. Considerations of flux quantization reveal an arithmetic constraint on certain intersection numbers on the base which must necessarily be satisfied in a smooth geometry. Combined with the proposed transversality conditions on the fluxes these conditions are shown to imply cancellation of the discrete Z 2 gauge anomalies as required by general consistency considerations.

In the case of symmetric mass matrices, two of the solutions of Ramond, Roberts and Ross that may not be obtained by family symmetries only, are accurately reproduced. For non-symmetric textures, new structures arise in models of this type. To distinguish between the solutions in this latter case, we performed a numerical fit to the charged fermion mass and mixing data.

40|$|It {{is shown}} in the present paper that the {{transformation}} relating a parallel transported vector in a Weyl space to the original one {{is the product of a}} multiplicative gauge transformation and a proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation. Such a Lorentz transformation admits a spinor representation, which is obtained and used to deduce the transportation properties of a Weyl spinor, which are then expressed in terms of a composite gauge group defined as the product of a multiplicative gauge group and the spinor group. These properties render a spinor amenable to its treatment as a particle coupled to a multidimensional gauge field in the framework of the Kaluza-Klein formulation extended to multidimensional gauge fields. In this framework, a fiber bundle is constructed with a horizontal, base space and a <b>vertical,</b> <b>gauge</b> space, which is a Lie group manifold, termed its structure group. For the present, the base is the Minkowski spacetime and the vertical space is the composite gauge group mentioned above. The fiber bundle is equipped with a Riemannian structure, which is used to obtain the classical description of motion of a spinor. In its classical picture, a Weyl spinor is found to behave as a spinning charged particle in translational motion. The corresponding quantum description is deduced from the Klein-Gordon equation in the Riemann spaces obtained by the methods of path-integration. This equation in the present fiber bundle reduces to the equation for a spinor in the Weyl geometry, which is close to but differs somewhat from the squared Dirac equation. Comment: 19 page...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the low frequency motion of swash directly induced by wave grouping {{on a steep}} beach. A new experimental investigation is presented which considers the hydrodynamics of the inner surf zone and swash zone using <b>vertical</b> wave <b>gauges</b> and a run-up wire. Results for regular waves, wave groups and random waves are discussed, with particular reference to low frequency motions. The inner surf zone and swash zone {{are found to be}} unsaturated at incident short wave frequencies and, as a result, significant wave grouping is apparent at the shoreline. The low frequency motion in the surf zone is found to be in phase with the incident wave grouping and may therefore be regarded as a time varying set-up (Watson and Peregrine, 1992). The low frequency motion of the swash is shown to be an order of magnitude greater than that in the inner surf zone, inconsistent with cross-shore standing long waves, for which no evidence is found. We demonstrate that the low frequency motion of the shoreline provides an excellent approximation to the run-up of individual bores and therefore describes the run-up envelope. Spectral analysis shows that the low frequency motion of the swash is directly linked to the modulations in offshore wave height, i. e. the low frequency energy in the incident wave envelope, In addition, the random wave run-up spectra show an f(- 4) high frequency roll-off, as found by Huntley et al. (1977). The accumulated data show that, unless the surf zone is totally saturated, a significant proportion of the low frequency swash motion may be directly due to incident wave grouping and rot standing long waves.

40|$|Peat is {{a common}} land surface {{material}} in many {{countries of the world}} and is particularly important in upland regions of the UK. Peat landscapes represent an important land use for hill farming, water management, and shooting, and are a globally scarce resource. Wind is a fundamental characteristic of upland environments in the UK and has long been recognised as a significant factor in peat erosion. This paper presents the first results of a project that aims to determine the significance of wind action in the erosion of upland peat. Wind erosion monitoring is being undertaken at Moor House in the North Pennines on a 3 -ha area of relatively flat, sparsely vegetated peat. Measurements using arrays of passive horizontal mass flux <b>gauges</b> (fixed orientation <b>vertical</b> slot <b>gauges),</b> together with a vertical array of mass flux samplers (directional), provide estimates of sediment flux. A micrometeorological station records local wind speed (four heights), wind direction, rainfall, soil moisture, and temperature conditions. For 1999 and 2000, the annual horizontal net erosion flux is 0. 46 and 0. 48 t ha− 1, respectively. Results of detailed monitoring over a 10 -month period demonstrate that the peat sediment flux collected in windward- and leeward-oriented sediment traps on 10 separate occasions is between 3 and 12 times greater in the windward-facing traps. The concentration of peat with height decays rapidly and the majority of the peat is transported close to the ground surface. Above 0. 3 m, very little peat is found. Significant horizontal fluxes of peat occur in both wet and dry periods. This is evaluated using the local micrometeorological data to try and predict sediment yields. Correlations among time-averaged friction velocity measurements, surface conditions, and sediment flux are complex. Event-based measurements, as opposed to cumulative sediment yields, are required to resolve this. These results quantify {{for the first time the}} significance of wind action in the erosion of peat in a UK upland environment. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Recently {{developed}} Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) {{determines the}} probable total rutting by summing up the deformations of all {{layers of the}} trial pavement. If all distresses outcomes including rutting are within the specification the trial section is designed for construction. Therefore, vertical deformation (or strain) needs to be measured to validate the MEPDG for local conditions. However, no direct procedure for measuring the vertical strain in flexible pavement is available to this date. Traditionally, Earth Pressure Cell (EPC) is {{used to measure the}} vertical stresses at different layers of pavement. Then, vertical strain is calculated using the measured stress and the stiffness of the corresponding material. The present study describes a procedure to measure the vertical strain of asphalt concrete based on field instrumentation. The vertical strain is measured using the <b>Vertical</b> Asphalt Strain <b>Gauge</b> (VASG) in an instrumented pavement section on Interstate 40 (I- 40) in the state of New Mexico, USA and compares the results with numerical model developed using ABAQUS. The numerical model is validated with stress responses measured with installed four EPCs. The stiffness input of the numerical model is obtained from Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) test. Promising agreement is observed between the strains measured in the field and determined from the numerical model. Therefore, the VASG can be considered an effective sensor to measure the vertical strain of asphalt concrete in flexible pavement...|$|R

Membrane deflection measurements can {{be made on the}} wafer scale (50 – 150 mm) with up to nanometer-scale <b>vertical</b> resolution. <b>Gauge</b> pressures up to 689 kPa (100 psi) are controlled using an electronic regulator with and accuracy of approximately 0. 344 kPa (0. 05 psi). Initial testing was performed on square diaphragms 350, 550, and 1200 μm in width comprised of 720 ± 10 nm thick low pressure chemical vapor deposited silicon nitride with ∼ 20 nm of e-beam evaporated aluminum. These initial experiments were focused on measuring the system limitations and used to determine what range of deflections and pressures can be accurately measured and controlled. Gauge pressures from 0 to ∼ 8. 3 kPa (1. 2 psi) were initially applied to the bottom side of the diaphragms and their deflection was subsequently measured. The overall pressure resolution of the system is good (∼ 350 Pa) but small fluctuations existed at pressures below 5 kPa leading to a larger standard deviation between deflection measurements. Analytical calculations and computed finite element analysis deflections closely matched those empirically measured. Using an analytical solution that relates pressure deflection data for the square diaphragms the Young’s modulus was estimated for the films assuming a Poisson’s ratio of v= 0. 25. Calculations to determine Young’s modulus for the smaller diaphragms proved difficult because the pressure deflection relationship remained in the linear regime over the tested pressure range. Hence, the calculations result in large error when used to estimate the Young’s modulus for the smaller membranes. The deflection measurements of three 1200 × 1200 μm 2 Si 3 N 4 −x membranes were taken at increased pressures (> 25 kPa) to increase nonlinearity and better determine Young’s modulus. This pressure-deflection data were fit to an analytical solution and Young’s modulus estimated to be 257 ± 3 GPa, close to those previously reported in literature...|$|R

It is currently used {{in the construction of}} high rise building in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The formwork used for the construction of the wall is by using tunnel form system. It is fast and cost effective compared to the conventional method. This is an experimental work involving three wall panel reinforced with double layer of wire mesh type B 385 (B 7) with a dimension of 75 x 1000 x 1500 mm (Width:Length:Height). The aspect ratio (h/L) and slenderness ratio (h/t) of the wall panel are 1. 5 and 20 respectively. The wall panels were constructed using concrete Grade 30 Normal Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) with a water cement ratio of 0. 58. These wall panel are tested under direct axial line load (without eccentricity) to monitored the structural performance of the wall. Experimental result shows that all wall panels failed in compression shear based on the cracking propagation of the entire wall. The wall panel split into two sections at the middle width of the wall panel. It was found that all the crack lines occur {{at the side of the}} wall panel. There are no cracks which occurred at both front and rear surfaces of the wall panel. Maximum deflection recorded at ultimate load was located at the top of the wall. The wall panels swayed to the front of the wall panel. The reinforcement strain was measured by two <b>vertical</b> strain <b>gauges</b> and two horizontal strain gauges.

Objective: This study presents the loading compliance comparing loads prescribed and applied {{on the three}} axes of the implant during static load-bearing exercises with a specific emphasis on axial and vectorial comparisons. Study design: Cohort study. Methods: A total of 11 fully rehabilitated unilateral transfemoral amputees fitted with an osseointegrated implant performed five trials in four loading conditions using a static standing frame. The load prescribed was monitored using a <b>vertical</b> single-axis strain <b>gauge</b> connected to an electronic display. The tri-axial forces applied on the implant were measured directly with an instrumented pylon including a six-channel transducer. The analysis included ‘axial’ and ‘vectorial’ comparisons corresponding {{to the difference between}} the force applied on the long axis of the implant and the load prescribed as well as the resultant of the three components of the load applied and the load prescribed, respectively.

40|$|Rail {{and track}} defects {{are one of}} the most {{important}} sources of dynamic loads generated by a moving train. The oscillations and vibrations decrease the ride comfort, increasing the track deterioration and noise emission. In the spectrum of the vibrations of railway vehicles, the track geometrical irregularities generate excitations at low frequencies, usually below 30 Hz, that are responsible for the dynamic behavior of the vehicle. A comprehensive multi-body simulation model of a four-axle passenger rail vehicle is implemented in the multi-body simulation software (MBS) and it is used for analyzing the potentially dangerous running condition. On basis of these multi-body model simulations, the influence of the track irregularities on the vehicle-track dynamic interaction, mainly in terms of lateral (Y) and vertical (Q) wheel-rail forces, their ratio (Y/Q) and contact angle (delta), is investigated. Four kinds of the track related irregularities, according to the ORE B 176 standard, are statistically determined: lateral, <b>vertical,</b> roll and <b>gauge.</b> Each one of these, is examined in two different levels of severity (low, high) by means of excitation signals in distance domain on the basis of a Power Spectral Density (PSD) function. In order to individuate the worst run condition varying the train speed within of this range: 70 - 200 km/h, the two different combinations of irregularity levels are implemented. Finally, the relations between the main dynamic parameters (Y, Q, Y/Q, d) and the track irregularities severity level are analyzed, under certain geometrical conditions. These studies are to be considered in preparation to future investigations aimed to obtain the best simplified model to describe the railway alignment defects occurrence and their evolution...|$|R
40|$|Dust {{particles}} in the atmosphere are a key cause of nuisance, health and other environmental problems. The mining sector is {{a major source of}} airborne particulate matter caused by operations like terrain clearing, drilling, blasting, tipping and loading and the passage of vehicles on unpaved roads. The nuisance effect of airborne dust can be measured by using dust buckets and/or directional dust deposition gauges. Dust buckets are used to determine vertical dust deposition rates and directional dust deposition gauges are used to determine the direction of the sources. Traditionally the measurement of the vertical flux of dust, or dust deposition has been used as to indicate the nuisance caused by coarse suspended particulate matter. Several countries have produced standards for permissible dust deposition rates. Although alternative deposition measurement methods have been proposed, ASTM D 1739 has remained the method most often used in the South African mining and industrial sectors to measure dust deposition. In addition, a number of non-standard directional dust deposition gauges have been used. SANS 1929 : 2005 (South African National Standards, 2005) prescribes the use of ASTM D 1739 : 98 for measuring dust deposition. However, for historical reasons the previous version, ASTM D 1739 : 70 (re-approved as ASTM D 1739 : 82) is still widely used and in the recently promulgated South African Dust Management regulations the use of this version is prescribed. In order to determine the difference in the results obtained by the two versions, ASTM D 1739 : 82 and ASTM D 1739 : 98 were used to measure dust deposition levels arising from a coal mining operation in the Mpumalanga Province and a gold mining operation in North-West Province. In order to determine whether a correlation exists between vertical dust flux (dust deposition) and horizontal dust flux, standard directional horizontal dust flux gauges according to BS 1747 part 5 were also set up at both sites. The measurement of dust deposition using three dust deposition gauges (i. e. ASTM D 1739 : 82, ASTM D 1739 : 98 and BS 1747 part 5, directional dust deposition gauges) was undertaken monthly over a period of fourteen (14) months at the two sites. The findings of the study indicate that the dust deposition rates for an opencast coal mine are generally higher than the dust deposition rates for an underground gold mine. ASTM D 1739 : 98 was shown to be a more efficient dust deposition collection method than ASTM D 1739 : 82, with the ratio between the mean values slightly more than 2. The addition of water to the dust bucket does not make a statistically significant difference to retention of dust in the bucket. There is a weak correlation between results for the <b>vertical</b> dust <b>gauges</b> and horizontal dust flux. It is recommended that the South African mining sector continue dust deposition monitoring and reporting using the more recent version of ASTM D 1739, as high deposition levels may indicate a potential health impact from PM 10 thoracic dust.

In this study, we compared the strain around the abutting teeth and edentulous ridges supporting telescopic-retained RPDs with different designs using a strain gauge technique. Materials and methods: A maxillary model including four abutting teeth (# 14, 13, 23, and 24) was constructed and is referred to as Case 1. In total, four RPD frameworks (two resilient and two rigid) were fabricated for Case 1 with a conventional telescope retainer and attachment-retained telescopic retainer (ARTR) groups. A vertical static load of 280 N was applied, and strain values obtained from the strain gauges were recorded. RPDs were modified according to the following cases—Case 2 included teeth 14, 13, and 23; Case 3 included teeth 14 and 13; and Case 4 included teeth 13 and 23 —and measurements were repeated. A randomized block analysis of the variance test was conducted using a general linear model procedure with statistical software. Multiple comparisons between groups were performed using Tukey’s honest significant difference test (α= 0. 05). Results: RPDs with an ARTR produced more strain distal to the abutting teeth than RPDs with a conventional telescope retainer. Both retainer types with a rigid design produced more strain distal to the abutting teeth than did retainers with a resilient design. RPDs supported by four, three, and two unilateral abutting teeth produced similar strain patterns. RPDs supported by two bilateral abutting teeth produced the highest strain distal to the abutting teeth, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the strains produced by RPDs supported by either two unilateral or bilateral abutting teeth. The highest strain values were obtained from strain gauges distal to the “terminal” abutting teeth. Directions of the principal strain were in a <b>vertical</b> direction for <b>gauges</b> located distal to the terminal abutting teeth. More strain was produced on the posterior edentulous ridges.

40|$|Measurement of {{the volume}} of {{precipitate}} d water on the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface is an important division of the science of hydroclimatology. Rainfall measurements provide fundamental knowledge needed in establishing the bio-climatic type of a region, and rainfall data are essential in many forms of land management, either for agriculture, municipal development, production of hydroelectric power, or flood control. Rainfall cannot be measured directly, like the flow of a river, but must be estimated from samples taken at various locations on the watershed. For a satisfactory estimate, the individual samples must be as accurate as possible and closely representative of the areas to which they are applied. The technique of precipitation measurement in populated areas, which are usually of minor relief, has presented but little difficulty. On the other hand, precise determinations of rainfall in mountainous regions present many difficulties. Sampling techniques and instrumentation require modification as measurements are extended into the high country, to provide basic hydrologic information for use in water supply problems, stream regulation, and flood control. In this report are presented the results of detailed research of this process and how much precipitation is delivered to mountain watersheds. In 1955, in the Kujiu, central part of the Kyushu, the author started a program of hydrologic research. The area was selected for the investigations included Waita conical mountain situated in the Kujiu mountain within the national park. The research program required an accurate determination of the rainfall on mountain water sheds. In effect, in the high mountains the measure o f total precipitation is in error if one multiplies the horizontal projectional area of the watershed by the total depth of water as given by the conventional vertically placed rain gauge. Storm rainfall must be considered as a vector and the true rainfall sample can be computed by the elementary theory of vectors on the condition that the magnitude and direction of the storm vector in space are known respectively. In steep mountain regions as Waita the conventional rain gauge will not give a true sample of the rainfall. The sample is in error because in mountainous regions storms are usually accompanied by strong winds. The rainfall characteristics study is dealt with the behavior of rainfall in relation to wind. Rainfall rate, wind direction, and wind velocity were recorded synchronously. The vectorical components of rainfall were measured by a directional rain gauge, or special vectopluviometer. It consisted of a horizontal (H) and a vertical funnel (E. S. W. N.) mounted, and rain caught by the funnels was directed into separate compartments of the receiver tank, one compartment for each quadrant of the compass for each funnel. The angle of inclination of the rainfall (i) from any quadrant was calculated by the formula, tan i =V /H where V is the catch of the funnel with its rim in a vertical plane, and H is catch of the funnel with its rim in a horizontal plane. The average inclination of the storm could be determinded by summing the catch of the vertical and horizontal funnels separately, and then applying the formula (Table 14, Fig. 60). Correction of rainfall estimated from these <b>vertical</b> rain <b>gauge</b> setting on steep terrain was made possible through the use of vector equation, provided slope and aspect of the terrain are known and storm direction and angle of inclination of the rainfall can be determined. And then author 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of measurements of rainfall made during 1955 - 1961. in Kujiu drainage basin on the windward and leeward slope of the Waita mountain shows that the rainfall at each gage correlates according to a geometric progression with distance of the gauge from the summit (Figs. 28 - 41). And then the detailed observations made during the microhydro-climatological survey of soil and plant of this Waita mountain district which was undertaken between 1955 to 1961 with aid of agricultural-meteorology. A few of the items are given here. (I) Insolation, air temperature, soil temperature, precipitation, evaporation, and wind difference owing to topographies (Figs. 68 - 80). (II) Soil and plant variation by topography in the around Waita mountain (Figs. 82 - 89). 涌蓋山の植物群落を調査して気候との関係を調査した. その結果,海抜 1, 000 m付近までが山麓植物群落, 1, 000 ～ 1, 300 mが山地森林植物群落(喬木帯), 1, 300 ～ 1, 400 mに高山性草木灌木性植物群落が発達していることがわかつた. そして植物群落は南東から北西を通る線によつて 2 分され,北東側の半分が南西側よりよく発達していることがわかつた. これは北東側が日射,風が弱くて蒸発散が少ないためと思われる. これに反し南西側は雨期には強雨が多く,細土および腐植土の流亡があり瘠薄になること,また気候的には日射が強く高温,乾燥が相伴い,また風も強く気候変化がはげしいために,植物のその後の生育が悪く植生の発達も悪くなつたと推論した...|$|R
