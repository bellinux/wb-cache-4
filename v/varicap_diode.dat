The second varicap effectively replaces the blocking capacitor {{in the first}} circuit. This reduces the overall capacitance and the capacitance range by half, but possesses the advantage of reducing the AC component of voltage across each device and symmetrical distortion should the AC component possess enough amplitude to bias the varicaps into forward conduction.|$|R

50|$|In electronics, a <b>varicap</b> <b>diode,</b> {{varactor}} diode, variable capacitance diode, variable reactance diode or tuning diode {{is a type}} of diode {{designed to}} exploit the voltage-dependent capacitance of a reversed-biased p-n junction.|$|E
50|$|Generally {{the use of}} a <b>varicap</b> <b>diode</b> in {{a circuit}} {{requires}} connecting it to a tuned circuit, usually in parallel with any existing capacitance or inductance. Because a DC voltage must be applied reverse bias across the varicap to alter its capacitance, this must be blocked from entering the tuned circuit. This is accomplished by placing a DC blocking capacitor with a capacitance about 100 times greater than the maximum capacitance of the <b>varicap</b> <b>diode</b> in series with it and applying the DC from a high impedance source to the node between the varicap cathode and the blocking capacitor as shown in the upper left hand diagram, right.|$|E
50|$|These circuit {{configurations}} are quite common in television tuners and electronically tuned broadcast AM and FM receivers, {{as well as}} other communications equipment and industrial equipment. Early <b>varicap</b> <b>diodes</b> usually required a reverse voltage range of 0 - 33 v to obtain capacitance range, which was quite small, approximately 1 - 10 pF. These types were and are still extensively used in television tuners, whose high carrier frequencies require only small changes in capacitance.|$|R
50|$|In time, <b>varicap</b> <b>diodes</b> were {{developed}} which exhibited very large capacitance ranges, 100 - 500 pF, with relatively {{small changes in}} reverse bias: 0 - 5 or 0 - 12 v. These newer devices allow electronically tuned AM broadcast receivers to be realized {{as well as a}} multitude of other functions requiring large capacitance changes at lower frequencies, generally below 10 MHz. Some of designs of electronic security tag readers used in retail outlets require these high capacitance varicaps in their voltage-controlled oscillators.|$|R

The line {{consists of a}} number of LC filters. The capacitance is obtained by using <b>varicap</b> <b>diodes,</b> so that electronic control over the desired depth is obtained by changing the diode inverse polarization voltage. This delay line exhibits a dramatic simplification and a broader time delay excursion than alternative techniques.

50|$|Indirect FM {{employs a}} <b>varicap</b> <b>diode</b> {{to impose a}} phase shift (which is voltage-controlled) in a tuned circuit that is fed with a plain carrier. This is termed phase modulation.In some {{indirect}} FM solid state circuits, an RF drive {{is applied to the}} base of a transistor. The tank circuit (LC), connected to the collector via a capacitor, contains a pair of varicap diodes. As the voltage applied to the varicaps is changed, the phase shift of the output will change.|$|E
50|$|Direct FM (true Frequency modulation) {{is where}} the {{frequency}} of an oscillator is altered to impose the modulation upon the carrier wave. This {{can be done by}} using a voltage-controlled capacitor (<b>Varicap</b> <b>diode)</b> in a crystal-controlled oscillator or frequency synthesiser. The frequency of the oscillator is then multiplied up using a frequency multiplier stage, or is translated upwards using a mixing stage, to the output frequency of the transmitter. The amount of modulation {{is referred to as the}} deviation, being the amount that the frequency of the carrier instantaneously deviates from the centre carrier frequency.|$|E
50|$|Jackson Brothers, {{commonly}} known as Jackson Bros, was a firm known for its dominance of the variable capacitor (or 'tuning condenser') market {{in the early days}} of radio broadcasting. Founded in 1923 to provide tuning capacitors for the growing home construction market, by the Fillmore family in Lewisham, England, (there never was a pair of people involved who were Jackson brothers!) the firm went on to manufacture a huge variety of the, mostly air-spaced, two or three gang, variable capacitors, that were at the heart of all radio receivers until the invention of the <b>varicap</b> <b>diode,</b> which replaced them, especially in VHF designs, and the frequency-synthesizer front ends that are now found in most radio receivers.|$|E

40|$|Conference on Metamaterials II, Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC, APR 16 - 18, 2007 International audienceDielectric {{substrates}} supporting planar periodic subwavelength metamaterial-based metallic arrays {{and presenting}} frequency dispersive phase characteristics {{are applied to}} ultra-compact high-gain and high-directivity planar antennas. In this paper, different models of metamaterial-based surfaces introducing a zero degree reflection phase shift to incident waves are firstly studied numerically using finite-element method analysis where the bandwidth and operation frequency are predicted. These surfaces are then applied in a resonant Fabry-Perot type cavity and a ray optics analysis is used to design different models of ultra-compact high-gain microstrip printed antennas. Firstly, a cavity antenna of thickness lambda/ 60 based {{on the use of}} a microstrip patch antenna and two bidimensional metamaterial-based surfaces, the first one acting as a High Impedance Surface (HIS) and the second one acting as a Partially Reflecting Surface (PRS) is designed. This cavity is then optimized for easier fabrication process and loss reduction by the use of only one bidimensionnal composite metamaterial-based surface acting as a PRS. Secondly, another surface presenting a variable phase by the use of a non periodic metamaterial-based metallic strips array is designed for a passive low-profile steering beam antenna application.

50|$|Special {{types of}} <b>varicap</b> <b>diode</b> exhibiting an abrupt change in {{capacitance}} {{can often be}} found in consumer equipment such as television tuners, which are used to switch radio frequency signal paths. When in the high capacitance state, usually with low or no bias, they present {{a low impedance path}} to RF, whereas when reverse biased their capacitance abruptly decreases and their RF impedance increases. Although they are still slightly conductive to the RF path, the attenuation they introduce decreases the unwanted signal to an acceptably low level. They are often used in pairs to switch between two different RF sources such as the VHF and UHF bands in a television tuner by supplying them with complementary bias voltages. The fourth device from the left in the picture at the head of this page is one such device.|$|E
5000|$|The three leaded devices {{depicted}} {{at the top}} of {{the page}} are generally two common cathode connected varicaps in a single package. In the consumer AM/FM tuner depicted at the right, a single dual-package <b>varicap</b> <b>diode</b> adjusts both the passband of the tank circuit (the main station selector), and the local oscillator with a single varicap for each. This is done to keep costs down [...] - [...] two dual packages could have been used, one for the tank and one for the oscillator, four diodes in all, and this was what was depicted in the application data for the LA1851N AM radio chip. Two lower-capacitance dual varactors are used in the FM section which operates at a frequency about one hundred time greater and are highlighted by red arrows. In this case four diodes are used, one dual package each for the tank/bandpass filter and the local oscillator.|$|E
40|$|Parametric {{oscillator}} circuits are investigated {{further in}} addition to part 1 of this series of papers, where was shown by simulation that energy from spacetime is possible in certain cases. A variable capacitance can give rise to ever increas-ing oscillations. The design of part 1 is improved so that the circuit is fully self-oscillating and the parametric element is switched by phase conditions only, not requiring an external tuned oscillator. Realization examples (a switched capacitor design and a design by capacity <b>diodes,</b> <b>varicaps)</b> are investigated by simulation and real circuits. The varicap example shows some similarity to the desired behaviour but {{does not lead to}} a permanently increasing amplitude. Further design improvements towards “energy from spacetime ” are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The job {{developed}} {{in this thesis}} has been that to plan an electric circuit that realize an analog beamforming with two dipole spar, related to the receiving chain of the systems RFID, in the UHF (860 ÷ 868 MHz) frequencies band. Such a project puts in evidence a solution of system and {{the realization of the}} circuit it is a part of it. In fact the use of two spar allows to increase the general profit in comparison to a single spar and therefore to exploit such advantage for the range of action of the device or to parity of this last to decrease the power in transmission. The circuit reduces to zero the phase between the signals received by the two spar allowing to drive the principal lobe of the diagram of spar in direction of the transmitter or rather that of maximum field of radiation, so maximizing the received signal. The circuit is constituted by <b>varicap</b> <b>diodes</b> which inversely polarized works as capacitances controlled in voltage. The same function is developed by the MOS varactor but the choice of the diodes it {{is due to the fact}} that in the MOS varactor the variation of the capacitance is at the most of 2 pF while with the varicap they reach variation of 15 - 18 pF allowing to reduce to zero the phase between the signals on a greater range of delays. This allows us to check and to reset the bewilderment among the induced signals around two spar making to vary the voltage of polarization. This happens changing the phase of the received signal by one of the two spar of 90 ° through a net realized with the diodes opportunely polarized in the point of select rest in a linear zone of the characteristic ability-tension of the varicap. Then the signals are opportunely amplified and multiplied. The output of the multiplier is filtered getting a value of proportional continuous tension to the bewilderment of the two signals. This tension is applied, in reaction, on the diodes making to vary their polarization, therefore the value of their ability until to reduce to zero the difference of phases. To this point the value of the continuous tension to the output of the multiplier is void, we have so corrected the error of phase. To correct the error of phase means to aim the lobe of radiation of the spar in the direction of maximum field. The circuit corrects a bewilderment among the signals equal to 0. 15 ns. The two spar allow us to get a double profit in comparison to the single spar. This allows us to choose whether to decrease the power in transmission of 2 or to increase the range of action of the device, practically than in base to the equation that exists between the power of transmission and the power in receipt among two spar, a transmitting station and the other receiver. The circuit in matter, being realized with discreet components has enough elevated consumptions of power, 12 V of power supply, as well as the noise and the parasitic capacitances are greater in comparison to an integrated device. For this reason in a future development of integrated circuit realization on silicon, the required amplifications will surely be smaller and therefore to reduce notably the consumption of power. This will also allows the use of such a circuit on the semipassive or active tags. At present, the component discreet electric scheme of the design surely allows the use in the reader...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to develop RF {{bandpass}} filters in PCB technology,with three main objectives. The first objective was to develop synthesis formulas tosimplify the design procedure of the filter. The second was to achieve wideout-of-band rejection without modifying the in-band filtering characteristics. Thethird objective was to control the center frequency of the filter by using varactordiode. The bandpass filter topology treated in this thesis is based on Stub-LoadedResonators (SLR). The main features of this filter topology were treated. Equivalentcircuits based on J-inverters and susceptance parameters were derived. Based onthese equivalent circuits, synthesis formulas were developed. Simulations werepresented to validate the synthesis theory. For a proof-of-concept, third orderstripline bandpass filters were designed and fabricated based on this synthesis. Analysis technique using odd- and even- mode was achieved on the SLR. Thusresonance odd- and even-mode conditions were derived. These conditions aim toeasily control the first spurious frequency. Moreover, to go further in improving theout-of-band rejection a new technique, called “U corner structure”, was developedand design rules were derived. Based on these design rules an extended out-of-bandrejection was achieved without any modification in the passband and by maintainingthe compactness of the filter. A first spurious frequency was localized at up to ninetimes the working frequency {{in the case of}} the Parallel-coupled Stub-Loadedresonator (PC-SLR) filter. Also, by applying this technique into the classicalparallel-coupled filter the first and second spurious frequencies were rejected. Toaddress the issue of tunable filters, the SLRs were correctly loaded by variablecapacitors (varactor diode). The center frequency of the PC-SLR filter was easilycontrolled by maintaining a large out-of-band rejection.
