40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} investigating <b>vegetable</b> based <b>lubricant</b> {{as a replacement}} for chemical based lubricants on extrusion pressure of equal channel angular extrusion of Aluminum. In the process, aluminum alloy (Al 6063) was heated at 350 °C for one hour, machined and cut to billets size of 11. 95 m x 11. 95 m x 40 m (l × b × h). The billets were extruded through die of 12 mm x 12 mm channel cross-section area, the channel angle was 60 °. Four <b>vegetable</b> based <b>lubricants</b> namely jatropha, neem, castor and cotton seed oils were used. The die was centrally located on the bed of vertical hydraulic testing machine and the billet was inserted into the entrance channel. Lubrication was applied to the billet to decrease its friction and with the channel inner wall. The ram displacement per plunger speed was 1 mm per 1 second respectively. For each lubricant, four samples were extruded through ECAE die to confirm the repeatability of the results and the average values of the extrusion pressure were computed. The results were compared to the sample extruded via conventional lubricants. It was discovered of all the extruded samples, jatropha oil gave the least extrusion pressure of 83 kN, cottonseed oil extruded at 104 kN and castor oil at 151. 4 kN while neem oil require the highest pressure at 220. 9 kN. The chemical based lubricants that serve as the control from the literature gave the extrusion pressure of 81 kN. It can be concluded that the oil from jatropha seed is the best in terms of extrusion pressure and can effectively replace the chemical based lubricants...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Chainsaws, an {{indispensable}} tool for modern forestry operations, rely on bar lubricant to prevent rapid wear {{of the chain}} and bar. Choice of bar lubricant must balance performance, cost, and biological impact. Many bar lubricants are available, but little published work exists that conclusively ranks the performance of these choices. This study used a series of laboratory-based cutting and free running chainsaw experiments to compare the lubrication performance of 6 petroleum based <b>lubricants</b> and 2 <b>vegetable</b> based <b>lubricants.</b> The cutting experiments mimicked normal operating conditions and used bar temperature distribution to show how lubricant choice, lubricant flowrate and chain tension effected frictional power dissipation in the chain and bar assembly. Cutting results indicated that chain tension was the strongest predictor of frictional power dissipation. Boundary lubrication conditions occurred at 1 mL/min of lubricant flowrate, mixed lubrication occurred at 3 - 5 mL/min flowrate, and film lubrication occurred at 10 mL/min flowrate. In the 3 - 5 mL/min flowrate range, high viscosity index appeared to reduce lubricant film breakthrough. The free running experiments used measurements of chain length increase to test the ability of each lubricant to protect chain components from rapid wear under abusive operating conditions sometimes encountered in the field. Length increase is caused by material loss at the rivets of the chain. Results showed that under these operating conditions, lubricant viscous properties {{had no effect on}} wear rates. Lubricant additive composition dictated chain wear rates, which was independent of whether the lubricant was petroleum or vegetable based. The combined results show that a reliable means of evaluating chainsaw bar lubricants was developed and that both high and low quality examples of petroleum and <b>vegetable</b> base <b>lubricants</b> exist...|$|R

This paper presents results of testing the soybean oil additivated with nano graphite (0. 25 %wt, 0. 50 %wt and 1 %wt) on a four ball machine. The friction coefficient is slightly increased for the additivated lubricants, but no evident dependency on concentration and test conditions was noticed.

However, apparent solubility problems were detected when mixed with other vegetable oils with lower polarity than castor oil. In this work, a suitable combination of ethyl cellulose (EC) with both high oleic sunflower (HOSO) and castor (CO) oils was found able to reach stable and non gel-like blends with viscosities at 40 °C ranging between 62 and 493 cSt, and viscosity indexes fitting into group III (VI ≥ 120) of API classification of base fluids. The ternary HOSO/CO/EC blend showed an important reduction in friction coefficient at low entrainment speed, and generated a stable EHD-film at 100 °C of around 20 nm, which suggests better boundary properties than HOSO/EC or CO/EC blends.

40|$|Abstract. The {{awareness}} on {{the harmful}} impact of lubricants and industrial fluids entering the environment due to leakage or spillage has increased considerably {{during the last}} years. Hydraulic fluids can be classified as “high risk loss ” lubricants- they are used in large volumes in equipment that is susceptible to spills. Hydraulic fluids currently used in Latvia in wood harvesting and other environmentally sensitive areas still are mainly based on mineral oils which are not biodegradable and are dangerous to the environment. Completely different is the situation in other EU countries, e. g., in Sweden, where the Swedish standard SS 155434 is a legal requirement: lubricants not fulfilling these criteria for biodegradable hydraulic fluids are not permitted on the Swedish market. There is an obvious need for elaboration of compositions of hydraulic fluids based on renewable natural resources in order to initiate and to promote production of such products in Latvia. <b>Vegetable</b> oil-based <b>lubricants</b> have excellent lubricity and biodegradability, but two major problems exist with vegetable oils as functional fluids: low resistance to thermal oxidation and poor performance at low temperatures. We developed compositions of hydraulic fluids using as base stocks rapeseed oil and esters of its fatty acids with polyols-neopentyl glycol (NPG), trimethylolpropane (TMP) and pentaerythritol (PE) – as well as 2 -ethylhexyl esters of estolides of rapeseed oil. Besides that mixture of rapeseed oil with pentaerythritol esters of fatty acids (7 : 3) also was made.

The stable dispersions of 0. 5 wt%, 1 wt% and 2 wt% zinc borate ultrafine powder in sunflower oil were achieved by using an ultrasonic homogeniser. Both a 4 -ball tester and a pin-on-disc tester were employed to evaluate the anti-wear and friction reduction capabilities of zinc borate ultrafine powder. Tribo-films with dark colour were generated on the worn surfaces and showed a good contrast with the substrate. The worn surface with different morphologies reflected as the colour alterations on the worn surface were observed when different lubricants were applied. The morphology and elemental analysis of the worn surfaces were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Mechanical properties of the tribo-films and substrates were studied with a nano-indentation tester. Test results suggest that tribo-films generated on the worn surface have a relatively low hardness compared with the steel substrate. The substrates on the worn surfaces lubricated in sunflower oil with the powder demonstrated higher hardness {{than that of the}} substrate lubricated with pure sunflower oil due to the possible tribo-chemical reaction between the zinc borate additive and substrate.

MANOVA indicated that the speed and feed variables main effects are significant, but the interaction of (speed*feed) was not significant at 95 % confidence level. The model was able to predict 69. 44 %, 68. 06 % and 42. 90 % of the variation in the data for both the flank wear side 1 and 2 and aerosol mass concentration, respectively. An adequate signal-to-noise precision ratio more than 4 was obtained for the models, indicating adequate signal to use the model as a predictor for both the flank wear sides and aerosol mass concentration. The highest average mass concentration of 8. 32 mg/m 3 was realized using cutting speed of 80 Surface feet per minute (SFM) and a feed rate of 0. 003 Inches per tooth (IPT). The lowest average mass concentration of 5. 91 mg/m 3 was realized using treatment 120 SFM and 0. 005 IPT. The cutting performance under microlubrication is five times better in terms of tool life and two times better in terms of materials removal volume under low cutting speed and feed rate combination as compared to high cutting speed and feed rate combination. Abrasion was the dominant wear mechanism for all the cutting tools under consideration. Other than abrasion, sliding adhesive wear of the workpiece materials was also observed. The scanning electron microscope investigation of the used cutting tools revealed micro-fatigue cracks, welded micro-chips and unusual built-up edges on the cutting tools flank and rake side. Higher tool life was observed in the lowest cutting speed and feed rate combination. Transmission electron microscopy analysis at failure for the treatment 120 SFM and 0. 005 IPT helped to quantify the dislocation densities. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) identified 4 to 8 µm grain size growth on the machined surface due to residual stresses that are the driving force for the grain boundaries motion to reduce its overall energy resulting in the slight grain growth. EBSD also showed that (001) textured ferrite grains before machining exhibited randomly orientated grains after machining. The study shows that with a proper selection of the cutting parameters, it is possible to obtain higher tool life in end milling under microlubrication. But more scientific studies are needed to lower the mass concentration of the aerosol particles, below the recommended value of 5 mg/m 3 established by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ...|$|R
40|$|Industry Structure Lubricants 2 ̆ 7 {{base oil}} {{production}} is virtually controlled by five, vertically integrated, multi-national companies. Their market shares are {{large enough to}} permit strong influence over the entire industry and to render competition ineffective. It {{will be difficult for}} new firms to enter the lubricant 2 ̆ 7 s industry and compete successfully with these entrenched firms. The lubricants market is large. The market is dominated by petroleum based, mineral oil products. Projected market growth is minimal, and worldwide supply is ample. Growing environmental awareness and the prospect of stringent regulations regarding petroleum products use have spurred renewed interest in the manufacture of <b>vegetable</b> oil based <b>lubricants.</b> Product performance will likely be more critical to success than competitive price. Markets that offer significant potential include those where state regulations mandate biodegradable lubricant use or in industries that seek avoid costly remedial clean ups. Environmental Threats or Opportunities There is no universally accepted definition for environmentally acceptable lubricants, but the American Society for Testing Materials has formed a subcommittee to establish standards. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that our nation 2 ̆ 7 s remaining water quality problems are largely attributable to pollution from nonpoint sources. The EPA is stepping up efforts to reclassify nonpoint sources as point sources to subject former nonpoint sources to regulation liability. Public perception of ground water contaminants has been the catalyst to stimulate reclassification. Hence, in many applications a readily biodegradable and nontoxic lubricant is preferable to current options especially where the product is introduced into nature. Lacking federal government mandated change, any firm producing an environmentally superior lubricant faces several realities. First, the product must perform as well as or better than existing lubricants. Second, success may be most easily achieved by marketing products in states that have already regulated lubricants. And finally, because the global market for environmentally friendly products is still heating up, the odds for a 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 product 2 ̆ 7 s success are very good. The Drip Oil Market If 100 percent of petroleum based drip oil was displaced by soyoil, 1. 68 to 2. 36 million bushels of soybeans would be consumed to produce drip oil. A more realistic forecast by one of the big five lubricant firms is sales of 2. 5 million gallons for all biodegradable lubricants by 1995. National introduction of biodegradable lubricants is feasible for one of the industry 2 ̆ 7 s dominant firms, but for smaller firms, niche markets and regional introduction would be more manageable and enhance the chances for success. Drip oil is marketed as both a private branded drip oil and a nationally branded lubricant used for drip oil. Consumers look for anti-wear additives, lubricity and viscosity additives and quality for the price. The drip oil market is composed of more buyers who purchase small quantities of product and fewer buyers who purchase large quantities of product. Therefore, profits will not be garnered by 2 ̆ 2 product turn 2 ̆ 2 generated by high volume, low priced sales, but by offering consumers enhanced product value through distribution, packaging and product performance. Firms who can deliver the above three criteria will find consumers willing to pay a premium price for their products...|$|R
