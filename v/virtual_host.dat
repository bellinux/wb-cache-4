50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>virtual</b> <b>hosting,</b> name-based and IP-based. Name-based <b>virtual</b> <b>hosting</b> uses the host name {{presented}} by the client. This saves IP addresses and the associated administrative overhead but the protocol being served must supply the host name at an appropriate point. In particular, there are significant difficulties using name-based <b>virtual</b> <b>hosting</b> with SSL/TLS. IP-based <b>virtual</b> <b>hosting</b> uses a separate IP address for each host name, {{and it can be}} performed with any protocol but requires a dedicated IP address per domain name served. Port-based <b>virtual</b> <b>hosting</b> is also possible in principle but is rarely used in practice because it is unfriendly to users.|$|R

50|$|In name-based <b>virtual</b> <b>hosting,</b> {{also called}} shared IP <b>hosting,</b> the <b>virtual</b> <b>hosts</b> serve {{multiple}} hostnames {{on a single}} machine with a single IP address.

The MagicServer version of httpd worked around some of the problems that plagued other implementations, such as the number of open file descriptors on the system, but had issues of its own which led to its eventual abandonment in favor of the standard built-in Apache <b>virtual</b> <b>hosting.</b>|$|R
