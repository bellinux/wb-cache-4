40|$|A resin slurry venting {{analysis}} was conducted to address safety issues associated with overpressurization of ion exchange columns used in the Purex process at the Savannah River Site (SRS). If flow to these columns were inadvertently interrupted, an exothermic runaway reaction could occur between the ion exchange resin and the nitric acid used in the feed stream. The nitric acid-resin reaction generates significant quantities of noncondensable gases, which would pressurize the column. To prevent the column from rupturing during such events, rupture disks are installed on the column vent lines. The venting analysis models accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) tests and data from tests that were performed in a <b>vented</b> <b>test</b> vessel with a rupture disk. The tests showed that the pressure inside the test vessel continued to increase after the rupture disk opened, though at a slower rate than prior to the rupture. Calculated maximum discharge rates for the resin <b>venting</b> <b>tests</b> exceeded the measured rates of gas generation, so the vent size was sufficient to relieve the pressure in the test vessel if the vent flow rate was constant. The increase in the vessel pressure is modeled as a transient phenomenon associated with expansion of the resin slurry/gas mixture upon rupture of the disk. It is postulated that the maximum pressure {{at the end of}} this expansion is limited by energy minimization to approximately 1. 5 times the rupture disk burst pressure. The magnitude of this pressure increase is consistent with the measured pressure transients. The results of this analysis demonstrate the need to allow for a margin between the design pressure and the rupture disk burst pressure in similar applications...|$|R

40|$|Current {{explosion}} vent design correlations and guidance {{are based on}} an experimental data base of centrally ignited <b>vented</b> <b>tests.</b> However, there is evidence in the literature that ignition positions other than central produce higher overpressures. The objective of this work was to compare central and end ignition of vented explosions in a 10 L and a 200 L cylindrical vessels of L/D of 2. 8 and 2 respectively, with vent area coefficients of 10. 9, 5. 4 and 3. 1 for free venting. Methane-air (10 % v/v) and ethylene-air (7. 5 %) explosion tests were carried out using a 16 J spark ignition {{at the far end}} wall opposite the vent and half way {{along the length of the}} vessel. The results showed that for both vessels and for both gas/air mixtures end ignition produced the highest overpressures. This was attributed to the higher axial flame speed towards the vent with far end ignition, inducing higher vent mass flows and higher external flame speeds and associated overpressures. The present results and other data from the literature show that the vent design guides may not be based on sufficiently conservative data and need to be reviewed...|$|R

40|$|The Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR) {{proposed}} by General Electric (GE) is an advanced light water reactor (ALWR) design that utilizes passive safety systems. The PCCS {{is a series}} of heat exchangers submerged in water and open to the containment. Since the containment is inerted with nitrogen during normal operation, the PCCS must condense the steam in the presence of noncondensable gases during an accident. To model the transient behavior of the SBWR with a system code, the code should properly simulate the expected phenomena. To validate the applicability of RELAP 5 MOD 3. 1. 1, the data from three Phase 1, Step 2 nitrogen <b>venting</b> <b>tests</b> at Toshiba`s Gravity-Driven Integral Full-Height Test for Passive Heat Removal facility and RELAP 5 calculations of these tests were compared. The comparison of the GIRAFFE data against the results from the RELAP 5 calculations showed that it can predict condensation and gas purging phenomena occurring in the long-term decay heat rejection phase. In this phase of the transient, condensation in the PCCS is the only means to reject heat from the SBWR containment. In the two tests where the nitrogen purge vent line was at its deepest submergence in the Suppression Pool (SIP), the RELAP 5 results mirrored the behavior of the containment pressures and of the water levels in the Horizontal Vent (HV) and the nitrogen purge line tube of the GIRAFFE data. However, in the test with the shallowest purge line submergence, there was appreciable direct contact condensation on the pool surface of the HV despite modeling efforts to deter these phenomena. This surface condensation, unobserved in the GIRAFFE tests, was a major cause of RELAP 5 predicting early containment depressurization and the subsequent early rise in HV and nitrogen purge line water levels.

40|$|Deployable gossamer {{structures}} for solar sails {{need to be}} deployed in a controlled way. Several strategies present have the disadvantage that the sail membrane cannot always be tensioned during the deployment process. In combination with a slow deployment, this involves the risk of an entanglement of the sail. Slow deployments of at least several minutes are desirable {{in order to keep}} inertial loads low and to implement Fault-Detection, Fault-Isolation and Recovery Techniques (FDIR). This might further require completely stopping and resuming the deployment process. For gossamer spacecraft based on crossed boom configurations with triangular sail segments, a deployment strategy is described that is assumed to allow such a controlled deployment process. With a combination of folding and coiling, it is ensured that the deployed sail area can be held taut between the partly deployed booms. During deployment, four deployment units with two spools each on which the sail is mounted (a half segment stowed on each) moves away from the central bus unit, the center of the deployed sail. The development was made in the Gossamer- 1 project of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The folding and coiling of the membrane is mathematically modelled. This allows an investigation of the deployment geometry. It provides the mathematical relation between the deployed boom length and the deployed sail membrane geometry. By modelling the coiled zig-zag folding lines it is possible to calculate the deployment force vector as function of the deployment time. The stowing and deployment strategy was verified by tests with an engineering qualification model of the Gossamer- 1 deployment unit. According to a test-as-you-fly approach the tests included vibration <b>tests,</b> <b>venting,</b> thermal-vacuum <b>tests</b> and ambient deployment.

40|$|The Solar Sail Propulsion {{investment}} {{area has}} been one of the three highest priorities within the In-Space Propulsion Technology (ISPT) Project. In the fall of 2003, the NASA Headquarters' Science Mission Directorate provided funding and direction to mature the technology as far as possible through ground research and development from TRL 3 to 6 in three years. A group of experts from government, industry, and academia convened in Huntsville, Alabama to define technology gaps between what was needed for science missions to the inner solar system and the current state of the art in ultra 1 ightweight materials and gossamer structure design. This activity set the roadmap for development. The centerpiece of the development would be the ground demonstration of scalable solar sail systems including masts, sails, deployment mechanisms, and attitude control hardware and software. In addition, new materials would be subjected to anticipated space environments to quantify effects and assure mission life. Also, because solar sails are huge structures, and it is not feasible to validate the technology by ground test at full scale, a multi-discipline effort was established to develop highly reliable analytical models to serve as mission assurance evidence in future flight program decision-making. Two separate contractor teams were chosen to develop the SSP System Ground Demonstrator (SGD). After a three month conceptual mission/system design phase, the teams developed a ten meter diameter pathfinder set of hardware and subjected it to thermal vacuum tests to compare analytically predicted structural behavior with measured characteristics. This process developed manufacturing and handling techniques and refined the basic design. In 2005, both contractor teams delivered 20 meter, four quadrant sail systems to the largest thermal vacuum chamber in the world in Plum Brook, Ohio, and repeated the tests. Also demonstrated was the deployment and articulation of attitude control mechanisms. In conjunction with these tests, the stowed sails were subjected to launch vibration and ascent <b>vent</b> <b>tests.</b> Other investments studied radiation effects on the solar sail materials, investigated spacecraft charging issues, developed shape measuring techniques and instruments, produced advanced trajectory modeling capabilities, and identified and resolved gossamer structure dynamics issues.

The increased sensitivity of virus replication to guanidine in the presence of low Na + medium could be abolished with excess K Ã· in such medium. Excess K Ã· in low Na + medium restored intraceUular [Na +] and reduced guanidine uptake.

40|$|The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), in {{conjunction}} with the McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company (MDAC), has developed a standardized electronics box that provides a simple, cost-effective structure to house various digital and analog electronic circuitry. The standard electronics box design adheres to the Lightsat principles of simple and inexpensive articles which can reliably perform various missions. This standard electronics housing design reduces repetitive design and testing costs; specifically, shock and vibration qualification <b>testing,</b> <b>venting,</b> fracture, and thermal analyses, and mass properties determination. The simple box design allows for ease of manufacture and a direct path for conductive thermal dissipation, and flexibility to handle various electronic applications. Reliability was achieved by designing the standard box to survive the repeated pressure cycling of multiple shuttle missions. While the standard housing is not a 2 Ì 7 cure-all 2 Ì 7 design used for all purposes, it has worked well for many applications. Actual usage experience has enabled NRL to identify areas for future modifications using either contemporary or state-of-the-art technologies...|$|R
