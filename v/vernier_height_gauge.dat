50|$|<b>Height</b> <b>gauges</b> {{may also}} be used to measure the height of an object by using the {{underside}} of the scriber as the datum. The datum may be permanently fixed or the <b>height</b> <b>gauge</b> may have provision to adjust the scale, this is done by sliding the scale vertically along the body of the <b>height</b> <b>gauge</b> by turning a fine feed screw {{at the top of the}} gauge; then with the scriber set to the same level as the base, the scale can be matched to it. This adjustment allows different scribers or probes to be used, as well as adjusting for any errors in a damaged or resharpened probe.|$|R
50|$|In the toolroom, the {{distinction}} between a <b>height</b> <b>gauge</b> and a surface gauge is that a <b>height</b> <b>gauge</b> has a measuring head (whether vernier, fine rack and pinion with dial, or linear encoder with digital display), whereas a surface gauge has only a scriber point. Both are typically used on a surface plate and have a heavy base with an accurately flat, smooth underside.|$|R

50|$|On July 25, 2007, as {{a result}} of the most recent {{accident}} on the ramp, French Prime Minister François Fillon held a press conference to announce a series of measures to prevent such a heavy vehicle from attempting the descent again. Flashing signs were installed within days, as were speed bumps at the level of the road signs, designed to ensure driver attention to these signs. In July 2008, <b>height</b> <b>gauges</b> were also set up to physically prevent access for vehicles over a certain height.

30|$|Wires with diameters {{measuring}} either 0.063 or 0.296  mm were {{fastened to}} the upper gripper and the lower gripper and were pulled tight by the application of an initial load ranging from 0.5 – 3.0  N. Gauge tape (2  mm[*]×[*] 7  mm) {{was placed on the}} wire 10  mm from the fastened edge of the upper gripper, as shown in Fig.  2. A <b>height</b> <b>gauge</b> (Mitsutoyo Co., HD-AX) was fixed on the universal testing machine table. The positions of the fastened edge and the tape were measured prior to tensile testing. Next, the cross-head was elevated by 2  mm at a speed of 10  mm/min. The positions of the edge and the tape were again measured with the <b>height</b> <b>gauge.</b> The distance between the edge and the tape (upper gripper-tape gap) was calculated.|$|R

5000|$|The easiest {{method for}} {{measuring}} flatness {{is with a}} <b>height</b> <b>gauge</b> positioned on a surface plate.

50|$|Surface plates must be {{calibrated}} {{regularly to}} ensure that chipping, warping or wear has not occurred. A common problem with surface plates is wear to particular areas, such as that caused by the frequent use of a tool in one place (such as a <b>height</b> <b>gauge),</b> that causes an uneven surface and reduced overall accuracy to the plate. Tools and workpieces may also cause damage when dropped on the surface plate. Also, damage can be caused when swarf and other debris has not been removed. This will result in erroneous measurements. Damage to the plate can only be corrected by resurfacing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{design and}} {{construction}} of a small wave-sediment tank, built and instrumented for under $ 10, 000, is described. The tank {{is equipped with a}} piston-type wavemaker, capable of producing both small-amplitude and solitary waves. The middle section of the tank contains a sediment bed appropriate for wave-soil-structure interaction and sediment transport experiments. Wave energy is absorbed by a gravel beach located {{at the opposite end of}} the tank from the wavemaker. Instrumentation includes three capacitive wave <b>height</b> <b>gauges.</b> The wavemaker is controlled by a desktop computer, which also provides data-logging capability. Applications of this wave-sediment tank to research into grounded ship migration and barge added-mass are presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of different bit profiles on possible fracture modes was investigated using Finite Element Method. The International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) classification {{was used to}} design 14 types of profiles. The formation model was built, with given bit size, formation properties, meshing method and boundary conditions, etc. Moreover, the pseudo-static state and mass scaling were used to reduce the simulation time and increase the simulation accuracy. The simulation results showed that, for nine common bit profiles, larger cone height led to larger area of high stress zone, and the <b>gauge</b> <b>height</b> was not apparently related to the stress generated. When the <b>gauge</b> <b>height</b> decreased, the high stress zone turned from the nose and center to the gauge zone. For the non-common bit profiles, the convex bit produced larger high stress field, and the pilot section bottom of bicentre bits had concentrated stress. Fractures were created in the gauge zones and noses, and the bits with larger cone <b>height</b> and <b>gauge</b> <b>height</b> induced longer vertical fractures. The flat and convex bits did not generate longer vertical fractures. The bicentre bit can hinder the vertical fractures in the gauge zone, but enables the horizontal fractures easier. The bit with intermediate reamer has less damage to sidewall...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this {{research}} work, Finite Element Modeling (FEM) using SYSWELD {{was carried out}} to predict thermal cycles, residual stresses and distortion in type 316 LN stainless steel weld joint made by TIG welding process. The numerically predicted thermal cycles and temperature distribution were validated using Infrared (IR) Thermography. The model predictions of the surface and bulk residual stress profiles were validated using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Ultrasonic Testing (UT) respectively. Distortion analysis was also performed and validated using digital <b>height</b> <b>gauge</b> measurement. IR thermography {{was found to be}} a good tool for validating the model predictions of the temperature distribution in the weld joint. There was good agreement between the model predictions and the experimentally observed values of temperature, residual stresses and distortion. Therefore, the numerical modeling in combination with non-destructive methods provides an efficient approach for predicting the effect of welding process on the weld attributes...|$|R

40|$|As one of {{the major}} parts of the chainsaw, the cutting chain has an {{important}} impact on productivity and health risk in motor-manual harvesting. The efficiency of cross cutting and quantity of sawdust produced in relation to different cutting chain settings, chain producers and wood species has been measured. The trial was set up to include two tree species (fir and beech) and saw chains from two different producers. The chains were filed at three different top plate filing angles and depth <b>height</b> <b>gauges.</b> All factors were significant in terms of cutting efficiency and wood dust production. The top plate angle recommended by producers proved to be the most efficient, with the smallest quantity of inhalable wood dust. Cutting chain settings can be adapted to the specific requirements of the user; however, safe working practices should be followed. Significant differences between chain producers mean that users should conduct rational decision making when choosing a saw chain...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The recent {{literature}} data {{points out a}} rising application of digital radiography - radiovisiography (RVG) - in dental clinical practice. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to apply and compare RVG with the conventional radiographic technique (CRDG) in terms of accuracy in linear measurement in dentistry. Methods. Measurements were done on the mandibular dogs teeth considering incisors crown width and height of the surrounding alveolar bone using RVG and CRDG. The control technique (CONT) involved values obtained by direct gauging in dogs mouth. Each measuring was done by two examiners. Results. Considering the incisors’ crown width, there were no significant statistical difference in measurement using CRDG, RVG and CONT technique (p> 0. 01). Concerning the alveolar <b>height</b> <b>gauging</b> there were no significant difference in recorded values between the two radiographic techniques (p> 0. 01). The high level of inter-examiner agreement was observed for scoring in all techniques (CRDG, RVG and CONT). Conclusion. Although RVG did not expose more accuracy comparing to CRDG, having opulent tool service the first technique contributed more comfortable work during measuring procedures in this study...|$|R
40|$|Although {{a number}} of {{manufacturers}} are marketing disposable prophylaxis angles, no literature exists regarding the mechanical efficacy and efficiency of these products. It was {{the purpose of this}} in vitro evaluation to compare and evaluate five brands of commercially available disposable prophylaxis angles for vibration, noise, heat rise, and torque. Random samples of each brand of disposable prophylaxis angle were utilized. Vibration was measured with a <b>height</b> <b>gauge</b> and running motor; noise was measured with a sound meter and heat rise was measured from 68 °F on the head and body of the disposable prophylaxis angles, and torque required to destroy the gear was measured with a torque gauge. Means, standards deviations, standard errors, and coefficients of variation were computed for each of the variables tested. Results revealed that four of the brands tested (in alphabetical order) perform reliably when considering vibration, noise, heat rise, and torque: Denticator, Teledyne Getz, and Young Dental. The Ash/Dentsply had significant heat rise in the head and body. Both the Ash/Dentsply and Brahler disposable prophylaxis angles demonstrated significant vibration...|$|R
