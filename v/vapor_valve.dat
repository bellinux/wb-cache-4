40|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance testing of Zeolite adsorption cooling system driven by low grade waste heat source extracted from prime mover's exhaust, power plant's exhaust and the solar energy. The adsorbent FAM Z 01 {{is used as}} an adsorbent in the adsorption chiller facility. Owing to its large equilibrium pore volume, it has the high affinity for the water vapor adsorbate. The key advantages of the Zeolite adsorption cooling system are: (i) it has no moving parts rendering less maintenance, (ii) the energy efficient means of cooling by the adsorption process with a low temperature heat source, (iii) the use of vapor pipes are replaced by self actuating <b>vapor</b> <b>valves</b> rendering smaller footprint area and (iv) it is environmental friendly with low carbon footprint. The experimental investigations were carried out for Zeolite adsorption chiller at different key operating conditions namely (i) heat source temperature, (ii) the cycle time and (iii) the heat recovery time. It is investigated that performance of coefficient (COP) of this system {{could be as high}} as 0. 48 while the waste heat source temperature is applicable as low as 55 °C. © 2012...|$|R

40|$|U. S. Patent 6, 142, 151 {{describes}} a dual-bed ventilation {{system for a}} space suit, with emphasis on a multiport spool valve that switches air flows between two chemical beds that adsorb carbon dioxide and water <b>vapor.</b> The <b>valve</b> is used to alternately make the air flow through one bed while exposing the other bed to the outer-space environment to regenerate that bed through vacuum desorption of CO 2 and H 2 O. Oxygen flowing from a supply tank is routed through a pair of periodically switched solenoid valves to drive the spool valve in a reciprocating motion. The spool valve equalizes the pressures of air in the beds and the volumes of air flowing {{into and out of}} the beds during the alternations between the adsorption and desorption phases, in such a manner that the volume of air that must be vented to outer space is half of what it would be in the absence of pressure equalization. Oxygen that has been used to actuate the spool valve in its reciprocating motion is released into the ventilation loop to replenish air lost to vacuum during the previous desorption phase of the operating cycle...|$|R
40|$|A {{document}} {{describes a}} sheet membrane spacesuit water membrane evaporator (SWME), {{which allows for}} the use of one common water tank that can supply cooling water to the astronaut and to the evaporator. Test data showed that heat rejection performance dropped only 6 percent after being subjected to highly contaminated water. It also exhibited robustness with respect to freezing and Martian atmospheric simulation testing. Water was allowed to freeze in the water channels during testing that simulated a water loop failure and <b>vapor</b> backpressure <b>valve</b> failure. Upon closing the backpressure valve and energizing the pump, the ice eventually thawed and water began to flow with no apparent damage to the sheet membrane. The membrane evaporator also serves to de-gas the water loop from entrained gases, thereby eliminating the need for special degassing equipment such as is needed by the current spacesuit system. As water flows through the three annular water channels, water evaporates with the vapor flowing across the hydrophobic, porous sheet membrane to the vacuum side of the membrane. The rate at which water evaporates, and therefore, {{the rate at which the}} flowing water is cooled, is a function of the difference between the water saturation pressure on the water side of the membrane, and the pressure on the vacuum side of the membrane. The primary theory is that the hydrophobic sheet membrane retains water, but permits vapor pass-through when the vapor side pressure is less than the water saturation pressure. This results in evaporative cooling of the remaining water...|$|R

This procedure applies to any vapor emissions associated with the dispensing of any fluid, although it is written to reflect application to the hydrocarbon vapors associated with the dispensing of gasoline. 1. 2 Determinations of Compliance and Violation Determinations of certain modes of compliance with and violation of certification specifications is outlined in § 9. 1. 3 Modifications Modification of this procedure may be necessary for vapors and fluids other than the hydrocarbon vapors associated with the dispensing of gasoline. Any modification of this method shall be subject to approval by the ARB Executive Officer. 2 PRINCIPLE AND SUMMARY OF TEST PROCEDURE Upon completion of loading operations at the bulk gasoline distribution facility, the gasoline cargo tank is pressurized, with nitrogen, to 18 inches water column. By using the total cargo California Air Resources Board March 17, 1999 TP- 204. 2, Page 1 tank shell capacity, post-loading headspace volume, and the Ideal Gas Law, a one-minute maximum allowable pressure decay is calculated. The pressure decay is monitored for one minute and compliance is determined by comparison with the maximum allowable calculated value. The leak rate through the cargo tank internal <b>vapor</b> vent <b>valve</b> is similarly obtained. ...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{control valves}} may {{experience}} localized cavitation {{when the local}} static pressure drops to the liquid vapor pressure. Localized damage to the valve and surrounding area can occur when the <b>vapor</b> cavity collapses. <b>Valve</b> designs that reduce cavitation are based on empirical evidence and accumulated experience, {{but there are still}} considerable cavitation problems in industry. Valve designers may use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate cavitation in flow control valves, but model validation is challenging because there are limited data of local cavitation from the valve surface. Typically, the intensity of cavitation in a control valve is inferred from measurements of observable side effects of cavitation such as valve noise, vibration, or damage to the valve assembly. Such an indirect approach to characterizing cavitation yields little information about the location, degree, and extent of the cavitation flow field {{that can be used in}} CFD validation studies. This study uses 3 D X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to visualize cavitation from a 5. 1 cm diameter butterfly valve and compares the resulting vapor cloud to that predicted by CFD simulations. Qualitative comparisons reveal that the resulting cavitation structures are captured by the simulations when a small amount of non-condensable gas is introduced into the fluid and the simulations are completed in a transient mode...|$|R
40|$|For future lunar extravehicular {{activities}} (EVA), {{one method}} under consideration for rejecting crew and electronics heat involves evaporating water through a hydrophobic, porous Teflon(Registered Trademark) membrane. A Spacesuit Water Membrane Evaporator (SWME) prototype using this membrane was successfully tested by Ungar and Thomas (2001) with predicted performance matching test data well. The above referenced work {{laid the foundation}} for the design of a compact sheet membrane SWME development unit for use in the Constellation System Spacesuit Element Portable Life Support System (Vogel and et. al., ICES 2008). Major design objectives included minimizing mass, volume, and manufacturing complexity while rejecting a minimum of 810 watts of heat from water flowing through the SWME at 91 kg/hr with an inlet temperature of 291 K. The design meeting these objectives consisted of three concentric cylindrical water channels interlaced with four water vapor channels. Two units were manufactured for the purpose of investigating manufacturing techniques and performing thermal testing. The extensive thermal test measured SWME heat rejection as a function of water inlet temperatures, water flow-rates, water absolute pressures, water impurities, and water vapor back-pressures. This paper presents the test results and subsequent analysis, which includes a comparison of SWME heat rejection measurements to pretest predictions. In addition, test measurements were taken such that an analysis of the commercial-off-the-shelf <b>vapor</b> pressure control <b>valve</b> could be performed...|$|R
40|$|The Europa {{mission and}} {{spacecraft}} design presented unique challenges for selection of valve seat materials that met the fluid compatibility requirements, and combined fluid compatibility and high radiation exposure level requirements. The Europa spacecraft pressurization system valves {{will be exposed}} to fully saturated propellant vapor {{for the duration of}} the mission. The effects of Nitrogen Tetroxide (NTO) and Monomethylhydrazine (MMH) propellant <b>vapors</b> on heritage <b>valve</b> seat materials, such as Vespel SP- 1 and Polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE), were evaluated to determine if an alternate material is required. In liquid system applications, Teflon is the only available compatible valve seat material. Radiation exposure data for Teflon in an air or vacuum environment has been previously documented. Radiation exposure data for Teflon in an oxidizer environment such as NTO, was not available, and it was unknown whether the effects would be similar to those on air-exposed samples. Material testing was conducted by Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) to determine the effects of propellant vapor on heritage seat materials for pressurization valve applications, and the effects of combined radiation and NTO propellant exposure on Teflon. The results indicated that changes in heritage pressurization valve seat materials' properties rendered them unsuitable for the Europa application. The combined radiation and NTO exposure testing of Teflon produced results equivalent to combined radiation and air exposure results...|$|R
40|$|Thermally coupled {{distillation}} {{arrangements with}} dividing-wall implemen- tation provide significant energy and capital savings compared to energy intensive conventional distillation arrangements. In this thesis, {{the focus is}} to study control and operation of such arrangements for three and four product separation. The study comprises of mainly simulation study for the Petlyuk arrangements while for the four-product Kaibel arrangement, simulation as well as experimental works are reported. The first contribution deals with selecting control structures for a three- product Petlyuk (dividing-wall) column. Alternate control structures are considered, with and without the vapor split as a degree of freedom. This work also demonstrates {{the usefulness of the}} graphical Vmin diagram to visualize minimum boilup requirement and choose the appropriate control structure. Next, for a four-product Kaibel column separating methanol, ethanol, propanol and n-butanol, a start-up procedure and steady state operation is demonstrated using experimental setup. A control structure with four temperature controllers is used for control and it can handle feed rate dis- turbances as well as setpoint changes. The experiment data also compares well with an equilibrium stage model. Dividing-wall distillation columns offer large potential energy savings over conventional column sequences, typically up to 30 % for three-product (Petlyuk) columns and 40 % for four-product (Kaibel) columns. However, the energy required for a separation depends on using an optimal vapor split. Hence, the energy saving potential may be lost if the column is operated away from its optimal point, for example, due to feed composition changes. The following work demonstrates experimentally that the vapor split can be effectively used as a degree of freedom during operation for example, for temperature control in the prefractionator section. Together with an adjustable liquid split, the vapor split control allows for minimizing the energy requirements. Finally, a control study on a four-product extended Petlyuk column op- erating close to minimum energy is reported. The study assumes an “ideal” case with all steady state degrees of freedom available for control, including the <b>vapor</b> split <b>valves,</b> which is required to achieve minimum energy under all conditions. Four decentralized control structures are proposed and tested against a wide range of disturbances. This work demonstrates again the use of the graphical V min tool which can be used to visualize the minimum boilup requirement for four-product Petlyuk arrangements.

5000|$|Sickels {{obtained}} a patent for this invention, {{which he called}} 'Manner of constructing the apparatus for lifting, tripping, and regulating the closing of valves of steam engines' on March 20, 1842 (U.S. patent number 2631). Thurston (1878:317) relates [...] "It was introduced by the inventor in a form which especially adapted it to use with the beam-engine used on the Eastern waters of the United States, and was adapted to stationary engines by Messrs. Thurston, Greene & Co., of Providence, R. I., who made use of it for some years before {{any other form of}} [...] "drop cut-off" [...] came into general use. The Sickels cut-off consisted of a set of steam-valves, usually independent of the exhaust-valves, and each raised by a catch, which could be thrown out, at the proper moment, by a wedge with which it came in contact as it rose with the opening valve. This wedge, or other equivalent device, was so adjusted that the valve should be detached and fall to its seat when the piston reached that point in its movement, after taking steam, at which expansion was to commence. From this point, no steam entering the cylinder, the piston was impelled by the expanding <b>vapor.</b> The <b>valve</b> was usually the double-poppet.". As described by Somerscales (1990:283) it was 'a quick-closing valve gear using poppet valves, and a trip gear to control the cut-off ... with gravity assisted closure ... Sickels used a water-filled dashpot to decelerate the valve smoothly as it approached the end of its travel.'. [...] The device was not applied to the slide valve, which later became so ubiquitous in steam engines, but to poppet valves (also known as 'puppet valves' and 'drop valves'). These were first used by Watt for his beam engines in the 1770s or 1780s. Watt had fitted two conical valves to the upper steam passage to the steam cylinder and two to the lower passage. This is well illustrated in the text by Lardner (1840). [...] This arrangement of two such valves per steam passage was described as the 'double-beat', 'balanced' or 'equilibrium' poppet valve by various authors (see e.g. Clark 1891). [...] A schematic of equilibrium poppet valves appears in Buchanan and Watkins (1976) reproduced with further discussion in connection with Sickels by Somerscales (1990). However to reiterate, it is not the double poppet valve that can be attributed to Sickels, but a particular manner of its operation.|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 211 In {{order to}} ensure safe, reliable, {{efficient}} and cost effective operation of reciprocating pumps, pump dynamics should not be ignored. Pump problems due to dynamics are often difficult to diagnose and solve. Dynamic problems usually lie {{in one or more}} of the following areas: *Pulsation control (piping acoustics) *Vibration control (piping mechanics) *Cavitation control (pulsation and pressure drop) *Pump valve dynamics (valve motion). All the areas can be interactive to such an extent that it is difficult to know where the most effective changes can be made. A clear summary of each area will be presented with a view towards understanding how these areas can interact. The topic will be approached from an engineering perception viewpoint (a spectral energy response overlay) with minimal emphasis on mathematical concepts. Following the energy as it transfers though the whole system reveals how inefficient energy transfer and local energy magnification (resonance) is key to understanding how to prevent or solve everyday problems. Problems such as vibration, bladder failure, valve failure, poor performance, fatigue failure, and safety concerns are usually linked to one or more dynamic areas. Along with a basic understanding of the physics involved in pump dynamic areas, it is also helpful to have a working knowledge of ?rule of thumb? techniques that can be reliable and extremely cost effective. Pulsation control will be viewed using mechanical analogies with cause and effect scenarios. Vibration control will be focused on reducing the shaking force through reducing acoustic-to-mechanical coupling mechanisms, instead of brute force mechanical modifications. Cavitation and NPSHR (the inlet pressure required to prevent cavitation) problems will be viewed from a simple understanding of local instantaneous pressure compared to <b>vapor</b> pressure. <b>Valve</b> dynamics will be viewed in terms of simple fluid pressure forces, as they are exerted on a pressure controlled valve element. This engineering perception has a firm theoretical foundation but requires only fundamental mathematics to employ. Two short case histories will be presented illustrating pulsation/vibration control, cavitation control and pump valve problems. In almost all cases, piping vibration is the result of pulsation coupling into mechanical shaking forces yielding vibration with possible fatigue failures. Pump manifolds and external piping can be modified to ensure nonresonant acoustic systems that greatly reduce vibrational force. Once the shaking force is reduced, it remains to ensure that mechanical resonance is not present. Although cavitation is generally thought to be pressure drop related, in many cases it can be traced to acoustical resonances associated with the pump manifold and connected piping. Pump valve problems are generally solved through increasing spring stiffness, decreasing lift and employing more rugged materials. The use of newly developed materials has had the tendency of appearing as a universal fix where high pulsation levels can be tolerated. The best solution for many valve problems is reducing the pulsations that induce excessive impact forces. The use of a spectral energy response overlay or window is a concept that is in use by many who deal with dynamic problems. This type of approach is easily understood, but not as rigorous as the actual model approach. It should become apparent that most design quality can be determined by the overlay approach. It is not intended to replace the full model, but it will produce a good initial starting design and form the basis for analyzing existing field problems...|$|R
