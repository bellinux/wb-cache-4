40|$|The {{literature}} on the optimization of container terminal logistics has recently focused on space assignment and equipment management within the yard sub-system. Yet, to our knowledge, no models have been proposed for housekeeping, i. e. the process according to which a container is moved from one yard position to another during its stay in the terminal’s storage area. Housekeeping has only been addressed as a conceptual choice lying behind yard operating rules when dealing with empirical investigations for intelligent yard stacking. Here we propose a queuing-based representation of the current housekeeping process in a real container terminal and solve it by discrete-event simulation to i) assess {{the efficiency of the}} housekeeping operations under unforeseen events or process disturbances and ii) estimate the related productivity and waiting phenomena which, in turn, affect the <b>vessel</b> <b>turn-around</b> <b>time.</b> Sample results returned by the simulator are presented to illustrate possible usage via scenario analysis. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract An agent based {{simulator}} {{for evaluating}} operational {{policies in the}} transshipment of containers in a container terminal is described. The simulation tool, called SimPort, is a decentralized approach to simulating managers and entities in a container terminal. Real data from two container terminals are used as input for evaluating eight transshipment policies. The policies concern the sequencing of ships, berth allocation, and stacking rule. They are evaluated {{with respect to a}} number of aspects, such as, <b>turn-around</b> <b>time</b> for ships and traveled distance of straddle carriers. The simulation results indicate that a good choice in yard stacking and berthing position policies can lead to faster ship <b>turn-around</b> <b>times.</b> For instance, in the terminal studied the Overall-Time-Shortening policy offers fast <b>turn-around</b> <b>times</b> when combined with a Shortest-Job-First sequencing of arriving ships...|$|R

40|$|This work aims to {{estimate}} multiple node {{positions in the}} presence of unknown <b>turn-around</b> <b>times</b> within the context of cooperative sensor network localization. In the adopted scheme, each target can communicate with a set of anchors (probably not in sufficient numbers) and a set of other targets. Two-Way Times-of-Arrival between them are measured, which includes unknown processing delays at both channel endpoints. Since finding the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) of the positions and <b>turn-around</b> <b>times</b> given those measurements poses a difficult nonconvex optimization problem, it is approximated by a Nonlinear Least Squares problem. Then, the positions and <b>turn-around</b> <b>times</b> of multipletargets are estimated jointly by solving an Euclidean Distance Matrix completion problem. Simulations show that the localization accuracy of the proposed method is good, providing an initial point that subsequently enables MLE to attain the Cram´er-Rao Lower Bound for all considered scenarios...|$|R

Of particular interest, is the contribution of road transport infrastructures and systems to the magnitude of <b>turn-around</b> <b>time,</b> port performance and general economic growth and development. This is true and significant for developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, where transport systems are poorly developed and sparsely integrated; but the economies are import oriented. The port’s rates of capacity utilisation was determined over a period 14 years (1990 to 2007) and a study of ship traffic was done for 156 vessels calling at the port and 19, 296 loaded road vehicles leaving the port between 1 December, 2006 and 31 March, 2007. The result showed that over-utilisation of road transport resulted in under-utilisation of several port infrastructures, port congestion; longer <b>turn-around</b> <b>time</b> and general poor performance of the port. The need for a well-integrated transport system was therefore underlined...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} single node positioning in cooperative network using hybrid two-way time-of-arrival and time-difference-of-arrival where, the <b>turn-around</b> <b>time</b> at the target node is unknown. Considering the <b>turn-around</b> <b>time</b> as a nuisance parameter, the derived maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) brings a difficult global optimization problem due to local minima in the cost function of the MLE. To avoid drawbacks in solving the MLE, we obtain a linear two-step estimator using non-linear pre-processing which is algebraic and closed-form in each step. To compare different methods, Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived. Simulation results confirm that the proposed linear estimator attains the CRLB for sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
