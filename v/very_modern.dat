25|$|Self-Portrait with Palette (French: Autoportrait à la palette) is an 1878–79 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by the French artist Édouard Manet. This late impressionistic work {{is one of}} his two self-portraits. Velasquez's self-portrait in Las Meninas was a particular inspiration for Manet's painting which despite its allusion to the previous artist's work is <b>very</b> <b>modern</b> in its focus upon the personality of the artist and loose paint handling.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the two}} newest {{terminal}} {{buildings at}} the airport, Terminal A West has a <b>very</b> <b>modern</b> and innovative design, made by Kohn Pedersen Fox, Pierce Goodwin Alexander & Linville and Kelly/Maiello.

25|$|Zawinul, {{along with}} other Davis sidemen Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock, {{was one of the}} first to use {{electric}} pianos and early synthesizers like the ARP 2600 in 1973's Sweetnighter. He was also among the first to use an electric piano, the Wurlitzer. He used the Fender-Rhodes thereafter, adding a wah-wah pedal and later the Mutron effect unit for a complex phased timbre. His creativity and attention to detail resulted in a <b>very</b> <b>modern</b> sound. He also played the kalimba on Weather Report's albums Mysterious Traveller and Mr. Gone.|$|E
25|$|There {{is almost}} nothing {{occurring}} {{most of the}} time but unison melodies and very lengthy drone basses, which is all very Armenian. It is also <b>very</b> <b>modern</b> indeed in its elegant simplicity and adamant modal integrity, being, in effect, as tight and strong in its way as a twelve-tone work of the Austrian type. There is no harmony either, and the brilliance and excitement of parts of the piano concerto were due entirely to vigor of idea. It really takes a sound musicality to invent a succession of stimulating ideas within the bounds of an unaltered mode and without shifting the home-tone.|$|E
25|$|Narmada River's inland {{access to}} central and {{northern}} India {{and with a}} location in the sheltered Gulf of Khambhat {{in the era of}} coastal sea travel grew and prospered as a trading transshipment centre and ship building port. Until <b>very</b> <b>modern</b> times the only effective way to move goods was by water transport, and Bharuch had sheltered waters in an era without weather forecasting, compasses, and when shipping was necessarily limited to coastal navigation, and the general East-West course of the Narmada gave access to the rich inland empires at {{the upper reaches of the}} Narmada, including easy caravan access to the Ganges valley and the plains of Delhi.|$|E

25|$|In 1873 the {{railroad}} was running six locomotives, which all were running on coal. Three {{of them were}} new and three were converted from wood. On June 18, 1873, Roswell Pettibone Flower became president of {{the railroad}}. Even through the depression the railroad was kept into good shape and investments were being made. The railroad remained a <b>very</b> <b>modern</b> one. Plans for further extensions were put aside, and focus was on improving the lines already present. 56 Pound steel was replacing iron rails. The best iron rails were being used to relay yards and sidings. Also the branches were improved with the old iron rails. In 1879 all passenger cars were equipped with air brakes.|$|E
25|$|The Sanatorium of Bellevue (1857–1980), which {{occupied}} {{part of the}} old monastery, {{played an}} important role in the history of Kreuzlingen. In 1842, Ignaz Vanotti from Constance bought a large tract of land and built a residential and commercial building in 1843 to house the emigrant press of Bellevue, which had previously been located in Römerburg. In 1857, Ludwig Binswanger, a psychiatrist from Münsterlingen acquired the property and opened a private sanatorium. The clinic was <b>very</b> <b>modern</b> and remained in the control of the Binswanger family for nearly 120 years. Important psychiatric advances, particularly under the founder's grandson, also called Ludwig Binswanger, especially in the development of existential psychotherapy, were made at the sanatorium. However, few of its buildings remain.|$|E
25|$|The {{architectural}} {{style of the}} Belle Époque was eclectic and sometimes combined elements of several different styles. While the structures of the new buildings were resolutely modern, using iron frames and reinforced concrete, the façades ranged from the Romano-Byzantine style of the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur on Montmartre, to the strange neo-Moorish Palais du Trocadéro, to the neo-Renaissance style of the new Hôtel de Ville, to the exuberant reinvention of French classicism of the 17th and 18th centuries in the Grand Palais, Petit Palais and Gare d'Orsay, decorated as they are with domes, colonnades, mosaics and statuary. The most innovative buildings of the period were the Gallery of Machines at the 1889 exposition and the new railroad stations and department stores: their classical exteriors concealed <b>very</b> <b>modern</b> interiors with large open spaces and large glass skylights {{made possible by the}} new engineering techniques of the period. The Eiffel Tower shocked many traditional Parisians, both because of its appearance and {{because it was the first}} building in Paris taller than the cathedral of Notre-Dame.|$|E
50|$|The P.108 was an all-metal, four-engine bomber, {{with a crew}} of eight. It had a <b>very</b> robust <b>modern</b> {{structure}} (with a six g tolerance) {{designed by}} Giovanni Casiraghi, and built almost entirely of duralumin.|$|R

25|$|The {{conservation}} measures undertaken in Bhutan {{to preserve and}} conserve the cranes are unique; in fact more and more crane habitat areas are being brought under the protected area concept. The Royal Society for Protection of Nature (RSPN) established in 1987, which has the mandate for conservation and nature education {{has been involved in}} monitoring the winter visitors to the Phobjika valley and other habitats such as Bomdeling Valley. According to recorded information, 141 cranes visit Bomdeling valley (Phobjika reports a count of about 400 now) every year. RSPN has a Visitor Centre at the Phobjikha Valley, which provides information on cranes and the environment of the valley. The information Centre is a <b>very</b> <b>modern</b> decagonal building, next to a stream, with high-tech equipment. There is an observatory for birdwatchers, a mini theatre with mural painting with narration. The center staff provides services such as narration, facilitation and presentation of the valley and cranes in Bhutan. The Society has also produced a documentary (1989 : On the wings of prayer and 2014: Heavenly Bird with A german TV comapny) film on the cranes visiting Bhutan every year. Further, in Phubjika the Observation Towers have been so located that they cause the least disturbance to the crane habitats. Tourists are allowed to observe the cranes through the two or three high tech “spotting telescopes’’ and spotted on the watch the behaviour of the crane as described in the RSPN pamphlet titled “Field Guide to Crane Behaviour”, from a safe distance under the strict supervision of forest officials. Farmers are also advised to replace the barbed wire fencing with wooden and stone fencing to reduce harm to the cranes. Collisions with powerlines cause mortality to many crane species and when electricity was to be provided to the valley, the power cables were laid underground to avoid any mortality. The work was taken up during summer when the birds do not use the area.|$|E

500|$|During 1824–28 Chopin {{spent his}} {{vacations}} away from Warsaw, {{at a number}} of locales. In 1824 and 1825, at Szafarnia, he was a guest of Dominik Dziewanowski, the father of a schoolmate. Here {{for the first time he}} encountered Polish rural folk music. His letters home from Szafarnia (to which he gave the title [...] "The Szafarnia Courier"), written in a <b>very</b> <b>modern</b> and lively Polish, amused his family with their spoofing of the Warsaw newspapers and demonstrated the youngster's literary gift.|$|E
