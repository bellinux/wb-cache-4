50|$|The DIP switch with <b>sliding</b> <b>levers</b> {{was granted}} US Patent 4012608 in 1976. It {{was applied for}} 1974 and was used in 1977 in an ATARI Flipper game.|$|R
5|$|From {{literary}} sources it {{is known}} that the collapsible umbrella was invented during Wang Mang's reign, although the simple parasol existed beforehand. This employed <b>sliding</b> <b>levers</b> and bendable joints that could be protracted and retracted.|$|R
50|$|The take-down lever {{is used to}} {{lock the}} slide back (as the Browning Hi-Power safety is used) during {{disassembly}} to allow removal of the <b>slide</b> release <b>lever.</b> In later variants, this lever is omitted and the slide must be manually aligned to remove the <b>slide</b> release <b>lever.</b> Once the <b>slide</b> and frame are aligned (by the disassembly lever or manually), the recoil guide is pulled forward to release the <b>slide</b> release <b>lever</b> {{and allow it to}} drop free. The slide will then be free to run forward and be removed from the frame.|$|R
40|$|Laparoscopic {{tools are}} 1 st order <b>sliding</b> <b>levers</b> which are {{inserted}} through a port in the abdominal wall while the workspace is viewed remotely on a visual display (Fig. 1). The physical properties of laparoscopic tools require surgeons to learn complex visuomotor mappings which vary with port position. When port position is changed, different limb movements and forces {{are required to}} elicit the same visual outcome...|$|R
5000|$|ETRS: A {{modification}} introduced July 1982, ETRS {{production discontinued}} September 1989. Unnamed change to original ETRS model. Lens release <b>sliding</b> <b>lever</b> latch located to {{left side of}} camera side panel, film-backs released using two independent tabs. This version is reputedly {{referred to as the}} [...] "plastic" [...] body ETRS and film-back, for the change in the side panels of the body and film-backs to polycarbonate.|$|R
50|$|In November 1937, several {{substantial}} {{design changes}} were made. The bolt was redesigned to cock on opening, the safety {{was changed to}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>lever</b> {{on the right-hand side}} of the receiver, the prominent rear cocking piece was eliminated, and the barrel was given a constant-diameter round contour rather than the previous slightly tapered contour, increasing the weight of the rifle slightly. The trigger mechanism also incorporated an internal screw adjustment, allowing the owner to adjust the trigger pull weight to some degree. The improved rifle was designated as the Model 69A.|$|R
50|$|The {{overall design}} is {{slightly}} different from earlier SIG Sauer pistols such as P220 or P226, {{as there is}} no separate disassembly lever on the frame and the <b>slide</b> stop <b>lever</b> looks quite different.|$|R
5000|$|Safeties: <b>Slide</b> mounted {{decocking}} <b>levers.</b> Loaded chamber indicator. Firing-pin safety. Slide retention device.|$|R
50|$|The FNS {{series of}} the pistols all include ambidextrous {{magazine}} releases, and <b>slide</b> stop release <b>levers.</b>|$|R
50|$|These devices vary {{significantly}} between firearms but {{may occur}} {{in the form of}} a small protrusion or hook from the side of the bolt, a pumped <b>slide</b> or <b>lever.</b> The <b>slide</b> in a pistol performs similar actions as a cocking handle.|$|R
50|$|The {{lightweight}} barrel is chrome lined {{and manufactured}} by the hammer forging {{process at the}} Beretta factory in Gardone Val Trompia, Lombardy. Barrel lengths for this rifle are 16 in (40.6 cm) for its standard barrel, and a 12 in (30.48 cm) barrel for special operators. The flash hider has 5 radial cuts and 4 smaller cuts to control muzzle climb in automatic firing. Barrels have a 1:7 twist to fire NATO standard ball and tracer rounds. The non-free-floated barrel is easily removed simply by pulling on <b>slide</b> <b>levers</b> and pulling it out. A bayonet lug, designed for the Extrema Ratio Fulcrum bayonet is positioned above the barrel rather than underneath it.|$|R
50|$|The P250 was {{designed}} to be ambidextrous in handling, sporting an ambidextrous <b>slide</b> catch <b>lever</b> and user reversible magazine catch. All other operating controls are designed so they can be operated from either side. The firearm can be field stripped with no tools.|$|R
50|$|The {{stripping}} pin is {{retained in}} the frame when pushed to the side to strip and is separate from the slide lock, as on the Megastar. The <b>slide</b> lock <b>lever,</b> magazine release and other features are reminiscent of the Megastar as well.|$|R
5000|$|Hand-held {{umbrellas}} {{have some}} type of handle, either a wooden or plastic cylinder or a bent [...] "crook" [...] handle (like the handle of a cane). Umbrellas are available in a range of price and quality points, ranging from inexpensive, modest quality models sold at discount stores to expensive, finely made, designer-labeled models. Larger parasols capable of blocking the sun for several people are often used as fixed or semi-fixed devices, used with patio tables or other outdoor furniture, or as points of shade on a sunny beach. The collapsible/folding umbrella, the direct predecessor to the modern umbrella, originated in China. These Chinese umbrellas were internally supported with bendable, retractable, and extendable joints as well as <b>sliding</b> <b>levers</b> similar to those in use today.|$|R
50|$|The Inox models {{feature the}} {{following}} parts made in stainless steel: the barrel, the slide (including the extractor, {{the safety and}} the right-side manual safety lever), the trigger, the trigger pin, and <b>slide</b> stop <b>lever.</b> The aluminum frame is anodized to match the color. Can have either black or stainless controls.|$|R
5000|$|The dolmens {{were built}} from glacial erratics, with the gaps filled with red sandstone. Presumably, {{standing}} stones were {{transported to the}} site using rollers, <b>slides,</b> <b>levers</b> and ropes, and {{the interior of the}} unfinished dolmens was filled with clay to form a ramp to enable the movement of the cover stones into their final position. After removing the clay from the interior, a barrow (tumulus) was then raised on top of the dolmen, which remained accessible through a passage made from smaller stones. In addition, single standing stones were sometimes placed around the dolmen, forming either a rectangular or trapezoidal shape (Hünenbett), or a stone circle (Bannkreis). Sometimes, large singular [...] "guardian stones" [...] (Wächterstein, Bautastein) were placed adjacent to these shapes. The interior of the dolmen was usually divided into small compartments by slabs of red sandstone, standing upright.|$|R
2500|$|The Glock 17Pro {{version is}} {{produced}} {{exclusively for the}} Finnish market. It has these alterations from the standard Glock 17: [...] factory tritium night sights, an extended, threaded barrel, marine spring cups, modified magazine release, extended <b>slide</b> stop <b>lever</b> (factory standard in newer models), extended +2 magazine baseplates, [...] connector, and factory Glock pouch.|$|R
50|$|The lever {{tumbler lock}} uses {{a set of}} levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock. In its {{simplest}} form, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to <b>slide</b> past. <b>Lever</b> locks are commonly recessed inside wooden doors or on some older forms of padlocks, including fire brigade padlocks.|$|R
5000|$|The Glock 17Pro {{version is}} {{produced}} {{exclusively for the}} Finnish market. It has these alterations from the standard Glock 17: factory tritium night sights, an extended, threaded barrel, marine spring cups, modified magazine release, extended <b>slide</b> stop <b>lever</b> (factory standard in newer models), extended +2 magazine baseplates, 15.5 N connector, and factory Glock pouch.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we review and {{integrate}} {{a set of}} findings on learning the transformation of a <b>sliding</b> first-order <b>lever,</b> a type of tool with {{a prominent role in}} minimal access surgery. Its kinematic transformation is characterized by the so-called fulcrum effect, the inversion of the movement direction of the tip of the lever relative to that of the hand for rotations. A second characteristic is gain anisotropy, which results in curved paths of the tip of the lever for straight paths of the hand and vice versa. An internal model of the kinematic transformation is acquired during practice, the accuracy of which can be assessed in visual open-loop test trials. The accuracy of the acquired internal model is enhanced when visual closed-loop control during practice is impeded, and the accuracy of the internal model is reduced when closed-loop control during practice is facilitated. The internal model consists of a rapidly acquired line-symmetric approximation to the transformation of the <b>sliding</b> <b>lever</b> and a slowly acquired fine tuning. The fine tuning is local, that is, it is specific for the region of the workspace encountered during practice. The internal model is transferred to other regions of the workspace, but not adjusted to the fine tuning appropriate for these regions. Whereas the symmetry approximation is most likely explicit, the fine tuning seems to be represented implicitly. Findings on the straightness of the paths of the tip of the lever and the hand suggest that the internal model of the transformation is confined to initial and final positions of aimed movements, whereas their path is not strictly controlled, but affected by the dynamic transformation of the tool. Only when visual closed-loop control is possible, the path of the effective part of the tool is straightened. These characteristics of the internal model of the <b>sliding</b> first-order <b>lever</b> and its acquisition may be partly specific to sufficiently complex extrinsic transformations that arise from...|$|R
50|$|Walther {{modified}} the <b>slide</b> stop <b>lever</b> and an accompanying spring on the PPS pistols to improve reliability. Early PPS pistols {{can be modified}} but need an enlargement of {{a hole in the}} pistol gripframe before the new style slide stop and spring can be installed. For this the pistol has to be sent in to the Walther customer service.|$|R
40|$|In {{the modern}} society {{with a variety}} of {{information}} electronic devices, human interfaces increase their importance in a boundary of a human and a device. In general, the human is required {{to get used to the}} device. Even if the device is designed as a universal device or a high-usability device, the device is not suitable for all users. The usability of the device depends on the individual user. Therefore, personalized and customized human interfaces are effective for the user. To create customized interfaces, we propose rapid prototyping human interfaces using stretchable strain sensors. The human interfaces comprise parts formed by a three-dimensional printer and the four strain sensors. The three-dimensional printer easily makes customized human interfaces. The outputs of the interface are calculated based on the sensor’s lengths. Experiments evaluate three human interfaces: a sheet-shaped interface, a <b>sliding</b> <b>lever</b> interface, and a tilting lever interface. We confirm that the three human interfaces obtain input operations with a high accuracy...|$|R
50|$|The P320 was {{designed}} to be ambidextrous in handling, sporting an ambidextrous <b>slide</b> catch <b>lever</b> and user reversible magazine catch. All other operating controls are designed so they can be operated from either side. The firearm can be field stripped with no tools. Additionally, the firearm can also be field stripped without depressing the trigger, an additional safety feature to prevent negligent discharge of the weapon.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the very}} early GSPs were missing the <b>slide</b> stop <b>lever</b> which wasn't {{incorporated}} until the 1970s. The early model GSPs, from 1968 to 1977, had a manual safety catch {{on the left side}} of the frame. This feature was omitted in 1977 because it was an unnecessary feature on a competition pistol. Also throughout the years, the design of the ergonomic grips underwent several changes.|$|R
50|$|The M1951 {{is fed from}} an 8-round {{detachable}} box magazine. A hold open device {{will keep}} the slide locked open after discharging the last cartridge from the magazine. The slide can then be released by depressing the <b>slide</b> release <b>lever</b> located {{on the left side}} of the frame. The pistol uses fixed iron sights set for engaging targets at 50 m. These consist of a forward blade and rear notch.|$|R
25|$|The DS {{models are}} double action only pistols: the hammer doesn't stay cocked. Therefore the hammer spur has been removed, and is {{flush with the}} rear of the <b>slide.</b> The safety <b>levers</b> serve as manual safeties only and have no {{decocking}} feature..|$|R
50|$|The breech {{is opened}} by the {{breechblock}} moving in-line with {{the axis of}} the barrel and is locked in the closed position by an obstruction such as a cam, wedge, paw or over-centre levers. A roller lock is commonly associated with firarms produced by Heckler & Koch. This type of breechblock {{can be adapted to}} cycle by lever, cocking handle or gas. The mechanism is usually designs so that a single action unlocks and then withdraws the breechblock using either a <b>slide</b> or <b>levers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most basic}} clock {{thermostats}} may only implement one program with two periods (a hotter period and a colder period), {{and the same}} program is run day after day. More sophisticated clock thermostats may allow four or more hot and cold periods to be set per day. Usually, only two distinct temperatures (a hotter temperature and a colder temperature) can be set, even if multiple periods are permitted. The hotter and colder temperatures are usually established simply by <b>sliding</b> two <b>levers</b> along an analogue temperature scale, {{much the same as}} in a conventional (non-clock) thermostat.|$|R
5000|$|The Px4 Storm Compact {{is sized}} between the Full Size and the Subcompact models. It adopts the {{rotating}} barrel {{design of the}} full size pistols, but with a shorter and proportioned slide and grip. This model also introduces an ambidextrous <b>slide</b> stop <b>lever.</b> A high magazine capacity is maintained, with 15 rounds in 9 mm and 12 rounds in [...]40 S&W. The Px4 Storm Compact models accept the full size magazines as well, increasing capacity to 17 or 20 rounds in 9 mm and 14 or 17 rounds in [...]40 S&W.|$|R
40|$|For {{some types}} of visuo-motor transformations like large visuo-motor {{rotations}} or the complex transformation of a <b>sliding</b> first-order <b>lever,</b> distinct adaptive processes have been hypothesized that produce a rapid, discrete approximation of the transformation and a slow, graded fine tuning, respectively. Here we investigate whether part-task training of only the second of these processes, namely the fine tuning, transfers to the subsequent performance in a condition with the full transformation of the <b>sliding</b> first-order <b>lever.</b> Therefore, we compared performance of three groups with different practice conditions during transfer to the full transformation. While two groups only practiced the fine tuning without the right-left inversion of the lever prior to transfer, a third group practiced the full lever transformation. Our results show a positive, but less than perfect transfer of the isolated practice of the fine tuning on performance with the full transformation. For the fine tuning itself, transfer was not reliably different from being perfect. The observation that the fine tuning can be acquired separately and added to the later adaptation to the left-right inversion of the lever supports the notion that these slow and fast processes progress rather independently. The additional finding that the preceding acquisition of the fine tuning also facilitates the subsequent rapid process {{could be due to}} generalized learning-to-learn or to a more precise assignment of movement errors to the process from which they originate...|$|R
50|$|The CZ 75 {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It {{uses the}} Browning linkless cam locking system {{similar to that used}} in the Browning Hi-Power pistol, where the barrel and slide are locked {{together}} on firing, using locking lugs milled into the barrel mating with recesses in the roof of the slide. An enclosed cam track integral with the barrel is actuated by the <b>slide</b> release <b>lever's</b> transverse pin. After the first few millimetres of the recoil stroke, the barrel is cammed downwards at the rear, enabling the slide to continue the recoil stroke and eject the spent cartridge.|$|R
50|$|The Beretta 92G-SD and 96G-SD {{with the}} <b>slide</b> mounted {{decocking}} <b>lever</b> was quick into action, but somewhat less safe than a Beretta 92FS during unloading. The added advantages of night sights and an equipment rail {{made it an}} attractive home protection/law enforcement pistol. The barrel was made of stainless steel {{to protect it from}} wear and corrosion.|$|R
50|$|The lever frame at Stockport Junction was {{equipped}} with electro-pneumatic <b>slides</b> instead of <b>levers,</b> with electrical economising contacts located above them. The signalman wanted to cross a freight train travelling {{in the opposite direction}} behind the passenger train, but the points were locked by a track circuit until the passenger train was well clear of them.|$|R
25|$|The 1978 {{model year}} VAM Pacers gained new hood and grille designs, which in Mexico {{were just a}} {{facelift}} {{due to the lack}} of a V8 engine. The only technical difference of the year was the replacement of the Holley 2300 carburetor in favor of a Motorcraft 2150 unit with a built-in altitude compensator despite having a slightly lower flow. This took away a small amount of power but allowed easier passing of emission certification and was more reliable in changing altitudes. New standard features included a hood light, a speedometer in both kilometers and miles per hour, door panels including a vertical stripe pattern over their top edges, a different AM/FM radio model, a new flat-faced luxury steering wheel design with an AMC logo, and new seat designs. The heater was improved in the form of air vents appearing to the left of the instrument cluster, the center of the dashboard above the ashtray and over the top right corner of the glovebox door regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. The heater controls were revised, obtaining the VENT option in airflow selection, which was now a <b>sliding</b> <b>lever</b> instead of the five buttons used in the prior two years. The two remaining air vents, the passenger's side one over the top left corner of the glove box door and driver's side one integrated to the cover under the steering column, could only be obtained with the A/C system.|$|R
50|$|The PYa is a high-capacity, double-action, short-recoil {{semi-automatic}} pistol. Barrel/slide locking is {{a simplified}} Colt-Browning design, {{similar to that}} found in many modern pistols (for example the SIG Sauer and Glock families of pistols); the breech end of the barrel is rectangular in shape, rather than rounded, and fits into matching locking grooves within the slide, near the ejection port. The <b>slide</b> stop <b>lever</b> can be mounted {{on either side of}} the weapon to accommodate both left- and right-handed users. Likewise, the manual safety is ambidextrous, with safety catches on both sides of the weapon, where it is manipulated by the thumb. It is mounted on the frame, below the rear slide grooves, and directly behind the <b>slide</b> stop <b>lever.</b> The hammer is partially concealed at the sides to prevent catching on clothes and equipment. The magazine release catch is located in the base of the trigger guard on the left side, where it can be manipulated with the thumb (right-handed users) or index or middle finger (left-handed users). The front sight is formed as a fixed part of the slide and is non-adjustable. The back sight is drift adjustable for windage (dovetail type), but this requires a tool. Both feature white contrast elements to ease aiming in low-light conditions. The standard magazine capacity is 17 rounds, fed from a double-column, single feed magazine. Magazines with an 18 round capacity were produced after 2004.|$|R
50|$|Production of the T3 {{continued}} in South Africa until June 2002, when, {{due to the}} economies of scale, Volkswagen SA were obliged to discontinue production after parts supply started to become an issue. The South African T3s post 1991 had a face-lift which included modified front door sheet metal, bigger side windows behind the B pillars and different rear grilles in the D pillars. The bodyshell is a true RHD design lacking the unused door track cover on the offside and LHD wiper arm mount points as found on earlier models (which were originally designed as an adaptation of a LHD Twin-sliding door bodyshell). On models with 5-cylinder engines the boot floor was raised to accommodate the taller engine and has small storage areas {{either side of the}} engine hatch. Internal changes include a fully padded dashboard featuring a smaller glove box and updated vacuum-powered ventilation controls operated by round knobs rather than <b>slide</b> <b>levers,</b> the fuse box was also relocated to the right hand side of the steering column. At the front of the vehicle twin-headlamps in both round and rectangular configurations were fitted along with a full width lower grille incorporating the indicator lenses, which were changed from amber to smoked lenses from 1999 onwards, this grille and headlight combination was not found anywhere else in the world. These later South African T3s became known as Big Window T3s due to their larger side windows.|$|R
