25|$|Spanish orthography is the orthography {{used in the}} Spanish language. The {{alphabet}} {{uses the}} Latin script. The spelling is fairly phonemic, especially in comparison to more opaque orthographies like English and Irish, having a relatively consistent mapping of graphemes to phonemes; in other words, the pronunciation of a given Spanish-language word can largely be predicted from its spelling and to a slightly lesser extent <b>vice-versa.</b> Notable features of Spanish punctuation include the lack of the serial comma and the inverted question marks and exclamation points: ¿ ¡.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{impacting}} the ground, some translational {{kinetic energy}} {{can be converted}} to rotational kinetic energy and <b>vice-versa</b> depending on the ball's impact angle and angular velocity. If the ball moves horizontally at impact, friction will have a 'translational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's motion. In the figure, the ball is moving to the right, and thus it will have a translational component of friction pushing the ball to the left. Additionally, if the ball is spinning at impact, friction will have a 'rotational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's rotation. On the figure, the ball is spinning clockwise, and the point impacting the ground is moving to the left with respect to the ball's center of mass. The rotational component of friction is therefore pushing the ball to the right. Unlike the normal force and the force of gravity, these frictional forces will exert a torque on the ball, and change its angular velocity (omega&).|$|E

What's on TV {{announced}} the storyline in June 2009. About {{the beginning of the}} storyline, [...] "Hannah has gone off the rails of late, but even she manages to outdo herself when she and Darren tie the knot after a particularly boozy night in Denmark". Holy Soap said the wedding will leave fans [...] "stunned" [...] and described the pair as [...] "odd". Dawson said, regarding the sudden marriage, that [...] "Darren doesn’t suddenly fall in love with Hannah or <b>vice-versa.</b> It's just one of those mad, crazy things you do when you’ve had far too many drinks and your life is {{in a bit of a}} mess. They both regret it. They get home and their friends and families are horrified – especially Hannah's family".|$|E
500|$|A meter not {{displayed}} on screen is what many skilled players {{refer to as}} a [...] "dizzy threshold". This means if a player manages to land a given number of consecutive punches it will put the opponent into a brief [...] "dizzy" [...] or [...] "stunned" [...] animation. A [...] "dizzied" [...] or [...] "stunned" [...] opponent will appear very discombobulated {{for a short period}} of time (in which the match timer freezes temporarily) and the player has a small margin of opporitunity to achieve an instant knockdown with a well-timed knockout punch. Each of the 16 opponents varies in how much match time it takes to become [...] "dizzied", some more quickly than others and <b>vice-versa.</b> There are 2 opponents who can be KOd upon the 1st knockdown, however, a knockdown during a [...] "dizzy" [...] animation is critical in making this possible. There are 8 opponents who can be KOd in 2 knockdowns, however, the player must achieve the 2nd knockdown within 4 seconds of the 1st knockdown. Finally there are 6 opponents who the player must defeat via a TKO as the aforementioned 4 seconds between the 1st 2 knockdowns does not apply.|$|E
500|$|From the {{beginning}} of January 1883, Mahler became conductor at the Royal Municipal Theatre in Olmütz (now Olomouc) in Moravia. He later wrote: [...] "From the moment I crossed {{the threshold of the}} Olmütz theatre I felt like one awaiting the wrath of God." [...] Despite poor relations with the orchestra, Mahler brought nine (13 times) operas to the theatre, including the new Bizet's Carmen, and won over the press that had initially been sceptical to him. After a week's trial at the Royal Theatre in the Hessian town of Kassel, Mahler became the theatre's [...] "Musical and Choral Director" [...] from August 1883. The title concealed the reality that Mahler was subordinate to the theatre's Kapellmeister, Wilhelm Treiber, who disliked him (and <b>vice-versa)</b> and set out to make his life miserable. Despite the unpleasant atmosphere, Mahler had moments of success at Kassel. He directed a performance of his favourite opera, Weber's Der Freischütz, and 25 other operas. on 23 June 1884, he conducted his own incidental music to Joseph Victor von Scheffel's play Der Trompeter von Säckingen ("The Trumpeter of Säckingen"), the first professional public performance of a Mahler work. An ardent, but ultimately unfulfilled, love affair with soprano Johanna Richter led Mahler to write a series of love poems which became the text of his song cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen ("Songs of a Wayfarer").|$|E
2500|$|The Laws state that, {{throughout}} an innings, [...] "the ball {{shall be}} bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls". The name [...] "over" [...] {{came about because}} the umpire calls [...] "Over!" [...] when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a [...] "spell". The batsmen do not change ends {{at the end of}} the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and <b>vice-versa.</b> The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at [...] "square leg" [...] now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and <b>vice-versa.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In Quebec, the Civil Code {{goes further}} by specifying that [...] "keeping ... private life under {{observation}} by any means" [...] constitutes an additional ground of invasion of privacy. In Aubry v Éditions <b>Vice-Versa</b> Inc, the Supreme Court of Canada held that, because of that, supplemented by Quebec's Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms privacy provisions, a photographer can take photographs {{in public places}} but may not publish them unless permission has been obtained from the subject, except where the subject appears in an incidental manner, or whose professional success depends on public opinion.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} (between 11:00 and 11:15am), Alpha, Bravo {{and the six}} RMP's were within [...] of each other, but unable to {{communicate}} or group together; Alpha and Bravo Companies were completely unaware that the RMPs were even in the town and <b>vice-versa,</b> {{even though they had}} all gone through the same Ops Room that morning. An Army Air Corps (AAC) Gazelle helicopter was dispatched to act as a re-broadcast unit between Alpha, Bravo and the Ops Room. Critically, it had also been given orders for a fly-over of the police station to determine if the six RMPs were still there. At 11:05am, a Chinook with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) was deployed from Abu Naji to go into Majar al-Kabir and support Bravo Company.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{accounting}} sense, assets are recorded on the left-hand side (debit) of asset accounts, {{because they are}} typically shown on the left-hand side of the accounting equation (A=L+SE/OE). Likewise, an increases in liabilities and owner’s equity are recorded {{on the right-hand side}} (credit) of those accounts {{in order to maintain the}} balance of the accounting equation. This means if [...] "assets are increased with left-hand entries, the accounting equation is balanced only if increases in liabilities and owner’s equity are recorded on the opposite or right-hand side. Conversely, decreases in assets are recorded on the right-hand side of asset accounts, and decreases in liabilities and equity are recorded on the left-hand side". Similar is the case with revenues and expenses, what increases shareholder's equity is recorded as credit because they are in the right side of equation and <b>vice-versa.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions, Boards of Canada used {{a wide range}} of vintage hardware and equipment, including an effects unit [...] "that cost [...] {{a lot of time and}} road miles to source." [...] The band used minimal amounts of drum machine and samplers and used [...] "real live drumming and percussion", which was later [...] "woven into the rhythm tracks." [...] The recording process also included Eoin and Sandison [...] "throw tracks back and forward at each other." [...] Speaking of the process, Sandison said that [...] "sometimes we jam the core idea down as a take, or one of us will start something and hand it over, and <b>vice-versa.</b> There isn't really one method or any particular strength for either of us because it changes from track to track. We both write melodies but at the same time we're both technicians in some way, so the process is quite unpredictable and messy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{friendship}} between Zoe and Kelly Taylor (Brooke Kinsella) was a recurring storyline for both characters. In the British press, Kelly and Zoe {{were compared to}} two former popular characters, who also shared a close screen friendship, Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). Kinsella has commented, [...] "It is nice to be compared because they were great [...] but, hopefully, [...] and I will bring our own characters to light and show what we can do. We have so much in common and we balance each other out – when she's crazy I'll calm her down and <b>vice-versa.</b> It's worked well, which is why Kelly has been kept on, which is great for me but also for Michelle because she's got somebody to have fun with. Kelly's {{been one of the}} slowest developing characters and that's been good for me. I wasn't thrown into it and having Michelle has been great for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the courts' {{protection}} of procedural legitimate expectations assured individuals that decision-making processes were guided by fairness {{and thus the}} [...] "greater propensity for fairer decisions", in some circumstances a procedural right alone was insufficient for producing a fair outcome as [...] "procedure and substance are intertwined, with procedural rights reinforcing substantive ones, and <b>vice-versa</b> [...] ". The Schmidt case illustrates that the courts' {{protection of}} a procedural right inevitably leads to a substantive outcome. The plaintiffs here challenged a decision to refuse renewal of their residence permits {{on the grounds that}} they had not been given a hearing before the decision was reached. This argument was rejected as the original permits had been issued for only a certain time, which had since expired. However, Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, said that had the plaintiffs' residence permits been revoked before they expired, they [...] "would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for the permitted time". The Court of Appeal in effect envisaged procedural protection of a substantive expectation of being allowed to stay in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics on {{the record}} were {{described}} by the band members as [...] "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." [...] Vig said they tried to deal with [...] "dark themes that I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and [...] "the art of self-destruction." [...] Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, [...] "everybody has ideas that come to the table and I just use what I fancy. When we're working on something, the lyrics take a while to work on and [...] come to me and say 'I've had these ideas, use them if you want' and if there's something I like, I'll stick it in with my own, or <b>vice-versa.</b> Some people come in going 'I've got this great title for a song' and I might use that." [...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, I. S. O. Playfair, the British {{official}} historian {{wrote that}} {{the relationship of the}} [...] "battle for supplies" [...] with the land war reached a climax {{in the second half of}} 1942. Far from the Eighth Army capturing airfields to the west in the Cyrenaican bulge, it had been defeated at Gazala while Operation Julius was on and lost the landing grounds to the east. The disaster at Gazala had led to the military forces on Malta trying to save Egypt rather than <b>vice-versa.</b> MW11 had been a [...] "disappointing operation" [...] and turned back because the British and US air attacks on the Italian battlefleet had failed to inflict the damage hoped. Force A could not hope to defeat it in a surface action, a view echoed by Greene and Massignani in 2003. By the time that the Italian battleships had been ordered back, the convoy and escorts lacked the ammunition to continue and seven long-range Beaufighters had been lost, depriving Vigorous of air cover while beyond the reach of short-range fighters. Communications had been inadequate, with some signals taking too long to arrive but Playfair wrote that without airfields in the west of Cyrenaica, even quick and accurate reports would not have compensated. Six freighters in Vigorous and Harpoon had been sunk and nine forced to return to port. Two ships of Operation Harpoon reached Malta and delivered [...] of supplies, which with a decent harvest might keep the population of Malta fed until September but the depletion of aviation fuel led to fighters being give priority over the offensive force. Transit flights through Malta except for Beauforts was suspended, only close range air attacks on easy targets were to be permitted and fuel for the fighters was to be carried to Malta by submarine.|$|E

60|$|A most {{curious and}} {{interesting}} set of phenomena are those which often occur {{when a group}} of fishes, once marine, take by practice to inhabiting freshwater rivers; or, <b>vice-versâ,</b> when a freshwater kind, moved by an aspiration for more expansive surroundings, takes up its residence in the sea as a naturalised marine. Whenever such a change of address happens, it usually follows that the young fry cannot stand the conditions of the new home to which their ancestors were unaccustomed--we all know the ingrained conservatism of children--and so the parents are obliged once a year to undertake a pilgrimage to their original dwelling-place for the breeding season.|$|E
60|$|It was so {{annoying}} if you won, to {{be handed}} a number of green counters and be informed that they represented so many {{hundreds or thousands of}} pounds, or <b>vice-versa</b> if you lost, for as it cost no one anything, my dear father insisted upon playing for enormous stakes. Never in any aspect of life have I cared for fooling. Anscombe also disliked cards, I think because his ancestors too had played with counters, such as some that I have seen belonging to the Cocoa-Tree Club and other gambling places of a past generation, marked as high as a thousand guineas, which counters must next morning be redeemed in hard cash, whereby his family had been not a little impoverished.|$|E
60|$|In {{surveying}} the mass {{with a view}} to determining that point, his attention was arrested by {{what seemed to be a}} ring of shining metal immediately in front of his eyes. It appeared to him at first to surround some perfectly black substance, and it was somewhat more than a half-inch in diameter. It suddenly occurred to his mind that the blackness was simply shadow and that the ring was in fact the muzzle of his rifle protruding from the pile of débris. He was not long in satisfying himself that this was so--if it was a satisfaction. By closing either eye he could look a little way along the barrel--to the point where it was hidden by the rubbish that held it. He could see the one side, with the corresponding eye, at apparently the same angle as the other side with the other eye. Looking with the right eye, the weapon seemed to be directed at a point to the left of his head, and <b>vice-versa.</b> He was unable to see the upper surface of the barrel, but could see the under surface of the stock at a slight angle. The piece was, in fact, aimed at the exact centre of his forehead.|$|E

She was much amused when I told her that Aunt Susan (who lived, you will remember, in respectable indigence at Blackheath) had written to expostulate with me on my 'unladylike' conduct in becoming a bicycle commission agent. 'Unladylike!--the Cantankerous Old Lady exclaimed, with warmth. 'What does the woman mean? Has she got no gumption? It's [...] "ladylike," [...] I suppose, to be a companion, or a governess, or a music-teacher, or something else in the black-thread-glove way, in London; but not to sell bicycles for a good round commission. My dear, between you and me, I don't see it. If you had a brother, now, he might sell cycles, or corner wheat, or rig the share market, or do anything else he pleased, in these days, and nobody'd think the worse of him--as long as he made money; and it's my opinion that what is sauce for the goose can't be far out for the gander--and <b>vice-versâ.</b> Besides which, what's the use of trying to be ladylike?
