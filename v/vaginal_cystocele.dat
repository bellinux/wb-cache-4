40|$|A case of prolapsus uteri {{associated}} with cystocele vaginalis {{was reported in}} a 66 -year old woman. Though her chief complaint was itching pain at urethral orifice, which was due to caruncula, a <b>vaginal</b> <b>cystocele</b> was found with prolapsus uteri. Neither voiding difficulty nor urinary incontinence was complained of. Urethral caruncula was resected and transabdominal repair of cystocele was carried out. Repairing procedures included shortening of bilateral round ligaments and peritoneum to fix both pelvic organs at normal position and hitching the bladder serosa onto the pelvic wall. At this writing, almost 9 months after surgical intervention, she complains of no recurrence. Literature regarding lepair of the cystocele was reviewed and discussed briefly...|$|E

40|$|Urogenital organs statics {{disorders}} affect approximately 30 – 75 % of women; their incidence {{increases with}} age. Among various causes, the generally recognized ones are deliveries {{experiences in the}} past, excessive physical effort, age-related estrogen deficiency, previous treatment, including irradiation (brachytherapy) – mainly due to uterine tumors. Dysfunctions in statics usually involve two anatomically and developmentally related systems: the reproductive system and the urinary system. In gynecologic practice, the most common pathologies involve a lowering the anterior <b>vaginal</b> wall (<b>cystocele),</b> stress urinary incontinence and polyuria. Study encompassed 78 women, aged 50 to 76, 11 of whom experienced earlier endometrial cancer and nine of whom were also subjected to brachytherapy. In 63 women OB intravaginal tampons were applied for three months, covered with a gel or cream containing hyaluronic acid; in some of them additionally estriolcontaining ointment was applied twice a week. Some women (15) were exclusively recommended to do the Kegel exercises. Evaluation of stress urinary incontinence as well as polyuria and nocturia was conducted 3 and 6 months after tampons stopped to be applied. The application of tampons covered with hyaluronic acid-containing preparations was found to reduce significantly the symptoms of stress urinary incontinence and polyuria and the symptoms of cystocele. The presented method is simple and evidently effective...|$|R
50|$|Pelvic floor {{dysfunction}} can {{be diagnosed}} by history and physical exam, {{though it is}} more accurately graded by imaging. Historically, fluoroscopy with defecography and cystography were used, though modern imaging allows the usage of MRI to complement and sometimes replace fluoroscopic assessment of the disorder, allowing for less radiation exposure and increased patient comfort, though an enema is required the evening before the procedure. Instead of contrast, ultrasound gel is used during the procedure with MRI. Both methods assess the pelvic floor at rest and maximum strain using coronal and sagittal views. When grading individual organ prolapse, the rectum, bladder and uterus are individually assessed, with prolapse of the rectum {{referred to as a}} rectocele, bladder prolapse through the anterior <b>vaginal</b> wall a <b>cystocele,</b> and small bowel an enterocele.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Optimized {{biocompatibility}} of {{new materials}} {{is a major}} requirement for transvaginal meshes for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repair. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) presented good characteristics in prior animal experiments and clinical use in humans. Methods Between 01 / 2012 and 04 / 2016 37 women underwent transvaginal repair of symptomatic prolapse of the anterior <b>vaginal</b> wall (<b>cystocele)</b> with PVDF-mesh in a single institution. A chart review for recurrence, continence, peri- and early postoperative complications was performed. Referring practitioners were interviewed by telephone and mail. Additionally patient reported outcome and satisfaction were measured by Patient Global Improvement Inventory (PGI-I) scale. Results 34 women were eligible for a mean follow up of 19 months. The functional outcome improved significantly. One symptomatic vault prolapse (2. 9 %) and two reoperations for incontinence (5. 9 %) occurred. Two mesh exposures (5. 9 %) occurred and were treated conservatively. No other severe complications were registered. 87. 5 % of treated women felt very much better or much better and would undergo the surgery again. A cohort study including development steps {{in accordance with the}} IDEAL system is presented. Conclusions For the first time we report on effectivity and safety of transvaginal application of PVDF-mesh in real-life practice. A prospective long-term evaluation in a registry is justified. © 2017 IJS Publishing Group Lt...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the prognostic factors and long-term results on stress urinary continence of the Bologna procedure for bladder neck suspension in women undergoing vaginal repair for large cystocele. This was a cohort study and questionnaire-based outcomes analysis. Subjects were 218 women operated on between 1982 and 1992. Their mean age was 66 years. The Bologna vaginal wall sling was associated with vaginal hysterectomy in 199 cases and with posterior colporrhaphy in 202 cases. Median follow-up was 69 months. Of the 218 patients, 182 were continent at stress (83 %). The risk factors were low urethral pressure (< 30 cmH(2) O, RR = 2. 42), severity of preoperative stress urinary incontinence (RR = 2. 01 for grade I, 4. 03 for grade II and 8. 10 for grade III), and an exteriorized cystocele (RR = 0. 45). We concluded that the Bologna procedure allows bladder neck suspension during <b>vaginal</b> repair of <b>cystocele,</b> with good results on future continence...|$|R
40|$|We present {{our initial}} {{experience}} with the Perige™ System for correction of prolapse of the anterior vaginal wall. We recruited twenty patients with anterior vaginal prolapse, underwent a prosthetic operation using the Perigee System, which consists of a large-pore, monofilament polypropylene mesh and four lateral arms made of the same material, positioned via the transobturator foramen. This system permits simultaneous correction of central and lateral defects. Prolapse and therapeutic outcome were evaluated using the POP-Q system. The 20 patients were suffering from grade III cystocele. The follow-up was conducted after six weeks, three months, six months, twelve months and eighteen months.

The aim of this study was to determine if levator avulsion is a risk factor for prolapse recurrence following anterior colporrhaphy with mesh. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of data obtained from three surgical audits for subjective and objective outcomes following anterior colporrhaphy with mesh. Recurrence was defined as cystocele = Stage 2 on the prolapse quantification system of the International Continence Society; symptoms of <b>vaginal</b> lump/bulge; or <b>cystocele</b> on ultrasound, defined as maximum bladder descent to =? 10 ?mm below the symphysis pubis. Levator avulsion was diagnosed using tomographic ultrasound imaging. Results Two hundred and nine patients were followed up at a mean of 2. 2 ?years (range, 3 ?months to 5. 6 ?years) after anterior vaginal mesh placement. 24 % (51 / 209) had recurrent prolapse symptoms, 33 % (68 / 209) clinical cystocele recurrence = Stage 2, and 26 % (54 / 209) a recurrent cystocele on ultrasound. Twenty-eight out of 80 (35 %) women with levator avulsion had significant sonographic cystocele recurrence (odds ratio (OR), 2. 24 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 13 - 4. 43)). This finding was confirmed after adjusting for potential predictors of prolapse recurrence on multivariate logistic regression (OR, 2. 13 (95 % CI, 1. 04 - 4. 39); P = 0. 04).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} the incidence {{and types of}} utero-vaginal prolapse. METHODS: Retrospective medical records analyses of women who were subjected to reconstructive pelvic surgery for various types of pelvic relaxation at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi and the University Of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, Nigeria was carried out. The study was conducted from January 1996 to December 1999 during which there were 7515 surgical admissions. The inclusion criteria were those women who complained of feeling a mass in the vagina with demonAstrable descent of the anterior and/or posterior and/or apical vaginal walls and/or perineal descent. Excluded were patients who had other symptoms other than utero-vaginal prolapse and those whose grades and sites of prolapse were not determinable from the clinical or surgical notes. Also excluded were patients with nerve injury or disease, connective tissue disorders and neuromuscular diseases. The subjects {{were divided into two}} groups. Group I consisted of 54 women (age or = 40 years). The findings between those two groups were compared with reference to sites, types and degree of prolapse. Also, coexistence of pelvic relaxation and underlying medical conditions were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 159 subjects out of 492 charts studied met the inclusion criteria for the study. In group I, mean age was 32. 839 with a standard deviation (SD) of +/- 6. 012 years; and in group II the mean age was 56. 543 with a SD of 8. 094. Hypertrophic (elongated) cervix was determined in 15 (6. 3 %) subjects in group I for an incidence of 1. 58 % per year, <b>cystocele</b> (<b>vaginal</b> anterior wall descent) was present in 21 (8. 9 %) women for an incidence of 2. 2 % per year; rectocele (posterior vaginal wall descent) was identified in 15 (6. 3 %) women for an incidence of 1. 58 % per year; vaginal cough prolapse (apical descent) was present 21 (8. 9 %) women for an incidence of 2. 2 % per year. Perineal descent was absent in this group. In group II, there was no hypertrophic cervix; cystocele was present in 39 (16. 5 %) cases for an incidence of 4. 13 % per year; rectocele was identified in 27 (11. 4 %) women, amounting to an incidence of 2. 85 % per year; vaginal cough prolapse was present in 36 (15. %) women, an incidence of 3. 75 % per year; perineal descent was present in 63 (25. 6 %) women, for an incidence of 6. 4 % per year. CONCLUSION: (1) The incidence of hypertrophic cervix without any other abnormality amounted to 1. 58 % per year. This medical entity can present as uterine prolapse and was noted only in group I. (2) The annual incidence for hospital admission with a diagnosis of uterine prolapse was 2. 1 %. (3) The incidence of cystocele, and rectocele was not statistically different in the two groups; but the incidence of perineal descent and uterine prolapse were significantly more in group II than group I. (4) The etiology of hypertrophic cervix is not known, but it is of importance especially in the childbearing age when it may be related to prolonged pregnancy, cervical dystocia, etc...|$|R
