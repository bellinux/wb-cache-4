40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a nonlinear control system for a small four-rotor aerial robot, a so called quadrotor UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle). Stabilizing control of these vehicles is a difficult task because of the nonlinear dynamic behavior. The proposed control system is based on a decomposition into an inner attitude and an outer velocity control loop. For the attitude control, feedback linearization is applied that transforms the system into a decoupled linear system in state <b>variable</b> <b>format.</b> This resulting system is controlled via a conventional linear controller, leading to a sufficiently fast and damped closed loop dynamics. The outer control loop applies a nonlinear inversion to compensate a static nonlinearity and a linear control system to control the remaining linear dynamics. The advantage of the derived control system besides the excellent performance is the simple structure and the easy implementation...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of outliers in formatted datasets {{is a critical}} data quality issue, particular in the data review process. Having a long history, it culminated by Ronald Fehd establishing a set of powerful macros for performing range and logic checks on datasets and the writing of file exceptions to edit and use for updates. As {{a necessary condition for}} this approach, the existence of a properly written data dictionary containing the other=INVALID option for all format values is required. In practice, however, often one has to work with the formats that do not have the required structure, and, for various reasons, it is difficult to transform them in the form required. As a supplement to the established approach, we have created a macro that handles situations where the presence of the other=INVALID option is not obligatory in character, numeric regular and multi-label value formats. As an output of this macro, we obtain a table with the identifier(s), variable name, <b>variable</b> <b>format,</b> and an unformatted value, which can be used for future analysis...|$|E
40|$|Five {{optimization}} {{models are}} constructed for selecting an optimal subset of projects submitted for a statewide programming process. Our approach develops models {{that are consistent}} with user needs and appropriate for the assumptions used in the project prioritization process. Each of the models builds on a basic linear-programming formulation in which a maximization of benefits and minimization of costs is desired. The five models include the following: a priority index that provides a ranking of projects but does not directly facilitate trade-offs between project costs and the ranks (model 1); a model that incorporates a formal approach to making trade-offs between rank and cost (model 2); a model that explicitly includes policy objectives by setting a fixed goal for each objective (model 3); a model that includes a strict budget constraint in addition to requiring that funded projects equal or exceed a fixed goal for each policy objective (model 4); and finally, a model that combines the relative rankings and budgetary constraint (model 5). Models 2 - 5 are developed in both a continuous and integer <b>variable</b> <b>format,</b> thus generating nine optimization approaches. Models 4 and 5 also introduce a method for determining the improvement in the overall transportation-system performance, given the current budget and decision-maker objectives.

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factors}} (FGFs) {{represent}} a family structurally related growth factors that promote {{a wide range}} of biological effects by interacting with different FGF receptors (FGFRs) in target cells. Among the different FGFRs, FGFR 1 is expressed by various tumor cell types as well as by tumor endothelial cells and plays a prominent role in both tumor cell and stromal cell compartments of the neoplastic tissue by mediating tumor angiogenesis, growth and invasiveness. Humanized antibodies in single-chain fragment <b>variable</b> <b>format</b> (scFv) are antibody fragments with improved pharmacokinetics for tissue penetration and can be easily conjugated allowing their use as cytokine, radionuclide, or drug carriers. Our group identified scFv_RR-C 2 as a neutralizing recombinant scFv antibody specific for the extracellular domain of the FGFR 1. We screened a human single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody phage display library against the extracellular domain of the FGFR- 1 -IIIc isoform that harbors the FGF binding site. Several phages were isolated and tested for specificity and sensitivity, and the most promising antibody fragment RR-C 2 was characterized for its biochemical and biological properties. ScFv RR-C 2 specifically recognizes FGFR- 1 with a Kd value of 150 nM. The antibody fragment also recognizes FGFR- 1 when the receptor is exposed on the cell surface, thus preventing the formation of the ternary complex among FGFR- 1, its ligand FGF 2, and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Accordingly, scFv RR-C 2 specifically inhibits FGF 2 -mediated mitogenic activity in endothelial cells of human, bovine, and murine origin in a nanomolar range of concentrations. Also, the antibody fragment prevents FGF 2 -triggered sprouting of both human umbilical vein endothelial cell spheroids and of murine endothelium from aortic rings, and hampers the angiogenic activity exerted both by FGF 2 in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay and by S 115 mouse mammary tumor cells in the Matrigel plug assay. Indeed, anti-FGFR 1 scFv fragment specifically impairs the proliferation triggered by FGF/FGFR 1 autocrine and paracrine loops of stimulation in murine models of prostate (TRAMPC 2), melanoma (B 16 -F 10) and lung cancer (3 LL). The antibody-mediated anti-FGFR 1 therapy will target both tumor endothelium, overcoming resistance to anti-VEGF-targeting therapy, and FGFR 1 -expressing cancer cells. Forthcoming experiments will provide novel scFv antibodies endowed with more potent targeting and neutralizing activity against FGFR 1...|$|E
