40|$|The {{control of}} {{supersonic}} aircraft presents a difficult problem because {{the variation in}} aerodynamic parameters over the range of flight conditions encountered is too great to be compensated for by conventional techniques It is generally recognized {{that the problem is}} basically nonlinear in nature, and the usual procedure is to use some type of nonlinear compensation to permit self adaptation within the system „ Most of the schemes which have been proposed to date are reviewed here in considerable detail 9 and it is seen that the mechanization required is rather complex The basis for a proposed study is then developed In essence it consists of the use of active networks in the autopilot to provide complex zero compensators which confine the excursions of roots during parameter variation to acceptable areas on the s-plane The proposed mechanization is simple, and {{it may be possible to}} reduce self adaptation to the status of a <b>vernier</b> <b>adjustment,</b> or eliminate it entirely.

40|$|Adiposity {{is one of}} {{the main}} health {{problems}} encountered worldwide and is associated with severe illnesses. Adequate therapies for long-term weight reduction are currently unavailable. Thus, identifying the specific causal mechanisms of obesity is necessary in order to detect the level to intervene. Energy homeostasis is centrally regulated in the hypothalamus by specific ligands and their receptors. For example, G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to have an important role in energy consumption and expenditure. However, the specific mechanisms through which GPCRs influence energy homeostasis remain unclear. In general, 50 % of pharmacological drugs target GPCRs; therefore, GPCRs constitute ideal sites of actions to implement specific interventions targeting pathophysiological processes. Among other receptors, the melanocortin- 3 receptor (MC 3 R), the melanocortin- 4 receptor (MC 4 R) and the ghrelin receptor (GHSR) are involved in the hypothalamic regulation of appetite. The objective of this thesis was to analyze potential protein-protein interactions between these receptors as well as their influence on signaling properties. To do this, several molecular biological methods were used to identify the presence of interactions and to quantify the signaling properties. Experiments using specifically designed MC 4 R chimeras indicated that the signaling characteristics of an MC 4 R-homodimer (two interacting receptor monomers) differ to those of monomers, and possible interaction points between two monomers was detected. One main result of this research is that there is a mutually opposite influence of the signaling capacity between MC 3 R and GHSR: as the capacity of the MC 3 R strongly increases, the GHSR capacity is inhibited. Furthermore it was shown that the GHSR and MC 3 R also interact with the orphan G-protein coupled receptor 83 (GPR 83). Finally, during interactions with the GPR 83, signaling capacity is inhibited for the GHSR whereas it is significantly enhanced for the MC 3 R. These studies demonstrate that different hypothalamic localized GPCRs assume mutual interactions (homo- and/or heterooligomers) and directly influence each other’s functionality. This means that previous models depicting interactions between these receptors under singular examination are not supported, and that a more complex function and regulation process in vivo could exist. Furthermore, it was shown that the interplay between different ligands and receptors, as well as their mutual interactions, could provide a more detailed pattern of the <b>vernier</b> <b>adjustment</b> of energy homeostasis than previously known models. This finding is a prerequisite for the development of pharmacological agents simultaneously targeting, for example, two interacting GPCRs. Such compounds could not only be more efficient, but could also have enhanced tissue specificity resulting in a reduction of side-effects...|$|E
2500|$|The {{trajectory}} of the bullets is very steep, which makes for a very short point-blank range.

5000|$|Rifles {{from the}} late 19th century often {{featured}} one of two types of aperture sight called a tang sight or a ladder sight. Since the black powder used in muzzleloaders and early cartridges was not capable of propelling a bullet at high velocity, these sights had very large ranges of vertical adjustments, often {{on the order of}} several degrees, allowing very long shots to be made accurately. The [...]45-70 cartridge, for example, was tested by the military for accuracy at ranges of up to 1500 yards, which required 3 degrees of elevation. Both ladder and tang sights folded down when not in use to reduce the chance of damage to the sights. Ladder sights were mounted on the barrel, and could be used as sights in both the folded and unfolded states. Tang sights were mounted behind the action of the rifle, and provided a very long sight radius, and had to be unfolded for use, though rifles with tang sights often had open sights as well for close range use. Tang sights often had <b>vernier</b> scales, allowing <b>adjustment</b> down to a single minute of arc over the full range of the sight.|$|R
