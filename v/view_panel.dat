We present a learning method based on using so-called living pictures [1]. The method deals with the goal, to put interactive teaching modules to the Internet {{that can be used}} in a lecture as well as for individual self-studies. The core of the teaching concept presented are JAVA-applets (interactive modules) running on any browser connected to the Internet. We call this type of applet "Living Pictures". The program for representing “living pictures ” for teaching Digital Test is written in Java 1. 3 [2]. It can be run over network, using standard browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer with Java 1. 3 runtime plug-in, or with Java 1. 3 applet viewer. The program can be used for teaching the basics of testing digital systems, test generation, fault simulation and fault diagnosis.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} that home owners are {{about twice as}} likely as renters to participate in the stock market in the USA and Sweden. Given this fact, the goal of the paper is to study the effect of home ownership and home purchases on stock market participation. The paper presents evidence that the effect of home ownership per se is only small or even absent, whereas a wealth effect can explain most of the gap in participation rates between renters and home owners. Difference in difference estimates on a Swedish panel data set suggests that the short-run (treatment) effect of a home purchase on stock market participation is negative. The analysis of a carefully calibrated life-cycle model that abstracts from possible sources of unobserved heterogeneity between renters and home owners supports this <b>view.</b> <b>Panel</b> estimates on model-generated data indicate a relatively small positive home ownership effect on stock market participation. Finally, the model shows that frictions in the housing market have an ambiguous effect on stock market entry- less severe frictions can either stimulate or preven...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to fi nd out what {{is the effect of}} {{different}} types of government spending and taxes on economic growth in developed economies. The analysis is performed on a sample of 27 OECD countries in the period 1997 – 2011. It is based on the neoclassic growth model extended with the level of human capital and fi scal variables. Those include particular types of government spending (according to the COFOG classifi cation) and taxes (according to the OECD classifi cation), and state budget defi cit. From a methodological point of <b>view,</b> <b>panel</b> data estimation is used. We support the view that only some types of government spending are growth-enhancing, and only if they are fi nanced through indirect taxes. However, the results show that only expenditure on defense, education and health, and general public services may be labeled as productive. In addition, we show that direct taxes, especially corporate taxes, negatively affect the growth, also in case they are used to fi nance productive spending. Web of Science 63331630...|$|E
40|$|Ethical {{controversy}} over transplantation of human fetal tissue has arisen because {{the source of}} tissue is induced abortions. Opposition to such transplants {{has been based on}} various arguments, including the following: rightful informed consent cannot be obtained for use of fetal tissue from induced abortions, and fetal tissue transplantation might result in {{an increase in the number}} of abortions. These arguments were not accepted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research Panel. The majority opinion of the panel stated that abortion and fetal tissue use are entirely separate issues, and that tissue use is ethically acceptable because it can be morally insulated from the issue of abortion. In support of this <b>view,</b> <b>panel</b> members and others have replied to the arguments put forward by opponents of fetal tissue use. However, replies to the two arguments mentioned above have been unsatisfactory, and the shortcomings of those replies are identified herein. Examination of the arguments pro and con suggests that fetal tissue use cannot be completely insulated from the issue of abortion. Thus, in seeking an ethical justification for fetal tissue transplantation we must consider reasons other than those put forward by the NIH panel. In this paper it is argued that whatever wrong is involved in using fetal tissue from induced abortions must be balanced against the benefits for patients, and it is on this basis that fetal tissue transplantation can be ethically justified...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To {{facilitate}} efficient {{selection and}} the prioritization of candidate complex disease susceptibility genes for association analysis, increasingly comprehensive annotation tools {{are essential to}} integrate, visualize and analyze vast quantities of disparate data generated by genomic screens, public human genome sequence annotation and ancillary biological databases. We have developed a plug-in package for Ensembl called "Statistical Viewer" that facilitates the analysis of genomic features and annotation in the regions of interest defined by linkage analysis. Results Statistical Viewer is an add-on package to the open-source Ensembl Genome Browser and Annotation System that displays disease study-specific linkage and/or association data as 2 dimensional plots in new panels {{in the context of}} Ensembl's Contig View and Cyto View pages. An enhanced upload server facilitates the upload of statistical data, as well as additional feature annotation to be displayed in DAS tracts, in the form of Excel Files. The Statistical <b>View</b> <b>panel,</b> drawn directly under the ideogram, illustrates lod score values for markers from a study of interest that are plotted against their position in base pairs. A module called "Get Map" easily converts the genetic locations of markers to genomic coordinates. The graph is placed under the corresponding ideogram features a synchronized vertical sliding selection box that is seamlessly integrated into Ensembl's Contig- and Cyto- View pages to choose the region to be displayed in Ensembl's "Overview" and "Detailed View" panels. To resolve Association and Fine mapping data plots, a "Detailed Statistic View" plot corresponding to the "Detailed View" may be displayed underneath. Conclusion Features mapping to regions of linkage are accentuated when Statistic View is used in conjunction with the Distributed Annotation System (DAS) to display supplemental laboratory information such as differentially expressed disease genes in private data tracks. Statistic View is a novel and powerful visual feature that enhances Ensembl's utility as valuable resource for integrative genomic-based approaches to the identification of candidate disease susceptibility genes. At present there are no other tools that provide for the visualization of 2 -dimensional plots of quantitative data scores against genomic coordinates {{in the context of a}} primary public genome annotation browser. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. Constrained {{electrical}} power {{systems and the}} long lead times ne eded for new capacity necessitate interim demand side management measures such as t ime-of-use (TOU) pricing. This form of electricity pricing {{has the potential to}} reduce system peak demand and thus improve the efficiency of power systems. Such time differenti ated pricing mechanisms have been used successfully in the industrial and commercial secto rs to shift demand out of the peak periods but have yet to be implemented in the residential sector in South Africa (SA). TOU schemes are based on the cost of supply and reflect, in part, the changes in short-run marginal costs. In contrast the conventional residential tariffs in SA are based on flat rate structures and recover long-run costs only. The analysis of the impact of such schemes, for both the utility as well as the customers, is gaining importance once more, particularly when most utilities are contemplating the implementation of smart s ystems and advanced metering infrastructures and the costs associated with this. A recent TOU pilot project, HomeFlex, is analysed from an ec onometric point of <b>view.</b> <b>Panel</b> data sets for both treatment groups and the control group ar e obtained from the pilot project database for each customer in two separate experiments in two separate geographic areas. The Caves and Christensen approach is used and the const ant elasticity of substitution functional form is chosen. Conditioning variables such as daily consumpti on per customer as well as climate effects are included in the ordinary lea st squares regression in order to establish the relationship between peak and off-peak consumption and the extent of the substitutability of these two commodities. The elasticity of substitution estimates obtained for stage 1 of the analysis range from 0. 339 to 0. 384. The conditioning variables enter the analysis as modifie rs to the estimates but their effect is insignificant. The stage 2 estimates range from 0. 457 to 0. 518. The effect of the conditioning variables is also statistically insignificant at this stage. The effect of the daily and weekly price ratio is therefore the primary factor in det ermining the response of customers to TOU pricing in the HomeFlex project...|$|E
