40|$|Objective: Lane {{departure}} crashes {{account for}} {{a significant proportion of}} passenger car occupant fatalities and serious injuries. Utilizing real-world data involving fatal passenger car crashes in Sweden, the characteristics of lane departure crashes were identified and the safety potential of lane departure warning (LDW) systems was quantified. Methods: The material consisted of 104 in-depth studies of fatal passenger car crashes in 2010. The crashes were classified as single-vehicle (n = 48), head-on (n = 52), and overtaking (n = 4) crashes. These crash types were identified as crashes that could have potentially involved lane departure. A case-by-case analysis was carried out and lane departure crashes were identified and characterized using police reports and information collected by crash investigators at the Swedish Transport Administration; for example, inspections and photographs of the crash sites and of the involved vehicles. Lane departure crashes were separated from crashes where loss of control occurred pre-lane departure. Furthermore, loss of control post-lane departures were identified. When studying the pre-stage of lane departure without prior loss of control, crashes were categorized as unintentional drifting, intentional lane change, or evasive maneuver. Using previously published effectiveness information, the potential for LDW systems to prevent crashes was estimated. Results: Of all crashes with passenger car occupant fatalities in Sweden in 2010, 46 % (63 / 138) were found to relate to lane departure without prior loss of control. These crashes accounted for 61 % (63 / 104) of all single-vehicle, head-on, and overtaking crashes. The remaining 41 crashes were due to loss of control pre-lane departure. Unintentional drifting accounted for 81 % (51 / 63) of all lane departure crashes without prior loss of control, which corresponded to 37 % (51 / 138) of all fatal passenger car occupant crashes. LDW systems were found to potentially prevent 33 - 38 of the 100 fatal head-on and single vehicle crashes. These crashes involved drifting and occurred on roads with <b>visible</b> <b>lane</b> <b>markings,</b> signed posted speed limits 70 km/h, and without rumble strips on the corresponding lane departure side. The range of potentially prevented crashes (33 - 38) is due to the inclusion or exclusion of crashes involving excessive speeding. Conclusions: In this study, approximately half (51 / 100) of all head-on and single-vehicle crashes were identified as being a consequence of drifting, where LDW systems had the potential to prevent the majority (33 - 38) of these crashes. The typical lane departure crash without prior loss of control occurred on undivided roads in rural areas with signed posted speed limits 70 km/h, where the center and side road markings were visible...|$|E

In this paper, for satisfying the quickness and precision requirement of recognizing <b>lane</b> <b>markings,</b> a novel vision-based <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> detection and recognition method, which mainly comprise of two steps, is proposed. The first step of which is to roughly determine the ROI of <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> by means of projection, while the next is to precisely detect <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> by combining Hough transform with the least square method to fit straight-line. Large amounts of experiment indicate that the proposed method can rapidly and precisely recognize <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> from sequential images...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Road scene {{analysis}} is a challenging {{problem that has}} applications in autonomous navigation of vehicles. An inte-gral component of this system is the robust detection and tracking of <b>lane</b> <b>markings.</b> It is a hard problem primarily due to large appearance variations in <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> caused by factors such as occlusion (traffic on the road), shadows (from objects like trees), and changing lighting conditions of the scene (transition from day to night). In this paper, we address these issues through a learning-based approach using visual inputs from a camera mounted {{in front of a}} vehicle. We propose, (i) a pixel-hierarchy feature descriptor to model contextual information shared by <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> with the surrounding road region, (ii) a robust boosting algorithm to select relevant contextual features for detecting <b>lane</b> <b>markings,</b> and (iii) particle filters to track the <b>lane</b> <b>markings,</b> without the knowledge of vehicle speed, by assuming the <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> to be static through the video sequence and then learning the possible road scene variations from the statistics of tracked model parameters. We investigate the effectiveness of our algorithm on challenging daylight and night-time road video sequences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Within {{the past}} few years, lane {{detection}} technology has become of high interest {{in the field of}} intelligent vehicles; however, robustness is still an issue. The challenge is to extract the <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> effectively from the complex urban environment. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on Random Finite Set Statistics for estimating the position of <b>lane</b> <b>markings.</b> We rely on Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filtering and apply this technique to lane marking extraction in urban environment. Our method is based on two phases: an image preprocessing phase to extract pixels that potentially represent lanes and a tracking phase to identify <b>lane</b> <b>markings.</b> Compared to other approaches, our method presents a recursive filtering algorithm which extracts <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> in the presence of clutter and non-lane markings.

40|$|We {{describe}} an algorithm by which an autonomous land vehicle {{is able to}} navigate along roads utilising <b>lane</b> boundary <b>markings.</b> This is achieved by defining a six-parameter model of the <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> and fitting this to the processed monochrome image using non-linear least squares techniques. By qualitative as well as quantitative analysis over many hundreds of images the model used is shown to be justified, resulting in a very robust method, finding <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> to sub-pixel accuracy. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{effect of}} the {{steerable}} filter on edge extraction depends on {{the accuracy of the}} lane orientation. Common edge detectors identify the local maxima of intensity changes as the orientation [1, 4]. Occasionally, however, boundary <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> may not be as dominant as other road features under shadows. The local features of <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> follow a clear global distribution pattern in road scene images. We prefer identifying the local edges at each pixel location according to the high-level information (vanishing point) on the <b>lane</b> <b>markings.</b> A local edge extraction algorithm, called the vanishing point-based steerable filter, is proposed. The implementation of the algorithm is summarized as follows.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{and robust}} lane detection, {{especially}} the curve lane detection, is {{the premise of}} lane departure warning system and forward collision warning system. In this article, an algorithm based on improved river flow and random sample consensus is proposed to detect curve lane under challenging conditions including the dashed <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> and vehicle occlusion. The curve lanes are modeled as hyperbola pair. To determine the coefficient of curvature, an improved river flow method is presented to search feature points in the far vision field guided {{by the results of}} detected straight lines in near vision field or the curved lines from the last frame, which can connect dashed <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> or obscured <b>lane</b> <b>markings.</b> As a result, it is robust on dashed <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> and vehicle occlusion conditions. Then, random sample consensus is utilized to calculate the curvature, which can eliminate noisy feature points obtained from improved river flow.

40|$|<b>Lane</b> <b>markings</b> (arrows) at {{individual}} intersections serve as interfaces to connect {{upstream and downstream}} intersections in signal-controlled networks. Demand flows from origins to destinations may need to pass {{through a series of}} intersections. If <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> are not well established to ban turns at intersections, then paths connecting origin and destination (OD) pairs could be inefficient. Due to indirect connections, road users need to take longer paths to reach their destinations. Conventionally, network configurations are fixed inputs for network analysis. In the present study, concepts of the lane-based designs for individual signalized intersections are extended for signal-controlled network designs. Taking OD demand flows as inputs, the proposed algorithm will optimize all <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> and assigned <b>lane</b> flows on approach lanes. Paths (flows) will then be optimized by linking up the optimized <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> across upstream and downstream intersections. Traffic signal settings {{at individual}} intersections will be optimized simultaneously by maximizing the reserve capacity for the entire OD demand flow matrix. The problem is formulated as a Binary-Mixed-Integer-Linear-Program (BMILP) and a standard branch-and-bound routine is applied to solve for global optimum solutions. A numerical example using a 4 -intersection network will be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design methodology...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of road markings has many practical applications, such as advanced driver assistance systems, road maintenance and accurate GPS navigation. In this {{paper we propose}} an algorithm to detect and recognize road markings from panoramic images. Our algorithm consists of four steps. First, an inverse perspective mapping {{is applied to the}} panoramic image, and the potential road markings are segmented based on their intensity difference compared to the surrounding pixels. Second, we extract the distance between the center and the boundary at regular angular steps of each considered potential road marking segment into a feature vector. Third, each segment is classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Finally, by modeling the <b>lane</b> <b>markings,</b> previous false positive detected segments can be rejected based on their orientation and position relative to the <b>lane</b> <b>markings.</b> Our experiments show that the system is capable of recognizing 93 %, 95 % and 91 % of striped line segments, blocks and arrows respectively, as well as 94 % of the <b>lane</b> <b>markings...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently, a lane-based {{optimization}} {{method was}} developed {{for the design of}} isolated signal-controlled junctions. The <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> are relaxed as binary-type control variables and are integrated into the design framework, in which the <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> and signal settings can be optimized simultaneously to maximize the overall junction performance. To take into account the time-varying effects of traffic demand, the lane-based optimization method has been enhanced to cater for multi-period demand patterns. To eliminate ambiguity, only a single set of <b>lane</b> <b>markings</b> (also referred to as the permitted movements) can be established on the ground for operation throughout all of the design periods, which implies that during various design periods road users that approach a junction will be guided by the same set of <b>lane</b> <b>markings.</b> In accordance with the specific traffic conditions in different design periods, road users can make their own choice of traffic lane for turning, provided that they do not violate the permitted movement patterns. In the present formulation, the actual lane utilization patterns are referred to as the effective movements. A set of linear constraints is developed to relate all of the lane-based control variables and to prescribe the feasible solution region. The optimization for the usual objective function is formulated as a mathematical program. Standard and heuristic solution methods are derived, and numerical examples are also given for demonstration...|$|R
