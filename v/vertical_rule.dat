The ice pile model {{can be interpreted as}} a discrete time dynamical system under the action of a vertical and a horizontal evolution rule, whereas the sand pile model is characterized by the unique action of the <b>vertical</b> <b>rule.</b> The signed partition extension, besides these two dynamical evolution rules, also takes into account an annihilation rule at the boundary region between the non-negative and the non-positive regions. We provide an original physical interpretation of this model as a p-n junction of two semiconductors. Moreover, we show how the sand pile extension of the signed partition environment can be formalized by mean of a non-uniform cellular automaton (CA) since the vertical and the annihilation evolution rules have the formal description of two CA local rules.

40|$|Even to {{the casual}} observer, there is {{evidence}} that, {{in the last ten}} to twelve years, the Catholic Church has undergone and is undergoing a process of rapid and considerable change. While there is clearly a basis of continuing belief and unchanged "essentials", the Catholic Church now experiences new forms of theology, new attitudes, new expressions of authority, new styles of worship, new teaching methods; and among the fruits of this change has been the growth of new forms of shared responsibility. In a society accustomed to a vigorous and <b>vertical</b> <b>rule</b> of law, the emergence or re-emergence of such bodies as the College of Bishops, Diocesan Councils, Priests Senates and the Parish Pastoral Councils has produced new possibilities - and naturally enough, new problems. It would be misleading to suggest that the existence of these bodies amounts to a total democratisation of the Church, but the change from single to shared responsibility in many fields is a significant reality and one which provides a fascinating field of research for the social scientist.

40|$|Traditional {{accounts}} {{of international law}} in domestic courts focus on the distinction between monist and dualist legal systems. In monist systems, courts apply international law directly. In dualist systems, direct application is not an option, so courts apply international law indirectly, or not at all. Although this account is formally correct, it tells us {{very little about the}} functional role of domestic courts in the international legal system. In this chapter, we present a functional account that focuses on the distinctions among horizontal, vertical, and transnational legal obligations. Modern international law regulates horizontal relationships between states, vertical relationships between states and private parties, and transnational relationships between private parties whose interactions cross state lines. The role of domestic courts in interpreting and applying international law varies greatly, depending on whether the international rule at issue is horizontal, vertical, or transnational. We demonstrate in this chapter that the willingness (or ability) of courts to apply international law—that is, the decision that a particular issue is “legal” as opposed to “political”—depends heavily {{on the nature of the}} international legal rule. Domestic courts rarely interpret or apply horizontal rules. Indeed, they often refer to treaties that regulate solely the horizontal relationship between states as “political” in nature. As a result, implementation of horizontal obligations typically involves executive, not judicial action. This is true for both monist and dualist states. In contrast, domestic courts routinely interpret and apply transnational rules, and executive branch officials play little or no role in implementing such rules. (Purely private law treaties such as the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods provide a clear example.) Again, this is true for both monist and dualist states. It is more difficult to generalize about the role of domestic courts in interpreting and applying <b>vertical</b> <b>rules,</b> such as human rights treaties. However, the classic monist-dualist distinction does a poor job of explaining why domestic courts in some countries apply <b>vertical</b> <b>rules</b> aggressively, while domestic courts in other countries are reluctant to apply <b>vertical</b> (international) <b>rules</b> to regulate the conduct of government officers. It is in this dimension, therefore, that we seek to draw special insights into how particular political relationships may affect the willingness of domestic courts to implement international law in domestic law, and to effect legal change on their own initiative. This chapter draws on materials from approximately two dozen countries to present an account of the role of domestic courts in interpreting and applying horizontal, transnational, and <b>vertical</b> international legal <b>rules...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{particularly}} effective method for analyzing document images, that consist {{of large numbers}} of bi-nary pixels, is to generate reduced images whose pixels represent enhancements of textural densities in the full-resolution image. These reduced images are generated using an integrated combination of filter-ing and subsampling. Previously reported methods used thresholding over a square grid, and cascaded these threshold reduction operations. Here, the approach is generalized to a sequence of arbitrary filter-ing/subsample operations, with emphasis on several particular filtering operations that respond to salient textural qualities of document images, such as halftones, lines or blocks of text, and horizontal or <b>vertical</b> <b>rules.</b> As with threshold reductions, these generalized “textured reductions ” are performed with no regard for connected components. Consequently, the results are typically robust to noise processes that can vitiate analysis based on connected components. Examples of image analysis and segmentation operations using textured reductions are given. Some properties can be determined very quickly; for example, the existence or absence of halftone regions in a full page image can be established in about 10 milliseconds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The <b>vertical</b> {{association}} <b>rules</b> mining {{algorithm is}} an efficient mining method, which {{makes use of}} support sets of frequent itemsets to calculate the support of candidate itemsets. It overcomes the disadvantage of scanning database many times like Apriori algorithm. In vertical mining, frequent itemsets can be represented {{as a set of}} bit vectors in memory, which enables for fast computation. The sizes of bit vectors for itemsets are the main space expense of the algorithm that restricts its expansibility. Therefore, in this paper, a proposed algorithm that compresses the bit vectors of frequent itemsets will be presented. The new bit vector schema presented here depends on Boolean algebra rules to compute the intersection of two compressed bit vectors without making any costly decompression operation. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, Vertical Boolean Mining (VBM) algorithm is better than both Apriori algorithm and the classical <b>vertical</b> association <b>rule</b> mining algorithm in the mining time and the memory usage.

40|$|Association rule mining {{is one of}} the {{important}} concepts in data mining domain for analyzing customer’s data. The association rule mining is a process of finding correlation among the items involved in different transactions. Traditionally association rule mining is implemented horizontally. For this we have plenty of different algorithms in research like Apriori based, FP tree based so on. Recently we have a new method in association rule mining which generates <b>vertical</b> association <b>rules.</b> In horizontal association rule mining we read transaction items record by record basis and computes support of each frequent item or candidate item. We repeat this process to generate frequent item sets. The <b>vertical</b> association <b>rule</b> mining evaluates support frequency of each item column wise. For this it uses bitmap matrix that saves support sets of frequent item sets in memory which is used to calculate candidate item sets. The Item are read from Data set using BitMap Matrix format which uses 1 or 0 to represent {{the presence or absence of}} item in record. In our system it is proposed to combine both horizontal mining and vertical mining in generating association rules. The horizontal and vertical mining are implemented in parallel using multithreading concept. For this we propose a modified parallel multithreaded Apriori algorithm. The algorithm saves time and decreases memory space as th...|$|R

40|$|Several {{articles}} in TUGBOAT have demonstrated methods of drawing simple graphics using dots and horizontal or <b>vertical</b> <b>rules.</b> UTEX provides a complex environment which uses special fonts, containing arcs and diagonal lines, to draw more elaborate figures. These methods {{have the advantage}} of portability because they use only facilities common to all Tj implementations and most dvi processors. But they have the disadvantages of limited scope, difficulty of use, Tfl memory limitations, and lack of an interface to other graphical systems. A more versatile approach is to link a graphical language, such as Postscript, into TEX, using the command. A recent TUGBOAT article [I] describes this approach, and several other sites have used this method. This article describes work on these lines at the University of Sydney. Some small improvements on the methods of [I] make the 'lJQ-Postscript interface simpler and more foolproof for users.
