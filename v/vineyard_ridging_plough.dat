25|$|This is {{a variety}} of <b>ridge</b> <b>plough</b> notable in that the blade points towards the operator. It is used solely by human effort rather than with animal or machine assistance, and is pulled {{backwards}} by the operator, requiring great physical effort. It is particularly used for second breaking of ground, and for potato planting. It is found in Shetland, some western crofts and more rarely Central Scotland. The tool is typically found on small holdings too small or poor to merit use of animals.|$|R

A second shorter ridge descends steadily to the south west over gradually roughening ground, until after three quarters of a mile a rock outcrop is thrust up. This is Arthur's Chair and the ridge upon which it stands is Stone Arthur. Prominence is negligible, and other than the low outcrop itself, the [...] "summit" [...] is merely {{the point at which the}} gradient steepens markedly.|$|R

In Washington State, the grape was first planted at Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA in 1983. The 1990s and 2000s saw an increase of plantings of the variety, most notably at Alder <b>Ridge</b> <b>Vineyard</b> and Destiny <b>Ridge</b> <b>Vineyard</b> in the Horse Heaven Hills AVA and Ciel du Cheval Vineyard in the Red Mountain AVA.

50|$|Established July, 1989 in Santa Cruz, California, and {{incorporated}} 2001, {{the company was}} previously named McCloskey, Arrhenius and Company for its first 4 years, but {{changed its name to}} Enologix to reflect the company's expansion into luxury winemaking products for Napa Valley winemakers. Enologix is derived from Oeno, Greek goddess of wine and Logic, Greek for reasoning. Between 1989 and 1993 former winemaker Dr. Leo McCloskey and natural products chemist Dr. Susanne Arrhenius, both University of California trained chemical ecologists; along with the advice of mathematician Dr. Marshall Sylvan, Stanford University, created the first mathematical model for California luxury wine market performance. It was tested with winemakers in California, Oregon, Washington and France between 1989 and 1993, including Chalone Vineyard, Joseph Phelps <b>Vineyards,</b> <b>Ridge</b> <b>Vineyards</b> in California, Rex Hill in Oregon, Canoe Ridge in Washington and Domaines Barons Rothschild properties in Bordeaux and Chile. The most important winemaker to help Enologix was Richard Graff of Chalone Vineyard, who insisted that McCloskey prove the model with Chateau Lafite Rothchild wines. Models were developed for traditional style, taste quality and aging potential by 1993 when it was branded and trademarked Enologix and sold {{for the first time in}} February 1994 to Peter Michael Winery, Calistoga, California.
