5000|$|In finance, {{a forward}} {{contract}} {{or simply a}} forward is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or to sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed upon today, making it a type of derivative instrument. [...] This {{is in contrast to}} a spot contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset on its spot date, which may vary depending on the instrument, for example most of the FX contracts have Spot Date two business days from today. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a long position, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position. The price agreed upon is called the delivery price, which is equal to the forward price at the time the contract is entered into.The price of the underlying instrument, in whatever form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This {{is one of the many}} forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the <b>value</b> <b>date</b> where the securities themselves are exchanged.|$|E
50|$|Packaging {{is crucial}} to ensure a product's safety, quality and reliability. Packaging carries all the {{information}} the consumer may consider to be important, e.g., preparation instructions, nutritional <b>value,</b> <b>date</b> of manufacture and expiration date and producer information. The transfer of chemical contaminants from food contact materials to food is regarded as being {{a major issue in}} health studies. Hence, mathematical modelling and in-depth analyses are used in order to make estimations about the degree of this so-called migration of contaminants. Packaging materials have to comply with the vast regulatory framework that has been created by lawmakers. In 2000, four years after having had adopted the Mercosur's regulations managing the use of food contact materials, Brazil exempted all FCM from Mercosur's registration requirements except for FCM made from recycled materials. Despite being exempted from Mercosur's registration policy, FCM that is imported into the Brazilian market still needs to comply with all technical resolutions and Brazilian legislation incorporating the Mercsosur resolutions. Additionally to that, the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) must be informed about any imports of FCM whatsoever. Laws are constantly being revised in order to match newly acquired scientific and technological insights and steadily evolving products. Along with Mercosur, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as the European Union - which passed harmonized legislation on FCM in 2004 - ANVISA promotes globally harmonized policies and regimes for the governing of FCM.|$|E

50|$|The ad hoc {{usage of}} Chinese {{characters}} for their phonetic <b>values</b> <b>dates</b> {{nearly to the}} introduction of Chinese characters to Japan. Two widespread uses of ateji came out of this. On one front, scholars and monks used kanji characters as translation aids between the lines of Chinese texts. On the other, poets simply used kanji phonetically to write in Japanese. Many different characters were used with the same sound values.This system of characters is called 万葉仮名 man'yōgana (alphabet of myriad leaves). The kana of modern Japanese (hiragana and katakana) developed as organic simplifications of man'yōgana that were eventually codified.|$|R
