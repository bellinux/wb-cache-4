5|$|Some {{evidence}} of early evolutionary {{history is the}} structure of the antennal heart, a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae, or vesicles, that are attached to the frontal cuticle to the bases of the antennae. These features have not been found in other insects. An independent organ exists for each antenna, consisting of an ampulla, attached to the frontal cuticle medial to the antenna base and forming a thin-walled sac with a <b>valved</b> ostium on its ventral side. They pump blood by elastic connective tissue, rather than muscle.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of <b>valved</b> spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E

25|$|<b>Valved</b> brass {{instruments}} use {{a set of}} valves (typically three or four but {{as many as seven}} or more in some cases) operated by the player's fingers that introduce additional tubing, or crooks, into the instrument, changing its overall length. This family includes all of the modern {{brass instruments}} except the trombone: the trumpet, horn (also called French horn), euphonium, and tuba, as well as the cornet, flugelhorn, tenor horn (alto horn), baritone horn, sousaphone, and the mellophone. As <b>valved</b> instruments are predominant among the brasses today, a more thorough discussion of their workings can be found below. The valves are usually piston valves, but can be rotary valves; the latter are the norm for the horn (except in France) and are also common on the tuba.|$|E
25|$|In all {{of these}} cases, the composer's desired effect was that of tenor-voiced, <b>valved</b> brass {{instrument}} – and {{in many of these}} cases the euphonium is substituted for the called-for instrument, either because the instrument is obsolete (French C tuba), is unavailable (tenor tuba), or may be undesirable (Wagner tuba).|$|E

25|$|Keyed or Fingered brass {{instruments}} used holes along {{the body of}} the instrument, which were covered by fingers or by finger-operated pads (keys) in a similar way to a woodwind instrument. These included the cornett, serpent, ophicleide, keyed bugle and keyed trumpet. They are more difficult to play than <b>valved</b> instruments.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>valved</b> brass {{instruments}} provide triggers or throws that manually lengthen (or, less commonly, shorten) the main tuning slide, a valve slide, or the main tubing. These mechanisms alter {{the pitch of}} notes that are naturally sharp in a specific register of the instrument, or shift the instrument to another playing range. Triggers and throws permit speedy adjustment while playing.|$|E
25|$|A core {{standard}} valve layout {{based on}} the action of three valves had become almost universal by (at latest) 1864 as witnessed by Arban's Method published in that year. The effect of a particular combination of valves {{may be seen in}} the table below. This table is correct for the core 3-valve layout on almost any modern <b>valved</b> brass instrument. The most common four-valve layout is a superset of the well-established 3-valve layout and is noted in the table, despite the exposition of four-valve and also five-valve systems (the latter used on the tuba) being incomplete in this article.|$|E

50|$|Aortic <b>valve</b> {{replacement}} is {{a surgical}} procedure {{in which a}} patient's aortic <b>valve</b> {{is replaced by a}} different <b>valve.</b> The aortic <b>valve</b> can be affected by a range of diseases and require aortic <b>valve</b> replacement. The <b>valve</b> can become either leaky (regurgitant or insufficient) or stuck partially shut (stenotic). Aortic <b>valve</b> replacement traditionally required open heart surgery. A new alternative is transcatheter aortic <b>valve</b> replacement (TAVR), which delivers a mechanical <b>valve</b> {{to the site of the}} diseased <b>valve</b> through a catheter. There are two basic types of artificial heart <b>valve,</b> mechanical <b>valves</b> and tissue <b>valves.</b> Tissue heart <b>valves</b> are usually made from animal tissues, either animal heart <b>valve</b> tissue or animal pericardial tissue. The tissue is pretreated by removing antigens to prevent rejection and to prevent calcification.|$|R

25|$|Professor Anthony Molteno {{developed}} the first glaucoma drainage implant, in Cape Town in 1966. Since then, {{several types of}} implants have followed on from the original, the Baerveldt tube shunt, or the <b>valved</b> implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant or the ExPress Mini Shunt and the later generation pressure ridge Molteno implants. These are indicated for glaucoma patients not responding to maximal medical therapy, with previous failed guarded filtering surgery (trabeculectomy). The flow tube is inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye, and the plate is implanted underneath the conjunctiva to allow a flow of aqueous fluid out of the eye into a chamber called a bleb.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Aston {{introduced}} an aftermarket dealer approved upgrade path {{for power and}} handling of the 4.3-litre variants that maintained the warranty with Aston. The power upgrade was The V8 Vantage Power Upgrade, creating a more potent version of the Aston Martin 4.3-litre engine {{with an increase in}} Peak power of 20bhp to 400bhp while peak torque is increased by 10Nm to 420Nm. This consists of the fitting of the following revised components; manifold assembly (painted Crackle Black), <b>valved</b> air box, right and left hand side vacuum hose assemblies, engine bay fuse box link lead (ECU to fuse box), throttle body to manifold gasket, intake manifold gasket, fuel injector to manifold seal, and a manifold badge.|$|E
25|$|Body fluids enter through one-way <b>valved</b> ostia, {{which are}} {{openings}} situated {{along the length}} of the combined aorta and heart organ. Pumping of the haemolymph occurs by waves of peristaltic contraction, originating at the body's posterior end, pumping forwards into the dorsal vessel, out via the aorta and then into the head where it flows out into the haemocoel. The haemolymph is circulated to the appendages unidirectionally with the aid of muscular pumps or accessory pulsatile organs usually found at the base of the antennae or wings and sometimes in the legs, with pumping rates accelerating with periods of increased activity. Movement of haemolymph is particularly important for thermoregulation in orders such as Odonata, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>valve</b> seen for <b>valve</b> {{attachments}} is the rotary <b>valve.</b> Some trombones have piston <b>valves</b> used instead of rotary <b>valves</b> for <b>valve</b> attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary <b>valve</b> have been invented in the past half-century such as the Thayer <b>valve</b> or axial-flow <b>Valve,</b> the Hagmann <b>valve,</b> the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary <b>valve</b> would allow. Many of these new trombone <b>valve</b> designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard rotary <b>valve</b> remains the most common for trombone <b>valve</b> attachments.|$|R
5000|$|A check <b>valve,</b> clack <b>valve,</b> {{non-return}} <b>valve,</b> reflux <b>valve,</b> or one-way <b>valve</b> is a <b>valve</b> {{that normally}} allows fluid (liquid or gas) to flow through it {{in only one}} direction.|$|R
25|$|The euphonium, {{like the}} tenor trombone, is pitched in concert B. For a <b>valved</b> brass {{instrument}} like the euphonium, {{this means that}} when no valves are in use the instrument will produce partials of the B harmonic series. It is generally orchestrated as a non-transposing instrument like the trombone, written at concert pitch in the bass clef with higher passages in the tenor clef. Treble clef euphonium parts transposing down a major ninth are included in much concert band music: in the British-style brass band tradition, euphonium music is always written this way. In continental European band music, parts for the euphonium may be written in the bass clef as a B transposing instrument sounding a major second lower than written.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, several {{makers have}} begun to market compact B/C trombones that are {{especially}} well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short <b>valved</b> attachment that puts the instrument in B is open when the trigger is not depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on {{the first and second}} positions by using the trigger. A similar design ("Preacher model") was marketed by C.G. Conn in the 1920s, also under the Wurlitzer label. Currently, B/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers Günter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the Yamaha Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Lymph {{is formed}} from the fluid that filters {{out of the}} blood {{circulation}} to nourish cells. This fluid returns through venous capillaries to the blood circulation through the force of osmosis in the venous blood; however, {{a portion of the}} fluid that contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. must return through the lymphatic collection system to maintain tissue fluid balance. The collection of this prelymph fluid is carried out by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended epithelial-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, which later develop into complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully <b>valved</b> lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force, moving lymph within its vessel walls. The regulation of the frequency and power of contraction is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.|$|E
