50|$|One hypothesis, {{developed}} at Oxford University, {{is that the}} hexagon forms {{where there is a}} steep latitudinal gradient in the speed of the atmospheric winds in Saturn's atmosphere. Similar regular shapes were created in the laboratory when a circular tank of liquid was rotated at different speeds at its centre and periphery. The most common shape was six sided, but shapes with three to eight sides were also produced. The shapes form in an area of turbulent flow between the two different rotating fluid bodies with dissimilar speeds. A number of stable vortices of similar size form on the slower (south) side of the fluid boundary and these interact with each other to space themselves out evenly around the perimeter. The presence of the vortices influences the boundary to move northward where each is present and this gives rise to the polygon effect. Polygons do not form at wind boundaries unless the speed differential and <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters</b> are within certain margins and so are not present at other likely places, such as Saturn's south pole or the poles of Jupiter.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop and}} study an adjoint-based {{inversion}} method for the simultaneous recovery of initial temperature conditions and <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters</b> in time-dependent mantle convection {{from the current}} mantle temperature and historic plate motion. Based on a realistic rheological model with temperature-dependent and strain-rate-dependent viscosity, we formulate the inversion as a PDE-constrained optimization problem. The objective functional includes the misfit of surface velocity (plate motion) history, the misfit of the current mantle temperature, and a regularization for the uncertain initial condition. The gradient of this functional {{with respect to the}} initial temperature and the uncertain <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters</b> is computed by solving the adjoint of the mantle convection equations. This gradient is used in a pre-conditioned quasi-Newton minimization algorithm. We study the prospects and limitations of the inversion, as well as the computational performance of the method using two synthetic problems, a sinking cylinder and a realistic subduction model. The subduction model is characterized by the migration of a ridge toward a trench whereby both plate motions and subduction evolve. The results demonstrate: (1) for known <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters,</b> the initial temperature can be well recovered, as in previous initial condition-only inversions where the effective viscosity was given; (2) for known initial temperature, <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters</b> can be recovered accurately, despite the existence of trade-offs due to ill-conditioning; (3) for the joint inversion of initial condition and <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters,</b> initial condition and effective viscosity can be reasonably recovered, but the high dimension of the parameter space and the resulting ill-posedness may limit recovery of <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters...</b>|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The Asian noodle {{market is}} {{responsible}} for the increased volume of wheat imported to that region in recent years. Soft white wheat produced in the Pacific Northwest is mainly used for baked products, whereas an Australian wheat, Australian Standard White, is preferred for noodles. To enter this market soft white-wheat cultivars with properties similar to or better than Australian Standard Whitemust be developed. This process is difficult as little is known of the factors that influence noodle quality. The use of grain-protein percentage, kernel hardness, and six <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters</b> measured by the Rapid Visco Analyzer for predicting Japanese udonnoodle quality was evaluated. The Rapid Visco Analyzer was developed to indicate quickly and reliably the starch properties of a small wheat sample. Experimental material included advanced winter-wheat selections from the Oregon State University wheat-breeding program and Stephens, a widely grown winter-wheat cultivar. Two commercial spring cultivars, Owens and Klasic, thought to have good noodle quality were used as checks as was straight grade flour milled from Australian Standard White wheat. The material was grown at two locations (Rugg and Chambers) which represent diverse environments and management systems. Protein content, kernel hardness, and six <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters</b> (Peakl, Low, Peak 2, Peakl-Low, Peak 2 -Low, Peakl-Peak 2) were measured. A sensoryevaluation panel evaluated the end product for surface appeal, texture, and taste. Within each location differences were found for all traits except protein content at the Rugg site and surface appeal at the Chamber location. Between the two experimental sites the only traits for which no differences were detected were kernel hardness and surface appeal. Significant entry by location interactions were observed for kernel hardness, Peakl- Peak 2, and the three sensory-evaluation traits. Kernel hardness and grain-protein percentage were not associated, however both were negatively associated with the <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters.</b> Associations of grain-protein, kernel hardness, and the <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters</b> with the sensory evaluation traits were not statistically determined. A softer kernel texture appeared most useful for predicting Japanese udon-noodle quality as determined by sensory evaluation. Grain-protein percentage was not a good indicator by itself, but each cultivar may have a protein-content range within which noodle quality is optimized. This range may be influenced by the kernel texture. The <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameters</b> did not appear useful for predicting noodle quality as determined by the sensory evaluation panel.

40|$|With {{polypropylene}} as {{a prototype}} viscoelastic material at room temperature, {{it was found}} that a "nose" may appear in the unloading segment of the load-displacement curve during nanoindentation when the holding time at peak load is short and/or the unloading rate is small, and when the peak load is high enough. The load at which the nose appears was also found to decrease linearly with decreasing unloading rate. A linear viscoelasticity analysis was performed to interpret this effect. The analysis predicts a linear variation between the nose load and the unloading rate, and the slope of such a linear variation is also shown to be proportional to the <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameter</b> of the material. Thus, by measuring the slope of the nose-load versus unloading rate plot at a given temperature, the <b>viscosity</b> <b>parameter</b> of the specimen can be found.
