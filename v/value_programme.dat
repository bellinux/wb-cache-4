40|$|PublishedJournal ArticleThis is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons LtdThis paper reports original research which measures {{the social and economic}} impact of training and skills development on individuals who participated in training provided by social purpose, nonprofit organizations. An implicit policy assumption is that such organizations contribute to social and economic regeneration. Examining {{the costs and benefits of}} training to trainees, an adapted Return on Investment methodology measures any economic benefit, while an Index of Social Benefit measures changes in individual well-being. The results demonstrate that while changes to both the economic and social well-being of trainees occur, it does not necessarily relate solely to the training they received. Instead, changes reflect other, often complex, aspects of trainees’ lives, although training may facilitate change. Furthermore, social purpose, nonprofit organizations need to evince the socioeconomic benefits of their training programmes to secure future funding, public or private, but proving their successful delivery may be difficult to determine. This work developed as a collaborative effort between the Centre for Rural Policy Research (now the Land, Environment, Economics and Policy Institute – LEEP) at the University of Exeter and Devon Communities Together as part of the Proving Our <b>Value</b> <b>programme</b> funded by SW Forum. This programme was designed to engage collaborative work between academic researchers and not-for-profit organizations. As such, the authors are indebted the work of Lesley Smith and David Kinross of Devon Communities Together, whose commitment and contacts made this research possible...|$|E
40|$|Relationship {{quality has}} {{received}} increasing attention by researchers {{during the past}} decade. Research evidence has revealed that relationship quality {{has an influence on}} relationship outcomes such as customer loyalty, repurchase intention and word-of-mouth. Based on these reasons, relationship quality has received more overt emphasis by both academicians and practitioners. The data for this research were collected from 400 retail loyalty programme members in Malaysia via drop off and collect survey technique. Basically, this research had shed new light and understanding to the existing knowledge by incorporating various constructs in the antecedents of relationship quality such as perceived equity, programme perceived <b>value,</b> <b>programme</b> service quality, programme relationship orientation and member relationship proneness. The significance of the study lies in the fact that, it attempts to identify and empirically investigate the antecedents of relationship quality among programme members and in tum examines the consequences on member's behavioural loyalty such as program card loyalty and store loyalty in a retail loyalty programme setting. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was utilised to test the hypothesised relationships among the constructs, as postulated in the model. The results derived from the present study sheds new insights; firstly, the result exemplifies that ' courteousness/helpfulness' is the most important determinant of loyalty programme service quality (LoPQUAL). In turn, loyalty programme service quality is the most influential determinant of programme perceived value and programme satisfaction. Secondly, programme relationship orientation is the most important driver of programme trust, while programme trust is the most predictive indicator of programme commitment. Fourth, it was revealed that programme perceived value positively influenced perceived equity and which then found to be a significant predictor of programme commitment but not programme satisfaction. In terms of the consequences of relationship quality on behavioural loyalty (programme card loyalty and store loyalty), the results delineate several interesting findings; firstly, programme satisfaction and programme commitment holds a pre-eminent role in the formation of programme card loyalty and ultimately store loyalty However, programme satisfaction has no direct impact on store loyalty. Secondly, programme trust and programme commitment have significant direct impact on store loyalty. Thirdly, loyalty towards the programme is the most predictive determinant of store loyalty. Thus, this revealed that programme trust has an indirect effect on programme card loyalty mediated by programme commitment. And, programme satisfaction has an indirect effect on store loyalty mediated by programme card loyalty. Ultimately, the study's primary goal of developing a plausible model that has statistical and explanatory power, which could permit interpretation of results confidently, was achieved after a minor modification to the proposed model. Thus, the current research reveals three new links namely, member relationship proneness-programme card loyalty, perceived equity-programme card loyalty and programme card loyalty_store loyalty; that have not been examined empirically by previous research. Moreover, the research has also developed and validated a new measure called loyalty programme service quality (LoPQUAL), which attempts to offer a new dimension of loyalty programme service quality particularly in retail loyalty programme...|$|E

40|$|School {{websites}} {{are one of}} {{a number}} of ways that schools communicate their vision, <b>values,</b> <b>programmes,</b> successes, and about their community in the public domain. An initial stimulus for this article was a study conducted by one of the authors investigating the presence and profile of outdoor education on secondary school websites in Aotearoa New Zealand. The cost associated with some senior outdoor education offerings compared with other resourceintensive subject options was a finding that provoked our collective attention. This is particularly so when Ministry of Education policy prohibits schools from compelling parents to pay fees for outdoor education courses that are part of the curriculum of a school. This article catalogues the questions and quandaries that surfaced from our consideration of outdoor education funding issues, particularly in senior outdoor education in some schools. We speculate about the importance of outdoor educators considering their ‘bottom-lines’ and what learning opportunities are possible if outdoor education experiences are seen to be a ‘right’ of all students...|$|R
