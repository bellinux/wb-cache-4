5|$|In 1913, Western Electric, the {{manufacturing}} division of AT, acquired {{the rights to}} the de Forest audion, the forerunner of the triode <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube.</b> Over the next few years they developed it into a predictable and reliable device that made electronic amplification possible for the first time. Western Electric then branched-out into developing uses for the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> including public address systems and an electrical recording system for the recording industry. Beginning in 1922, the research branch of Western Electric began working intensively on recording technology for both sound-on-disc and sound-on film synchronised sound systems for motion-pictures.|$|E
5|$|Three {{neptunium}} arsenide compounds {{have been}} prepared, NpAs, NpAs2, and Np3As4. The first two were first created by heating arsenic and neptunium hydride in a vacuum-sealed tube {{for about a}} week. Later, NpAs was also made by confining neptunium metal and arsenic in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube,</b> separating them with a quartz membrane, and heating them to just below neptunium's melting point of 639°C, which is slightly higher than the arsenic's sublimation point of 615°C. Np3As4 is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a transporting agent. NpAs2 crystals are brownish gold and Np3As4 is black. The neptunium antimonide compound NpSb was created in 1971 by placing equal quantities of both elements in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube,</b> heating them to the melting point of antimony, and then heating it further to 1000°C for sixteen days. This procedure also created trace amounts of an additional antimonide compound Np3Sb4. One neptunium-bismuth compound, NpBi, has also been reported.|$|E
5|$|Vintage amateur {{radio is}} {{a subset of}} amateur radio {{activity}} and is considered a form of nostalgia or hobby much like antique car collecting, where enthusiasts collect, restore, preserve, build, and operate amateur radio equipment from bygone years, most notably those using <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> technology.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Transistor is {{the major}} {{invention}} in electronics field, <b>vacuums</b> <b>tubes</b> are used in older times. But <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> have lot of drawbacks when comparing with transistor like their large size high power consumption etc. So transistor will easily replace <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> because transistors are small size, low power consumption cheap etc. but transistor can't completely replace these <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> because transistor can't work In high frequency application and also transistor will almost hit its minimum size further reduction in size is not easy so need a better replacement.

5|$|A Museum of Computing {{was opened}} in 2001 in Žirmūnai by the Lithuanian {{software}} company Sintagma, showcasing {{the history of}} Lithuanian computing science and hardware production. It {{was based on a}} museum opened in 1985 by Sigma, one of the leading computer manufacturers in the former Soviet Union. The museum's exhibits include EV-80, the first Soviet <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> computing machine manufactured by Sigma, and a copy of the IBM 604.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 Liverpool Street {{became the}} new {{terminus}} of the Central London Railway {{after the completion}} of an extension project from Bank. The deep-level Central line platforms 4 and 5 opened on 28 July 1912 as the eastern terminus of the Central London Railway. The tube station {{was one of the first}} to use the Moore <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Tube,</b> a new system of lighting that produced three times as much as a normal bulb.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E

50|$|The main {{hardware}} {{consisted of}} 1982 pluggable units, {{each of which}} typically had several <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> plus supporting electronics. There were 62 types of pluggable units, but half of the circuitry used only six of the types and 80% of the circuitry used only 18 of the types. With 1,300 <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> in the three systems of the computer, the NORC had a total of 9800 <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> and 10,000 crystal diodes were used.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} three decades, Kilburn led the {{development}} of a succession of innovative Manchester computers. The first, commenced in 1951, was a development of the Mark I known as the megacycle machine or Meg, that replaced the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> diodes with solid state ones. This permitted an order of magnitude increase in the clock rate. To add further speed, Kilburn provided for 10-bit parallel CRT memory. It {{was also one of the}} first computers, if not the first, to have floating point arithmetic. Meg operated for the first time in 1954, and nineteen were sold by Ferranti, six of them to customers overseas.|$|E
5|$|Bertie the Brain was a {{computer}} game of tic-tac-toe, built by Dr. Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. Kates had previously worked at Rogers Majestic designing and building radar tubes during World War II, {{then after the}} war pursued graduate studies in the computing center at the University of Toronto while continuing to work at Rogers Majestic. While there, he helped build the University of Toronto Electronic Computer (UTEC), {{one of the first}} working computers in the world. He also designed his own miniature version of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube,</b> called the additron tube, which he registered with the Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association on 20 March 1951 as type 6047.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, who had worked with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
50|$|Directly heated cathode: In this type, the {{filament}} {{itself is}} the cathode and emits the electrons directly. Directly heated cathodes {{were used in the}} first <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes.</b> Today they are used in fluorescent tubes and most high power transmitting <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R

50|$|MANIAC II {{was built}} by the University of California and the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, {{completed}} in 1957. It used 2,850 <b>Vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> and 1,040 semiconductor diodes in the arithmetic unit. Overall it used 5,190 <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes,</b> 3,050 semiconductor diodes, and 1,160 transistors.|$|R
5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature version of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube,</b> though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E
5|$|Liquid crystal {{materials}} {{became a}} focus {{of research in the}} development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.|$|E
5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> {{themselves}} are usually FRUs.|$|R
50|$|From the 1920s to the 1960s, {{virtually}} every electronic device used hot cathode <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes.</b> Today, hot cathodes {{are used as}} the source of electrons in fluorescent lamps, <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes,</b> and electron guns in cathode ray tubes and laboratory equipment such as electron microscopes.|$|R
50|$|Directly heated cathode: In this type, the {{filament}} {{itself is}} the cathode and emits the electrons directly. Directly heated cathodes {{were used in the}} first <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes,</b> but today they are only used in fluorescent tubes, some large transmitting <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes,</b> and all X-ray tubes.|$|R
5|$|LC filters at low {{frequencies}} become awkward; the components, especially the inductors, become expensive, bulky, heavy, and non-ideal. Practical 1H inductors require many {{turns on a}} high-permeability core; that material will have high losses and stability issues (e.g., a large temperature coefficient). For applications such as a mains filters, the awkwardness must be tolerated. For low-level, low-frequency, applications, RC filters are possible, but they cannot implement filters with complex poles or zeros. If the application can use power, then amplifiers {{can be used to}} make RC active filters that can have complex poles and zeros. In the 1950s, Sallen–Key active RC filters were made with <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> amplifiers; these filters replaced the bulky inductors with bulky and hot vacuum tubes. Transistors offered more power-efficient active filter designs. Later, inexpensive operational amplifiers enabled other active RC filter design topologies. Although active filter designs were commonplace at {{low frequencies}}, they were impractical at high frequencies where the amplifiers were not ideal; LC (and transmission line) filters were still used at radio frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Most {{small signal}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> devices have been {{superseded}} by semiconductors, but some <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> electronic devices {{are still in}} common use.

In spite of the advancing state of the art in power semiconductor technology, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> still has reliability and cost advantages for high-frequency RF power generation.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{development}} of silicon semiconductor rectifiers, <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> thermionic diodes and copper oxide- or selenium-based metal rectifier stacks were used. With the introduction of semiconductor electronics, <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> rectifiers became obsolete, except for some enthusiasts of <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> audio equipment. For power rectification from very low to very high current, semiconductor diodes of various types (junction diodes, Schottky diodes, etc.) are widely used.|$|E
