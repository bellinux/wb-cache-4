50|$|The <b>Voorburg</b> <b>Group</b> {{has contributed}} {{over the years}} to {{building}} up and sharing a considerable and growing body of knowledge of Service Sector Statistics. It has prompted international cooperation in the development of standards and has assisted in resolving statistical and measurement challenges in the Service Sector.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Voorburg</b> <b>Group</b> on Services Statistics {{was created}} in 1986, in {{response}} to a request from the United Nations Statistical Office (UNSO), for assistance in developing services statistics. The first meeting, hosted by the Netherlands Statistical Office (CBS) was held in January 1987 in Voorburg, Netherlands, from which the Group derives its name.|$|E

Insurance carriers appear to have had negative labor productivity growth over the whole 1987 – 2001 period (table 5 - 4), and both the insurance carrier and the insurance agent industries had negative measured multifactor productivity (MFP) for most of that interval. In April 1998, the Brookings Program on Output and Productivity Measurement in the Services Sector convened a workshop, “Measuring the Price and Output of Insurance, ” that included participants from both the analytic/research community and the measurement community. The latter included staff members from statistical agencies {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic and from the Pacific region as well. Although the measurement of insurance has been discussed in other forums (see, for example, <b>Voorburg</b> <b>Group</b> 1993) the all-day Brookings workshop was the most intensive and comprehensive discussion of measurement issues in the insurance sector to date. 1 This chapter reviews the measurement of insurance output and prices in the economic measurement literature and in economic research on insurance; among other sources, we mak...|$|E
