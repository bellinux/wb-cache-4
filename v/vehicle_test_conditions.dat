40|$|Confusion and misconceptions {{regarding}} the utility {{and safety of}} turf work trucks are addressed in this paper. Sources of this confusion include media stories of related vehicles and advertisements. The maneuverability, including both turning ability and traction performance, as well as lateral-stability characteristics of three- and four-wheeled turf work trucks are evaluated based on experimental tests and mathematical models. Experiments with the three most popular heavy-duty turf work trucks from Cushman ® and Toro® show that the three-wheeled model maintains a distinct advantage over the four-wheeled models with respect to maneuverability in tight spaces as measured in clearance-circle tests. Traction-performance <b>tests</b> with these <b>vehicles</b> show there to be considerable variations in traction performance between <b>vehicles,</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions,</b> and loading states. The analyses of the lateral-stability characteristics of three- and four-wheeled turf work trucks, using a mathematical model, indicate that the optimum four-wheeled vehicle is more laterally stable than the three wheeler for equal track widths. However, among vehicles of equal clearance-circle performance, the optimum three-wheeled vehicle stability surpasses that of the four wheeler. This paper continues with {{the analysis of the}} effects of a simple load on three- and four-wheeled vehicle stability which shows qualitatively different effects of loading on the two vehicle configurations. Finally, this paper evaluates the need for and implementation of a rollover protective structure (ROPS) system. Among the conclusions reached is that both three- and four-wheeled turf work trucks are required to achieve all of the performance goals found in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Time domain {{approach}} with S-N approach and local strain approach {{were used for}} fatigue life estimation. But these days, using PSD (Power Spectral Density) method is highlighted, because of {{short amount of time}} in measurement and analysis. Especially, PSD method is useful for analysis of fatigue failure which is caused by vibration damage, also FRF (Frequency Response Function) is useful for efficient prediction of fatigue life when the same product is employing different motor <b>vehicle</b> or <b>test</b> <b>condition.</b> In order to estimate fatigue life of compressor for air conditioning, time domain analysis and frequency domain analysis were performed and the results were compared. As a result, results of analysis in frequency domain and time domain were similar. With this, there is recognition of decreasing the period of measuring and analysis in PSD analysis. Moreover, in case of FRF pursued of a part, using FRF is applicable at fatigue life prediction in different <b>testing</b> <b>condition.</b> There was investigated an analysis method with curtailed analysis period by FRF...|$|R
40|$|P a g e | ii This work {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} to estimate tire side slip angles in front-wheel steered, rear-wheel driven four wheeled vehicles. A three degree-of-freedom model with slip angle, yaw rate and roll angle as {{degrees of freedom}} was constructed to capture the coupling between steering and roll dynamics of such vehicles. An open-loop estimator was designed based on this model to estimate the side slip angles of tires using available real-time measurements which include steering angle, steering torque and suspension positions. The estimator was validated by comparing its predictions with that of an ADAMS model. The predictions of the ADAMS model in turn were compared with experimental results reported in vehicle dynamics literature for similar <b>vehicles</b> and <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> We conclude that a three degree-of-freedom model {{is a good start}} for use in estimation techniques of side slip angle...|$|R
40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) {{is being}} {{designed}} {{to land the}} Orion Crew Module (CM) at a safe rate of descent at splashdown via a series of Drogue, Pilot, and Main parachutes. Because Orion is considerably larger and heavier than Apollo, many of the flight test techniques developed during the Apollo program must be modified. The Apollo program had a dedicated C- 133 aircraft, which was modified to allow a simple airdrop of "boilerplate" flight <b>test</b> <b>vehicles.</b> However, the CPAS program must use either commercial or military assets with minimal modifications to airframes or procedures. Conceptual envelopes from 2 -Degree Of Freedom trajectories are presented for several existing and novel architectures. Ideally, the technique would deliver a representative capsule shape to the desired altitude and dynamic pressure at test initiation. However, compromises must {{be made on the}} characteristics of trajectories or the fidelity of test articles to production hardware. Most of the tests to date have used traditional pallet and weight tub or missile-shaped <b>test</b> <b>vehicles.</b> New <b>test</b> <b>vehicles</b> are being designed to better incorporate Orion structural components and deploy parachutes in a more representative fashion. The first attempt to <b>test</b> a capsule-shaped <b>vehicle</b> failed due to unexpected events while setting up the <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> through a series of complex procedures. In order to avoid the loss of another expensive test article which will delay the program, simpler deployment methods are being examined and more positive control of the vehicle will be maintained. Existing challenges include interfacing with parent aircraft, separating <b>test</b> <b>vehicles,</b> achieving <b>test</b> <b>conditions,</b> and landing within limited test ranges. All these challenges must be met within cost and schedule limits...|$|R
40|$|Advanced in-space repair {{technologies}} for reinforced carbon/carbon composite (RCC) thermal protection system (TPS) structures are critically {{needed for the}} space shuttle Return To Flight (RTF) efforts. These technologies are also critical for the repair and refurbishment of thermal protection system structures of future Crew Exploration Vehicles of space exploration programs. The Glenn Refractory Adhesive for Bonding and Exterior Repair (GRABER) material developed at the NASA Glenn Research Center has demonstrated capabilities for repair of small cracks and damage in RCC leading-edge material. The concept consists of preparing an adhesive paste of desired ceramic in a polymer/phenolic resin matrix with appropriate additives, such as surfactants, and then applying the paste into the damaged or cracked area of the RCC composite components with caulking guns.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{model of a}} mid-size sport utility vehicle was developed using MADYMO. The model includes {{a detailed description of}} the suspension system and tire characteristics that incorporated the Delft-Tyre magic formula description. The model was correlated by simulating a vehicle suspension kinematics and compliance test. The correlated model was then used to simulate a J-turn <b>vehicle</b> dynamics <b>test</b> maneuver, a roll and non-roll ditch test, corkscrew ramp and a lateral trip test, the results of which are presented in this paper. The results indicate that MADYMO is able to reasonably predict the vehicle and occupant responses in these types of applications and is potentially suited as a tool to help setup a suite of <b>vehicle</b> configurations and <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> for rollover sensor testing.

40|$|A Global Technical Regulation (GTR) on {{pedestrian}} {{safety is}} currently in its final draft stages, and may be adopted in Australia as an Australian Design Rule. Currently, selected new <b>vehicles</b> are <b>tested</b> by the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) for pedestrian protection; the GTR testing procedure is similar, but has different <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> The goal {{of this study was}} to estimate how many <b>vehicles</b> <b>tested</b> by ANCAP might be expected to pass the headform testing requirements of the GTR based on the vehicles ANCAP performance. Initially, three popular <b>vehicles</b> were <b>tested</b> to the specifications of the GTR. The resulting data was used to validate a theoretical relationship that predicts the change in Head Injury Criterion (HIC) for a given change in headform mass and impact speed. This relationship was used to predict the best-case and worst-case results for 60 <b>vehicles</b> previously <b>tested</b> by ANCAP, 33 of which are current models. The results indicate that a relatively small number of vehicles would be expected to unequivocally pass the GTR requirements, however many more may pass with little to no modifications.

40|$|To enable direct {{experimental}} {{duplication of}} the inflight heat flux distribution on supersonic and hypersonic vehicles, an aerodynamic heating scaling technique has been developed. The scaling technique {{is based on}} the analytical equations for convective heat transfer for laminar and turbulent boundary layers that follow from applying the Reynolds analogy. The method was developed starting from an elementary isothermal cold flat plate at zero angle of attack and subsequent introduction of wall temperature effects, geometrical scaling effects and angle of attack effects. The present paper extends the scaling technique by introducing correction factors enabling full duplication of the laminar and turbulent boundary layer heat transfer downstream of a shock wave generated by a flat plate at angle of attack. A similar extension is developed to enable full duplication of the laminar and turbulent boundary layer heat transfer downstream of a Prandt- Meyer expansion. The scaling technique is applied to a simplified vehicle configuration consisting of two convex surfaces. The results clearly show that scaled <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> can be derived at which the in-flight distribution of heat flux on either one of the two surfaces can be fully duplicated. After implementation of high temperature effects this scaling technique may allow for experimental verification of the heat flux distribution on hypersonic <b>vehicles</b> at supersonic <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> In this way, test facilities that are far less expensive to operate can provide valuable information during the initial design phase of a hypersonic vehicle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} inexpensive methods {{whereby the}} vehicle side-slip angle {{can be measured}} accurately at low speeds on any terrain using cameras. Most commercial side-slip angle sensor systems and estimation techniques rely on smooth terrain and high vehicle speeds, typically above 20 km/h, to provide accurate measurements. However, during certain in-situ tyre and <b>vehicle</b> <b>testing</b> on off-road <b>conditions,</b> the vehicle may be travelling at speeds slower than required for current sensors and estimation techniques to provide sufficiently accurate results. Terramechanics tests are typical case in point. Three algorithms capable of determining the side-slip angle from overlapping images are presented. The first is a simple fast planar method. The second is a more complex algorithm which can extract not only the side-slip angle but also its rotational velocities and scaled translational velocities. The last uses a calibrated stereo-rig to obtain all rotations and translational movement in world coordinates. The last two methods are aimed more at rough terrain applications, where the terrain induces motion components other than typical predominant yaw-plane motion. The study however found no discernible difference in measured side-slip angle of the methods. The system allows for accurate measurement at low and higher speeds depending on camera speed and lighting. National Research Foundation (DAAD-NRF). [URL]...|$|R
