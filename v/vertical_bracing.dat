50|$|Utilising the wings, struts {{and tail}} {{unit of the}} T.8 Kirby Tutor, the T.29 Motor Tutor had a new {{fuselage}} incorporating a wheeled undercarriage and the cockpit under the wing centre section. Early trials revealed resonance of the front wing struts, which was rectified by adding a <b>vertical</b> <b>bracing</b> strut vertically up to the mainspar. This modification was introduced for all Kirby Tutors to allow aero-tow launching.|$|E

50|$|Building length: 3 m (10' +/-) to 10 m (32' +/-) is common. Length is {{primarily}} {{limited by the}} ability of the load path to transfer loads to a <b>vertical</b> <b>brace</b> system (e.g. gable endwall). Building length can be extended with added discrete brace systems (e.g. roof level horizontal brace, portal frame, diagonal brace, interior partition shear wall).|$|R
50|$|These lidded wagons were longer (length over buffers with/without hand brake: 9,100mm / 9,800 mm) and had {{a greater}} axle base (4,000 mm) than their forebears {{designed}} {{on the basis of}} technical drawing A7. The side walls were now divided into two panels by a <b>vertical</b> <b>brace</b> either side of the door. With the renaming of the recently formed town of Barmen-Elberfeld to Wuppertal in 1930 the designation of this class also changed.|$|R
50|$|Lidded wagons {{were used}} for the {{transportation}} of moisture-sensitive bulk goods such as lime or salt, but {{over the course of the}} years they were largely superseded by self-unloading hoppers. As a result the Austauschbauart class wagons built in 1933 were the last series of lidded wagons. In 1935 the DRG ordered only two welded trials wagons with a length over buffers of 9,100 mm without hand brakes and a wheelbase of 4,000 mm. The side walls were divided into two panels by a <b>vertical</b> <b>brace</b> on either side of the door. But this was not followed by a production run because lidded wagons, with all the associated difficulties of unloading, had meanwhile been technically superseded.|$|R
50|$|The two {{storeyed}} former service wing is also {{constructed of}} face brick though {{this has been}} painted in sections. Lining the north western facade of the wing is a double storeyed timber verandah. This is infilled on the upper level with horizontal timber boarding and is partially infilled on the lower level, accommodating a kitchen extension. The early kitchen survives {{on the ground floor}} of this wing. The upper floor, reached by a dog legged timber stair is attached to the main building with a partially open walkway. This contains several small rooms, partitioned with single skinned horizontal timber partitioning with <b>vertical</b> <b>bracing,</b> which are accessed from an infilled verandah.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} section has {{a foundation}} of small stones, still partly visible. The house's German-American hallmarks include its heavy timber frame construction with <b>vertical</b> <b>braces</b> at the corners with tightly fitted horizontal log infillings. The apparently original and complete roof structure is now covered with early 20th century tin, {{and much of the}} unusual original beaded siding, applied circa 1810 with cut nails, survives covered by weatherboard. Weathering beneath the beaded siding reveals the exterior was originally unsheathed. Some of the early windows remain, set in molded surrounds with molded sills that appear to date to 1810. The windows originally were small (about two-and-a-half feet square) and possibly filled only with shutters in the earliest period.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Long-span and {{bifurcation}} tunnel {{engineering is}} not very common in underground engineering field. It is difficult to construct this complicated structure because of numerous influencing factors. In order {{to find out the}} optimum construction method for long-span and bifurcation tunnel to guarantee construction security and stabilization of this project, six construction methods were compared and analyzed by using numerical simulation. The results show that: (1) The excavation of confluence segment and small interval tunnel can affect each other but the confluence segment is the crucial part of the whole project. (2) The <b>vertical</b> <b>brace</b> determines the stabilization of surrounding rock and preliminary support in confluence segment. (3) The central concrete between main tunnel and ramp tunnel is the key point to guarantee the construction security and stabilization of small interval tunnel. The above results certainly contribute to research and develop new types of construction methods for long-span and bifurcation tunnel engineering...|$|R
40|$|A steel construction, {{divided into}} two parts, was {{designed}} for the building object of a production block of a bio power plant. The two parts separate the boiler room and the engine room. Due to the specific load caused by the operation equipment, also several plateaus, consoles, footbridges and technological constructions were designed. A system of principal pillars HEB, transversely frame-connected with plane solid girders IPE, forms the hall construction. Pillars in rows 1 and 4 are rigidly jointed to foundations. A bearing structure of the roof deck is imposed on the girders. It is composed {{of a system of}} purlins – rolled profiles type UPE. The rigidity of the roof is secured by horizontal bracing between the purlins. The construction of the boiler room is attached to the construction of the engine room, which is formed of frame-connected principal pillars HEB in rows 4, 7 and 8. The roof truss IPE is designed for 12 900 mm span between rows 4 and 7 and for 4 800 mm between rows 7 and 8. The spatial rigidity of the structure is not only secured by the rigid connection of pillars and foundation combined with the frame-connected roof rungs. It is mainly maintained thanks to the system of vertical wall bracings interacting with the horizontal bracing of the roof. Between the pillar rows B, C, D, E, F and G and 8 to 9 a construction of a substation is attached. In the engine room is situated technological structure. The construction is formed by supporting frames consisting of pillars type HEA, rungs type IPE and HEA and <b>vertical</b> <b>bracing</b> of rolled profiles. Pillars type HEA are connected to foundation using articulated connection. The rigidity of the structure is secured both ways by <b>vertical</b> <b>bracing</b> and by the connection of the plateau beams with the hall girders...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{experimental}} investigation of the Smart Restorable Sliding Base Isolation System (SRSBIS), proposed for the earthquake-resistant design of structures. SRSBIS is composed of steel-PTFE Flat Sliding Bearings (FSBs), supporting gravity loads while allowing large horizontal displacements, and superelastic Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, providing the necessary horizontal stiffness and restoring capability. Three different configurations can be alternatively considered based on {{the arrangement of the}} SMA elements in <b>vertical,</b> <b>bracing,</b> and horizontal directions. A model scale test-structure has been set up for the system with the SMA wires arranged in vertical direction, representing the isolation units that can be practically used under each column of base isolated buildings. A shaking table test program has been then conducted on the model structure. The experimental outcomes clearly showed that SRSBIS can be reliably used for the passive control of the seismic vibrations of buidlings and other structures...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{the project of}} {{replacing}} the steel roof construction and the outside fire staircase with elevator of the UL FGG building on Hajdrihova street. First we determine the loads for the roof and the fire staircase. Then we make a 3 D model in the program Steel Engineer in order to calculate the internal forces. For the main structure of the roof we select the frame {{in one direction and}} frame with centric bracing in other direction. The fire staircase has four internal columns and four external columns around which <b>vertical</b> <b>bracing</b> is placed. Between internal and external columns there are stairs with intermediate platforms. In this project we make the ultimate limit state analysis and seismic analysis for both designs. The seismic analysis is performed using a simplified method of horizontal forces. At roof seismic analysis is used to design vertical bracings and to design the rest of the elements we use the ultimate limit state analysis. At fire staircase seismic analysis is used to design columns, beam and vertical bracings and the ultimate limit state analysis is used {{for the rest of the}} elements. In both cases we also design joints and draw the position and detail plans...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe toggle-brace-damper {{system has}} been proven {{to be the most}} {{effective}} system for the energy dissipation of stiff structures. However, the expected effect of the toggle-brace-damper system depends largely on its configuration, the use of steel braces and the installation mode. The existing design methods of toggle-brace-damper systems may be further improved. The analysis of different installation modes and experiments involving toggle-brace-damper systems are conducted to improve understanding of the influence of key factors and to provide design guidance. For toggle-brace-damper system tests, a <b>vertical</b> <b>brace</b> is installed in a steel frame to prevent out-of-plane instability. The calculation formulas for an upper toggle-brace-damper system and other configuration systems with consideration of the influence of brace deformation are studied in the paper. Test results show that the upper toggle-brace-damper system has the largest magnification factor, which is consistent with the theoretical analyses. The brace deformation and installation error cannot be ignored in the design of a toggle-brace-damper system. Installation error can also lead to out-of-plane instability of a toggle-brace-damper system. Moreover, the experimental results show that the magnification factor changes with loading and is different when force is applied in the push and pull directions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{behaviour}} {{of standardized}} lattice timber beams in bending with semi-rigid joints is studied. Various measurement techniques {{are used in}} the experiments to measure the displacements and rotations of the glued and/or nailed joints. The experimental results, obtained on beams with different types of joints combining glue and nails, are presented. The description of the nails, the adhesives and the types of wood is detailed. The experimental results in terms of load-deflection curves, crack features, due to nails and adhesives, are presented. The semi-rigidity of the joint between <b>vertical</b> <b>bracing</b> and diagonal struts is analysed. The comparison of various measurements techniques showed the validity of the experimental results. These results showed the influence of the axial and the rotational semi-rigidity of the joints on the global behaviour of the beams. The experimental results are compared with the analytical results given by the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, including or not the linear semi-rigid stiffness of the joints in tension or compression. The study shows the satisfactory behavior of the lattice beams and gives information on the opportunity to choose one of the gluing techniques to fulfill the mechanical requirements of the beams. The study also shows the necessity of a more complete modeling taking into account the effect of the rotation in the joint area and the influence of the nonlinearity on the global behaviourof the beam...|$|E
40|$|Steel framed {{buildings}} are generally designed with "simple" shear-resisting connections, and lateral forces are resisted by <b>vertical</b> <b>bracing</b> and shear walls. When a beam is considered then {{the effects of}} the longitudinal restraints by the adjacent structure and the rotational restraint by the connections has to be taken into account. Because of structural interaction, the beam behaviour at elevated temperature is rather complex. This paper presents a numerical parametric study of a structural system consisting of an exposed steel beam restrained between a pair of fire protected steel columns. The structural sub-frame is modelled using 3 D shell elements, thereby taking into account the effect of the local failure modes, and the realistic behaviour of the sub-frame exposed to natural fire. The numerical model accounts for the initial geometrical imperfections, non-linear temperature gradient over the cross-section, geometrical and material nonlinearity and temperature dependent material properties. Results obtained using a general Finite Element software - LUSAS and a fire dedicated software - SAFIR, are compared. The influence of following variables: beam span/depth ratio, lateral restraint, gradient temperature within the cross-section and mechanical load level is presented in the paper. The failure modes, the development of the internal forces and displacements throughout the analysis are considered to exemplify {{the effects of the}} variables considered.

This type of retrofit was evaluated for a four-story reinforced concrete (RC) frame office building damaged during the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. This structure had no serious damage in its perimeter moment frames, but experienced several punching shear failures at its interior slab-column connections. Previous research has led to the conclusion that these buildings may be retrofitted by limiting their lateral drift and/or retrofitting their interior connections. This study focused on evaluating the effectiveness of stiffening the structure using <b>vertical</b> <b>bracing</b> in the perimeter frames. An analytical model in DRAIN- 2 DM of the study building was used to evaluate different retrofit strategies. Various aspects of the selection and design of steel bracing systems for the seismic retrofitting of reinforced concrete frames were considered. The bracing configuration within the exterior frame was varied and the effects of allowing the braces to behave outside of the elastic range were assessed. As part of the evaluation of various bracing configurations, both static and dynamic nonlinear analyses were performed. The ground motion records used for the dynamic nonlinear analyses included a ground motion recorded within 0. 6 mi. (1 km) of the study building and a synthetic ground motion representative of the mid-west and east coast area of the United States...|$|E

50|$|Its flat, wooden girder {{fuselage}} {{was very}} {{similar to that of the}} Zögling, with an upper and lower horizontal pair of beams and six diagonal and <b>vertical</b> cross <b>braces.</b> Since the CAT 15's wing was rigidly braced it did not need the above wing pylon which anchored the flying wires of the Zögling. The nacelle was a wooden structure with ovoid cross-section and fabric covering which extended aft just beyond the wing trailing edge. The rear of the girder was braced laterally with a pair of steel wires to the wings. The empennage of the CAT 15 {{was very similar}} to that of the Zögling, with a triangular tailplane mounted on the upper beam of the girder carrying rectangular elevators with a large cut-out to allow movement of the near-rectangular, deep, balanced rudder. The glider landed on a sprung skid reaching from the nose to the trailing edge.|$|R

The fuselage was a steel tube structure covered with dural forward of the cockpit and fabric aft.The tail was redesigned again, this time to a triangular shape and was also built of steel tube and dural-covered. An aerodynamically improved single strut undercarriage featuring wheel spats was fitted near the wing roots and a small wheel replaced the previous tailskid. Instead of the crash-pylon featured on earlier models, a rounded knob appeared behind the pilot's headrest.The wings were rounded and shortened to 11.00 m, giving 19.00 m² total area, and were built around two dural spars {{with a mixture of}} wood and metal ribs.
