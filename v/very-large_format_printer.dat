5000|$|Wide <b>format</b> <b>printers</b> (large <b>format</b> <b>printers)</b> are {{generally}} accepted {{to be any}} computer-controlled printing machines (printers) that support a maximum print roll width of between 18" [...] and 100". Printers with capacities over 100" [...] wide are considered super wide or grand <b>format.</b> Wide <b>format</b> <b>printers</b> are used to print banners, posters, trade show graphics, wallpaper, murals, backlit film (duratrans), vehicle image wraps, electronic circuit schematics, architectural drawings, construction plans, backdrops for theatrical and media sets, and any other large format artwork or signage. Wide <b>format</b> <b>printers</b> usually employ some variant of inkjet technology to produce the printed image; and are more economical than other print methods such as screen printing for most short-run (low quantity) print projects, depending on print size, run length (quantity of prints per single original), {{and the type of}} substrate or print medium. Wide <b>format</b> <b>printers</b> are usually designed for printing onto a roll of print media that feeds incrementally during the print process, rather than onto individual sheets.|$|R

40|$|The study {{object of}} the present project is a large <b>format</b> <b>printer</b> that is being {{produced}} by a company leader in the sector. The author has done the project and its internship in the R&D part of the company, concretely in the Stewardship team. The objective of the project is to research the possibility of increasing the content of Post-Consumer Recycled (PCR) plastic in large <b>format</b> <b>printers</b> in order to push the use of it by the R&D mechanical engineers. This idea arose due to the good will of the Stewardship team to satisfy an optional eco-mark requirement. The author joined such team with the wish of leading a project and an idea in the imaging equipment business. First of all, it is given {{an introduction to the}} theme of circular economy, recycling and an overview of the different plastics used currently. Then, it is explained the situation of the company in this theme nowadays and its future prospects. After, the project proposes a procedure to increase the usage of PCR in large <b>format</b> <b>printers</b> qualifying the plastic virgin parts as R (they can be replaced by a PCR plastic directly), MR (the parts need to overcome some tests) and NR (the parts cannot be replaced). Subsequently, the tests of the MR parts have been described. And finally, the procedure has been applied to a particular large <b>format</b> <b>printer...</b>|$|R
