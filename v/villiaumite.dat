40|$|The phase {{relationships}} in the systems NaF-H_ 2 O and NaAlSi_ 3 O_ 8 -NaF-H_ 2 O were determined between 600 ° and 900 ° C. at pressures up to 4 kb., {{and those in the}} anhydrous system NaAlSi_ 3 O_ 8 -NaF were determined at 1 atm. The phases encountered were albite, <b>villiaumite</b> (NaF), liquid, and vapor. The liquid quenches to a glass containing skeletal NaF crystals. Primary <b>villiaumite</b> is readily distinguished from "quench" NaF. Albite crystals coexisting with liquid are several times larger than subsolidus crystals. The binary reaction <b>villiaumite</b> + vapor ↔ liquid occurs at 860 ° ± 7 ° C. at 1 kb., and the binary reaction albite + <b>villiaumite</b> ↔ liquid occurs at 860 ° ± 5 ° C. at 1 atm. The beginning of melting in the ternary system is the reaction albite + <b>villiaumite</b> + vapor ↔ liquid; this occurs at 753 ° ± 5 ° C. at 0. 5 kb., at 688 ° ± 5 ° C. at 1 kb., at 640 ° ± 5 ° C. at 2 kb., at 630 ° ± 5 ° C. at 3 kb., and at 600 ° ± 5 ° C. at 4 kb. The composition of the univariant liquid in the system NaF-H_ 2 O at 1 kb. is approximately 80 wt. per cent NaF and 20 wt. per cent H_ 2 O; the composition of the univariant liquid in the anhydrous system is approximately 84 wt. per cent NaAlSi_ 3 O_ 8 and 16 wt. per cent NaF. The composition of the univariant liquid in the ternary system varies with pressure. At 1 kb. the composition expressed in terms of the anhydrous components is approximately 86 wt. per cent NaAlSi_ 3 O_ 8 and 14 wt. per cent NaF, and the water content is about 30 wt. per cent; at 4 kb. it is approximately 75 wt. per cent NaAlSi_ 3 O_ 8 and 25 wt. per cent NaF, and with a water content of about 45 wt. per cent. Critical conditions are probably reached at a pressure not far above 4 kb. The solubility of the solids in the vapor phase at 4 kb. is about 40 wt. per cent. These results indicate that small variations in NaF content of a silicate magma can produce large variations in the water content of residual magmas and large variations in the amount of water required to saturate the magma. NaF causes residual magmas to persist to significantly lower temperatures than the final consolidation temperature if H_ 2 O were the only dissolved volatile component...|$|E
30|$|Major {{source of}} {{fluoride}} in groundwater is geological formations through which water circulate. Fluoride content in groundwater originates {{primarily from the}} dissolution of fluoride-rich minerals of the bedrock. Fluoride-rich minerals are fluorite, apatite, Mica, amphiboles, clay and <b>villiaumite.</b> In the study area, {{the major source of}} F is gneissic and charnockitic rocks (Sajil Kumar 2012). It is observed that the F concentration was higher during the post-monsoon than the pre-monsoon. This is {{may be due to the}} formation of calcium fluoride (CaF 2) in the pre-monsoon season and its deposition, induced by the higher residence time. A relatively high concentration of Ca in the pre-monsoon than post-monsoon season is supporting this argument.|$|E
40|$|The rare mineral natrophosphate {{has been}} {{identified}} {{for the first time}} in the Ilímaussaq alkaline complex in a drill core from the Kvanefjeld area. It occurs sparsely in zoned veinlets with cores of natrophosphate and borders of fibrous trona. The natrophosphate is more or less smoky, transparent and unaltered. The refractive index n = 1. 448 ± 0. 005 is low compared to that given for the material from the type locality, Khibina alkaline complex, Kola Peninsula; the unit cell parameter a = 27. 76 ± 0. 05 Å is in excellent agreement with that given for the material from the type locality. The veins occur in hyper-agpaitic naujakasite lujavrite; <b>villiaumite</b> is an associated mineral. Only a few water-soluble minerals have so far been found in the Ilímaussaq alkaline complex compared to the wealth of such minerals in the Khibina and Lovozero alkaline com-plexes. This is possibly at least partly due to lack of necessary precautions during sampling...|$|E
3000|$|Fluoride occurs both in igneous and {{metamorphic}} rocks, and {{the minerals}} which {{are part of}} natural formations and bedrocks of aquifers and contain fluoride are amphiboles, micas, certain clays (illite, chlorite), <b>villiaumite</b> (NaF) (Boyle and Chagnon 1995; Apambire et al. 1997), fluorite (CaF 2), fluorapatite, biotite, muscovite (KAl 2 (AlSi 3 O 10)(F,OH) 2), etc. During weathering of these formations and circulation of water around these rocks and soils, fluoride can leach out and dissolve into groundwater and thermal gases. Thus, fluoride content of groundwater varies greatly depending on the geological settings and type of rocks (Brunt et al. 2004). Thus, the bedrock mineralogy of aquifers and host rocks most abundant in fluoride minerals {{can be attributed to}} be major sources of geogenic fluoride contamination in groundwater (Chae et al. 2007). Hydrolysis, dissolution and dissociation reactions that happen over time in natural water systems lead to ion exchange processes which release the fluoride ion into groundwater. Alkaline water systems and minerals containing higher amounts of bicarbonate (HCO_ 3 ^ - [...]) and hydroxyl (OH−) ions in solution or in solid phase result in presence of free fluoride in water. The fluoride ion is similar to the hydroxyl ion in terms of ionic size and chemical properties and, hence, can exchange places during displacement reactions in high pH conditions. Besides the natural factors, certain anthropogenic sources which contribute to fluoride in groundwater are mainly the agriculture industry using high doses of phosphatic fertilizers, clay industries and industries using coal, for e.g., thermal power plants and brick kilns.|$|E
40|$|In this study, an {{extraction}} {{method and}} environmental {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) are employed to reveal {{the changes in the}} occurrence mode of fluorine in a coal-fired power plant in Inner Mongolia, China. The different occurrence states of fluorine during coal combustion and emission show that fluorine in coal mainly assumes insoluble inorganic mineral forms. The results illustrate that the three typical occurrence modes in coal are CaF 2, MgF 2 and AlF 3. The fluorine in fly ash can be captured by an electrostatic precipitator (EPS) or a bag filter. In contrast, the gaseous fluorine content in flue gas is only in the range of several parts per million; thus, it cannot be used in this study. The occurrence mode of fluorine in bottom ash and slag is inorganic <b>villiaumite</b> (e. g., soluble NaF, KF and insoluble CaF 2) which is difficult to break down even at high temperatures. The occurrence mode of fluorine with the highest content in fly ash is physically adsorbed fluorine along the direction of the flue gas flow. The insoluble inorganic mineral fluoride content in fly ash is also high, but the gradually increasing fluorine content in fly ash is mainly caused by physical adsorption. Fluorine in the coal-fired power plant discharges mostly as solid products; however, very little fluorine emitted into the environment as gas products (HF, SiF 4) cannot be captured. The parameters used in this study may provide useful references in developing a monitoring and control system for fluorine in coal-fired power plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressive}} enrichment in volatiles {{and light}} incompatible elements observed during upper-crustal differentiation of granitic and rhyolitic magmas leads to {{significant changes in}} melt physical-chemical properties and {{has important implications for}} ore deposition and volcanic devolatization. Thermodynamic calculations and experimental studies of melting equilibria in the Na 2 O-K 2 O-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -F 2 O- 1 -H 2 O system are used to evaluate mineral stabilities, fluid compositions, the extent of fluoride-silicate liquid-liquid immiscibility, fluorine and water solubility limits and differentiation paths of natural fluorine-bearing silicic magmas. The interaction of fluorine with rock-forming aluminosilicates corresponds to progressive fluorination by the thermodynamic component F 2 O- 1. Formation of fluorine-bearing minerals first occurs in peralkaline and silica-undersaturated systems that buffer fluorine concentrations at very low levels (<b>villiaumite,</b> fluorite). The highest concentrations of fluorine are achieved in peraluminous silica-oversaturated systems, saturated with fluorite or topaz. Thermodynamic models of fluorosilicate melts indicate clustering of silicate tetrahedra in the Na 2 O-SiO 2 -F 2 O- 1 system, whereas initial NaAl-F short-range order evolves into partial O-F disorder in the albite-cryolite system. Experiments performed at 520 - 1100 °C and 0. 1 - 100 MPa completely describe liquidus relations and differentiation paths of fluorine-bearing felsic magmas. Coordination differences and short-range order effects between [NaAl]-F, Na-F vs. Si-O lead to the fluoride-silicate liquid immiscibility, which extends from the silica-cryolite binary through the peralkaline albite-silica-cryolite ternary and closes in multicomponent, topaz-bearing systems owing to the destabilizing effect of increasing peraluminosity. Liquidus relations indicate that fluoride-silicate liquid-liquid immiscibility is inaccessible to quartz-feldspar-saturated granitic mel...|$|E
40|$|A partir del diagrama de estabilidad determinado por FOSTER(1960) para el sistema Al 2 O 3 - Na 3 AlF 6, y aplicando algunas leyes y normas que regulan la cristalización en soluciones acuosas, se ha desarrollado un procedimiento teórico que permite modelizar {{el comportamiento}} de dicho sistema, durante su proceso de cristalización, en forma de corindón y criolita, mediante la técnica conocida comúnmente como "flux growth" (disolución no acuosa de alta temperatura). Los datos empleados para llevar a cabo dicha modelización, se corresponden con las {{variables}} de entrada aplicadas en una serie de experimentos, realizados con esta técnica y con el mismo sistema. La concordancia entre los resultados experimentales obtenidos y las previsiones estimadas teóricamente, pone en evidencia la validez del procedimiento propuesto y constituye una nueva aportación para el conocimiento formal de los procesos implicados en dicha técnica de cristalización. [ABSTRACT] A procedure which allows to foresee theoretically the behaviour of the Al 203 -Na 3 AlF 6 system during its crystallisation process in corundum (AL 203) and cryolite (NA 3 ALF 6) forms by the technique {{commonly known as}} flux growth (high temperature solution) has been developed from ihe stability diagram detennined by FOSTER(1960). It {{has been carried out}} a series of experiments with the same technique and system. The entrance variables of these experiments have been used to develop the theoretical procedure. In all these experiments, corundum (A O) and cryolite (Na 3 AlF 6) crystals have been obtained. Rarely, diaoyudaoita (NaAl 11017) ' <b>villiaumite</b> (NaF) and chiolite (Na 5 Al 3 F 11) have also been obtained. The position which occupies these crystallme phases in the crucible shows the way in which its nueleation and their later growth have taken place: the phases located in the higher part of the crucible nueleated and grew in vapour phase, out of the flux, and the phases located in the lower part were done in solution. The initial alumina andcryolite concentration detennines the exelusive crystallisation of one or the other phase in their stability fields (before reaching the eutectic point). The initial concentration of alumina and cryolite, in relation to the initial temperature, detennines the temperature at which, the first nueleus, in each case, are created. The cryolite concentration in its interval of stability originates in all of the experiments already carried out a solid residue in which two levels of different composition are distinguished: the highest enriched with cryolite and the lowest enriched with corundum. The characteristics of the crystalline aggregates situated in this low level allow to differentiate two fonnation process: one characterized by continuous episodes of primary nueleation in which those nueleus do not increased its size and originate a cryptocrystalline material, and another one characterized by an only episode of heterogeneous nueleation which originates visible crystals in plates and micrometric density fonn. In the eutectic, all the phases which can be crystallised are developed from the components of the residualliquid as their respective equilibrium concentrations are being obtained. [...] - The position of the heating plates in the furnace determine the temperature gradient originated in the working chamber: if the temperature decreases towards the crucible basis, the nueleation of the vapour phase it is not favoured in the highest part of the crucible. Whereas, if the gradient is inverted, the nueleation of the vapour phase takes place in the highest part of the crucibles. This fact varies the proportion between the different components of the system and, in consequence, the theoretic ca 1 culations obtained from them can be fiddled. However, in spite of this possible desviations, it is made clear the concordance between the experimental results obtained and the forecasts theoretically estimated from the procedure proposed. The agreement between experimental and theoretical result supposes an advance for the formal knowledge of the crystallisation process through the "flux" technique...|$|E
