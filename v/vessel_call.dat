The vessel is equipped with a wide array of directive and omnidirectional radio-communications sensors including numerous VHF, UHF, HF and satellite communications antennae, maritime radars and satellite navigation systems.|$|E
40|$|The acrylic vessel as {{constructed}} is dirty. The dirt includes blue tape, Al tape, grease pencil, gemak, the glue or residue form these tapes, finger prints and dust {{of an unknown}} composition but probably mostly acrylic dust. This dirt has to be removed and once removed, the vessel {{has to be kept}} clean or at least to be easily cleanable at some future stage when access becomes much more difficult. The authors report on the results of a series of tests designed: (a) to prepare typical dirty samples of acrylic; (b) to remove dirt stuck to the acrylic surface; and (c) to measure the optical quality and Th concentration after cleaning. Specifications of the <b>vessel</b> <b>call</b> for very low levels of Th which could come from tape residues, the grease pencil, or other sources of dirt. This report does not address the concerns of how to keep the vessel clean after an initial cleaning and during the removal of the scaffolding. Alconox is recommended as the cleaner of choice. This acrylic vessel will be used in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory...|$|E
40|$|Turnaround time in port {{industry}} portrays {{capability and}} ability of container terminal in providing services. This study {{is motivated by}} the rapid development in port container terminal, in providing efficient and effective services and high port productivity, with the aim to achieve optimum port performance. Research arises from the issue between port throughputs (i. e. Teus- Twenty Footer Equivalent Unit) and port facilities (e. g. quay crane, prime movers etc), as currently {{it is not possible}} to determine significant factor(s) that influence port performance, in terms of turnaround time. For this purpose, the research proposes a regression model that relates these variables, i. e. turnaround time and port facilities. Two ports in Port Klang – Westport and Northport – are used as the subjects from which actual <b>vessel</b> <b>call</b> data collected between August 1 and August 31, 2005 are used. The results show that vessel turnaround time is highly correlated with crane allocation as well as the number of containers loaded and discharged. The benefits of such model include giving port operators opportunity to determine optimum crane allocation to achieve the desired turnaround time given the quantity of containers to be processed...|$|E

30|$|As {{a result}} {{and based on}} Fig.  1, the global port-urban {{database}} consisted in 529 urban areas having at least one <b>vessel</b> <b>call</b> between 1950 and 1990, such cities being directly matched with a port (a and b in Fig.  1). This amount increased to 628 when matching additional ports to the closest urban area (c and inland in Fig.  1). These 628 cities concentrated a growing share {{of the total number}} of ports in the maritime database, from 51  % in 1950 to 63  % in 1990, but a slightly declining share of total world population (from 53 to 47  %) and world vessel calls (from 82 to 78  %). The additional hundred cities added a mere 14  % of world traffic to the sample on average compared with the 529 cities. Despite the drop in traffic share, the latter remains very high and suggest that most of the world’s maritime activity in fact concentrates at a limited number of urban places. Such a preliminary result already answers, at least partly, the initial hypothesis as a very high proportion of maritime flows concentrate at larger cities. The slight decline over the period is attributable to the exclusion of smaller cities from the Geopolis database, which tended to attract more traffic over time. In addition, we calculated that the urban areas under study are three times larger on average than other cities in terms of demographic size.|$|E
40|$|Small {{container}} ports rely on {{feeder services}} from hub ports {{to provide access}} to unitised trade flows for their hinterlands. They generally possess limited water depth and handling facilities, as investments required to handle larger vessels are not justified by their low container throughput. This paper questions the future of small ports due to larger vessels cascading down as a result of ever-larger vessels on the major trade lanes. The paper uses <b>vessel</b> <b>call</b> data to identify all world ports currently served by sub- 1, 000 TEU vessels. Data on the dimensions of the vessel fleet and order book are analysed in conjunction with accessibility constraints at these small ports. Results show that with 15 % of the sub- 1, 000 TEU fleet currently laid up and very few on order, larger feeders with deeper drafts seem certain to serve at least some of these routes. But with 90 container ports (21 %) having berth depth of less than 9. 1 m and the need to accommodate design drafts of at least 8. 7 m, larger vessels will threaten the viability of these ports unless they commit significant investment. A geographical analysis is also conducted, mapping the distribution of small ports across the globe and classifying coastal, estuary, river and island locations, as well as identifying clusters of small ports that could in future be served by second-tier hubs, such as Southeast Asia and the Baltic Sea. Findings suggest that, just as container ports at the larger end of the scale were rationalised as flows concentrated at major hubs, several drivers exist for the same process to occur at small ports. Consequently, the paper asks how small ports and local shippers will cope, whether such ports lose their connections entirely, if local shippers must pay for an additional handling cost to tranship a second time from large feeder to small feeder, or whether they rely on overland transport links.
