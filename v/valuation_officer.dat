40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the connection between}} shareholdings by different groups of corporate officers (insiders and outsiders), and market valuation in South Africa. Specifically, and distinctively, we {{examine the effect of}} shareholdings by employees, chief executive officers, chief financial officers, other executive directors, and non-executive (outside) directors on market valuation. Consistent with past evidence, we find that total ownership by all corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) has a positive effect on market valuation. However, when we examine the link between ownership by individual groups of corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) and market valuation, our results suggest that firms with higher ownership by chief executive officers and other executive directors have lower market valuation, but we do not find any evidence that ownership by chief financial officers has any significant effect on market valuation, except when interacted with ownership by CEOs. In contrast, we find that ownership by employees and non-executive (outside) directors has a positive effect on market valuation. The central tenor of our evidence remains largely unchanged across a number of econometric models that sufficiently address different types of endogeneities and market valuation measures. Overall, our findings are generally consistent with the predictions of agency theory.

40|$|From 1988 to 2003, {{the average}} change in {{managerial}} ownership is significantly negative {{every year for}} American firms. We find that managers {{are more likely to}} significantly decrease their ownership when their firms are performing well and more likely to increase their ownership when their firms become financially constrained. When controlling for past stock returns, we find that large increases in managerial ownership increase Tobin's q. This result is driven by increases in shares held by officers, while increases in shares held by directors appear unrelated to changes in firm value. There is no evidence that large decreases in ownership have an adverse impact on firm value. We rely on the dynamics of the managerial ownership/firm value relation to mitigate concerns in the literature about the endogeneity of managerial ownership.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The {{advent of}} {{democracy}} in South Africa in 1994 brought new challenges in transformation including service delivery and economic development. In order to address these challenges, the new government adopted the approach of bringing government to the people through the decentralization of decision making and devolution of powers and functions. The vehicle through which {{this was to be}} done was the institution of wall to wall municipalities referred to as 'local government'. In other words, unlike in the past, all areas of South Africa including rural areas were incorporated into local government structures which were charged with the functions of service delivery and development. In order for these municipalities to carry out their mandates they were classified as 'developmental local governments' and not merely administrative units. They are also autonomous spheres of government. It was clear from the onset that one of the major constraints faced by the newly created municipalities in achieving their developmental objectives is insufficient financial resources. In terms of the constitution of the country, the municipalities have access to equitable shares from the national coffers and conditional grants from both the national and provincial governments. These are however insufficient {{in the light of the}} inherited service delivery and developmental backlogs coupled with the high expectations and impatience of their people who had long been denied these services and developments. Consequently, local government had to find other sources of revenue. One of such sources was to charge service user fees. However considering the state of poverty and unemployment prevailing in most of these municipalities, the revenue base here is very limited. To broaden their tax bases therefore, it became necessary to implement property taxation systems. As a result, the Local Government: Municipal Property Rates Act, 2004 was promulgated. However, the implementation of the new Act brought along its own problems for local government. Among these is either lack of or insufficient capacity in various areas of implementation. This study has identified such areas as human resource capacities, institutional and environmental capacities and capabilities. International experience has shown that property valuation and collection are the two key success factors within a Property tax administration system. It is also accepted that the administration of the various phases of property taxation rests almost entirely upon the skill and competence of municipal officials. Unfortunately most of the municipalities are incapacitated in these vital areas. To make matters worse, a lot of the municipal areas are operating in environments characterized by abject poverty and unemployment thus seriously narrowing the tax base. Another problem identified is the difficulty of identifying and assessing properties in traditional or tribal areas where communal ownership of property is dominant. This study therefore has concluded that a lot of the municipalities are not yet sufficiently capacitated to implement the Property Act, 2004. In order for them to be able to implement it efficiently as demanded by the Act and the Constitution, they need to, among other things, design and implement appropriate training programmes for their officials, acquire the necessary technology, develop effective property management information systems, develop billing systems, pass relevant by-laws and muster the political will to assess and collect taxes on properties in their areas of jurisdiction. The sampling type used in the study is the criterion purposive sampling. This means that only municipal officials directly involved in the administration of the Act (which was the criterion used) were selected for the sample used in the survey. A total of 117 officials made of all municipal managers, chief financial officers and the senior <b>valuation</b> <b>officers</b> of each municipality were surveyed through self-administered questionnaires. It is therefore noted that the findings are limited to the chosen sites and as such any transfer of findings to other areas require further research. Master...|$|R
50|$|In {{the leading}} case of Gilbert (<b>Valuation</b> <b>Officer)</b> v Hickinbottom & Sons Ltd 1956, Lord Denning said:The case {{therefore}} raises the important question: What {{is a separate}} hereditament for rating purposes? The statutes contain no definition, but the practice, which has prevailed for many years past, warrants the following general rulesWhere two or more properties are within the same curtilage or contiguous to one another, and {{are in the same}} occupation, they are as a general rule to be treated for rating purposes as if they formed parts of a single hereditament. There are exceptional cases, however, where for some special reason they may be treated as two or more hereditaments.Where the two properties are in the same occupation but are not within the same curtilage nor contiguous to one another, each of them must as a general rule be treated as a separate hereditament for rating purposes: and this is the case even though they are used by the occupier for the purposes of his one whole business.|$|E
50|$|Starting on 1 April 1990, {{a rating}} list for each local {{authority}} was compiled. Although there is technically a separate list for each authority, {{it is common}} to refer to the aggregate of the lists as, for example, the 1990 Rating List. Rating lists are maintained during their lifetime to reflect changes in properties, and new lists are compiled every five years. The current list came into force on 1 April 2010.As well as local lists, there are a small number of central rating lists, used to assess properties that would otherwise span multiple lists, such as railway or telephone networks.A rating list is required to identify each relevant non-domestic property in the area, and assign a rateable value, based on a rental valuation of the property. Some types of property, such as public utilities, are valued using a statutory formula instead.The task of compiling and maintaining the list is given to the <b>valuation</b> <b>officer</b> for each authority, who in practice is a civil servant of the Valuation Office Agency, an Executive Agency of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.|$|E

This study is conducted to identify the effect of training programmes towards the level of knowledge of the personnel involved in stamp duty valuation. Due to its importance of the provision of the training programmes given to the personnel of an organization, hence, an investigation related {{to the effect of}} the content of the training programmes towards the knowledge of the personnel of JPPH in stamp duty valuation has been conducted. This is to identify if the content of the training programmes conducted by the National Institute of Valuation (INSPEN) towards the personnel of JPPH has ensured effectiveness and has ensured the fulfillment of the requirement of the personnel in executing their tasks effectively. This study has been conducted focusing on stamp duty involving six (6) offices of the JPPH within Klang Valley that has included the District Valuer, <b>Valuation</b> <b>Officer</b> and Assistant <b>Valuation</b> <b>Officer,</b> who are engaged in the valuation process of stamp duty, as respondents. Interview approach, pilot study, content analysis, application of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been employed to achieve the main objective of this study. AHP which has been used in this study, is to determine the relative importance of the level of knowledge of the personnel in JPPH and also acts as the instrument that can be applied as a guide in the effort to improve the performance in the content of training programmes to fulfill the expectation and requirement of the personnel during the valuation process of the stamp duty. In summary, this study has proven that there is strong relationship between knowledge contained in the training programmes content with the level of knowledge of the personnel in stamp duty valuation...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of tariff {{policies}} on evasion of customs duties, {{in the context of the}} trade reform in India of the 1990 s. We exploit the variation in tariff rates across time and products to identify the evasion elasticity, namely, {{the effect of}} tariffs on evasion, and relate this elasticity to factors related to customs enforcement or the quality of customs institutions. We find a positive and robust effect of tariffs on import tax evasion. We then show that the evasion elasticity is influenced by certain product characteristics that determine how easy it is to detect evasion (with more differentiated products exhibiting a higher evasion elasticity). This evasion elasticity, which we broadly interpret as reflecting the quality of customs administration, has not improved over the 1990 s. Finally, our results suggest that the effectiveness of customs in addressing evasion may be better in India than China, although China appears to be catching up over time.

Shifts in real estate activities from individual to corporate participation however have evolved real estate education towards more dynamic and proactive learning process. The paper presents the current issues of real estate education in Malaysia including the consequences of REITs listing, managing corporate real estate for non-real estate companies {{and the perception of}} real estate investment with other investment means. In order to cater for the changing needs, real estate education should transform for a new paradigm focusing more on real estate investment and decisions. The direction of real estate education must also emphasise on real estate asset management, marketing, market research and decision-making. Currently, the main shortcoming of real estate discipline is the unstable of real estate data and information which affect real estate decision-making. However, shifting towards a new direction in real estate education requires collaboration from institution of higher learning. This means that institution offering courses in real estate should complement one another. In Malaysia, this was done with the formation of REER (Real Estate Educators and Researchers) forum where educators and researchers in real estate discuss together concerning important issues of real estate education...|$|E
