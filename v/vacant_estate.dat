The move to Vail Manor was completed on June 30, 1951, {{the final day of the}} school's lease at Lyndon Institute.|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} Vicksburg, Mississippi {{fell to the}} Union in 1863, most {{planters}} in the Lake Providence area had fled and left behind their <b>vacant</b> <b>estates.</b> The historian John D. Winters, who was reared in Lake Providence, wrote in the mid-20th century about this period:The long line of abandoned plantations was then leased by the army and treasury agents to carpetbaggers and to southerners who took the oath of allegiance (known as scalawags). Since the necessary Negro labor, farming implements, and mules were provided by the army, lessees were responsible only for feeding and clothing the Negroes until the harvest, when they paid off their obligations to the army and to the laborers, Yearly expenses ran between $5,000 and $30,000 on a plantation of a thousand acres, while profits might run higher than $200,000. There was little trouble finding lessees for the plantations.|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} student {{housing in the}} Netherlands is {{increasing}} due to the current economy and government measures. Furthermore, based on the annual report of TU Delft of 2010, a scenario has been sketched that shows a relatively large vacancy on campus. This research combines these two problems and explores whether <b>vacant</b> campus real <b>estate,</b> in this case of the TU Delft, can be transformed to student housing.

40|$|Cities face many {{environmental}} challenges, including {{air and water}} quality issues, lack of sufficient green space, excess heat capture, polluted stormwater runoff and lack of ecological biodiversity. Urban agriculture presents {{a unique opportunity to}} utilize vacant or idle land and rooftops throughout cities for the production of healthy, pesticide-free food. Adding green spaces to a neighborhood, including community gardens and urban farms, is known to provide a number of social, health, economic and environmental benefits. Unfortunately, most studies have neglected to analyze the potential contributions of urban agriculture to improvement of ecological sustainability in cities. This study used a multi-pronged approach to examine the environmental benefits of urban agriculture on unused, <b>vacant</b> real <b>estate</b> or rooftops as compared to the alternative of leaving the land or space in its current state...|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} decade, {{a high level}} of {{structurally}} vacant office buildings has characterised the Dutch real estate market. In 2010 the minister of housing, spatial planning and the environment (VROM), Tineke Huizinga, presented a report on the scale of office vacancy and took the initiative to start a taskforce to reduce the vacancy. The former ministers meddling {{in the state of the}} office market is a sign that structural vacancy is seen as a national and societal problem and not only a problem for the owners of <b>vacant</b> property.

50|$|During {{both the}} First World War and Second World War nearby Hornchurch Airfield was an {{important}} RAF station; it was known as RAF Suttons Farm during the Great War, with its HQ {{as far away as}} Upminster Hall. During the Second World War, the airfield was known as RAF Hornchurch, and was home mostly to a number of Spitfire squadrons, with an advanced sub-station at Rayleigh. The land has since been reused for a large housing development and Hornchurch Country Park. During the First World War a large <b>vacant</b> country <b>estate</b> called Grey Towers on Hornchurch Road was commandeered by the Army Council as a military depot. In January 1916 it became the first Command Depot for the New Zealand Contingent in Britain but was found to be more suitable as a Convalescent Hospital Camp for New Zealand Servicemen, and was run as such until June, 1919. Like most suburbs of London, Hornchurch had been entirely rural until the arrival of the railway which spurred huge property development during the early 1900s. Whole estates were constructed such as Emerson Park to the north. Development was fuelled further by the arrival of the electrified District line during the 1930s with inter and post war housing developments south and west of Hornchurch in places such as Elm Park.|$|R
5000|$|Louis's {{plans for}} the estate {{came to an abrupt}} halt the {{following}} year, on his sudden death in January, 1886. He was 37 years old when he died, leaving behind a widow and five children. After Louis's death, the stock farm was disbanded and the horses sold, and Nina Dousman renamed the estate [...] "Villa Louis" [...] in memory of her late husband. Later, in 1888, Nina remarried and moved to New York City, leaving the <b>estate</b> <b>vacant.</b> Her new marriage did not last, and in 1893 she returned with the five Dousman children to the Midwest. Villa Louis was then used as the family's summer home into the early 20th century. Louis de Vierville Dousman, the only son of Louis and Nina, was the last family member to occupy the estate, leaving for Billings, Montana in 1913 with his wife Sarah Easton.|$|R
5000|$|A ghost estate (Eastát na Sí, [...] "Fairy estate") is an unoccupied housing estate, {{particularly}} one {{built in}} the :Republic of Ireland {{during the period of}} economic growth when the Irish economy was known as the Celtic tiger. A massive surplus of housing, combined with the late-2000s recession, resulted in a large number of estates being abandoned, unoccupied or uncompleted. In 2010 there were more than 600 ghost estates in Ireland, and a government agency report estimated the number of empty homes in Ireland at greater than 300,000. The National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis defines a ghost estate as developments of [...] "ten or more houses where 50% of the properties are either vacant or under-construction", which therefore does not fully cover the total number of unfinished estates. The 2011 Census lists the number of empty homes to be around 230,000 (excluding the 60,000 holiday homes), around 26% of which are apartments, despite the fact that only 11% of the occupied homes are apartments. Of the 230,000 empty homes in the 2011 census, around 10% of these were in ghost estates. In November 2013, the number of vacant units in unfinished estates was 6,350. As at December 2014 there were 5,563 vacant homes in unfinished estates, however this figure is revised down to 4,453 homes (in the report for unfinished housing developments) as the difference is 1,110 <b>vacant</b> homes in <b>estates</b> no longer deemed to be unfinished. This means that the number of vacant homes in unfinished estates in 2014 had decreased by 30% in one year. [...] The report for 2015 lists the number of vacant homes in unfinished estates to be 2,542. Vacant homes do not include derelict houses and homes under construction.|$|R
