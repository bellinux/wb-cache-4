50|$|Many {{parts were}} {{interchangeable}} between the Type A, Type B and Type C engines (e.g. pistons, <b>valves,</b> <b>rods).</b> Many {{of the same}} parts were also interchangeable with the Chevrolet Stovebolt engine, from which it was derived.|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} {{unusual for a}} 0-4-0. The well tank engine has a long {{wheelbase}} and the driving axle is behind the firebox, which prevents {{the use of a}} conventional valve gear layout. Consequently, the Allan valve gear is driven from the leading coupled axle and doubled back to connect to the <b>valve</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were directly}} below the smokebox and moderately inclined, with all four cylinders {{driving on the}} third axle. The crosshead was, unusually, a single bar type. Walschaerts valve gear was used. The piston rods are particularly long, allowing space for a rocker arm on the <b>valve</b> <b>rods,</b> between the <b>valve</b> chest and the combination lever, to drive the inner valves.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of gab {{valve gear}} or 'gab clutch' {{was a simple}} notch in the <b>valve</b> <b>rod,</b> where it hooked over the valve spindle. A hand lever allowed this notch to be lifted, thus disengaging the valve drive and promptly stopping the engine.|$|E
50|$|The valvegear {{actuating}} the valve was very simple. Each piston had two parallel connecting rods, working on separated crankpin journals between the same crank webs. An eccentric {{between the two}} crankpins drove the centrally-mounted valve spindle by another short connecting rod. Because {{of the need to}} allow the <b>valve</b> <b>rod</b> to pass through between them, the piston had two overhung stub gudgeon pins, rather than a single through pin.|$|E
50|$|Their {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the plate frames. The Murdoch's D slide valves, mounted above the cylinders, were arranged at an incline and were actuated by Allan straight link motion. In {{this type of}} valve gear, the <b>valve</b> <b>rod</b> and the expansion link are respectively connected to opposing arms on the reversing shaft, so that partial rotation of the shaft moves the link and the die block in opposite directions.|$|E

50|$|Like most {{engines of}} the era, the OX-5's {{high-temperature}} areas were built mostly of cast iron, using individual cylinders bolted {{to a single}} aluminum crankcase, wrapped in a cooling jacket made of a nickel-copper alloy. Later versions used a brazed-on steel jacket instead. Cylinder heads were also attached to the crankcase, using X-shaped tie-downs {{on the top of}} the head attached to the block via four long bolts. Fuel was carbureted near the rear of the engine, then piped to the cylinders via two T-shaped pipes, the cylinders being arranged so the intake ports of any two in a bank were near each other. The cylinders had one intake and one exhaust valve, each operated by a pushrod from a camshaft running between the banks. This arrangement caused the outer exhaust valves to have a rather long rocker arm. The pushrods were arranged one inside the other, the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>rod</b> being on the inside and the intake <b>valve</b> <b>rod</b> a tube around it. The aluminum camshaft bearings were a split type bolted together and held in place by lock screws. The pistons were cast aluminum.|$|E
50|$|The first {{locomotive}} gab {{gears used}} two 'open' gabs, side by side, each potentially (when engaged) hooking {{over the same}} pin. If both gabs were ever engaged simultaneously these would jam, probably damaging the <b>valve</b> <b>rod.</b> On the footplate of a rattling locomotive with no suspension and a poor trackbed, this {{is known to have}} been the cause of breakdowns, whether by driver error or by a loose gab slipping into accidental engagement. As the gabs, unlike in the stationary engine, were remote from the driver they were provided with wide V-shaped jaws to help them engage with the pins.|$|E
5000|$|In areas {{subject to}} {{freezing}} temperatures, {{only a portion}} of the hydrant is above ground. The valve is located below the frost line and connected by a [...] to the above-ground portion. A <b>valve</b> <b>rod</b> extends from the valve up through a seal {{at the top of the}} hydrant, where it can be operated with the proper wrench. This design is known as a [...] "dry barrel" [...] hydrant, in that the barrel, or vertical body of the hydrant, is normally dry. A drain valve underground opens when the water valve is completely closed; this allows all water to drain from the hydrant body to prevent the hydrant from freezing.|$|E

The main engines were of the 4-cylinder triple expansion 4-crank type, balanced on the Yarrow-Tweedy-Slick system, the cylinders being as follows:The common stroke was 30 in. The piston and slide <b>valve</b> <b>rods</b> were all fitted with metallic packing to the stuffing boxes, and all pistons fitted with packing rings and springs. The high-pressure valve was of the piston type, whilst the remaining ones were of the balanced type. The main engines were designed to develop [...] at 185 rpm continuously.|$|R

500|$|Holcroft’s {{valve gear}} design {{was also an}} attempt to address the {{problems}} associated with Gresley’s conjugated valve gear, which was prone to variations in valve events caused by heat expansion of the valve spindles within the pistons. The design utilised the motion of the outside <b>valve</b> <b>rods</b> (the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves, such as the combination lever) instead, although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate the rocking arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity. Holcroft’s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the pony truck and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside <b>valve</b> <b>rods</b> with extension levers, which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances. This necessitated a new design of cylinder block whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards {{and the size of the}} cylinders reduced to [...] stroke and diameter. [...] The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2-cylinder locomotives, thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the extension levers. The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front pony truck, leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft’s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service.|$|R
5000|$|The Hackworth {{valve gear}} is a design of valve gear used to {{regulate}} the flow of steam to the pistons in steam engines. It is a radial gear, with an actuating lever driven from the crank. The drive may be taken directly from the crank (top picture) or indirectly via a return crank (lower picture). The {{other end of the}} actuating lever is attached to a die block which slides in a slotted link. When the link is vertical, the engine is in mid-gear. Forward, reverse and cut-off adjustments are made by moving the link away from the vertical. The <b>valve</b> <b>rod</b> is pivoted to a point on the actuating lever.|$|E
50|$|The best-known {{design of}} {{expansion}} valve was the Meyer, {{the invention of}} French engineer Jean-Jacques Meyer (1804-1877) who applied for a patent on 20 October 1841. A similar valve was patented by James Morris. A second slide valve rides {{on the back of}} an adapted main slide valve and is driven by an additional eccentric. In the Meyer valve, the effective length of the expansion valve can be altered with a handwheel whilst the engine is running. The valve has two heads mounted on left- and right-handed threads on the handwheel's <b>valve</b> <b>rod,</b> so that rotating the wheel moves the heads either together or apart. In this arrangement the cut-off is normally controlled manually. Although automatic control was attempted, it was too slow-acting to be effective.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1830s {{the most}} popular valve drive for {{locomotives}} was known as gab motion in the U.K. and V-hook motion in the U.S.A. The gab motion incorporated two sets of eccentrics and rods for each cylinder; one eccentric was set to give forward and the other backwards motion to the engine and {{one or the other}} could accordingly engage with a pin driving the distribution valve by means of the gabs: - vee-shaped ends to the eccentric rods supposed to catch the rocker driving the <b>valve</b> <b>rod</b> whatever its position. It was a clumsy mechanism, difficult to operate, and only gave fixed valve events. In 1841 two employees in Stephenson’s locomotive works, draughtsman William Howe and pattern-maker William Williams, suggested the simple expedient of replacing the gabs with a vertical slotted link, pivoted at both ends to the tips of the eccentric rods. To change direction, the link and rod ends were bodily raised or lowered by means of a counterbalanced bell crank worked by a reach rod that connected it to the reversing lever. This not only simplified reversing but it was realised that the gear could be raised or lowered in small increments, and thus the combined motion from the “forward” and “back” eccentrics in differing proportions would impart shorter travel to the valve, cutting off admission steam earlier in the stroke and using a smaller amount steam expansively in the cylinder, using its own energy rather than continuing to draw from the boiler. It became the practice to start the engine or climb gradients at long cutoff, usually about 70-80% maximum of the power stroke and to shorten the cutoff as momentum was gained to benefit from the economy of expansive working and the effect of increased lead and higher compression {{at the end of each}} stroke. This process was popularly known as [...] "linking up" [...] or “notching up”, the latter because the reversing lever could be held in precise positions by means of a catch on the lever engaging notches in a quadrant; the term stuck even after the introduction of the screw reverser. A further intrinsic advantage of the Stephenson gear not found in most other types was variable lead. Depending on how the gear was laid out, it was possible to considerably reduce compression and back pressure at the end of each piston stroke when working at low speed in full gear; once again as momentum was gained and cutoff shortened, so lead was automatically advanced and compression increased, cushioning the piston at the end of each stroke and heating the remaining trapped steam in order to avoid temperature drop in the fresh charge of incoming admission steam.|$|E

The <b>Valve</b> Hot <b>Rod</b> and <b>Valve</b> Senior were released in 2009. The <b>Valve</b> Hot <b>Rod</b> is a 5 watt amp like the Valve Junior, but has a gain and reverb control.

50|$|The engine used Richardson slide valves, {{arranged}} {{above the}} cylinders and actuated by the Stephenson motion and rocker shafts. The eccentrics were fitted to the trailing coupled wheel axle, {{which resulted in}} exceptionally long <b>valve</b> connecting <b>rods</b> of 7 ft.|$|R
50|$|These {{enable a}} 3-cylinder or 4-cylinder {{locomotive}} {{to be built}} with only two sets of valve gear. The best known is Gresley conjugated valve gear, used on 3-cylinder locomotives. Walschaerts gear is usually used for the two outside cylinders. Two levers connected to the outside cylinder <b>valve</b> <b>rods</b> drive the <b>valve</b> for the inside cylinder. Harold Holcroft devised a different method for conjugating valve gear by linking the middle cylinder to the combination lever assembly of an outside cylinder, creating the Holcroft valve gear derivative.

If no action is taken to stop a kick once it begins, then the fluids will be pushed out of the borehole and will be flowing uncontrollably to surface (blow-out). Blow-out is prevented by closing off the well at the surface with special kind of valves (Blow-out Preventers - BOPs). When pressure control over the well is lost, swift action must be taken to avert the severe consequences. These consequences may include: — endangering of human life, — loss of rig and equipment, — negative influence on the environment, — additional costs of bringing the well under control again, — loss of reservoir production.

50|$|The {{class were}} {{fitted with a}} steam chest and slide valves located beneath the cylinders. The valves were driven by Stephenson valve gear. This {{inverted}} arrangement of slide valves and steam chest, originally introduced by William Stroudley of the LSBCR, allowed the valves to drop away from the cylinder's steam port faces when the regulator was closed, thus reducing wear. Because the steam chest was below the cylinders, and not between them, the latter could have an increased diameter. The centre line of the cylinders was inclined at an angle of 6° to the centre line of the valves, each centre line being aligned with the driving centre. This arrangement allowed the <b>valve</b> <b>rods</b> to be driven directly from the expansion link. First used on the Armstrong and 3031 Classes, this arrangement of cylinders, valves and valve gear was subsequently used on all GWR outside framed 4-4-0s, with the slide valves being eventually replaced by piston valves.|$|R
50|$|On {{the front}} end of the cranks, there are 30-degree {{inclined}} rods that are connected to the inclined plungers of the pump proper. The unusual diagonal plungers were created in part by the limitation of the existing engine room. The crank configuration is set in a way that the 6 ft stroke is reduced to 4 ft stroke for the inclined rods. Each plunger pumps water in two pump chambers with total of six chambers for the pumping engine. With the reduction of the strokes and the relation of diameters, a higher capacity for pressure can be achieved. The efficiency of the engine also comes from the design of the pump valves by Prof. Riedler. The pump valves which are connected rings that can move up and down to open can close the valves. The pump valve mechanism is controlled by a diagonal rod, powered from a 12 ft stroke horizontal rod which is connected the crank. The <b>valve</b> <b>rods</b> only close the valves on the reverse stroke and leave the valves free to open automatically to increase the speed of the operation.|$|R
