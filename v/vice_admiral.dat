50|$|In Elizabethan {{times the}} fleet grew {{large enough to}} be {{organised}} into squadrons. The squadron’s admiral wore a red ensign, the <b>vice</b> <b>admirals</b> white, and the rear admirals blue.

Joy's superior was General of the Army Douglas MacArthur of the United Nations Command Korea (UNC). As such, Radford exercised no direct responsibility over forces involved in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The Formosa Air Battle {{also proved}} {{a turning point}} for Japanese {{military}} tactics. Organized kamikaze attacks had been proposed after the First Battle of the Philippine Sea but were rejected by Imperial Japanese Navy leaders through September 1944. Only in the immediate wake of the Formosa Air Battle, when <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral</b> Takijirō Ōnishi replaced <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral</b> Kimpei Teraoka as leader of the IJN's 1st Air Fleet, were units specifically deployed with the intent to crash-dive enemy vessels.|$|E

The ships arrived on 21 February at Lingga Island, near Singapore, and the ship became the flagship of <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral</b> Matome Ugaki, commander of Battleship Division 1, on 25 February until he transferred his flag to Yamato on 5 May. Aside from a brief refit at Singapore, the ship remained at Lingga training until 11 May when she was transferred to Tawitawi on 12 May.

5|$|As neither Lussin or {{the earlier}} Zara-class cruisers met the {{requirements}} of the Marinesektion, <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral</b> Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck, who had replaced Pöck in November 1883, decided that further torpedo cruisers would be ordered from more experienced, foreign shipyards. The first of these new vessels, the , were ordered from the British firm Armstrong Whitworth in 1884.|$|E
5|$|By 10 October Toyoda's tour of {{the front}} was complete. He {{intended}} to depart from Formosa for Japan that same day but was forced to change his plans when <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral</b> Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force suddenly appeared to the north, launching strikes against the Ryukyu Islands. Toyoda could not risk a return trip home through a concentrated enemy carrier force that now embarked more than 1,000 aircraft, especially not after previous Combined Fleet commanders had been lost during aerial engagements. As a result, he was grounded far from Combined Fleet headquarters at a decisive moment. Out of position and with inadequate lines of communication, the response to such overwhelming enemy air power was left to Toyoda's Chief of Staff, <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral</b> Ryūnosuke Kusaka.|$|E
50|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Saalwächter received command of Marine-Gruppenkommando West and was responsible for operations in the North Sea, which led to disputes {{between himself and the}} fleet commanders, <b>Vice</b> <b>Admirals</b> Hermann Boehm, Wilhelm Marschall, and Günther Lütjens.|$|R

Shortly before Gallery's retirement, the custom of [...] "tombstone promotion" [...] was abolished. So {{he was one of}} the few rear admirals of his era to be retired as only a rear admiral. Most of his contemporaries retired as <b>vice</b> <b>admirals.</b>|$|R
5|$|Following the war, the Allies prosecuted the {{officers}} {{responsible for the}} murders on board Tone. <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral</b> Takasu had died from disease in September 1944, but Sakonju was tried by the British in 1947 at Hong Kong and sentenced to death. Mayuzumi was also convicted {{for his role in}} the killings and sentenced to seven years imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|For MacArthur's long-awaited {{return to}} the Philippines in October 1944, the Seventh Fleet was massively {{reinforced}} by Nimitz's Pacific Fleet. Kinkaid commanded the assault personally, with Barbey's VII Amphibious Force as Task Force 78, joined by <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral</b> Theodore S. Wilkinson's III Amphibious Force from the Pacific Fleet as Task Force 79. Kinkaid was also given Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Task Force 77.2, a bombardment force built around six old battleships that had survived the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague's Task Force 77.4, a force of escort carriers. However, <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral</b> Marc Mitscher's Task Force 38, the covering force of the fast carriers and battleships, remained part of Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet, which was not under MacArthur or Kinkaid's command.|$|E
5|$|Halsey's orders, {{which gave}} {{priority}} {{to the destruction of}} the Japanese fleet, led to the most controversial episode of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Four Japanese task forces converged on Kinkaid's forces in Leyte Gulf: a carrier task force under <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral</b> Jisaburō Ozawa, from the north; a force under <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral</b> Takeo Kurita through the Sibuyan Sea; and two task forces commanded by Vice Admirals Shōji Nishimura and Kiyohide Shima, which approached via the Surigao Strait. Carrier aircraft from Task Force 38 engaged Kurita in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, and forced him to withdraw. In a controversial decision, Halsey concluded that Kurita was no longer a threat and headed north after Ozawa's force but, due to a misunderstanding, Kinkaid believed that Halsey was still guarding the San Bernardino Strait. Kinkaid deployed all available Seventh Fleet vessels in the Surigao Strait under Oldendorf facing Nishimura and Shima.|$|E
5000|$|With the Russian {{army and}} its {{commander}} Prince Menshikov gone, the defence of Sevastopol {{was led by}} <b>Vice</b> <b>Admirals</b> Vladimir Alexeyevich Kornilov and Pavel Nakhimov, assisted by Menshikov's chief engineer, Lieutenant Colonel Eduard Totleben. [...] The military forces available to defend the city were 4,500 militia, 2,700 gunners, 4,400 marines, 18,500 naval seamen, and 5,000 workmen, totalling just over 35,000 men.|$|R
50|$|General Order 325 {{identified}} the colleges first president as Commodore Stephen B. Luce, who took {{office on the}} day Chandler signed the order. No commander ever has served as president, and the last captain to serve as president left the position in 1913, after which all presidents have been flag officers. Since 1948, all presidents of the Naval War College have been <b>vice</b> <b>admirals</b> or rear admirals.|$|R
50|$|The Ottomans {{began to}} bear away and by 6 p.m. were in full retreat. The Russians {{followed}} closely, inflicting much damage - in particular, the Ottoman <b>Vice</b> <b>Admiral's</b> ship {{was attacked by}} Ioann Bogoslov, and the Admiral's and Rear-Admiral's ships by Rozhdestvo Christovo and Preobrazhenie Gospodne. The Ottomans speed allowed them to get away though, and soon after 8 p.m. firing ceased and the Russians anchored.|$|R
