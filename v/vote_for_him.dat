5|$|In 2016, Edwards co-hosted a Super Tuesday {{broadcast}} that interviewed Donald Trump Jr., {{the son of}} Republican party {{presidential candidate}} Donald Trump. Edwards praised the elder Trump and encouraged his supporters to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1823, Wickliffe {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives and served five {{consecutive}} terms. Again he succeeded his cousin and friend, Ben Hardin. Though a Whig, he disagreed with many of the positions of the party's founder, Henry Clay. When no candidate received a majority of the electoral votes in the 1824 presidential election, the constitution mandated that the election be decided in the House. Wickliffe bucked Clay's advice to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and instead voted for Andrew Jackson, who was the choice of the Kentucky legislature.|$|E
5|$|John Boehner, {{a member}} of the Republican Party from Ohio, served as the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives from February 2006 until January 2007. As the Democratic Party assumed control of the House {{following}} the 2006 elections, Boehner served as Minority Leader from January 2007 until January 2011. When Republicans reassumed control of the House of Representatives in January 2011, Boehner was elected as Speaker, with the votes of all 241 of his fellow Republicans. In 2014, some House Republicans reached out to Ben Carson about his interest in becoming Speaker should they be able to oust Boehner; Carson declined, citing his impending candidacy for president. Boehner's Republican opponents formed a congressional caucus, called the Freedom Caucus, in January 2015 to focus their opposition. Though Boehner was reelected as Speaker {{at the beginning of the}} 114th United States Congress that month, 25 conservative members of the Republican caucus did not <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida, received 12 votes.|$|E
50|$|Note: Alexander Ovechkin {{was listed}} as a Left Wing but played the {{majority}} of his games at Right Wing. Some members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> at Left Wing while others <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> at Right Wing and consequently, Ovechkin placed twice on the NHL All-Star team.|$|R

5|$|The Democratic-Republican congressional caucus convened February 25, 1804. Contrary to {{previous}} conventions, the proceedings were open and formal. Afraid that taking vice presidential nominations {{from the floor}} would precipitate divisive oratory, chairman Stephen Bradley called for open balloting for the nomination. New York's George Clinton received a majority with 67 votes; Breckinridge garnered 20 votes, mostly from western delegates, and the remaining votes were scattered among 4 other candidates. Historian James C. Klotter concluded that the solons felt a ticket composed of Jefferson, a Virginian, and Breckinridge, a former Virginian, made little political sense. Breckinridge acceded to the choice; some reports hold that he asked his colleagues not to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> at all. Before the caucus adjourned, a thirteen-man committee was formed to promote {{the election of the}} Democratic-Republican ticket; Breckinridge represented Kentucky on the committee.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{nominations}} {{began the}} following day. Hardin {{felt as though}} he had been cheated and withdrew his candidacy, although some loyal delegates continued to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Delegate John Stockdale Rhea nominated Stone. Stone believed that his agreement with Goebel meant, with Hardin's withdrawal, Goebel would instruct his delegates to vote for Stone, maintaining a unified party. That understanding vanished when another delegate nominated Goebel. Stone was further incensed when all of the Louisville delegation voted for Goebel instead of being split between Stone and Goebel, as the two men had previously agreed. In retaliation, some Stone supporters began to back Hardin. Seeing the breakdown of the Stone-Goebel alliance, Hardin reversed his withdrawal. After numerous ballots, the convention was deadlocked on the night of June 24 with each candidate receiving about one-third of the votes. No deliberations were held on Sunday, June 25, and when the delegates reconvened on Monday, June 26, the hall was filled with police per Redwine's request. Rhea requested that the police be removed to prevent intimidation, but Redwine ruled the motion out of order. Another delegate appealed Redwine's decision, and, in violation of parliamentary rule, Redwine ruled the appeal out of order. Angered by Redwine's obviously biased rulings, delegates for Stone and Hardin then began trying to disrupt the convention by blowing horns, singing, yelling, and standing on chairs. Although voting was attempted, many delegates abstained because they were unable to hear and understand what was going on. When the voting—such as it was—ended, the chair announced that Goebel had a majority of the votes cast, but Goebel sent word to Redwine that he would only accept the nomination if he received an absolute majority of the delegates. Further attempts to vote were likewise disrupted, and the meeting adjourned for the day.|$|E

25|$|To be {{selected}} as the 2008 Republican Party Nominee, a candidate must have received the vote of 1,191 delegates. As of March 4, 2008, McCain had received the pledges of more than 1,191 delegates. Although most of those delegates {{were not required to}} <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> on September 3, 2008, McCain won the nomination almost unanimously.|$|E
25|$|None of Bradley's delegates {{were allowed}} to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> so Gore won the {{nomination}} unanimously at the Democratic National Convention. Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman was nominated for vice president by voice vote. Lieberman became the first Jewish American ever to be chosen for this position by a major party. Gore chose Lieberman over five finalists.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the crucial}} {{questions}} after Obama's speech was what effect (if any) the speech would have on voters {{in terms of their}} overall opinion of Obama and their willingness to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in the remaining Democratic primaries and in the general election. Critical to these questions was the extent to which voters identified Obama with the views of Jeremiah Wright.|$|E

50|$|These {{surprising}} results stifled {{the impending}} early elections; Topi's election was only possible because five opposition members <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> instead of Ceka.|$|R
25|$|Democratic nominee John McKeithen {{at first}} warned voters {{that they were}} {{required}} to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as the party standard-bearer because their participation in a party primary carried with it a loyalty oath to the eventual nominee. Lyons, however, cited Section 671, Title 18 of Louisiana Revised Statutes which states that voters are free to support any candidate of their choice in a general election.|$|E
25|$|Plurality: A {{candidate}} {{secured a}} delegation {{when he has}} {{the highest number of}} delegates that could <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> on the first ballot in the nomination at the National Convention. According to RNC rules it took plurality in five delegations to be on the first ballot at the National Convention, and it took 1,144 delegates at the roll call of the ballots to become the Republican nominee.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} {{accounts of}} the conclave (written by the conclavists for the various cardinals) disagree {{on the number of}} votes received by the three papabile; on the first scrutiny. Baumgartner regards as the most accurate the account according 15 votes to della Rovere, 13 to d'Amboise, and 4 to Piccolomini. This was bad news for d'Amboise, who knew that many of his pledged supporters had promised only to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> on the first scrutiny. Therefore, d'Amboise threw his support to Piccolomini.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half of October Carafa broke his {{alliance}} with Sforza, as Philip II decided to return the fiefdom Palli Colonnie Marcantonio and ordered the Spanish cardinals to prevent the selection of Gonzaga at all costs. Cardinal d'Este allied himself with Carafa, hoping to win the election, but the vote on 1 December showed this was in vain, with many who had promised to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> not doing so. The French also – without much success – tried to get cardinals Tournon and Suau elected.|$|E
25|$|Out of all {{the states}} that Nixon had {{previously}} carried in 1960, Maine and Washington {{were the only two}} states that did not <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> again; Nixon carried them during his re-election campaign in 1972. This was the last time until 1988 that the state of Washington voted Democratic and until 1992 that Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan voted Democratic in the general election. Nixon was also the last Republican candidate to win a presidential election without carrying Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-five {{players in}} all were {{named by the}} 37 experts in their lists of the 10 best. The {{magazine}} then ranked them in descending order by total number of points assigned. The top eight players in overall points, with their number of first-place votes, were: Rod Laver (9), John McEnroe (3), Don Budge (4), Jack Kramer (5), Björn Borg (6), Pancho Gonzales (1), Bill Tilden (6), and Lew Hoad (1). Gonzales was ranked the sixth-best player, with only Allan Fox casting a <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as {{the greatest of all}} time.|$|E
50|$|The Croat {{candidate}} was: incumbent Željko Komšić from Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who {{was elected}} in 2006 when large numbers of Bosniaks <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> rather than <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> a Bosniak candidate.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{withdrawing}} from the presidential race in July 2011, Norris maintained considerable and, in some cases, increased public support. A poll taken one week after Norris withdrew from the presidential race, showed a large increase in public support for his Presidency if they were given the choice to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> (topping the poll by a considerable margin) with 40 per cent of respondents now saying they would vote Norris {{number one in the}} preferential voting electoral system and 50 per cent saying they would give him a vote.|$|E
25|$|In 1800 the Democratic-Republican Party again {{nominated}} Jefferson {{for president}} and also nominated Aaron Burr for vice president. After the election, Jefferson and Burr both obtained a majority of electoral votes but tied one another with 73 votes each. Since ballots did not distinguish between votes {{for president and}} votes for vice president, every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to become president, despite Jefferson clearly being his party's first choice. Lacking a clear winner by constitutional standards, the election had {{to be decided by}} the House of Representatives pursuant to the Constitution's contingency election provision.|$|E
25|$|Burr ran for {{president}} in the 1796 election, coming in fourth with 30 votes behind John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Pinckney. (At the time members of the electoral college cast two ballots but did not specify an office. The first-place finisher overall became president and the runner up vice president. They did not run on a 'ticket' and were often opponents.) Burr was shocked by his defeat, as he believed he had arranged with Jefferson's supporters for their <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as well, in exchange for Burr's working to obtain New York's electoral votes for Jefferson. But many Democratic-Republican electors voted for Jefferson and no one else, or for Jefferson and a candidate other than Burr.|$|E
