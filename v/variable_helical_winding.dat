40|$|Abstract- Optical fibers are {{structures}} that are typically designed to transmit energy along a specified trajectory with minimal attenuation and single distortion. Optical fibers with small losses appeared in 1970. This event has {{laid the foundation}} for modern optical communication industry. However Si waveguides have some nonlinearity which occurs when electromagnetic waves interact with core ofthe waveguide. To do away with this problem it was begun to use Optical fibers with <b>helical</b> <b>winding</b> known as complex optical waveguides. Also in conventional waveguide modes are mixed with adjacent mode if V number is greater than 2. 405. The use of <b>helical</b> <b>winding</b> in optical fibers makes the analysis much accurate. As the number of propagating modes depends on the helix pitch angle, so <b>helical</b> <b>winding</b> at core-cladding interface can control the dispersion or propagation characteristics ofthe optical waveguide. The model dispersion characteristics of circular optical waveguide with <b>helical</b> <b>winding</b> at core-cladding interface are obtained for different pitch angle. This paper gives the idea to obtain dispersion characteristics, and comparison of dispersion characteristics at different pitch angles. We obtained the dispersion characteristics by using boundary condition and this condition have been utilized to get the model Eigen values equation. From these Eigen value equations dispersion curve are obtained and plotted for five particular values of the pitch angle of the winding. Also fractional power flow in core and cladding has been calculated and the result has been compared.

40|$|Helical {{windings}} (or zig-zag windings) {{are used}} {{in a number of}} applications, however in electrical machines mainly employed in low-power, high-speed PM brushless DC machines due to the cost-effectiveness of the winding type while maintaining reasonable performance. Typically, <b>helical</b> <b>winding</b> are used for low voltage applications due to their spiral form, which makes them most suitable for a small number of turns. In high-speed electrical machines such a low number of turns is applicable.
