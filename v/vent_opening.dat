The aim of this work is to give a first evaluation of a new asymmetric <b>vent</b> <b>openings</b> design by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The roof pitch combinations and the position of the <b>vent</b> <b>openings</b> offered by this design, present a wide range of adaptations for different local situations, thus allowing an expected optimal air exchange control.

Two vent configurations are considered (0 °; 30 ° and 10 °; 20 °), taking into account the combination effect of the leeward and windward openings; in fact the longitudinal axis of the greenhouses is normal to the imposed wind direction thus exposing differently the roof opening combination set-ups. The boundary conditions used for the simulation are representative of winter conditions in the Northern Italy. Two wind speeds (2 and 4 m s- 1) and two outside temperatures (- 2 and 7 °C) were used considering a set point inside temperature of 16 °C. The asymmetric design of the roof and the consequent positioning of the roof vents opened inward, seems to offer a sufficient range of combinations in order to obtain the best performance of air circulation for any outside climatic conditions.

50|$|Lava {{sometimes}} forms a tube as {{it moves}} away from the <b>vent</b> (<b>opening</b> from which lava flows from a volcano). The top of a stream of lava cools down, thereby forming a solid roof. Meanwhile, the lava continues moving in the tube. Often, when all the lava leaves the tube, the roof collapses, making a channel. These features are found on Mars. Some can be seen around Pavonis Mons, in the picture below. Some people have suggested that future colonists on Mars could use lava tunnels as shelters. They would offer great protection from radiation, especially ultraviolet radiation. Lava Channels on the flank of the volcano Pavonis Mons are pictured below in a picture from Mars Odyssey THEMIS. Sometimes the lava tube remains intact for a time. Lava will break out along the tube to accumulate or flow away. Lava flows often have a lobate appearance at the edges.

40|$|Campi Flegrei is {{an active}} {{volcanic}} area situated in the Campanian Plain (Italy) and dominated by a resurgent caldera. The great majority of past eruptions have been explosive, variable in magnitude, intensity, and in their vent locations. In this hazard assessment study we present a probabilistic analysis {{using a variety of}} volcanological data sets to map the background spatial probability of <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> conditional on the occurrence of an event in the foreseeable future. The analysis focuses on the reconstruction of the location of past eruptive vents in the last 15 ka, including the distribution of faults and surface fractures as being representative of areas of crustal weakness. One of our key objectives was to incorporate some of the main sources of epistemic uncertainty about the volcanic system through a structured expert elicitation, thereby quantifying uncertainties for certain important model parameters and allowing outcomes from different expert weighting models to be evaluated. Results indicate that past vent locations are the most informative factors governing the probabilities of <b>vent</b> <b>opening,</b> followed by the locations of faults and then fractures. Our <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> probability maps highlight the presence of a sizeable region in the central eastern part of the caldera where the likelihood of new <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> per kilometer squared is about 6 times higher than the baseline value for the whole caldera. While these probability values have substantial uncertainties associated with them, our findings provide a rational basis for hazard mapping of the next eruption at Campi Flegrei caldera...|$|E

In the past, the volcano has exhibited significant spatial variability in vent location; this can exert a significant control on where hazards materialise (particularly of pyroclastic density currents). The new <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> probability mapping has been performed through: i) development of spatial probability density maps with Gaussian kernel functions for different data sets, and ii) weighted linear combination of these spatial density maps. The epistemic uncertainties affecting these datasets were quantified explicitly with expert judgements, and implemented following a doubly stochastic approach. Various elicitation pooling metrics, and sub-groupings of experts and target questions were tested to evaluate the robustness of outcomes. Our findings indicate that: a) Somma-Vesuvio <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> probabilities are distributed inside the whole caldera, with a peak corresponding {{to the area of}} the present crater, but with more than 50 % probability that the next vent could open elsewhere within the caldera; b) there is a mean probability of about 30 % that the next vent will open west of the present edifice; c) there is a mean probability of about 9. 5 % that the next medium-large eruption will enlarge the present SV caldera, and d) there is a non-negligible probability (mean value of 6 - 10 %) that the next Plinian or sub-Plinian eruption will have its initial <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> outside the present Somma-Vesuvio caldera...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss a novel {{approach}} to provide insights on the probability of <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> in calderas, using a dynamic model of sill intrusion. The evolution of the stress field is the main factor that controls the <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> processes in volcanic calderas. On the basis of previous studies, we think that the intrusion of sills is one of the most common mechanism governing caldera unrest. Therefore, we have investigated the spatial and temporal evolution of the stress field due to the emplacement of a sill at shallow depth to provide insight on <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> probability. We carried out several numerical experiments by using a physical model, to assess the role of the magma properties (viscosity), host rock characteristics (Young’s modulus and thickness), and dynamics of the intrusion process (mass flow rate) in controlling the stress field. Our experiments highlight that high magma viscosity produces larger stress values, while low magma viscosity leads to lower stresses and favors the radial spreading of the sill. Also high-rock Young’s modulus gives high stress intensity, whereas low values of Young’s modulus produce a dramatic reduction of the stress associated with the intrusive process. The maximum intensity of tensile stress is concentrated at the front of the sill and propagates radially with it, over time. In our simulations, we find that maximum values of tensile stress occur in ringshaped areas with radius ranging between 350 m and 2500 m from the injection point, depending on the model parameters. The probability of <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> is higher in these area...|$|E

This experiment was conducted for periods of 4 days, 13 days and one month and deployments were aligned along a gradient from the basaltic bottom to the <b>vent</b> <b>openings.</b> δ(13) C values of colonists revealed a narrower range of carbon sources in proximity to <b>vent</b> <b>openings</b> in Alvinella pompejana habitat than in Tevnia jerichonana habitat, separated by a distance of four meters. This was possibly due to a spatial change in available food sources with a possible higher contribution of particulate organic matter (POM) to the siboglinid habitat compared to a higher contribution of microbial primary producers such as Epsilonproteobacteria in the alvinellid habitat.

Aim: Identifying determinants of ventilation behavior and quantifying relationships. Secondly, identifying households characteristics associated with low ventilation activity. Methods: In a cross sectional study, ordinal and binary logistic regression analyses were performed, in a large population based survey, to identify determinants of window and <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> behavior in the main living areas during the heating season in naturally ventilated dwellings. Relationships were quantified. Results: Window opening behavior was associated (although not always consistently between models) positively with household size, negatively with disposable income (living- and bedroom), and with ethnicity (association different in direction between room types). Furthermore, window opening behavior was positively associated with ‘respondent or partner {{does not have a}} paid income’ (living room only), presence of females and age of the oldest occupant (bedroom only). In addition, significant associations were found between dwelling characteristics and window opening behavior, including the presence of vents (strong negative association, both room types), type of dwelling (association different in direction between room types), and the overall heat transfer coefficient by transmission. A smaller number of household and dwelling characteristics was found associated with <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> behavior.

40|$|The Campi Flegrei caldera is {{a restless}} {{structure}} affected by general subsidence and ongoing resurgence of its central part. The persistent {{activity of the}} system and the explosive character of the volcanism lead to a very high volcanic hazard that, combined with intense urbanization, corresponds to a very high volcanic risk. One of the largest sources of uncertainty in volcanic hazard/risk assessment for Campi Flegrei is the spatial location of the future volcanic activity. This paper presents and discusses a long- term probability hazard map for <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> in case of renewal of volcanism at the Campi Flegrei caldera, which shows the spatial conditional probability for the next <b>vent</b> <b>opening,</b> given that an eruption occurs. The map has been constructed by building a Bayesian inference scheme merging prior information and past data. The method allows both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties to be evaluated. The probability map of <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> shows that two areas of relatively high probability are present within the active portion of the caldera, with a probability approximately doubled with respect {{to the rest of the}} caldera. The map has an immediate use in evaluating the areas of the caldera prone to the highest volcanic hazard.

In the framework of the project PON SIGMA (Integrated Cloud-Sensor System for Advanced Multirisk Management), we developed a near real-time computer-assisted analysis and probabilistic evaluations that provide the identification of the areas prone to the highest <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> hazard. The use of a code such BET_EF (Bayesian Event Tree_Eruption Forecasting) provide us a long-term hazard map mainly based on the past behaviour of the Etna volcano. The near real-time additional seismic and ground deformation data allow the long-term hazard map switches into a short-term future <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> one. The short-term future <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> was computed starting from the evaluation of deformation field over Etna surface. Analytical inversion of deformation and seismic data is performed to find the parameters of a magmatic source in an elastic, isotropic and homogeneous half-space and forward model is performed to compute the displacement field over Etna surface.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimen-tally investigate the influence of vent type and of insect proof screens on ventilation rate of a round arch plastic covered greenhouse. The greenhouse was equipped with side roll-up win-dows and a flap roof window and {{is located at the}} University of Thessaly near Volos in the coastal area of Eastern Greece. Microclimate variables as well as the greenhouse ventilation rate (G) were measured. Two measuring meth-ods were used for the determination of G: (a) the decay rate tracer gas method, using N 2 O as tracer gas, and (b) the greenhouse energy bal-ance method. In order to study the effect of vent type on G, in a greenhouse with an insect proof screen in the <b>vent</b> <b>openings,</b> the G was deter-mined during periods were the ventilation was performed by (i) roof, (ii) side and (iii) both roof and side vents.

The two measuring methods gave similar results, but the tracer gas method provided a better fit to the experimental data. Concerning the ventilation performance, the results showed that the most effective vent configuration was the combina-tion of roof and side vents, followed by side vents only.

40|$|The {{statistical}} analysis of volcanic activity at Mt Etna was conducted with the twofold aim of (1) constructing a probability map for <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> of future flank eruptions and (2) forecasting the expected number of eruptive events at the summit craters. The spatiotemporal map of new <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> at Etna volcano {{is based on the}} analysis of spatial locations and frequency of flank eruptions starting from 1610. Thanks to the completeness and accuracy of historical data over the last four centuries, we examined in detail the spatial and temporal distribution of flank eruptions showing that effusive events follow a nonhomogenous Poisson process with space-time varying intensities. After demonstrating the spatial nonhomogeneity and the temporal nonstationarity of flank eruptions at Etna, we calculated the recurrence rates (events expected per unit area per unit time) and produced different spatiotemporal probability maps of new <b>vent</b> <b>opening</b> in the next 1, 10 and 50 years. These probabilistic maps have an immediate use in evaluating the future timing and areas of Etna prone to volcanic hazards. Finally, the results of the analysis of the persistent summit activity during the last 110 years indicate that the hazard rate for eruptive events is not constant with time, differs for each summit crater of Mt Etna, highlighting a general increase in the eruptive frequency starting from the middle of last century and particularly from 1971, when the SE crater was formed...|$|E
