40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [54]- 59) Excessive pronation {{has been}} indicated {{as one of}} the major factors {{in a wide range of}} clinical symptoms in the lower extremity. Two of the foot deformities which lead to excessive pronation are forefoot varus and rearfoot varus. However, current biomechanical investigations of subtalar joint pronation do not identify causes of excessive pronation in their subjects and categorize them as one group "excessive pronators. " The purpose of this study was to compare selected aspects of subtalar joint movement during barefoot walking in three foot types (normal, forefoot varus, and rearfoot varus) to the two groups: normal and excessive pronators which was combination of forefoot varus and rearfoot <b>varus</b> <b>foot</b> types. For this study, twenty normal feet, twenty forefoot varus feet and twenty rearfoot varus feet were studied using high-speed camera (100 Hz). After marking the lower posterior one-third of both legs, each subject walked on a 5 m-long stage away from the camera at a rate of 110 steps per minute. Following variables were measured: 1) rearfoot angle at heel strike (HS), at maximum pronation (Pmax), and at heel off (HO); 2) duration of the four events from HS to Pmax, HS to HO, HS to subtalar joint neutral (N), HS to toe off (TO); and 3) maximum pronation velocity. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a significance level of p< 0. 05 was used for data analysis. Results of this study indicated that the forefoot <b>varus</b> <b>foot</b> type had significantly greater rearfoot pronation angles at HS and Pmax compared to the rearfoot <b>varus</b> <b>foot</b> type. The length of time from HS to HO and HS to TO was significantly shorter in the forefoot <b>varus</b> <b>foot</b> type compared to the rearfoot <b>varus</b> <b>foot</b> type. No significant differences were found in the comparison between the normal group and the excessive pronator group. The excessive pronator group did not represent either the forefoot varus or the rearfoot <b>varus</b> <b>foot</b> motion characteristics. These findings demonstrated the need for future investigators to identify each foot type in pronation studies. Problems specific to each foot type can then be identified. M. S. Ed.

The prevalence of their dysfunction has been reported with not well defined results. Although gait analysis and dynamic electromyography provide useful information {{for the assessment of}} the patients, they are not available in every hospital. The purpose of the current study is to identify the causative muscle producing the deformity and apply the most suitable technique for its correction. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 48 consecutive ambulant patients (52 feet) with spastic paralysis due to cerebral palsy. The average age {{at the time of the}} operation was 12, 4 yrs (9 - 18) and the mean follow-up 7, 8 yrs (4 - 14). Eigtheen feet presented equinus hind foot deformity due to gastrocnemius and soleus shortening. According to the deformity, the feet were divided in two groups (Group I with forefoot and midfoot inversion and Group II with hindfoot varus).

40|$|Anaesthesia of {{the lower}} limbs of {{children}} with myelomeningocele presents an important hazard {{in the management of}} the fixed varus deformity, with or without equinus, that is so often found. Sharrard and Grosfield (1968), in an important paper on the management of the foot deformities associated with myelomeningocele, reported an earlier review (1958) of twenty feet which they had treated by the orthopaedic techniques commonly used for correcting congenitally deformed feet with normal sensibility. Of the twenty feet, five developed severe pressure sores and one of these led to amputation. Of the remaining fifteen, shape and function were acceptable in only two. Since that time they have used a purely operative approach to these paralysed and anaesthetic deformed feet. In this paper I report the early results of a prospective series of thirty-five <b>varus</b> <b>feet</b> in infants with myelomeningocele, treated by a combination of conservative orthopaedic methods reinforced when necessary by a minor operation. Some of these <b>varus</b> <b>feet</b> also had fixed equinus deformity, and there were a few in which equinus was revealed when the varus had been corrected. The object in these anaesthetic feet is to overcome all the varus deformity, and as much of any equinus as possible, by manipulations and strapping, and then to correc...|$|R

The most extensive clinical syndrome observed was established over 4  weeks {{and consisted of}} bradypsychia, dysartria, and limb rigidity with equine <b>varus</b> <b>feet</b> predominating on the right. The syndrome was aggravated when the patient was sitting with the sequential appereance over minutes of a typical parkinsonian levodopa‐resistant tremor starting {{on the right side}}, extending to all four limbs, followed by diplopia resulting from a left abducens nerve palsy followed by a left‐sided mydriasis. All signs recovered within 1 – 2  h after horizontalisation. It was correlated with an orthostatic progressive sinking of the skin flap, MRI and CT scan mesodiencephalic distortion without evidence of parenchymal lesion. Brain stem auditory evoked potential wave III latency increases were observed on the right side on verticalisation of the patient. EEG exploration excluded any epileptic activity. Symptoms were fully recovered within 2  days after cranioplasty was performed. The cranioplasty had to be removed twice due to infection.

30|$|A {{range of}} {{surgical}} procedures on the tibialis posterior {{have been reported}} {{for the management of}} the varus hindfoot [2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], including complete tenotomy [22], z-lengthening of the tendon, intramuscular tenotomy [17, 19], re-routing the tendon anterior to the medial malleolus [13, 18, 24], split posterior tibial tendon transfer [20, 21], anterior interosseus transfer [13, 16, 24, 25], and combinations thereof [12, 26]. However, it is also recognized that the outcome of surgery for the varus hindfoot in cerebral palsy is extremely variable, with high rates of both recurrent deformity and over-correction [2, 3, 12, 14, 15, 16, 20, 26, 27, 28]. This may be related to heterogeneity within the patient population: however, it may also be due to variability in the execution of certain surgical procedures, including intramuscular tenotomy of tibialis posterior. Simple tenotomy and anterior interosseous transfer have unpredictable outcomes, have been condemned and largely discarded [2, 16, 22, 28]. Intramuscular lengthening of the tibialis posterior is a popular procedure in the management of the <b>varus</b> <b>foot</b> in spastic cerebral palsy, and is considered to have more predictable results [1, 14, 28].|$|E

It is mostly sporadic and can be identified as an isolated disorder {{or as part of}} malformation syndromes. CASE REPORT A male child, born to unaffected and non-consanguineous parents, presented with shortening of the legs and adduction of both feet. Physical examination at six months of age showed head circumference of 44. 5 cm (75 th percentile), length 60 cm (< 3 rd percentile), weight 7, 700 g (50 th percentile), shortening of the left thigh and both legs with <b>varus</b> <b>foot.</b> There were no craniofacial dysmorphisms or chest, abdominal, genital or upper-extremity anomalies. Psychomotor development was normal. His workup, including renal and cranial ultrasonography, brainstem auditory evoked potential, and ophthalmological and cardiological examinations, was normal. X-rays showed bilateral {{absence of the}} tibia with intact fibulae, distally hypoplastic left femur, and normal right femur. In addition, spinal radiographs showed hemivertebrae at T 9 and T 10.

40|$|Background: The foot plays a {{key role}} in a {{standing}} posture, walking and running performance. Changes in its structure or function may alter upper segments of kinematic chain which can lead to formation of musculoskeletal disorders. Although functional clinical typology provides a complex view of foot kinesiology there is a lack of knowledge and evidence about influences of different foot types on human gait. Objective: The aim of the study was to analyse differences of kinematic gait parameters of lower extremity joints and pelvis between functional clinical foot types in healthy young men. Methods: Three-dimensional kinematic analysis by the Vicon Motion Capture MX System device in synchronization with 2 Kistler force platforms was used to obtain kinematic data from 18 healthy men (mean age 23. 2 &# 8239;&# 177;&# 8239; 1. 9 years). The functional clinical foot type was clinically examined and sorted into 3 basic foot type groups - forefoot varus (FFvar), rearfoot varus (RFvar) and forefoot valgus (FFvalg). Peak angular values and range of an angular displacement in all of three movement planes were analysed for pelvis, hip, knee and ankle joint. For statistical analysis of kinematic gait parameters differences between foot types Mann Whitney U test at a statistical significance level p&# 8239;<&# 8239;. 05 and Cohen's coefficient d for effect size were used. Results: This study showed that functional clinical foot type can affect kinematic parameters of gait in the joints of the lower limb and pelvis. Significant differences were presented in the FFvar in comparison with other two foot type groups with middle and high size of effect. The most alterations were observed in pelvis area and in a sagittal plane of movement. Nevertheless, significant differences between FFvalg and RFvar foot types were not noticed. Conclusions: Functional clinical foot typology provides one of the possible methods to describe foot structure and function. Our results showed that foot type could alter gait. Forefoot <b>varus</b> <b>foot</b> type has more significant influence on kinematic gait parameters then other foot types. These effects should be considered by clinicians during examination of musculoskeletal system disorders especially in lower extremities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Overactivity of {{anterior}} and/or posterior tibial tendon {{may be a}} {{causative factor}} of spastic <b>varus</b> <b>foot</b> deformity. The prevalence of their dysfunction has been reported with not well defined results. Although gait analysis and dynamic electromyography provide useful information {{for the assessment of}} the patients, they are not available in every hospital. The purpose of the current study is to identify the causative muscle producing the deformity and apply the most suitable technique for its correction. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 48 consecutive ambulant patients (52 feet) with spastic paralysis due to cerebral palsy. The average age {{at the time of the}} operation was 12, 4 yrs (9 - 18) and the mean follow-up 7, 8 yrs (4 - 14). Eigtheen feet presented equinus hind foot deformity due to gastrocnemius and soleus shortening. According to the deformity, the feet were divided in two groups (Group I with forefoot and midfoot inversion and Group II with hindfoot varus). The deformities were flexible in all cases in both groups. Split anterior tibial tendon transfer (SPLATT) was performed in Group I (11 feet), while split posterior tibial tendon transfer (SPOTT) was performed in Group II (38 feet). In 3 feet both procedures were performed. Achilles tendon sliding lengthening (Hoke procedure) was done in 18 feet either preoperatively or concomitantly with the index procedure. Results The results in Group I, were rated according to Hoffer's clinical criteria as excellent in 8 feet and satisfactory in 3, while in Group II according to Kling's clinical criteria were rated as excellent in 20 feet, good in 14 and poor in 4. The feet with poor results presented residual varus deformity due to intraoperative technical errors. Conclusion Overactivity of the anterior tibial tendon produces inversion most prominent in the forefoot and midfoot and similarly overactivity of the posterior tibial tendon produces hindfoot varus. The deformity can be clinically unidentifiable in some cases when Achilles shortening co-exists producing foot equinus. By identifying the muscle causing the deformity and performing the appropriate technique, very satisfying results were achieved in the majority of our cases. In three feet both muscles contributed to a combined deformity and simultaneous SPLATT and SPOTT were considered necessary. For complex foot deformities where the component of cavus co-exists, supplementary procedures are required along with the index operation to obtain the best result. </p...|$|E

If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. Prior research has shown that an individual with a large forefoot varus is five times as likely to have a total hip replacement. However the biomechanical mechanism underlying these injuries remains poorly understood. It is proposed that this may be because of two factors. First, the traditional clinical measure of rearfoot and forefoot structure has poor reliability and questionable validity. Second, few studies include forefoot kinematics when investigating the relationship between foot structure and injury. We conducted two studies to investigate the validity of a new clinical measure of foot orientation. The purposes of both studies (walking and running) were twofold: 1) To determine if a new non-weight bearing clinical measure of forefoot and rearfoot orientation is a valid predictor of measures of forefoot and rearfoot orientation at forefoot and rearfoot contact respectively, during gait; and 2) to determine the differences in duration and amplitude of pronation between two groups divided on degree of <b>varus</b> <b>foot</b> orientation. Methods: All fourteen subjects had a forefoot varus {{greater than or equal to}} 15 ° using a new clinical orientation measure. For the new measure, clinical forefoot and rearfoot orientations were obtained from digital photographs. Using a 3 D motion capture system forefoot and rearfoot orientations at ground contact were captured while walking at three speeds and running at three speeds. Duration of pronation was defined as the percent of stance between contact and re-supination. Results: The new clinical measure of forefoot orientation predicted the forefoot orientation at ground contact but the clinical rearfoot orientation did not. The group of individuals with a large forefoot varus orientation at forefoot contact had greater amplitude and duration of forefoot pronation during walking and greater amplitude of forefoot and rearfoot pronation during running. Rearfoot orientation, measured clinically and at ground contact did not predict any of the stance variables. Conclusions: These studies suggest that a new clinical measure of forefoot structure using an extrinsic reference frame can predict foot behavior during gait and that forefoot structure may significantly contribute to musculoskeletal injuries associated with foot structure...|$|E
40|$|Clubfoot, or talipes equinovarus, is a {{deformity}} {{consisting of}} equinus, <b>varus,</b> and adductus <b>foot</b> deformity. The true etiology of congenital clubfoot is unknown; several theories have been proposed.

Various treatment regimens have been proposed, {{including the use of}} corrective splinting, taping, and casting. Surgery in clubfoot is indicated for deformities that do not respond to conservative treatment by serial manipulation and casting. Surgery in the treatment of clubfoot must be tailored to the age of the child and to the deformity to be corrected.

40|$|Background: Hallux valgus and {{metatarsus}} primus varus defor-mities {{usually are}} the result of failure of the supporting soft tissues rather than bone deformities. Since soft-tissue proce-dures have been shown to only be suitable for mild deformi-ties, first metatarsal osteotomy has {{become an integral part of}} correcting moderate to severe deformities. A soft-tissue tech-nique referred to as the “syndesmosis procedure ” by the author was evaluated for its effectiveness in correcting metatarsus primus <b>varus</b> in <b>feet</b> with hallux valgus. Methods: This is a retrospective clinical and radiographic study of six patients (11 feet) an average of 6 years and 10 months after the “syndesmosis procedure. ” A cerclage technique using absorbable suture (PDS) was used for the first metatarsal realignment, and its long-term maintenance depended on a syndesmosis (fibrous) bonding between the first and second metatarsal bases. Results: The average preoperative hallux valgus angle of 29. 5 (21 to 43) degrees improved to 13. 5 (− 2 to 24) degrees and the average preoperative metatarsus primus varus angle of 13. 6 (12 to 16) degrees improved to 5. 2 (2 to 8) degrees at an average of 85. 7 (33 to 128) months. All patients were satisfied with their results and were able to return to sports and wearing high-heeled shoes as desired. Complications were few and mild.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess {{pregnancy}} outcomes of women treated with a novel neuraminidase inhibitor, laninamivir, during pregnancy. Methods A retrospective review of pregnancy outcomes of 112 pregnant women who were given laninamivir for treatment of influenza was performed. Possible adverse events, including miscarriages, preterm birth, foetal malformation and any neonatal morbidity requiring treatment, were assessed. Results Seventeen, 39, 46 and 10 women were administered a single inhaled dose of 20 or 40 mg of laninamivir at gestational week (GW) 3 - 11, 12 - 21, 22 - 36 and 37 or more, respectively. One (1. 8 %) of 56 women with laninamivir at GW < 22 experienced miscarriage at GW < 12. The remaining 111 women gave birth to 111 viable infants but at preterm (GW < 37) in nine (8. 8 %) of 102 women with laninamivir at GW < 37. Three (2. 7 %) of the 111 newborns had malformations: forefoot <b>varus</b> deformity, <b>foot</b> polydactyly and cleft lip in one each born to a mother taking laninamivir atGW 6, 17 and 21, respectively. Five neonates (4. 5 %) were small for gestational age. Eleven (9. 9 %), five (4. 5 %) and no neonates required phototherapy for jaundice, transient respiratory supports for respiratory distress syndrome (n = 2) or transient tachypnoea of the newborn (n = 3), and glucose administration for hypoglycaemia, respectively. Conclusions Although this study included a small number of study women and no control women, the results suggested that maternal exposure to laninamivir did not increase the rate of adverse pregnancy and foetal outcomes.

40|$|Background: Resistant clubfoot {{deformities}} of {{the foot}} and ankle remain a difficult problem even for the most experienced surgeon. We report a series of neglected resistant clubfoot deformities treated by limited surgery and Ilizarov distraction histogenesis. Materials and Methods: Twenty one patients with 27 feet having resistant clubfoot deformities were managed by Ilizarov distraction histogenesis from April 2005 to May 2008. The mean age was 12 years (range 8 - 20 years). A limited soft tissue dissection like percutaneous Achilles sheath tenotomy and plantar fasciotomy were done. Progressive correction of the deformities was achieved through the standard and simple Ilizarov frame construct setting. After removal of Ilizarov frame, a short leg walking cast was used for an additional 6 weeks, followed by an ankle foot orthrosis for 3 months. Results: The mean followup period was 18. 7 months (range 20 - 36 months). The mean duration of fixator application was 3. 6 months (range 3 - 5 months). At the time of removal of the fixator, a plantigrade foot was achieved in 25 feet and gait was improved in all patients. There was residual <b>varus</b> hind <b>foot</b> deformity in two patients. Out of 27 feet, 3 (11. 11 %) were rated as excellent, 17 (62. 96 %) as good, 5 (18. 51 %) as fair, and 2 (7. 40 %) as poor according to Reinkerand Carpenter scale. Excellent and good results (74. 07 %) were considered satisfactory, while fair and poor results (25. 92 %) were considered unsatisfactory.

40|$|Objective:To {{investigate}} the clinical outcome of modified Blair ankle fusion for ankle arthritis. Methods:Between November 2009 and June 2012, 28 patients with ankle arthritis were treated, among whom 11 had obvious <b>foot</b> <b>varus</b> deformity, and 17 were almost normal in appearance. There were 13 males and 15 females {{with an average}} age of 49. 4 years (range, 23 - 67 years). The main symptoms included swelling, pain, and a limited range of motion of the ankles. The ankle joints functions were assessed by American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle and hindfoot score and visual analog scale (VAS) preoperatively and at 1 year follow-up. Results:Twenty-eight patients were followed up for 19. 8 months on average (range, 1 - 2 years). Superficial wound infection occurred in 3 cases, and was cured after debridement; the other incisions healed by first intention without complications. All ankles were fused at 1 year follow-up after operation. The symptom was relieved completely in all patients at last follow-up without complication of implant failure, or nonunion. The postoperative AOFAS ankle and hindfoot score was 83. 13 ± 3. 76, showing significant difference when compared with the preoperative score (45. 38 ± 3. 21, P< 0. 01).

Material Tue Clubfoot Clintic at the Hospital for Special Surgery in-i New York City has been under my direction-i since 1948. It has averaged sixty-eight new admissions a year sin-ice 1949. Prior to 1948, 216 patients registered. From 1949 {{until the end of}} 1965, 1, 159 new patients came to the clinic, makinig a total of 1, 375 patients. The total visits (old at-id new patients) averaged 1, 609 per year from 1949 through 1965. In the years 1948 through 1956, 557 new patients were admitted to the clinic, and 175 were diagnosed as having club-foot deformities. Thus, 31 per cent of all admissions during that period were patients with either unilateral or bilateral club foot. In-i this specialty clinic these foot problems are grouped in one area under the direction of on-ic individual in at-i effort to improve patient care, to evaluate and seek new methods of treatment, to train-i residen-its, to stimulate the interest in these problems, at-id to share experiences. Exposure to this large number of club feet of all varieties has given-i me the opportunity to participate in-i a large number of operative procedures.

40|$|To {{assess the}} most {{accurate}} radiographic method to determine talar three-dimensional position in varus and valgus osteoarthritic ankles, we evaluated {{the reliability and validity}} of different radiographic measurements. Nine radiographic measurements were performed blindly on weight-bearing mortise, sagittal, and horizontal radiographs of 33 varus and 33 valgus feet (63 patients). Intra- and interobserver reliability was determined with the intraclass coefficient (ICC). Discriminant validity of measurements between <b>varus</b> and valgus <b>feet</b> was assessed with effect size (ES). Convergent validity (Pearson's r) was evaluated by correlating measurements to the dichotomized varus and valgus groups. Obtained measurements in both groups were finally compared with each other and with 30 control feet. Reliability was excellent (ICC > 0. 80) in all but two measurements. Whereas frontal plane validity was excellent (ES and r > 0. 80), horizontal and sagittal measurements showed poor to moderate validity (ES and r between 0. 00 and 0. 60). Four measurements were significantly different among all groups (p < 0. 05). Talar positional tendency was found towards dorsiflexion or endorotation in the varus group and towards plantarflexion or exorotation in the valgus group. The frontal tibiotalar surface angle, sagittal talocalcaneal inclination angle, and horizontal talometatarsal I angle showed the best reliability, validity, and difference among the groups. The frontal tibiotalar surface angle, sagittal talocalcaneal inclination angle, and horizontal talometatarsal I angle accurately determine talar three-dimensional radiographic position in weight-bearing varus and valgus osteoarthritic ankles. Careful radiographic evaluation is important, as these deformities affect talar position in all three plane...|$|R
40|$|Congenital Talipes Equinovarus (CTEV) is {{a complex}} foot {{deformity}} characterized by the following four structural changes, which occur in the foot and ankle: ankle equinus, hind <b>foot</b> <b>varus,</b> forefoot adductus and cavus. It occurs one in 1000 live births and {{is more common in}} male than female children. For the healthy subjects, the threedimensional foot shape can be obtained from a 3 D foot scanner and this is useful for the design of footwear. In the last 10 years, most studies have focused on 3 D laser scanning technology and digital imaging procedure to quantify the shape of the foot of healthy subjects. In the previous literature, quantification of foot shape, gender difference, foot shape classification, and plantar pressure studies have been carried for normal human feet. Although there are advanced developments in technology, the use of 3 D scanning technology for clubfoot is still at its infancy status. Moreover, development of footwear and specification of footwear prescription is still in the early stage. The main correction method is the use of orthosis. Due to the use and design of hard orthosis, there are clubfoot recurrences, and other complications such as pressure sores and pain. Moreover, slippage of footwear with Dennis brown bar occurs due to unfitted wearing of clubfoot footwear with braces. The design of custom orthosis is also time consuming and requires a manual procedure that is sometimes expensive. Therefore, this novel study aims to develop a 3 D clubfoot model and rapid prototyping orthosis by using cheaply commercially available 3 D Kinect scanner. Also a conceptual footwear design is proposed to correct the foot. Institute of Textiles and ClothingRefereed conference pape...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Cochrane {{review of}} hallux valgus surgery has disputed the {{scientific}} validity of hallux valgus research. Scoring systems and surrogate {{measures such as}} x-ray angles are commonly reported at just one year post operatively but these are of dubious relevance to the patient. In this study we extended the follow up to a minimum of 8 years and sought to address patient specific concerns with hallux valgus surgery. The long term follow up also allowed {{a comprehensive review of}} the complications associated with the combined rotation scarf and Akin osteotomies. Methods Between 1996 and 1999, 101 patients underwent rotation scarf and Akin osteotomies for the treatment of hallux valgus. All patients were contacted and asked to participate in this study. 50 female participants were available allowing review of 73 procedures. The average follow up was over 9 years and the average age at the time of surgery was 57. The participants were physically examined and interviewed. Results Post-operatively, in 86 % of the participants there were no footwear restrictions. Stiffness of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was reported in 8 % (6 feet); 10 % were unhappy with the cosmetic appearance of their feet, 3 <b>feet</b> had hallux <b>varus,</b> and 2 <b>feet</b> had recurrent hallux valgus. There were no foot-related activity restrictions in 92 % of the group. Metatarsalgia occurred in 4 % (3 feet). 96 % were better than before surgery and 88 % were completely satisfied with their post-operative result. Hallux varus was the greatest single cause of dissatisfaction. The most common adverse event in the study was internal fixation irritation. Hallux valgus surgery is not without risk and these findings could be useful in the informed consent process. Conclusions When combined the rotation scarf and Akin osteotomies are an effective treatment for hallux valgus that achieves good long-term correction with a low incidence of recurrence, footwear restriction or metatarsalgia. The nature of the osteotomies allows early return to normal shoes and activity without the need for postoperative immobilisation in a plaster cast. </p...|$|R
