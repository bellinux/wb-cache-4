A closed-loop Brain–Machine Interface (BMI) instantiates {{a connection between the}} human central nervous system and an industry robot designed to execute the grasping task. Two central problems were addressed in this paper, namely I) the implementation of a BMI to translate a subject’s <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> of brain activation patterns into commands for target selection and grasp execution and II) the development of a robot that autonomously grasps natural objects. Our approach in the work was to implement as much intelligence as possible into an industry standard robotic system to claim a minimum of information flow from the patient to the system. The final system demonstrates the feasibility of brain controlled grasping of natural objects with a robotic arm which is an important step towards the development of intelligent prostheses for paralyzed patients...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} explores the neural {{correlates}} of <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulations</b> {{of attention in}} an auditory-visual matching task. Visual stimuli (a female or a male face) were preceded in cióse temporal proximity by auditory stimuli consisting of the Spanish word for "man" and "woman" ("hombre" or "mujer"). In 80 % of the triáis {{the gender of the}} two stimuli coincided. Participants were asked to mentally count the specific instances in which a female face appeared after hearing the word "man" (10 % of the triáis). Our results show attention-related amplitude modulation of the early visual ERP components NI and anterior P 2, but also amplitude modulations of (i) the N 270 potential usually associated with conflict detection, (ii) a P 300 wave related to infrequency, and (iii) an N 400 potential related to semantic incongruence.

40|$|One crucial {{question}} {{in the design of}} electroencephalogram (EEG) -based brain-computer interface (BCI) experiments is the selection of EEG channels. While a setup with few channels is more convenient and requires less preparation time, a dense placement of electrodes provides more detailed information and henceforth could lead to a better classification performance. Here, we investigate this question for a specific setting: a BCI that uses the popular CSP algorithm in order to classify <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulations</b> of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). In a first approach 13 different fixed channel configurations are compared to the full one consisting of 119 channels. The configuration with 48 channels results to be the best one, while configurations with less channels, from 32 to 8, performed not significantly worse than the best configuration in cases where only few training trials are available. In a second approach an optimal channel configuration is obtained by an iterative procedure in the spirit of stepwise variable selection with nonparametric multiple comparisons. As a surprising result, in the second approach a setting with 22 channels centered over the motor areas was selected. Thanks to the acquisition of a large data set recorded from 80 novice participants using 119 EEG channels, {{the results of this study}} can be expected to have a high degree of generalizability...|$|R
40|$|Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals {{have been}} shown to contain {{reliable}} information about the direction of arm movements and can be used for on-line cursor control. These findings indicate that the ECoG is a potential basis for a brain-machine interface (BMI) for application in paralyzed patients. However, previous approaches to ECoG-BMIs were either based on classification of different movement patterns or on a <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> of spectral features. For a continuous multi-dimensional BMI control, the prediction of complete movement trajectories, as it has already been shown for spike data and local field potentials (LFPs), would be a desirable addition for the ECoG, too. Here, we examined ECoG signals from six subjects with subdurally implanted ECoG-electrodes during continuous two-dimensional arm movements between random target positions. Our results show that continuous trajectories of 2 D hand position can be approximately predicted from the ECoG recorded from hand/arm motor cortex. This indicates that ECoG signals, related to body movements, can directly be transferred to equivalent controls of an external effector for continuous BMI control. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|All brain-computer {{interface}} (BCI) {{groups that have}} published results of studies involving {{a large number of}} users performing BCI control based on the <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) report that BCI control could not be achieved by a non-negligible number of subjects (estimated 20 % to 25 %). This failure of the BCI system to read the intention of the user {{is one of the greatest}} problems and challenges in BCI research. There are two main causes for this problem in SMR-based BCI systems: either no idle SMR is observed over motor areas of the user, or this idle rhythm is not modulated during motor imagery, resulting in a classification performance lower than 70 % (criterion level) that renders the control of a BCI application (like a speller) difficult or impossible. Previously, we introduced the concept of machine learning based co-adaptive calibration, which provided substantially improved performance for a variety of users. Here, we use a similar approach and investigate to what extent co-adaptive learning enables significant BCI control for completely novice users, as well as for those who could not achieve control with a conventional SMR-based BCI...|$|E
40|$|Voluntary control {{processes}} can {{be recruited}} to facilitate recollection {{in situations where}} a retrieval cue fails to automatically bring to mind a desired episodic memory. We investigated whether voluntary control processes can also stop recollection of unwanted memories that {{would otherwise have been}} automatically recollected. Participants were trained on cue–associate word-pairs, then repeatedly presented with the cue and asked to either recollect or avoid recollecting the associate, while having the event-related potential (ERP) correlate of conscious recollection measured. Halfway through the phase, some cues switched instructions so that participants had to start avoiding recall of associates they had previously repeatedly recalled, and vice versa. ERPs during recollection avoidance showed a significantly reduced positivity in the correlate of conscious recollection, and switching instructions reversed the ERP effect even for items that had been previously repeatedly recalled, suggesting that voluntary control processes can override highly practiced, automatic recollection. Avoiding recollection of particularly prepotent memories was associated with an additional, earlier ERP negativity that was separable from the later <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> of conscious recollection. The findings have implications for theories of memory retrieval by highlighting the involvement of voluntary attentional processes in controlling conscious recollectio...|$|E
40|$|Background Compelling {{evidence}} {{points at}} both impaired proprioception and disturbed force control {{in patients with}} chronic complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Because force modulation at least partly relies on proprioception, we evaluated if impaired sense of force production contributes to disturbances of force control in patients with CRPS. Methods Characteristics of <b>voluntary</b> force <b>modulation</b> were examined in the affected upper extremity in 28 CRPS patients with abnormal postures, in 12 CRPS patients without abnormal postures, and in 32 healthy controls. Isometric grip-force matching was compared between conditions with and without visual feedback to identify potential deficits {{in the sense of}} force production in terms of force reproduction errors. Results <b>Voluntary</b> force <b>modulation</b> was impaired in CRPS patients, but more so in patients with abnormal postures. In particular, CRPS patients with abnormal postures were characterized by reduced maximum force, reduced ability to increase force output according to task instructions, higher variability of force output and less adequate correction of deviations from the target force. Although effects of visual feedback removal appeared largely similar for the two patient groups and controls, our findings with respect to force reproduction errors suggested that an impaired sense of force production may contribute to the motor dysfunction in CRPS. Conclusions CRPS patients, in particular those with abnormal postures, showed impaired voluntary force control and an impaired sense of force production. This suggests that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoration of proprioceptive impairments, possibly using online visual feedback, may promote the recovery of motor function in CRPS. © 2014 European Pain Federation - EFIC®...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{everyday}} life, when manipulating objects, arm {{actions and}} precision grip force are tightly coupled {{by the central}} nervous system. To investigate the extent of this neural coupling, 11 {{subjects were asked to}} perform tasks that encourage either the coupling (Task 1) or the dissociation (Task 2 and 3) of grip force and arm actions. During Task 1, subjects held a grasping device, with an extra load suspended underneath by a string. Then, using the other hand, subjects were asked to lift or release the suspended load, while maintaining unaffected the posture of the grasping arm. During Task 2, while holding the device, subjects received similar instructions, but this time the extra load was suspended underneath the forearm. During Task 3, subjects were explicitly asked to modulate their grip force without moving the arm. In Task 1, grip force changed in parallel with, or slightly ahead of, changes in load, which is consistent with the view of a feedforward mechanism making grip force largely sub-ordinate to ongoing arm actions. In Task 2, even though subjects had no obvious reasons to modulate their force (i. e. the load of the device was constant) they did so, with a number of features that resemble performance in Task 1. In Task 3, as expected, <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulations</b> in grip force had no effect on arm actions. It is concluded that the neural coupling between arm actions and grip force (1) can possibly lead to clumsy reactions, (2) depends on the focal action, and (3) is only unidirectional.

40|$|We {{outline the}} Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI), {{a system which}} enables us to {{translate}} brain signals from movements or movement intentions into control commands. The main contribution of the BBCI, which is a non-invasive EEG-based BCI system, {{is the use of}} advanced machine learning techniques that allow to adapt to the specific brain signatures of each user with literally no training. In BBCI a calibration session of about 20 min is necessary to provide a data basis from which the individualized brain signatures are inferred. This is very much in contrast to conventional BCI approaches that rely on operand conditioning and need extensive subject training of the order 50 - 100 hours. Our machine learning concept thus allows to achieve high quality feedback already after the very first session. This work reviews a broad range of investigations and experiments that have been performed within the BBCI project. In addition to these general paradigmatic BCI results, this work provides a condensed outline of the underlying machine learning and signal processing techniques that make the BBCI succeed. In the first experimental paradigm we analyze the predictability of limb movement long before the actual movement takes place using only the movement intention measured from the pre-movement (readiness) EEG potentials. The experiments include both off-line studies and an online feedback paradigm. The limits with respect to the spatial resolution of the somatotopy are explored by contrasting brain patterns of movements of left vs. right hand rsp. foot. In a second complementary paradigm <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulations</b> of sensorimotor rhythms caused by motor imagery (left hand vs. right hand vs. foot) are translated into a continuous feedback signal.

40|$|The cost of incongruent stimuli {{is reduced}} when {{conflict}} is expected. This {{series of experiments}} tested whether this improved performance is due to repetition priming or to enhanced cognitive control. Using a paradigm in which Word and Number Stroop alternated every trial, Experiment 1 assessed dynamic trial-to-trial changes. Incongruent trials led to task-specific reduction of conflict (trial n � 2) without cross-task modulation (trial n � 1), but this was fully explained by repetition priming. In contrast, an increased ratio of incongruent words did lead to sustained task-specific enhancement, above and beyond repetition priming (Experiment 2). Experiments 3 and 4 assessed the <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> of cognitive control: A cue predicted the congruency of the incoming trial, allowing participants to establish the correct mindset (Word Stroop in Experiment 3, Flanker task in Experiment 4). Preparing oneself to process an incongruent word (or flanker) enhanced conflict resolution in the subsequent Number Stroop, an example of cross-task modulation. Taken together, these experiments reveal the multifaceted aspects of conflict resolution: Trial-to-trial changes are often due to repetition priming; sustained modulations brought about by task demands are task specific; and voluntary modulations are task general...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) {{based on}} the <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> of {{sensorimotor}} rhythms (SMRs) induced by motor imagery are very prominent because allow a contin-uous control of the external device. Nevertheless, {{the design of a}} SMR-based BCI system that provides every user with a reliable BCI control from the first session, i. e., without extensive training, is still a big challenge. Considerable advances in this direction have been made by the machine learning co-adaptive calibration approach, which combines online adapta-tion techniques with subject learning in order to offer the user a feedback {{from the beginning of the}} experiment. Recently, based on offline analyses, we proposed the novel Common Spatial Patterns Patches (CSPP) technique as a good candidate to improve the co-adaptive calibration. CSPP is an ensemble of localized spatial filters, each of them optimized on subject-specific data by CSP analysis. Here, the evaluation of CSPP in online operation is presented for the first time. Results on three BCI-naive participants show indeed promising results. All three users reach the threshold criterion of 70 % accuracy within one session, even one candidate for whom the weak SMR at rest predicted deficient BCI control. Concurrent recordings of the SMR during a relax condition as well as the course of BCI performance indicate a clear learning effect. I...|$|E

A 67 -year-old hemiplegic patient with no active finger extension was trained with a brain–computer interface (BCI) combined with a specific daily life–oriented physiotherapy. The BCI used electrical brain activity (EEG) and magnetic brain activity (MEG) to drive an orthosis and a robot affixed to the patient’s affected upper extremity, which enabled him to move the paralyzed arm and hand driven by <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> of m-rhythm activity. In addition, the patient practiced goal-directed physiotherapy training. Over 1 year, he completed 3 training blocks. Arm motor function, gait capacities (using Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Wolf Motor Function Test, Modified Ashworth Scale, 10 -m walk speed, and goal attainment score), and brain reorganization (functional MRI, MEG) were repeatedly assessed. Results. The ability of hand and arm movements as well as speed and safety of gait improved significantly (mean 46. 6 %).

40|$|When {{multiple}} {{objects are}} present in a visual scene, they compete for cortical processing in the visual system; selective attention biases this competition so that representations of behaviorally relevant objects enter awareness and irrelevant objects do not. Deployments of selective attention can be voluntary (e. g., shift or attention to a target’s expected spatial location) or stimulus driven (e. g., capture of attention by a target-defining feature such as color). Here we use {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to show that both of these factors induce spatially selective atten-tional modulations within regions of human occipital, parietal, and frontal cortex. In addition, the <b>voluntary</b> attentional <b>modulations</b> are temporally sustained, indicating that activity in these regions dynamically tracks the locus of attention.

40|$|Two {{models of}} visual {{orienting}} of attention are frequently described. Voluntary orienting is usually induced by central cues that direct subjects' {{attention to a}} given location in the visual space. Automatic orienting is provoked by presentation of peripheral cues. It is shown that automatic orienting induces greater attentional costs and benefits, and is less under a subject's control (Jonides 1981). Furthermore, it is not similarly affected by factors such as signal eccentricity (Umilt?t al. 1991). The present experiment was undertaken to investigate how sensitive automatic orienting produced by peripheral cues is to <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulations</b> of attention. In experiment 1, subjects facing situations daily in which attentional requirements are high, were compared to non-practiced ones. In experiment 2, other groups of practiced subjects facing high or low attentional-demanding situations were tested. In both experiments, {{subjects were asked to}} respond to signals, presented in rapid succession, in one of two possible locations in space, on each side of central fixation point. The cue signal automatically oriented attention to one of the two locations in which a first stimulus was presented with 100 % probability; 100 ms after the first response (RT 1), a second response signal (RT 2) was delivered either in the same location (valid condition) or in the opposite location (invalid condition). Four cue probabilities were manipulated for this second stimulus: 100 %/ 0 %, 80 %/ 20 %, 50 %/ 50 %, and 20 %/ 80 %. Two eccentricities of 3 degrees and 6 degrees were tested. RT 2 data demonstrated that (1) there was no eccentricity effect; (2) the higher the cue probability, the greater were the attentional costs; (3) the attentional effects were smaller in the practiced subjects who faced attention-demanding situations daily, than in the other groups. Put together, these data suggest that automatic orienting of attention can be modulated by voluntary attentional processes, according to cue probability. Furthermore, experienced subjects seem to be able to better distribute their attentional resources in space, with increased task requirements. The adoption of an optimal criterion might lead to the use of a cost minimizing strategy...|$|R
40|$|Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) {{allow for}} {{communicating}} intentions by mere brain activity, not involving muscles. Thus, BCIs may offer {{patients who have}} lost all voluntary muscle control the only possible way to communicate. Many recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} BCIs based on electroencephalography (EEG) can allow healthy and severely paralyzed individuals to communicate. While this approach is safe and inexpensive, communication is slow. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides signals with higher spatiotemporal resolution than EEG, and could thus be used to explore whether these improved signal properties translate into increased BCI communication speed. In this study, we investigated the utility of an MEG-based BCI that uses <b>voluntary</b> amplitude <b>modulation</b> of sensorimotor μ and β rhythms. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, we present a simple spatial filtering method that takes the geometric properties of signal propagation in MEG into account, and we present methods that can process artifacts specifically encountered in an MEG-based BCI.

40|$|Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) allow a user {{to control}} a {{computer}} application by brain activity as acquired, e. g., by EEG. One {{of the biggest challenges}} in BCI research is to understand and solve the problem of "BCI Illiteracy", which is that BCI control does not work for a non-negligible portion of users (estimated 15 to 30 %). Here, we investigate the illiteracy problem in BCI systems which are based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. In this paper, a sophisticated adaptation scheme is presented which guides the user from an initial subject-independent classifier that operates on simple features to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts the whole time with the same feedback application. While initial runs use supervised adaptation methods for robust co-adaptive learning of user and machine, final runs use unsupervised adaptation and therefore provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, which does not involve any offline calibration measurement, good performance was obtained by good BCI participants (also one novice) after 3 - 6 min of adaptation. More importantly, the use of machine learning techniques allowed users who were unable to achieve successful feedback before to gain significant control over the BCI system. In particular, one participant had no peak of the sensory motor idle rhythm {{in the beginning of the}} experiment, but could develop such peak during the course of the session (and use <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> of its amplitude to control the feedback application) ...|$|E
40|$|For brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) that utilize {{visual cues}} {{to direct the}} user, the neural signals extracted by the computer are representative of ongoing processes, visual evoked responses, and <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation.</b> We proposed to use three brain signatures for predicting success on a single trial of a BCI task. The first two features, the amplitude and phase of the pre-trial mu amplitude, were chosen as a correlate for cortical excitability. The remaining feature, related to the visually evoked response to the cue, served as a possible measure of fixation and attention to the task. Of these three features, mu rhythm amplitude over the central electrodes {{at the time of}} cue presentation {{and to a lesser extent}} the single trial visual evoked response were correlated with the success on the subsequent imagery task. Despite the potential for gating trials using these features, an offline gating simulation was limited in its ability to produce an increase in device throughput. This discrepancy highlights a distinction between the identification of predictive features, and the use of this knowledge in an online BCI. Using such a system, we cannot assume that the user will respond similarly when faced with a scenario where feedback is altered by trials that are gated on a regular basis. The results of this study suggest the possibility of using individualized, pre-task neural signatures for personalized and asynchronous (self-paced) BCI applications, although these effects need to be quantified in a real-time adaptive scenario in a future study...|$|E
40|$|Horizontal {{vestibulo-ocular reflex}} (VOR) {{function}} was quantified in 14 parkinsonian patients and {{compared with that}} of 10 age-matched normals. Eight patients had mild and 6 had advanced rigidity and akinesia. In advanced disease VOR gains were subnormal in darkness during sinusoidal whole-body rotation at frequencies from 0. 3 to 3. 0 Hz. When fixating a stationary target, patients enhanced VOR gains to near unity, but gains of patients with advanced disease were significantly lower than controls. Visual suppression of the VOR by fixating a target moving with the head was defective in all stages of the disease. Advanced patients also exhibited defective voluntary control of the reflex in darkness: both voluntary enhancement, by imagining a stationary target, and voluntary suppression, by imagining a target moving with the head, were abnormal. This disordered voluntary control of the VOR was independent of defective visually mediated smooth pursuit. Attempted visual and voluntary suppression of the reflex produced a rise in VOR gain, above the hypoactive values recorded in darkness in advanced disease. This inappropriate activation of the VOR implied structural integrity of brainstem smooth eye movement pathways, despite vestibulo-ocular hyporeflexia. Unrecognized degeneration in brainstem VOR circuits, or defective cerebral hemisphere control of the reflex caused by the nigrostriatal or cerebral cortical dysfunction of Parkinson's disease, may explain subnormal ocular responses to passive head motion. We attribute the abnormal visual and <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> of smooth eye movements to disordered long-loop cerebral control of the VOR and suggest that it is analogous to the defective long-loop cerebral regulation of spinal reflexes that occurs in Parkinson's disease...|$|E

40|$|Sensory {{information}} is encoded with sparse spiking in rodent sensory cortex, but {{the organization and}} functional basis of this sparse code is not well understood. I conducted two studies to characterize function and learning in the cortex. In the first study, I used population calcium imaging to study the circuit-level factors underlying sparse coding in layer (L) 2 of mouse somatosensory cortex. Whisker deflection elicited low-probability spikes in small, shifting neural ensembles spanning multiple cortical columns. Neurons within a column-sized imaging field were tuned heterogeneously to many different whiskers, contrary to standard models of somatotopy. A spectrum of whisker-evoked response probability existed across neurons that correlated strongly with spontaneous firing rate. This correlation indicates that {{a major component of}} responsiveness is independent of experimental stimulus choice. The distribution of responsivity was skewed, indicating the existence of a small population of highly-responsive neurons. Highly-responsive neurons included pyramidal cells and interneurons, and individual whisker deflections were primarily encoded by a small, stable population of highly responsive cells. L 2 neurons projecting to motor (M 1) and secondary somatosensory (S 2) cortex differed in whisker tuning and sparseness, suggesting these intermingled populations send disparate information to their targets. Thus, sparse coding in L 2 reflects heterogeneous sensory tuning, low average response probability across neurons, a skewed distribution of inherent responsiveness that includes a small number of more-active neurons, and functional specialization of S 1 output streams. In order to test whether the large pool of unresponsive neurons observed might be important in learning, I developed a novel type of brain-machine interface (BMI) based on calcium imaging in the intact cortex. In this BMI task, the mouse learned to use <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulations</b> of neural activity to control a device. The BMI design allowed for direct control over the relationship between neuronal activity and behavioral output. We trained mice to operantly control an auditory cursor using spike-related calcium signals recorded with 2 -photon imaging in motor and somatosensory cortex. Mice rapidly learned to modulate activity in layer 2 / 3 neurons, evident both across- and within-sessions. Learning was accompanied by striking modifications of firing correlations within spatially localized networks at fine scales (10 - 100 microns). We found that less-active neurons, and even silent neurons, could dramatically up-modulate their firing to successfully learn the task. Neurons in a `cloud' around the BMI-controlling neurons initially exhibited task-related activity, which dampened out as the animal honed in on the specific cells controlling the device. This suggests an economization of activity, which may be reflective of the sparse firing strategies in the cortex. These studies both point to the existence of a gradient of activity in cortical neurons in L 2 / 3, which can nevertheless be volitionally manipulated by learning. Neurons in L 2 / 3 of rodent somatosensory cortex had unexpectedly divergent tuning, organized in a salt-and-pepper fashion. The reliability of their responses depended mainly on intrinsic, stimulus-independent responsivity, and more minimally on tuning and downstream targets. However, even extremely inactive neurons could be induced to modify their firing dramatically by coupling their activity to reward. The network rapidly learned to minimize the number of neurons necessary to perform the task, suggesting that an economizing impetus might be at work in superficial cortex...|$|R
40|$|Brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) allow {{users to}} control a computer application by brain activity as acquired (e. g., by EEG). In our classic machine learning approach to BCIs, the participants undertake a calibration measurement without feedback to acquire data to train the BCI system. After the training, the user can control a BCI and improve the operation through some type of feedback. However, not all BCI users are able to perform sufficiently well during feedback operation. In fact, a nonnegligible portion of participants (estimated 15 %- 30 %) cannot control the system (a BCI illiteracy problem, generic to all motor-imagery-based BCIs). We hypothesize that one main difficulty for a BCI user is the transition from offline calibration to online feedback. In this work, we investigate adaptive machine learning methods to eliminate offline calibration and analyze the performance of 11 volunteers in a BCI based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. We present an adaptat ion scheme that individually guides the user. It starts with a subjectindependent classifier that evolves to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts continuously. These initial runs use supervised techniques for robust coadaptive learning of user and machine. Subsequent runs use unsupervised adaptation to track the features' drift during the session and provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, without any offline calibration, six users, including one novice, obtained good performance after 3 to 6 minutes of adaptation. More important, this novel guided learning also allows participants with BCI illiteracy to gain significant control with the BCI in less than 60 minutes. In addition, one volunteer without sensorimotor idle rhythm peak {{at the beginning of}} the BCI experiment developed it during the course of the session and used <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> of its amplitude to control the feedback application...|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} technique of real-time fMRI neurofeedback trains individuals to regulate their own brain activity via feedback from an fMRI measure of neural activity. Optimum feedback presentation {{has yet to}} be determined, particularly when working with clinical populations. To this end, we compared continuous against intermittent feedback in subjects with tinnitus. Fourteen participants with tinnitus completed the whole experiment consisting of nine runs (3 runs ×  3  days). Prior to the neurofeedback, the target region was localized within the auditory cortex using auditory stimulation (1  kHz tone pulsating at 6  Hz) in an ON-OFF block design. During neurofeedback runs, participants received either continuous (n =  7, age 46. 84  ±  12. 01, Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) 49. 43  ±  15. 70) or intermittent feedback (only after the regulation block) (n =  7, age 47. 42  ±  12. 39, TFI 49. 82  ±  20. 28). Participants were asked to decrease auditory cortex activity that was presented to them by a moving bar. In the first and the last session, participants also underwent arterial spin labeling (ASL) and resting-state fMRI imaging. We assessed tinnitus severity using the TFI questionnaire before all sessions, directly after all sessions and six weeks after all sessions. We then compared neuroimaging results from neurofeedback using a general linear model (GLM) and region-of-interest analysis as well as behavior measures employing a repeated-measures ANOVA. In addition, we looked at the seed-based connectivity of the auditory cortex using resting-state data and the cerebral blood flow using ASL data. GLM group analysis revealed that a considerable part of the target region within the auditory cortex was significantly deactivated during neurofeedback. When comparing continuous and intermittent feedback groups, the continuous group showed a stronger deactivation of parts of the target region, specifically the secondary auditory cortex. This result was confirmed in the region-of-interest analysis that showed a significant down-regulation effect for the continuous but not the intermittent group. Additionally, continuous feedback led to a slightly stronger effect over time while intermittent feedback showed best results in the first session. Behaviorally, there was no significant effect on the total TFI score, though on a descriptive level TFI scores tended to decrease after all sessions and in the six weeks follow up in the continuous group. Seed-based connectivity with a fixed-effects analysis revealed that functional connectivity increased over sessions in the posterior cingulate cortex, premotor area and part of the insula when looking at all patients while cerebral blood flow did not change significantly over time. Overall, these results show that continuous feedback is suitable for long-term neurofeedback experiments while intermittent feedback presentation promises good results for single session experiments when using the auditory cortex as a target region. In particular, the down-regulation effect is more pronounced in the secondary auditory cortex, which might be more susceptible to <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> in comparison to a primary sensory region...|$|E
40|$|High-resolution electroencephalographic (HREEG) {{techniques}} allow {{estimation of}} cortical activity based on non-invasive scalp potential measurements, using appropriate models of volume conduction and of neuroelectrical sources. In {{this study we}} propose an application of this body of technologies, originally developed to obtain functional images of the brain's electrical activity, {{in the context of}} brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Our working hypothesis predicted that, since HREEG pre-processing removes spatial correlation introduced by current conduction in the head structures, by providing the BCI with waveforms that are mostly due to the unmixed activity of a small cortical region, a more reliable classification would be obtained, at least when the activity to detect has a limited generator, which is the case in motor related tasks. HREEG techniques employed in this study rely on (i) individual head models derived from anatomical magnetic resonance images, (ii) distributed source model, composed of a layer of current dipoles, geometrically constrained to the cortical mantle, (iii) depth-weighted minimum L(2) -norm constraint and Tikhonov regularization for linear inverse problem solution and (iv) estimation of electrical activity in cortical regions of interest corresponding to relevant Brodmann areas. Six subjects were trained to learn self modulation of sensorimotor EEG rhythms, related to the imagination of limb movements. Off-line EEG data was used to estimate waveforms of cortical activity (cortical current density, CCD) on selected regions of interest. CCD waveforms were fed into the BCI computational pipeline as an alternative to raw EEG signals; spectral features are evaluated through statistical tests (r(2) analysis), to quantify their reliability for BCI control. These results are compared, within subjects, to analogous results obtained without HREEG techniques. The processing procedure was designed {{in such a way that}} computations could be split into a setup phase (which includes most of the computational burden) and the actual EEG processing phase, which was limited to a single matrix multiplication. This separation allowed to make the procedure suitable for on-line utilization, and a pilot experiment was performed. Results show that lateralization of electrical activity, which is expected to be contralateral to the imagined movement, is more evident on the estimated CCDs than in the scalp potentials. CCDs produce a pattern of relevant spectral features that is more spatially focused, and has a higher statistical significance (EEG: 0. 20 +/- 0. 114 S. D.; CCD: 0. 55 +/- 0. 16 S. D.; p= 10 (- 5)). A pilot experiment showed that a trained subject could utilize <b>voluntary</b> <b>modulation</b> of estimated CCDs for accurate (eight targets) on-line control of a cursor. This study showed that it is practically feasible to utilize HREEG techniques for on-line operation of a BCI system; off-line analysis suggests that accuracy of BCI control is enhanced by the proposed metho...|$|E
40|$|Background. Changes in the {{modulation}} of soleus alpha motoneuron excitability, as {{assessed by}} H reflexes, and temporal sequencing of the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles during voluntary ankle dorsiflexions and plantar flex-ions of young (24. 7 ± 11. 5; n = 13) and older (68. 7 ± 5. 4; n = 13) subjects were assessed to determine potential neural mechanisms that {{might contribute to}} motor control changes associated with aging. Methods. A repetitive stimulation (5 Hz) soleus H-reflex testing protocol and surface electromyography (EMG) {{were used to assess}} the latencies of soleus H-reflex changes in relation to tibialis anterior and soleus EMG activations of standing subjects during voluntary ankle dorsiflexions and plantar flexions at self-selected speeds. The pattern and latency of H-reflex changes in relation to EMG activity were compared between young and old subjects. Results. There were no differences in the relative amount of antagonist muscle (soleus) inhibition during voluntary ankle dorsiflexions between young and old subjects (26. 4 % and 27. 2 % decrease from resting H-reflex values, respec-tively). Older subjects, however, required additional time to achieve these levels of inhibition. Delays in the activation of soleus H reflexes during the plantar flexion task were also observed in older subjects. Older subjects also had con-siderable intra- and intersubject variability in muscle temporal sequencing patterns during ankle plantar flexions. Conclusions. Although older subjects exhibited similar relative levels of alpha motoneuron inhibition and excitation during <b>voluntary</b> movements, this <b>modulation</b> was delayed when compared to younger subjects.

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) of the {{subthalamic nucleus}} (STN) and DBS of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) {{have been shown}} to be effective surgical therapies for Parkinson’s disease (PD). To better understand the PPN and STN as DBS targets for PD, this research compares the anatomy, electrophysiology, and motor control roles of these nuclei. PPN and STN connections were examined in vivo in human subjects and in the non-human primate using probabilistic diffusion tractography. Both the PPN and STN were connected with each other and with the motor cortex (M 1) and basal ganglia. After studying these anatomical connections in primates, their functional significance was further explored in an anesthetized rat model of PD. Examination of the electrophysiological relationship between the PPN and basal ganglia in the presence of slow cortical oscillatory activity suggested that excitatory input from the STN may normally modulate PPN spike timing but that inhibitory oscillatory input from the basal ganglia output nuclei has a greater effect on PPN spike timing in the parkinsonian brain. To examine transmission and modulation of oscillatory activity between these structures at higher frequencies, LFP activity was recorded from the PPN and STN in PD patients performing simple <b>voluntary</b> movements. Movement-related <b>modulation</b> of oscillatory activity predominantly occurred in the α (8 - 12 Hz) and low β (12 - 20 Hz) frequencies in the STN but in the high β (20 - 35 Hz) frequencies in the PPN, supporting observations from rodent studies suggesting that oscillatory activity is not directly transmitted from the STN to the PPN in PD. Finally, to better understand the roles of the STN and PPN in large-scale movement, the effects of STN and PPN DBS on gait abnormalities in PD patients were studied. DBS of the STN appeared to improve gait by optimising executive gait control while DBS of the PPN appeared to restore autonomic gait control. These results have several implications for DBS patient selection, surgical targeting, and for understanding the mechanisms underlying DBS efficacy.
