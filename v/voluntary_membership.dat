40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess how {{individual}} income levels and neighbourhood context affect <b>voluntary</b> association <b>membership.</b> Using data from the 2003 Canadian General Social Survey and a multi-level approach, the nature and extent of these effects is examined. Findings reveal both individual and contextual effects on <b>voluntary</b> association <b>membership</b> in Canada. A negative relationship was found to exist between neighbourhood poverty and <b>voluntary</b> association <b>membership</b> that held even after the inclusion of controls and individual income. Individual income is also found to moderate this relationship between neighbourhood poverty and <b>voluntary</b> association <b>membership.</b> The findings reinforce hypotheses about the importance of contextual influences on individual social behaviours and previous hypotheses that individual and contextual economic disadvantage negatively influence individuals in their capacity and ability to be active in voluntary associations and access the benefits that this membership holds...|$|R
25|$|The Second Sickness Insurance Modification Law {{linked the}} {{indexation}} of the income-limit for compulsory employee coverage {{to the development}} of the pension insurance contribution ceiling (75% of the ceiling), obliged employers to pay half of the contributions in the case of <b>voluntary</b> <b>membership,</b> extended the criteria for <b>voluntary</b> <b>membership</b> of employees, and introduced preventive medical check-ups for certain groups. The Law on Sickness Insurance for Farmers (1972) included the self-employed, their dependants and people who receive old age assistance in sickness insurance. The Law on the Social Insurance of Disabled Persons (1975) included in sickness and pension insurance disabled persons employed in workshops and institutions under certain conditions, while a law was passed in June that year to include all students in statutory sickness insurance. Social protection against the risks of an occupational accident, death, disability, and old age was newly regulated in 1974 through a Civil Servant Provisioning Law that was standard throughout the country.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we raised}} the {{question}} as to what extent members from higher status groups effectuated social resources, more specifically <b>voluntary</b> association <b>membership,</b> as a possible new compensatory strategy to guarantee a successful intergenerational transmission of their occupational status. For that purpose, we investigated whether <b>voluntary</b> association <b>membership</b> (of parents and their child) mediate the positive effect of parental occupational status on that of their child and whether it has become more important over time as an explanation of social reproduction. In the empirical analysis, we incorporated <b>voluntary</b> association <b>membership</b> into the classic status attainment model and estimated path models using retrospective life course data from the Family Survey Dutch Population 2000. The empirical results showed that <b>voluntary</b> association <b>membership</b> does not play a mediating role in the intergenerational transmission of occupational status for the 1916 - 1947 birth cohort. However, it does so for the 1948 - 1960 birth cohort, thereby becoming an effective compensatory strategy in the intergenerational transmission of occupation status...|$|R

40|$|Using World Values Survey {{data from}} 1981 - 2004 and country-level data on {{economic}} development and religious attendance, this study investigates how individual income affects <b>voluntary</b> association <b>membership</b> across 55 countries. This study examines four different levels of membership: only active membership, only inactive membership, a mixture of active and inactive memberships and non-membership. Multilevel logistic regression reveals both individual and contextual-effects on <b>voluntary</b> association <b>membership</b> that differ for only inactive membership. As income doubles, individuals are 10 % {{more likely to be}} active and inactive voluntary association members than non-members and 6. 8 % more likely to be only active members than non-members. Income has no significant effect on the likelihood of inactive membership only. In all models, the relationships between income and membership vary between countries. Contextual {{economic development and}} religious attendance cannot account for any of this variation but do explain some of the between-country variation in average levels of membership. Fixed effects of these variables are examined. The significance of the findings lie in their support for claims that: 1) economic disadvantage is having significant negative effects that could lead to further social marginalisation of poorer individuals and 2) differences exist between active and inactive membership that must be considered when investigating <b>voluntary</b> association <b>membership...</b>|$|R
