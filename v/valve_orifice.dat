25|$|Freezing: In cold {{conditions}} the cooling effect of gas expanding through a <b>valve</b> <b>orifice</b> may cool either {{first or second}} stage sufficiently to cause ice to form. External icing may lock up the spring and exposed moving parts of first or second stage, and freezing of moisture in the air may cause icing on internal surfaces. Either may cause the moving parts of the affected stage to jam open or closed. If the valve freezes closed, it will usually defrost quite rapidly and start working again, and may freeze open soon after. Freezing open {{is more of a}} problem, as the valve will then free-flow and cool further in a positive feedback loop, which can normally only be stopped by closing the cylinder valve and waiting for the ice to thaw. If not stopped, the cylinder will rapidly be emptied.|$|E
2500|$|When the diver {{starts to}} inhale, {{the removal of}} gas from the casing lowers the {{pressure}} inside the chamber, and the external water pressure moves the diaphragm inwards operating a lever. This lifts the valve off its seat, releasing gas into the chamber. The inter-stage gas, at about [...] over ambient pressure, expands through the <b>valve</b> <b>orifice</b> as its pressure is reduced to ambient and supplies the diver with more gas to breathe. When the diver stops inhaling the chamber fills until the external pressure is balanced, the diaphragm returns to its rest position and the lever releases the valve to be closed by the valve spring and gas flow stops.|$|E
2500|$|The normal {{area of the}} mitral <b>valve</b> <b>orifice</b> {{is about}} 4 to 6cm2. In normal cardiac physiology, the mitral valve opens during left {{ventricular}} diastole, to allow blood to flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. A normal mitral valve will not impede {{the flow of blood}} from the left atrium to the left ventricle during (ventricular) diastole, and the pressures in the left atrium and the left ventricle during ventricular diastole will be equal. [...] The result is that the left ventricle gets filled with blood during early ventricular diastole, with {{only a small portion of}} extra blood contributed by contraction of the left atrium (the [...] "atrial kick") during late ventricular diastole.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{atrioventricular}} (AV) septal defect, {{the common}} AV valve {{can have a}} common orifice or can be divided by bridging leaflet tissue into two separate orifices. To determine the accuracy of a two-dimensional echocardiographic technique devised specifically for evaluation {{of the number of}} AV <b>valve</b> <b>orifices,</b> all 69 children undergoing surgical repair of AV septal defect from April 1987 to August 1999 were examined prospectively. The presence of bridging leaflet tissue and the number of AV <b>valve</b> <b>orifices</b> were determined with use of a subcostal imaging plane. From a standard subcostal four-chamber view, the plane of sound was rotated 30 ° to 45 ° clockwise until the AV valve was seen en face. The plane of sound was then tilted from a superior to an inferior direction so that cross-sectional views of the AV valve were examined from the inferior margin of the atrial septum to the superior margin of the ventricular septum. Of the 69 patients, 6 (9 %) were excluded because the appropriate subcostal images were not obtained (in 3 because of obesity and in 3 as a result of operator failure). The remaining 63 children, ranging in age from 1 day to 13. 5 years and in weight from 1 to 55 kg, constituted the study group. Echocardiographic results were compared with surgical observations in 62 patients and with autopsy findings in 1 patient. With the two-dimensional echocardiographic technique, 32 of 33 patients with a common orifice and 28 of 30 patients with two separate AV <b>valve</b> <b>orifices</b> were correctly identified. By chi-square analysis, the echocardiographic technique allowed correct identification of a common <b>orifice</b> <b>valve</b> with 94 % sensitivity and 97 % specificity. For correct identification of two separate orifices, the echocardiographic technique had 97 % sensitivity and 94 % specificity. The positive predictive value of the echocardiographic technique was 97 % for a common orifices and 93 % for two separate orifices. Thus, in patients with AV septal defect, the presence of bridging leaflet tissue and the number of AV <b>valve</b> <b>orifices</b> can be accurately determined with use of a subcostal two-dimensional imaging plane...|$|R

40|$|Fetal {{cardiac output}} was quantitated by 2 -dimensional (2 -D) Doppler echocardiography. Circulatory {{dynamics}} in the fetus differ from circulatory dynamics after birth because {{right and left}} ventricles work in parallel. Therefore, volume flow was estimated over the mitral and tricuspid orifice separately. Serial 2 -D echo Doppler studies were performed in 28 normal fetuses at 4 -week intervals from 15 to 18 weeks of gestation {{to the time of}} parturition. Measurement of blood flow velocities through mitral and tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>orifices</b> and measurement of the diameter of these <b>valve</b> <b>orifices</b> were obtained from apical 4 -chamber views of the fetal heart. Angle-corrected mean temporal blood flow velocities increased linearly with gestational age, whereas the area of blood flow and calculated right and left ventricular output increased exponentially. The right ventricular blood flow velocities, areas of tricuspid orifice and calculated right ventricular outputs were significantly higher than those for the left ventricle when analyzed by paired t test (0. 005 greater than 2 p greater than 0. 001). The ratio of right to left ventricular output decreased from 1. 34 +/- 0. 28 (+/- standard deviation) at 15 weeks to 1. 08 +/- 0. 28 at 40 weeks. The combined ventricular output of the fetus near term is approximately 1, 735 ml/min, whereas flow indicated for estimated fetal weight is constant at a mean value of 553 +/- 153 ml/min/kg. Thus, 2 -D echo Doppler provided a means of estimating fetal cardiac blood flow at the atrioventricular orifices, and blood flow measured at these orifices increased exponentially during gestation, with a larger output from the right ventricle than from the left ventricle. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Eight {{patients}} with {{mild to moderate}} valvular pulmonary stenosis underwent serial physiological studies before surgical intervention. Average pulmonary valve area at the initial study was 0. 59 cm. 2 and at the second study (average 7. 8 years later) was 1. 09 cm. 2, resulting in an average increase of 0. 49 cm. 2 (p greater than 0. 05). In normal subjects during early years the pulmonary valve area increases linearly with age and with increasing body surface area. Though {{patients with}} valvular pulmonary stenosis have smaller <b>valve</b> <b>orifices,</b> they also show an increase in valve size with increasing age and with increasing body growth.

40|$|Sizing a valve or {{a fitting}} in {{single-phase}} flow {{is an easy}} to do operation. In two-phase flow, however, more complex flowing conditions occur and attention must be paid when selecting the model to predict pressure losses. Some special types of valves are also used in industrial plant for regulation purposes and flow control. In this case {{is important to have}} a reliable model to predict the flow rate through the valve in order to operate adequately on the valve actuator to control flow conditions. Different types of valve are used with this purpose: gate <b>valves,</b> globe <b>valves,</b> <b>orifice</b> <b>valves,</b> etc. In previous works a special type of valve used in the petroleum industry has been studied: the choke valve.

40|$|Noise from e. g. gas-transport piping systems {{becomes more}} and more a problem for plants located close to urban areas. Too high noise levels are {{unacceptable}} and will put limitations on the plant capacity. Flow-induced noise of <b>valves,</b> <b>orifices</b> and headers installed in the installation plays a dominant role. To control such noise problems during the engineering phase, methods must come available, which can predict flow-induced noise, propagation of the noise through the entire system and the effect of the noise to the environment. Noise control measures, such as silencers and pipe insulation, must often be incorporated at this engineering stage. The existing methods and standards for calculating noise generation and propagation, in the frequency range of interest, are incomplete and far from convenient for making calculations on large systems. A better and more efficient description of the flow-induced noise generation and propagation through fluid conveying pipes is required for engineering purposes. This paper presents some advanced methods for modelling of flow-induced noise generation and propagation in piping systems...|$|R

50|$|Acute severe aortic {{regurgitation}} {{is associated}} with a three phase murmur, specifically a midsystolic murmur followed by S2, followed by a parasternal early diastolic and mid-diastolic murmur (Austin Flint murmur). Although the exact cause of an Austin Flint murmur is unknown, it is hypothesized that the mechanism of murmur is from the severe aortic regurgitation jet vibrating the anterior mitral valve leaflet, colliding with the mitral inflow during diastole, with increased mitral inflow velocity from the narrowed mitral <b>valve</b> <b>orifice</b> leading to the jet impinging on the myocardial wall.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{narrowing}} of the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>orifice</b> when the valve is open. Mitral stenosis impairs LV filling {{so that there}} is a decrease in end-diastolic volume (preload). This leads to a decrease in stroke volume by the Frank-Starling mechanism and a fall in cardiac output and aortic pressure. This reduction in afterload (in particular, aortic diastolic pressure) enables the end-systolic volume to decrease slightly but not enough to overcome the decline in end-diastolic volume. Therefore, because end-diastolic volume decreases more than end-systolic volume decreases, the stroke volume decreases.|$|E

Most significant are the choice of hydrofluoroalkane- 134 a (HFA- 134 a) as a new propellant (rather than chloroflu-orocarbon, CFC), a smaller exit nozzle diameter and attachment of a spacer {{in order to reduce}} ultimately droplet size and spray inhalation speed, both contributing to higher deposition ef-ficiencies and hence better asthma therapy.
