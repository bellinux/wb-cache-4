The bandplan and appropriate types of emission are also included in the introductory part. The <b>frequency</b> synthesis <b>module</b> is discussed {{in the second part of}} the document. Emphasis is placed on the direct digital synthesis method (DDS) using modern Analog Devices circuits. The proposed DDS module includes a high-speed clock source. The description of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>module</b> with a demodulator is also placed there.

Both modules {{have been}} {{implemented}} using similar hardware, the DAC-VHS and the ADC-VHS from Lyrtech for the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Both platforms are analogous in hardware with the difference that the first one has 8 DACs (Digital to Analog Converters) with 14 -bit precision while the second one has 8 ADCs (Analog to Digital Converters) with 14 -bit precision. For the testbed, only 2 out of 8 are used but the platform allows extensions for more than 2 antennas. Each board has a large Virtex IV FPGA from Xilinx and a Pentium IV processor.

40|$|MicroMAS) is a 3 U cubesat (30 xlOxlO cm, 4 kg) {{hosting a}} passive {{microwave}} spectrometer operating near the 118. 75 -GHz oxygen absorption line. The {{focus of the}} first MicroMAS mission (hereafter, MicroMAS- 1) is to observe convective thunderstorms, tropical cyclones, and hurricanes from a near-equatorial orbit at approximately 500 -km altitude. A MicroMAS flight unit is currently being developed {{in anticipation of a}} 2014 launch. A parabolic reflector is mechanically rotated as the spacecraft orbits the earth, thus directing a cross-track scanned beam with FWHM beam width of 2. 2 -degrees, yielding an approximately 25 -km diameter footprint from a nominal altitude of 500 km. Radiometric calibration is carried out using observations of cold space, the earth's limb, and an internal noise diode that is weakly coupled through the RF front-end electronics. A key technology feature is the development of an ultra-compact <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> processor <b>module</b> for channelization, detection, and A-to-D conversion. The antenna system and RF front-end electronics are highly integrated and miniaturized. A MicroMAS- 2 mission is currently being planned using a multi band spectrometer operating near 118 and 183 GHz in a sun synchronous orbit of approximately 800 -km altitude. A HyMAS- 1 (Hyperspectral Microwave Atmospheric Satellite) mission with approximately 50 channels near 118 and 183 GHz is also being planned.

40|$|Lincoln Laboratory and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center have teamed {{to re-use}} an {{existing}} instrument platform, the CoSMIR/CoSSIR system for atmospheric sounding, {{to develop a}} new capability in hyperspectral filtering, data collection, and display. The volume of the scanhead accomodated an <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> processor(IFP), that provides the filtering and digitization of the raw data and the interoperable remote component (IRC) adapted to CoSMIR, CoSSIR, and HyMAS that stores and archives the data with time tagged calibration and navigation data. The first element of the work is the demonstration of a hyperspectral microwave receiver subsystem that was recently shown using a comprehensive simulation study to yield performance that substantially exceeds current state-of-the-art. Hyperspectral microwave sounders with approximately 100 channels offer temperature and humidity sounding improvements similar to those obtained when infrared sensors became hyperspectral, but with the relative insensitivity to clouds that characterizes microwave sensors. Hyperspectral microwave operation is achieved using independent RF antenna/receiver arrays that sample the same area/volume of the Earth's surface/atmosphere at slightly different frequencies and therefore synthesize a set of dense, finely spaced vertical weighting functions. The second, enabling element of the proposal is the development of a compact 52 -channel <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Frequency</b> processor <b>module.</b> A principal challenge {{in the development of a}} hyperspectral microwave system is the size of the IF filter bank required for channelization. Large bandwidths are simultaneously processed, thus complicating the use of digital back-ends with associated high complexities, costs, and power requirements. Our approach involves passive filters implemented using low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology to achieve an ultra-compact module that can be easily integrated with existing radio frequency front-end technology. This IF processor is universally applicable to other microwave sensing missions requiring compact IF spectrometry. The data include 52 operational channels with low IF module volume (less than 100 cubic centimeters) and mass (less than 300 grams) and linearity better than 0. 3 percent over a 330, 000 dynamic range...|$|R

50|$|In {{communications}} and electronic engineering, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> (IF) is a frequency {{to which a}} carrier wave is shifted as an intermediate step in transmission or reception. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> is created by mixing the carrier signal with a local oscillator signal in a process called heterodyning, resulting in a signal at the difference or beat <b>frequency.</b> <b>Intermediate</b> <b>frequencies</b> are used in superheterodyne radio receivers, in which an incoming signal is shifted to an IF for amplification before final detection is done.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{commonly}} used <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequencies</b> for broadcast receivers are around 455 kHz for AM receivers and 10.7 MHz for FM receivers.
