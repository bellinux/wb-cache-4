40|$|Monkeys (Macaca mulatta) {{were trained}} to order visual arrays based on their number of {{elements}} and to conditionally choose the array with the larger or smaller number of elements dependent on a color cue. When the <b>screen</b> <b>background</b> was red, monkeys were reinforced for choosing the smaller numerical value first. When the <b>screen</b> <b>background</b> was blue, monkeys were reinforced for choosing the larger numerical value first. Monkeys showed a semantic congruity effect analogous to that reported for human comparison judgments. Specifically, decision time was systematically influenced by the semantic congruity between the cue (“choose smaller” or “choose larger”) and {{the magnitude of the}} choice stimuli (small or large numbers of dots). This finding demonstrates a semantic congruity effect in a nonlinguistic animal and provides strong evidence for an evolutionarily primitive magnitude-comparison algorithm common to humans and monkeys...|$|R

For example, many window managers allow the <b>screen</b> <b>background</b> to be specified as a gradient. The colors produced by a gradient vary continuously with position, producing smooth color transitions.|$|R

Bobs required more processing power than sprites, because they required at least one DMA memory copy operation to draw them on the screen.
