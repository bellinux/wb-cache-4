25|$|In April 2009, {{the recall}} already posted for the Supercharged {{iterations}} of the 3800 Series II was expanded {{to cover all}} 3800 Series II engine-equipped vehicles after many fires were reported with Grand Prix GT and 3.8L equipped SE versions, {{as well as the}} sister car Buick Regal LS. The recall for the non-supercharged V6 was to remove the front spark plug retainer and a <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> <b>gasket</b> is not changed on non-supercharged 3.8 engines.

25|$|In March 2008, GM {{announced}} a recall on all 1997–2003 Grand Prix GTP models (as well as sister car Buick Regal GS) {{due to a}} problem that causes fires in the engine compartment. Over 230 fires were reported. This recall affected over 200,000 vehicles equipped with the supercharged 3800 Series II engine. GM {{sent a letter to}} the owners of these vehicles on March 13, 2008, instructing them not to park in garages or carports until the problem was resolved. The recall for the Supercharged engine involved changing the left (front) <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> <b>gasket,</b> as oil leaks onto the exhaust manifold may cause engine fires. Some believed this recall did not fix the fire problem, and instead the problem is likely faulty fuel rail quick disconnect o-rings. There have been reports of fires happening after the recall has been performed.|$|E

50|$|GM {{recalled}} 1.5 million {{vehicles with}} this engine on April 14, 2009 due to risk of fire from engine oil leaking under the <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> <b>gaskets</b> onto hot exhaust manifolds. The fire could {{spread to the}} nearby plastic spark plug wire retainers on the <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> {{and then to the}} rest of the engine compartment. GM fitted the affected vehicles with redesigned spark plug wire retainers. These engines were noted for having problems with the plastic upper intake manifold cracking around the EGR passage. The engine would then hydrolock. The lower intake gaskets and upper intake manifolds were revised, correcting all these issues.|$|R

50|$|Rules and {{regulations}} will change {{depending on the}} venue, but the basics remain the same: Competitors must construct a vehicle using a <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> from a car's engine. Usually it must have four wheels. It can be decorated or modified within the rules set by the organizing body. The <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> is powered by gravity. In a <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> race, two or more racing <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> are placed {{at the top of}} a specially constructed incline, which can be straight or curved. They are released at the same time and the first to cross a finish line at the bottom of the incline wins the race. Win lights or timers may be used to more accurately determine the winner of a race. <b>Valve</b> <b>cover</b> racing is often an event for children at car shows, although adult <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> race events are also seen.|$|R

40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Tier 4 Emission control versus {{conventional}} engine {{design is}} what every design engineer???s challenge {{to be dealt}} with. To design an engine to current market standards and requirements has become very intricate. In order to make such an explicit design which meets the standards, every component of the engine plays as a vital role. Every component design and development to current engineering standards pushes the envelope of manufacturability to new limits, which constraints {{the cost of the}} product across the ease of manufacturability of it. In consideration of the complexity to be attained, every component design contributes to the existence of a complete standardized engine, such as integrated <b>valve</b> <b>cover.</b> With the new tier 4 final regulations for engine manufactures, every new engine produced needs to meet those regulations. Caterpillar Inc regulated to produce tier 4 final compatible engines for the market. The new drive for development of new engines identified the objective of this project to design a new integrated breather <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> for large power engines. <b>Valve</b> <b>Cover,</b> the noun by name explains it <b>covers</b> <b>valves.</b> In explanation to the definition of the <b>valve</b> <b>cover,</b> it covers the cylinder head mechanism;this is a high speed operating <b>valve.</b> <b>Valve</b> <b>Cover</b> not only covers the head mechanism and should also be persistent to pressure, stress and heat dissipated during the operation of the engine. <b>Valve</b> <b>cover</b> design initiates and explains the intricacy of a complete engine design. All the functional requirements of <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> would be designed, analyzed and validated in this project, that drive the process of execution of the project to several phases of product development. Process identified for execution initiates with correct manufacturing technique, design intent and analysis. Caterpillar Inc. Engineering standards have been taken as a reference for defining all form fit functions. Pro engineering, Abaqus, Gambit and Fluent are the computer aided design tools used in this project for the execution of design intent. Identification of a proper manufacturing technique, processed execution of design requirements and analysis of concepts of design are validated across the requirements in this project with a justification of value added solutions are notified in the project. Conclusion on complete product design of integrated breather <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> with optimal solution of all the available techniques in every aspect of design, development and real time production of <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> have been discussed in this project,Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
