The estimation of flow mappings is based on the pressure dynamics of the hydraulic cylinder with the consideration of effects of some unknown system parameters such as the effective bulk modulus of the working fluid.

The upstream valve selects between incoming fluid from an external addition line (trapping) or the eluent addition position (release). The output of the first stopcock is connected via tubing to a cartridge. The output of the cartridge is connected to a second tube that feeds into a second stopcock valve that selects whether the fluid is directed to a built-in collection vial (trapping) or a line into the position where the reaction vessel is sealed for reagent addition (release). The third stopcock valve is used for cartridge purification of the crude product before transfer to the next reaction vessel. The purification cartridge is installed between the dip tube (for removal of crude product from the reaction vessel) and the tube leading to the stopcock.

40|$|Abstract — The {{energy-saving}} programmable valves, {{a unique}} combination of five independently controlled poppet type <b>cartridge</b> <b>valves,</b> {{have been shown}} to significantly reduce energy usage while maintaining excellent control performance. Due {{to the fact that the}} flow characteristics of poppet type <b>cartridge</b> <b>valves</b> are very difficult to model, pressure compensated flow mapping via off-line system identification were used in all previous controller designs. However, individually calibrating each valve in use would prohibit their widespread industrial applications. It is desirable to have a controller requiring only the manufacturer supplied valve flow mappings, which may differ from the true individual valve flow characteristics to certain degrees. This paper presents an Adaptive Robust Controller to control the multi-input valve system with the manufacturer supplied flow mapping only. Robust stability is guaranteed under bounded modelling errors, and the effect of modelling errors is effectively attenuated by the use of nonlinear robust feedback structure that achieves a prescribed transient performance and final tracking accuracy. In addition, real-time adaptation is used to reduce the degree of modelling errors for an improved performance. Experimental results are obtained to validate the proposed scheme.

The thesis proposes an intelligent mechatronics approach [...] -the integration of advanced control techniques with novel hardware reconfiguration and/or re-design [...] -to meet these industrial needs. The Purdue programmable valves; a unique configuration of five independently controlled poppet type <b>cartridge</b> <b>valves,</b> enable not only the decoupled meter-in and meter-out flow controls but also the precise control of the cross-port regeneration flow. When properly controlled, the increased hardware flexibility and controllability lead to significant energy-saving, due to the reduced working pressures and the full use of free regeneration flows. ^ However, the increased hardware flexibility also results in increased complexity in controlling such a multi-input-dual-objective system. A two-level coordinated control scheme is proposed in the thesis: the task-level configures the valve usage for maximal energy saving, and the valve-level utilizes Adaptive Robust Control (ARC) technique to guarantee the closed-loop system stability and performance under various model uncertainties and disturbances. Comparative experimental results were obtained to show the high-level control performance and significant energy saving achieved with the proposed low cost programmable valves.

Neither of the valves are {{able to control the}} pressures at the two cylinder chambers independently or to use the regeneration flow. The result is that while precision motion control is possible, significant energy saving is not. In order to save energy while maintaining excellent motion performance, the independent control of the pressures at the two cylinder chambers and the accurate use of the regeneration flow are two key factors. The programmable valves, a combination of five independently controlled poppet-type <b>cartridge</b> <b>valves,</b> break the mechanical linkage between the meter-in and meter-out orifices, maintain the full functionality of conventional four-way valves and enable the accurate control of the regeneration flow via the true cross port valve.

Our previous works have already shown that the tremendous control flexibility gained by the proposed hardware re-configuration enables one not only to achieve precision control of the cylinder motion but also to decrease the energy usage significantly through actively utilizing the potential and kinetic energy of the load in accomplishing certain tasks such as smooth stopping. However, the control of such an essentially multi-input valve system to achieve the above objectives is far from trivial. In our previous works, a constant off-side pressure was assumed in the controller design for simplicity. This assumption may not be realistic in certain circumstances where the off-side pressure may vary from the assumed constant pressure significantly, especially right after the change of working mode. As a result, though the controller design is simplified, larger tracking error results during the transients.

The accumulators are vessels attached to fluid systems to provide 1) a limited backup source of stored fluid energy for hydraulic/pneumatic mechanical equipment, 2) a damping effect on pressure pulses in fluid systems, and 3) a volume of fluid to be injected passively into a fluid system. Accumulators contain a gas that is compressed or expanded as the fluid from the system enters or exits the accumulator.

The results of this preliminary study indicate that two critical uses of accumulators have been previously evaluated by the NPAR program. NUREGICR- 5699, Aging and Service Wear of Control Rod Drive Mechanisms for BUT Nuclear Plants (Greene 199 I), identified two hydraulic control unit components subject to aging failures: accumulator nitrogen-charging <b>cartridge</b> <b>valves</b> and the scram water accumulator. In addition, NUREGICR- 6001, Aging Assessment of BWR Standby Liquid Control Systems (Buckley et al. 1992), identified two predominant aging-related accumulator failures that result {{in a loss of}} the nitrogen blanket pressure: (charging) valve wear and failure of the gas bladder. The present study has identified five prevalent aging-related accumulator failures: rupture of the accumulator bladder separation of the metal disc {{from the bottom of the}} bladder leakage of the gas from the charging valve leakage past the safety injection tank manway cover gasket leakage past O-rings. An additional study of the accumulator subcomponents associated with these failures is recommended, including an evaluation of current inspection programs to verify that they are detecting the aging degradation effects. The study may also provide beneficial input to the design of passive accumulator applications in advanced reactor designs...|$|R
