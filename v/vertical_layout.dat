5|$|At Ambohimanga, as {{in other}} rova sites, the {{cardinal}} and <b>vertical</b> <b>layout</b> of these various traditional components embodies two cosmological notions of space that coexisted in traditional Imerina. The older system governed sociopolitical order and {{was based on the}} concept of the four cardinal points radiating from a unifying center. A more recent system introduced through the astrology of seafaring Arabs governed the spiritual order and placed special significance on the northeast. The sacred eastern portions of Ambohimanga contained structures associated with the veneration of the ancestors, including the royal tombs, basins of holy water used in royal rituals, and numerous Ficus and Draceana trees, which were symbolic of royalty. The northern portion of the site is the location of a courtyard where royal judgments were handed down from atop a prominent granite boulder, in line with the Malagasy association between the northern cardinal point, masculinity, and political power. The houses of the royal wives were formerly located in the southern portion of the site, a cardinal point traditionally associated with femininity and spiritual power. These competing cosmological systems are also reflected in the placement of the city's main gates at cardinal points, as well as the northeastern gates reserved for use by the sovereign and dedicated to their role in sacred rituals.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} reduce this {{cognitive}} load, parameters such as reducing the list to five likely words, and having a <b>vertical</b> <b>layout</b> of those words may be used. [...] The <b>vertical</b> <b>layout</b> is meant to keep head and eye movements to a minimum, and also gives additional visual cues because the word length becomes apparent. [...] Although many software developers believe that if the word prediction list follows the cursor, that this will reduce eye movements, {{in a study of}} children with Spina Bifida by Tam, Reid, O'Keefe & Nauman (2002) it was shown that typing was more accurate, and that the children also preferred when the list appeared at the bottom edge of the screen, at the midline. Several studies have found that word prediction performance and satisfaction increases when the word list is closer to the keyboard, because of the decreased amount of eye-movements needed.|$|E

It consists of nine storeys plus one mezzanine floor and a basement, and stands 35 m above street level.

The architecture of the building follows a <b>vertical</b> <b>layout,</b> distinguished by a ground-floor on two levels, a mezzanine and four office floors, adorned with an in relief portico, directly above the main entrance, and finally one floor encircled by a balcony surmounted by two neutral levels.

40|$|This senior {{project is}} a {{facilities}} design for the plate production room at Hardy Diagnostics. This project was completed using a systematic layout planning approach. The main reason for this redesign was to consolidate all plate line production into one room. This would ensure better visability for the managers. After the project was defined, the different departments were established and the relationships between those departments were found. The space requirements needed for those departments were then measured out to also include the aisle widths and any machinery or carts needed to complete each function. Having determined all requirements for this facility, three layouts were generated. The first layout is called the horizontal layout because of the direction {{of all of the}} plate lines. The second is called the <b>vertical</b> <b>layout</b> because all the plate lines are positioned vertically. The last is called the modified <b>vertical</b> <b>layout</b> because it is similar to the <b>vertical</b> <b>layout</b> with modifications on the plate line locations. After evaluating each layout, the modified <b>vertical</b> <b>layout</b> was chosen. The implementation costs about $ 3, 880. 00 with a payback period of approximately 3 years...|$|E

40|$|When a {{listener}} {{is surrounded by}} multiple loudspeakers, {{some of which are}} located above and/or below him/her, an immersive threedimensional auditory display can be created with vector base amplitude panning (VBAP). In VBAP a complex loudspeaker layout is divided to loudspeaker triplets or pairs (sets). A sound signal is applied to loudspeakers of one set with different gain factors at one time, which creates a virtual source to a direction that does not necessarily correspond with any of the loudspeakers. The directional quality of virtual sources created with VBAP is studied in this paper. Listening tests are conducted with loudspeaker pairs in horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>layouts,</b> and with a loudspeaker triplet. The results are interpreted with a binaural model. The binaural model is further used to predict directional quality of virtual sources in arbitrary loudspeaker setups. It is found that VBAP predicts the angle between the median plane and a perceived virtual source quite accurately when the loudspeakers of a set are near the median plane. When loudspeakers are moved to a side of the listener, virtual source direction is biased towards the median plane. The elevation of virtual sources is perceived individually and can not be predicted with any panning law. 1...|$|R
