25|$|The <b>versine</b> or {{versed sine}} is a {{trigonometric}} function already appearing {{in some of}} the earliest trigonometric tables. The <b>versine</b> of an angle equals 1 minus its cosine.|$|E
25|$|Defined the <b>versine</b> (utkrama-jya).|$|E
25|$|In 1821, Cauchy {{used the}} terms sinus versus (siv) for the <b>versine</b> and cosinus versus (cosiv) for the coversine.|$|E
25|$|Contains the {{earliest}} tables of sine, cosine and <b>versine</b> values, in 3.75° intervals from 0° to 90°, to 4 decimal places of accuracy.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} related functions, {{most notably the}} coversine and haversine. The latter, half a <b>versine,</b> is of {{particular}} importance in the haversine formula of navigation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>versine</b> {{appears as}} an {{intermediate}} step {{in the application of}} the half-angle formula sin2 = versin('), derived by Ptolemaios, that was used to construct such tables.|$|E
25|$|The sagitta (also {{known as}} the <b>versine)</b> is a line segment drawn {{perpendicular}} to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{the usage}} of the <b>versine,</b> coversine and haversine {{as well as their}} inverse {{functions}} can be traced back centuries, the names for the other five cofunctions appear to be of much younger origin.|$|E
25|$|Another {{historical}} {{advantage of}} the <b>versine</b> {{is that it is}} always non-negative, so its logarithm is defined everywhere except for the single angle (' = 0, 2,...) where it is zerothus, one could use logarithmic tables for multiplications in formulas involving versines.|$|E
25|$|The <b>versine</b> or {{versed sine}} is a {{trigonometric}} function already appearing {{in some of}} the earliest trigonometric tables. It is written as versin('), sinver('), vers('), ver(') or siv('). In Latin, it is known as the sinus versus (flipped sine), versinus, versus or the sagitta (arrow).|$|E
25|$|As ' goes to zero, versin(') is the {{difference}} between two nearly equal quantities, so a user of a trigonometric table for the cosine alone would need a very high accuracy to obtain the <b>versine</b> in order to avoid catastrophic cancellation, making separate tables for the latter convenient. Even with a calculator or computer, round-off errors make it advisable to use the sin2 formula for small'.|$|E
25|$|In 1835, {{the term}} haversine (notated {{naturally}} as hav. or base-10 logarithmically as log. haversine or log. havers.) was coined by James Inman {{in the third}} edition of his work Navigation and Nautical Astronomy: For the Use of British Seamen to simplify the calculation of distances between two points {{on the surface of}} the earth using spherical trigonometry for applications in navigation. Inman also used the terms nat. <b>versine</b> and nat. vers. for versines.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, if the <b>versine</b> {{is small}} and the <b>versine,</b> radius, and half-chord length are known, they {{may be used to}} {{estimate}} the arc length s (AD in the figure above) by the formula ...|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>versine</b> is also {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} deviations from straightness in an arbitrary planar curve, of which the above circle is a special case. Given a chord between two points in a curve, the perpendicular distance v from the chord to the curve (usually at the chord midpoint) is called a <b>versine</b> measurement. For a straight line, the <b>versine</b> of any chord is zero, so this measurement characterizes the straightness of the curve. In the limit as the chord length L goes to zero, the ratio [...] goes to the instantaneous curvature. This usage is especially common in rail transport, where it describes measurements of the straightness of the rail tracks {{and it is the}} basis of the Hallade method for rail surveying.|$|E
2500|$|This figure also {{illustrates}} {{the reason why}} the <b>versine</b> was sometimes called the sagitta, Latin for arrow, from the Arabic usage sahem of the same meaning. This itself comes from the Indian word 'sara' (arrow) that was commonly used to refer to [...] "utkrama-jya". If the arc ADB of the double-angle '= 2' is viewed as a [...] "bow" [...] and the chord AB as its [...] "string", then the <b>versine</b> CD is clearly the [...] "arrow shaft".|$|E
2500|$|Expressed {{in terms}} of the {{meanwhile}} more commonly used [...] "vertical" [...] sines (sinus rectus) and cosines (cosinus rectus) functions, the <b>versine</b> is equal to , or 2sin2.|$|E
2500|$|When the <b>versine</b> v {{is small}} in {{comparison}} to the radius r, it may be approximated from the half-chord length L (the distance AC shown above) by the formula ...|$|E
2500|$|A few {{functions}} {{were common}} historically, but are now seldom used, {{such as the}} chord (...) , the <b>versine</b> (...) (which appeared in the earliest tables), the coversine (...) , the haversine (...) , the exsecant (...) and the excosecant (...) [...] Many more relations between these functions {{are listed in the}} article about trigonometric identities.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trigonometric}} functions of sine and <b>versine,</b> {{from which it}} was trivial to derive the cosine, were used by the mathematician, Aryabhata, in the late 5th century. The calculus theorem now known as [...] "Rolle's theorem" [...] was stated by mathematician, Bhāskara II, in the 12th century.|$|E
2500|$|One period (0 < theta& < [...] ) of a <b>versine</b> or, more commonly, a haversine (or havercosine) {{waveform}} is also {{commonly used}} in signal processing and control theory as {{the shape of a}} pulse or a window function (including Hann, Hann–Poisson and Tukey windows), because it smoothly (continuous in value and slope) [...] "turns on" [...] from zero to one (for haversine) and back to zero. In these applications, it is named Hann function or raised-cosine filter. Likewise, the havercosine is used in raised-cosine distributions in probability theory and statistics.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{vertical}} chord AB {{of the unit}} circle, the sine of the angle ' (representing half of the subtended angle ') is the distance AC (half of the chord). On the other hand, the versed sine of ' is the distance CD {{from the center of}} the chord to the center of the arc. Thus, the sum of cos(') (equal to the length of line OC) and versin(') (equal to the length of line CD) is the radius OD (with length 1). Illustrated this way, the sine is vertical (rectus, literally [...] "straight") while the <b>versine</b> is horizontal (versus, literally [...] "turned against, out-of-place"); both are distances from C to the circle.|$|E
2500|$|Indian {{astronomer}} and mathematician Aryabhata (476-550), in his Aryabhatiya (499) {{introduced a}} number of trigonometric functions (including sine, <b>versine,</b> cosine and inverse sine), trigonometric tables, and techniques and algorithms of algebra. In 628 AD, Brahmagupta suggested that gravity was a force of attraction. He also lucidly explained the use of zero as both a placeholder and a decimal digit, along with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system now used universally throughout the world. Arabic translations of the two astronomers' texts were soon available in the Islamic world, introducing what would become Arabic numerals to the Islamic World by the 9th century. [...] During the 14th–16th centuries, the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics made significant advances in astronomy and especially mathematics, including fields such as trigonometry and analysis. In particular, Madhava of Sangamagrama is considered the [...] "founder of mathematical analysis".|$|E

50|$|His {{definitions}} of sine (jya), cosine (kojya), <b>versine</b> (utkrama-jya),and inverse sine (otkram jya) influenced {{the birth of}} trigonometry.

50|$|The Hallade {{method is}} to use the chord to {{continuously}} measure the <b>versine</b> in an overlapping pattern along the curve. The <b>versine</b> values for the perfect circular curve would have the same number. By comparing the surveyed <b>versine</b> figures to the design versines, this can then be used to determine what slues should be applied to the track {{in order to make the}} curve correctly aligned. This is often done using pegs which are driven into the ground in the cess beside the track to be aligned. The process of putting the pegs in the correct positions is known as 'setting out'.If the curve needs to be of a desired constant radius, which will usually be determined by physical obstructions and the degree of cant which is permitted, the <b>versine</b> can be calculated for the desired radius using this approximation. In practice, many track curves are transition curves and so have changing radii. In order to maintain a smooth transition, the differences in versines between consecutive half chords are measured and minimised.|$|E
