This situation can be caused when the reactants are consumed by the electrochemical reaction faster than they can diffuse into the porous electrode, and can also be caused by variation in bulk flow composition. The latter {{is due to the fact}} that the consumption of reacting species in the reactant flows causes a drop in reactant concentration as it travels along the cell, which causes a drop in the local potential near the tail end of the cell.|$|E
40|$|Organic {{solar cells}} {{demonstrate}} external quantum efficiencies and fill factors approaching those of conventional photovoltaic technologies. However, {{as compared with}} the optical gap of the absorber materials, their open-circuit voltage is much lower, largely due to the presence of significant non-radiative recombination. Here, we study a large data set of published and new material combinations and find that non-radiative <b>voltage</b> <b>losses</b> decrease with increasing charge-transfer-state energies. This observation is explained by considering non-radiative charge-transfer-state decay as electron transfer in the Marcus inverted regime, being facilitated by a common skeletal molecular vibrational mode. Our results suggest an intrinsic link between non-radiative <b>voltage</b> <b>losses</b> and electron-vibration coupling, indicating that these losses are unavoidable. Accordingly, the theoretical upper limit for the power conversion efficiency of single-junction organic solar cells would be reduced to about 25. 5 % and the optimal optical gap increases to 1. 45 – 1. 65 [*]eV, that is, 0. 2 – 0. 3 [*]eV higher than for technologies with minimized non-radiative <b>voltage</b> <b>losses...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Theoretical power {{efficiency}} of class-D amplifiers is 100%. That is to say, {{all of the}} power supplied to it is delivered to the load, none is turned to heat. This is because an ideal switch in its on state would conduct all the current but have no <b>voltage</b> <b>loss</b> across it, hence no heat would be dissipated. And when it is off, it would have the full supply voltage across it but no leak current flowing through it, and again no heat would be dissipated. Real-world power MOSFETs are not ideal switches, but practical efficiencies well over 90% are common. By contrast, linear AB-class amplifiers are always operated with both current flowing through and voltage standing across the power devices.

In particular, when the affected PV modules are part of a string together with other cleaned (or less dusty) ones, operation <b>voltage</b> <b>losses</b> arise. These <b>voltage</b> <b>losses</b> can be several times larger than the short-circuit ones, leading to power losses that can be much larger than what measurements suggest when the PV modules are considered separately.

Typically, the open circuit voltage is calculated using Wagner’s equation. By accounting for the polarization voltage losses, the open circuit voltage can be calculated. However, electrodes degrade over time, and the open circuit voltage cannot be calculated during electrode degradation because the open circuit voltage remains unchanged. The current work proposes a solution to this problem using a current-independent constant anode <b>voltage</b> <b>loss.</b> The denial of large leakage currents does not deny the Wagner-Schmalzried method when a large current-independent constant anode <b>voltage</b> <b>loss</b> occurs.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{behavior}} of the overpotential increase due to a utilization rise in a molten carbonate fuel cell. The behavior is generally explained by Nernst loss, which is a kind of <b>voltage</b> <b>loss</b> due to the thermodynamic potential gradients in a polarization state due to the concentration distribution of reactant species through the gas flow direction. The evaluation of Nernst loss is carried out with a traditional experimental method of constant gas utilization (CU). On the other hand, overpotential due to the gas-phase mass-transport resistance at the anode and cathode shows dependence on the utilization, which can be measured using the inert gas step addition (ISA) method. Since the Nernst loss is assumed to be due to the thermodynamic reasons, the <b>voltage</b> <b>loss</b> can be calculated by the Nernst equation, referred to as a simple calculation (SC) in this work. The three values of <b>voltage</b> <b>loss</b> due to CU, ISA, and SC are compared, showing that these values rise with increases in the utilization within acceptable deviations. When we consider that the anode and cathode reactions are significantly affected by the gas-phase mass transfer, the behavior strongly implies that the <b>voltage</b> <b>loss</b> is attributable not to thermodynamic reasons, namely Nernst loss, but to the kinetic reason of mass-transfer resis-tance in the gas phase...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeven carbon aerogels (CAs) with {{different}} pore size distributions were synthesized {{and used as}} a catalyst support in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) cathodes. The cathodes were tested in 50 cm 2 membrane electrode assemblies. The results demonstrate that the CA texture significantly influences performance by impacting gas diffusion and proton transport. Also, the Nafion ® loading must be adapted to the CA texture, since its easier penetration into large pores favors their obstruction and results in higher proton resistance and mass-transport <b>voltage</b> <b>losses.</b> Under fixed experimental conditions (notably Nafion ®/carbon ratio = 1), the best CA support displays high specific surface area and pore volume, a majority of mesopores with a pore size distribution peak around 25 - 30 nm and with some macropores.

40|$|With a large-area field {{electron}} emitter, when {{an individual}} post-like emitter is sufficiently resistive, and current through it is sufficiently large, then <b>voltage</b> <b>loss</b> occurs along it. This letter provides a simple analytical and conceptual demonstration that this <b>voltage</b> <b>loss</b> is directly and inextricably linked {{to a reduction in}} the field enhancement factor (FEF) at the post apex. A formula relating apex-FEF reduction to this <b>voltage</b> <b>loss</b> was obtained in the paper by Minoux et al. [Nano Lett. 5, 2135 (2005) ] by fitting to numerical results from a Laplace solver. This letter derives the same formula analytically, by using a “floating sphere” model. The analytical proof brings out the underlying physics more clearly and shows that the effect is a general phenomenon, related to reduction in the magnitude of the surface charge in the most protruding parts of an emitter. Voltage-dependent FEF-reduction is one cause of “saturation” in Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plots. Another is a voltage-divider effect, due to measurement-circuit resistance. An integrated theory of both effects is presented. Both together, or either by itself, can cause saturation. Experimentally, if saturation occurs but <b>voltage</b> <b>loss</b> is small (< 20 [*]V, say), then saturation is more probably due to FEF-reduction than voltage division. In this case, existing treatments of electrostatic interaction ("shielding") between closely spaced emitters may need modification. Other putative causes of saturation exist, so the present theory is a partial story. Its extension seems possible and could lead to a more general physical understanding of the causes of FN-plot saturation...|$|E
