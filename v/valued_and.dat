5|$|Examples of {{matching}} include the Head Start program, which requires that recipients provide 20% {{of the total}} annual expenses in either monetary or in-kind contributions. Recipients of these funds may contribute money to cover teacher payroll, or may contribute a building to house the program classrooms. However, the federal government requires that in-kind contributions be properly <b>valued</b> <b>and</b> evidenced (such as estimating {{the value of a}} building {{to make sure that it}} meets the 20% of the program budget), and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only.|$|E
5|$|The {{roughness}} of {{this version}} succeeded {{in a way}} the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was <b>valued,</b> <b>and</b> this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It was a rare moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find often enough to satisfy themselves.|$|E
40|$|The outputs of {{political}} processes, i. e. policy, reflect rational cost-benefit calculations and power relationships, {{but are also}} shaped by the <b>values</b> <b>and</b> beliefs of policy actors, i. e. sovereigns, involved in the decision-making process. <b>Values</b> <b>and</b> beliefs affect how rational analyses and power relationships are understood <b>and</b> <b>valued</b> by sovereigns. This article suggests that understanding sovereigns’ <b>values</b> <b>and</b> beliefs is, however, necessary but insufficient for understanding concrete policy outputs, particularly in complex policy processes characterized by conflicting interests <b>and</b> <b>values.</b> In such cases, sovereigns are forced to prioritize among their <b>values</b> <b>and</b> beliefs. This article proposes a framework for studying how sovereigns prioritize among their <b>values</b> <b>and</b> beliefs. This framework is then used to study a complex policy process ridden with conflicts of interest and value-conflicts, which highlights the <b>value</b> <b>and</b> necessity of studying sovereigns, their <b>values</b> <b>and</b> beliefs, {{as well as the}} prioritizations they make among those <b>values</b> <b>and</b> beliefs...|$|R

5|$|All {{the members}} of the cast for the {{production}} were from Britain or the Commonwealth. Later in the season, one of England's few pre-war international opera stars, Eva Turner, appeared as Turandot. For the company's second season, eminent singers from continental Europe were recruited, including Ljuba Welitsch, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Paolo Silveri, Rudolf Schock and Set Svanholm. Other international stars who were willing to re-learn their roles in English for the company in its early years included Kirsten Flagstad and Hans Hotter for The Valkyrie. Nevertheless, even as early as 1948, the opera in English policy was weakening; the company was obliged to present some Wagner performances in German to recruit leading exponents of the main roles. At first Rankl conducted all the productions; he was dismayed when eminent guest conductors including Beecham, Clemens Krauss and Erich Kleiber were later invited for prestige productions. By 1951 Rankl felt that he was no longer <b>valued,</b> <b>and</b> announced his resignation. In Haltrecht's view, the company that Rankl built up from nothing had outgrown him.|$|E
5|$|Chinook {{helicopters}} {{have been}} relied upon heavily {{to support the}} British forces in Afghanistan continuously {{since the start of}} the war in Afghanistan in 2001; Operation Snipe saw the helicopters used to assist the 1,000 British Commandos sweeping a region of southeathern Afghanistan. Due to the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) scattered throughout the terrain by insurgents, transport helicopters have become highly <b>valued</b> <b>and</b> demanded units in this style of warfare. By April 2006 six Chinooks had been deployed by C-17 transport planes to Kandahar in Southern Afghanistan, in support of Operation Herrick. Two RAF Chinooks were lost in August 2009 during combat operations with the Taliban, one of which was brought down by enemy fire, in spite of warnings months before of Taliban plans to attack the helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly <b>valued</b> <b>and</b> was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E

5|$|Treloar's first {{challenge}} was {{to improve the quality}} of the war diaries kept by AIF units. These diaries were meant to be maintained by each element of the AIF as a record of its activities for later use by historians, but at the time most units recorded few details. To this end, Treloar met with many of the officers responsible for units' war diaries and frequently provided written advice and feedback on the quality of the records submitted to the Section; these methods had previously been used by the Canadian military. Treloar also sought to motivate relevant personnel by demonstrating that the diaries were <b>valued</b> <b>and</b> would be important in ensuring that their unit received recognition for its achievements after the war. In August 1917 the AWRS expanded its activities to include collecting artefacts from the French battlefields. Its tasks increased further in September when it took over responsibility for supervising the official war artists as well as producing and keeping records of non-official publications such as regimental magazines. Individual soldiers were encouraged to contribute artefacts and records, and the AWRS provided museum labels to combat units to encourage them to record the significance and origins of items they submitted. The AWRS established field offices in France and Egypt, and reached a strength of about 600 soldiers and civilians in November 1918. From November 1917 until August 1918 the war correspondent Henry Gullett commanded the AWRS subsection in Cairo; in this role he reported directly to Treloar. As a result of the AWRS' expansion, in March 1918 its headquarters moved from the PRO building to a larger office on Horseferry Road opposite the main offices of the AIF Administrative Headquarters.|$|E

40|$|Issue addressed: Modern health {{promotion}} practice needs {{to respond to}} complex health issues that have multiple interrelated determinants. This requires {{an understanding of the}} <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles of {{health promotion}}. Methods: A literature review was undertaken to explore the <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles evident in current health promotion theory and practice. Results: A broad range of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles are espoused as being integral to modern health promotion theory and practice. Although there are some commonalities across these lists, there is no recognised, authoritative set of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles accepted as fundamental and applicable to modern health promotion. There is a continuum of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles evident in health promotion practice from those associated with holistic, ecological, salutogenic health promotion to those more in keeping with conventional health promotion. Conclusion: There is a need for a system of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles consistent with modern health promotion that enables practitioners to purposefully integrate these <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles into their understanding of health, as well as their needs assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation practice. So what?: A system of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles would assist practitioners to respond to complex health issues that have multiple interrelated determinants...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} value {{relevance}} of book <b>value</b> <b>and</b> dividends versus book <b>value</b> <b>and</b> reported earnings. Our work {{is motivated by}} recent research including Ohlson (1995), Feltham and Ohlson (1995), Bernard (1995), Burgstahler and Dichev (1997), Collins, Maydew and Weiss (1997), Barth, Beaver and Landsman (1998) and Hand and Landsman (1999). We justify modeling price in terms of book <b>value</b> <b>and</b> dividends in two ways. First, using Modigliani and Miller's (1959) argument, dividends may have a stronger correlation with permanent earnings than reported earnings. Second, we derive a model of price in terms of book <b>value</b> <b>and</b> dividends from basic analytical relationships. Three sets of findings are reported. First, overall, the variables, book <b>value</b> <b>and</b> dividends, have almost the same explanatory power as book <b>value</b> <b>and</b> reported earnings. Second, for firms with transitory earnings, dividends have greater explanatory power than earnings but book <b>value</b> <b>and</b> earnings have about the same explanatory power as book <b>value</b> <b>and</b> dividends. Most important, when earnings are transitory <b>and</b> book <b>value</b> is a poor indicator of value, dividends have the greatest explanatory power of the three variables. The value relevance of dividends is confirmed further in statistical tests using holdout samples. ...|$|R
