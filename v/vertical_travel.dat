2500|$|The VIT-2 {{was derived}} from the VIT-1 prototype, but it was given [...] Klimov M-105 engines and its {{structure}} was revised. It was a low-winged, twin-engined aircraft with a mixed structure. The monocoque fuselage was made in halves of 'shpon', molded birch plywood and a large fuel tank was placed between the pilot and rear gunner. The fuel tank was moved to the rear and the canopy was lengthened in consequence. The wing structure was built from a mix of steel tubes and duralumin with a duralumin skin. The empennage was redesigned as a twin tail. The main legs of the conventional landing gear retracted aft into the engine nacelles and were given fairing to reduce drag when retracted, but the tail-wheel was fixed. The nose was extensively glazed to give the bombardier/navigator good visibility and he was armed with a [...] ShVAK cannon with 10° of <b>vertical</b> <b>travel.</b> The rear gunner/radio operator sat in a manually operated turret armed with another ShVAK and he was also provided with a retractable pair of [...] ShKAS machine guns for ventral defense. Two [...] Shpitalnyi Sh-37 cannon and two more ShVAKs were mounted in the wing roots.

5000|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>travel</b> lead, {{referred}} to as [...] "VTL" [...] system, was first developed and patented by C.W. Bermingham in the 1970s. This lead system was developed {{in response to the}} fundamental limitations of either a fixed lead or swinging lead system. The fixed lead system is well suited to level job sites with few obstructions and has the advantage of faster positioning of the lead. The hanging lead is very adaptable to different elevations and batter piles but takes much longer to position. The <b>Vertical</b> <b>Travel</b> Lead was developed to combine the fast and accurate positioning of fixed leads, with the ability to adjust the height of the lead base up or down. The VTL lead is connected to the boom by a sliding connection, which allows the lead to be elevated or lowered below grade. The VTL system has become the industry standard in Canada, US Railway Construction, and many parts of the USA. <b>Vertical</b> <b>Travel</b> Leads come in two main forms: Spud and Box Lead types. Box leads are very common in the Southern United States and Spud Leads are common in the Northern United States, Canada and Europe.|$|E
50|$|The source (which is {{typically}} on the surface) produces a wave travelling downwards. The receivers are positioned {{in an appropriate}} configuration at known depths. For example, in case of vertical seismic profiling, the receivers are aligned vertically, spaced approximately 15 meters apart. The <b>vertical</b> <b>travel</b> time of the wave {{to each of the}} receivers is measured and each such measurement is referred to as a “check-shot” record. Multiple sources may be added or a single source may be moved along predetermined paths, generating seismic waves periodically in order to sample different points in the sub-surface. The result is a series of check-shot records, where each check-shot {{is typically}} a two or three-dimensional array representing a spatial dimension (the source-receiver offset) and a temporal dimension (the <b>vertical</b> <b>travel</b> time).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} TAK-4 {{independent suspension}} system coil spring set-up as fitted to MTVR, LVSR and PLS A1 (front axles), M-ATV and upgraded MRAPs offers around 16-inches of <b>vertical</b> wheel <b>travel</b> and for MTVR, LVSR and PLS-A1, {{and has an}} off-road {{gross vehicle weight rating}} (GVWR) of 12,020 kg. The slighter lighter-capacity version fitted to the M-ATV has an off-road GVWR of 10,433 kg. The light version offered as a potential HMMWV upgrade has a GVWR of 10,000 kg and offers around 14-inches of <b>vertical</b> wheel <b>travel.</b> In all cases the operating profile of the system is 70% off-road, 30% on-road.|$|R

50|$|Unlike squirrels, {{which often}} {{move through the}} canopy by {{climbing}} and descending vertical tree trunks, Geoffroy's tamarin generally avoids large <b>vertical</b> supports during <b>travel.</b> It prefers to move across thin branches, ascending and descending by long leaps.

From Executive Summary: Con Edison {{commenced}} a {{study of}} the mechanical and biological effectiveness of a Ristroph-modified <b>vertical</b> <b>travelling</b> screen installed in one intake forebay at Indian Point Unit 2 in January 1985. The specific objectives of the biological studies were to evaluate the post-impingement survival of fish, and determine whether installing the screens inside the intake forebay would increase the number of fish impinged relative to the numbers impinged on a screen installed at the intake bay entrance. The results of the survival tests demonstrated that Ristroph-modified screens will substantially reduce the numbers of fish killed by impingement at Indian Point...|$|R
50|$|Single curtain, <b>vertical</b> <b>travelling,</b> fixed-width slit, focal-plane {{shutters}} with adjustable {{spring tension}} and slit-width selection remained popular in large and medium format cameras {{for the next}} half-century. The lens on a single curtain FP shutter camera must have its lens cap on when the shutter is cocked; otherwise the film will be double exposed when the blind's cutout re-passes the film gate. A camera-mounted FP shutter's main advantage over the competing interlens leaf shutter was ability to use a very narrow slit to offer an action stopping 1/1000 second shutter speed {{at a time when}} leaf shutters topped out at 1/250 s - although the available contemporaneous ISO 1 to 3 equivalent speed emulsions limited the opportunities to use the high speeds.|$|R

50|$|Arbor pits, where provided, are troughs at {{the stage}} edge that provide {{additional}} <b>vertical</b> <b>travel</b> to a counterweight system's arbors. Providing a counterweight arbor pit can help compensate for height limitations of a fly tower. The trough depth typically ranges from 2 to 10 feet. Shallower pits may be accessible only from above {{at the stage}} deck. Deeper pits are sometimes accessible from a trap room or orchestra pit.|$|E
50|$|A typical hole punch, {{whether a}} single or {{multiple}} hole punch, {{has a long}} lever {{which is used to}} push a bladed cylinder straight through a number of sheets of paper. As the <b>vertical</b> <b>travel</b> distance of the cylinder is only a few millimeters, it can be positioned within a centimeter of the lever fulcrum. For low volume hole punches, the resulting lever need not be more than 8 cm for sufficient force.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} features {{coil springs}} over a solid axle with trailing arms. The split rear axle {{is tied to}} a heavy-duty coil spring suspension.

30|$|Based on past earthquakes, {{the ground}} motions on soft soil sites {{were found to}} be {{generally}} larger than those of nearby rock outcrops (Idriss and Seed 1968). These amplifications of soil site responses were simulated using several computer programs such as SHAKE (Schnabel et al. 1972). The SHAKE program computes the site response of horizontally layered soil-rock profile subjected to transient and <b>vertical</b> <b>travelling</b> shear waves based on the wave propagation solutions of Kanai (1951), Roesset and Whitman (1969), and Tsai and Housner (1970). Cyclic soil behavior is simulated using an equivalent linear model, which is commonly adopted in geotechnical earthquake engineering applications (Idriss and Seed 1968; Kramer 1996). One of the latest versions of SHAKE, which considers frequency-dependent equivalent strain, is SHAKE 91 (Idriss and Sun 1992; Sugito 1995). In my study, a similar site response algorithm proposed by Bardet et al. (2000) is used.|$|R
5000|$|The machine {{operates}} by a {{high speed}} air spindle rotating a grinding bit. The air spindles are removable and interchangeable to achieve varying surface speeds. Some spindles are fixed speed (60000 rpm), others are adjustable (30000-50000 rpm), and still others are very high speed (175000 rpm). The machines have a standard X-Y table with the notable exception of knee travel. All axes are indexed to [...]0001" [...] via a vernier scale on the handwheels, with higher accuracy available {{with the use of}} measuring bars. The machine head has two <b>vertical</b> <b>travels,</b> one rough head adjustment and the other a precise spindle adjustment. The spindle to which the detachable air spindle mounts also rotates at a variable speed and can typically outfeed [...]100" [...] while running, again with an accuracy of [...]0001" [...] on the handwheel or greater, for very precise hole, peg and surface grinding. A well-kept jig grinder will reliably position work to a higher degree of accuracy than is possible with handwheels alone. These features are all critical in positioning a hole and peg system a precise distance from a reference surface or edge.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} {{counterweight}} fly system, an arbor (carriage) is employed {{to balance the}} weight of the batten and attached loads to be flown above the stage. The arbor, which carries a variable number of metal counterweights, moves up and down vertical tracks alongside an offstage wall. In some lower-capacity fly systems, cable guide wires are used instead of tracks to guide the arbors and limit their horizontal play during <b>vertical</b> <b>travel</b> (movement).|$|E
50|$|Most modern 35 mm {{and digital}} SLR cameras now use <b>vertical</b> <b>travel</b> metal blade shutters. These work in {{precisely}} {{the same way as}} the horizontal shutters, but because of the shorter distance the shutter blades must travel (24 mm as opposed to 36 mm), the shutter blades can travel across the film plane in less time. This can result in faster flash synchronization speeds than are possible with the horizontal-curtain focal-plane shutter, and the shutter can reliably provide higher speeds (up to 1/8000 of a second).|$|E
50|$|These {{pipettes}} operate by piston-driven air displacement. A vacuum {{is generated}} by the <b>vertical</b> <b>travel</b> of a metal or ceramic piston within an airtight sleeve. As the piston moves upward, driven by the depression of the plunger, a vacuum is created in the space left vacant by the piston. Air from the tip rises to fill the space left vacant, and the tip air is then replaced by the liquid, which is drawn up into the tip and thus available for transport and dispensing elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|Wayfinding {{in complex}} {{multi-storey}} buildings often brings newcomers {{and even some}} frequent visitors uncertainty and stress. However, there is little understanding on wayfinding in 3 D structure which contains inter-storey and inter-building travelling. This paper presents the method of vision-simulation-augmented wayfinding protocol {{for the study of}} such 3 D structure to find its application from investigating pedestrians’ wayfinding behaviour in general-purpose complex multi-storey buildings. Based on Passini’s studies as a starting point, an exploratory quasi-experiment was developed during the study and then conducted in a daily wayfinding context, adopting wayfinding protocol method with augmentation by the real-time vision simulation. The purpose is to identify people’s natural wayfinding strategies in natural settings, for both frequent visitors and newcomers. It is envisioned that the findings of the study can inspire potential design solutions for supporting pedestrian’s wayfinding in 3 D indoor spaces. From the new method developed and new analytic framework, several findings were identified which differ from other wayfinding literature, such as (1) people seem to directly “make sense” of wayfinding settings, (2) people could translate recurring actions into unconscious operational behaviours, and (3) physical rotation and constrained views, instead of <b>vertical</b> <b>travelling</b> itself, should be problems for wayfinding process, etc. Keywords: Wayfinding Protocol; Real-time Vision Simulation; 3 D Indoor Space; Activity Theory; Structure of Wayfinding process</p...|$|R

50|$|The major {{improvements}} in the FM2 compared to the FM were silicon photodiode light meter sensors, limited automatic dedicated electronic flash control and, most famously, a mechanically-timed vertical metal shutter (bearing mounted for reduced friction and extended life) reaching {{a top speed of}} an unprecedented 1/4000th second, with an X-sync of 1/200. This shutter was able to reach such ultra-fast speeds because its titanium honeycomb curtains had a travel time of 3.3 milliseconds, half of typical <b>vertical</b> <b>travel</b> metal-bladed focal plane shutters of the time.|$|E
50|$|Double {{purchase}} counterweight {{systems are}} sometimes used where the <b>vertical</b> <b>travel</b> of the counterweight arbor would be inadequate due to limited fly space or stage-level wing space. In systems of this type, the operating and lift lines are double-purchased {{so that the}} batten will travel twice {{the distance of the}} arbor. In other words, for every foot of arbor travel, the batten travels two feet. This often results in the arbors remaining well above the stage deck, leaving the otherwise occupied wing space usable for cast and crew.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the Panhard rod is its simplicity. Its major disadvantage is that the axle must necessarily move in an arc relative to the body, with the radius equal {{to the length of}} the Panhard rod. If the rod is too short, it allows excessive sideways movement between the axle and the body at the ends of the spring travel. Therefore, the Panhard rod is less desirable on smaller cars than larger ones. A suspension design that is similar but dramatically reduces the sideways component of the axle's <b>vertical</b> <b>travel</b> is Watt's linkage.|$|E
50|$|Type I hybrid masonry has {{no direct}} contact with the {{surround}} steel frame. For this reason, there are not two subsets of this configuration. Lateral forces are transmitted to the masonry panel through steel plates that are connected to the floor beams and attached to the wall with a through-bolt. The hole in the plate for the through-bolt is slotted so that gravity loads are not transmitted to the masonry panel; the <b>vertical</b> loads <b>travel</b> solely through the steel frame. Thus, the masonry panel takes only the story shear from the above floors and acts as a one story shear wall.|$|R
