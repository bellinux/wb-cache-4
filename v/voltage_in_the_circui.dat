40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a fast and {{efficient}} algorithm for BISTing datapaths described at the Register Transfer (RT) level. This algorithm is parameterized by user defined tuning factors allowing tradeoffs between fault coverage, area overhead and test application time. This algorithm is also generic i. e. independent of the test pattern generators and compactors types. Keywords: RT Level, BIST, Datapath, Test Synthesis 1. Introduction The architecture of most complex digital circuits is composed of a datapath and of a control unit. The datapath is an interconnection of functional units such as adders, multipliers, ALUs, and registers. A state machine called {{the control unit controls}} the datapath behavior. Complex designs are subject to testability problems due to the low controllability and observability of their deeply embedded functional units. Built-In Self Test (BIST) is particularly well-suited to solve these problems since test data are generated and compacted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circui</b> [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{revisit the}} problem of {{general-purpose}} private function evaluation (PFE) wherein a single party P 1 holds a circuit C, while each Pi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n holds a private input xi, and the goal is for a subset (or all) of the parties to learn C(x 1, [...] ., xn) but nothing else. We put forth a general framework for designing PFE where the task of hiding the circuit and securely evaluating its gates are addressed independently: First, we reduce the task of hiding the circuit topology to oblivious evaluation of a mapping that encodes the topology of the circuit, which we refer to as oblivious extended permutation (OEP) since the mapping is a generalization of the permutation mapping. Second, we design a subprotocol for private evaluation of a single gate (PFE for one gate), which we refer to as private gate evaluation (PGE). Finally, we show how to naturally combine the two components to obtain efficient and secure PFE. We apply our framework to several well-known general-purpose MPC constructions, in each case, obtaining the most efficient PFE construction to date, for the considered setting. Similar to the previous work we only consider semi-honest adversaries in this paper. • <b>In</b> <b>the</b> multiparty case with dishonest majority, we apply our techniques to the seminal GMW protocol [GMW 87] and obtain the first general-purpose PFE with linear complexity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circui...</b>|$|R

40|$|Body surface {{potential}} maps were recorded from 117 thoracic sites and 3 limb electrodes in 173 normal subjects older than 30 {{years of age}} and 122 patients with clinically "pure" left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Typical LV hypertrophy map patterns were identified at successive instants during the PQRST waveform by removing from sequential LV hypertrophy maps the corresponding normal variability range at each electrode site. <b>The</b> presence <b>in</b> individual patients of 1 or more patterns typical in time and location of LV hypertrophy allowed retrospective assignment to the LV hypertrophy group. The most consistent discriminant patterns were excessive negative <b>voltages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anterior torso with reciprocal excess of positive <b>voltages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper right chest {{during the second half of}} the P wave, excessive negative <b>voltages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower right anterior torso at mid-QRS and excessive negative <b>voltages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left precordium with reciprocal excess of positive <b>voltages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper right chest throughout ST-T. Best classification results were achieved with ST-T features, followed by features from the P wave, the QRS waveform and the PR segment. Cumulative use of ST-T and P features yielded a specificity of 94 % with a sensitivity of 88 %. Little improvement was obtained by the addition of QRS and PR information. The discriminant map criteria were applied to body {{surface potential}} maps from 169 new subjects (77 normal subjects ages 20 to 30 years and 92 patients with complicated LV hypertrophy). Little modification in specificity (93 %) and sensitivity (90 %) was observed. The performance of commonly used standard lead criteria was also tested. The Sokoloff-Lyon criterion and the Romhilt-Estes point score produced specificities of 82 and 97 %, respectively, with sensitivities of 55 and 64 %.
