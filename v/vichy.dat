5|$|Again, on {{the same}} day, the <b>Vichy</b> French {{government}} issued orders for the naval base and city of Gibraltar to be bombarded. As a result, six bomber squadrons of the <b>Vichy</b> French Air Force (Armée de l'Air de <b>Vichy)</b> and four squadrons of the <b>Vichy</b> French Navy (Marine nationale de <b>Vichy)</b> were employed in the operation. The 64 bombers flew from bases in Oran, Tafaroui (in Algeria), Meknes, Mediouna, and Port Lyautey (in Morocco). The French action was approved by both the German Armistice Commission and the Italian Armistice Commission.|$|E
5|$|Operation Dragoon {{also had}} {{political}} implications. Two {{days after the}} landing, the Germans proceeded to dismantle the <b>Vichy</b> France government. Members of the Sicherheitsdienst stormed French government institutions and moved the <b>Vichy</b> French officials, including Philippe Pétain, to Belfort in Eastern France. Later, they were moved to Sigmaringen in Germany, where they acted as a <b>Vichy</b> French government in exile. With {{the collapse of the}} <b>Vichy</b> French government, troops of the FFI took over and resumed control of the French political institutions. Antony Beevor comments that The landings in the south of France prompted a rapid German withdrawal and thus reduced the damage and suffering done to France.|$|E
5|$|In January 1957, Skyways {{ordered a}} new Decca type 424 radar for {{installation}} at Lympne. In summer 1957, a service was started between Lympne and <b>Vichy,</b> the first service between the UK and <b>Vichy</b> since Hillman's Airways before the war. This {{was part of}} Skyways London–Lympne–Lyons–Nice route. Valence was also served by air.|$|E
5|$|The {{air attack}} on 25 September {{was the last}} by <b>Vichy</b> forces on Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|The relève (relief) was {{a policy}} championed by Pierre Laval in which, in {{exchange}} for French workers volunteering to work in Germany, a proportional number of prisoners would be released. The policy was announced in June 1942 and soon became extremely unpopular and divisive across French society, and among the prisoners themselves. The <b>Vichy</b> government had originally hoped that a much greater number of prisoners would be released under the scheme, but the Germans refused to repatriate prisoners in the proportions which <b>Vichy</b> had suggested. In the end, around 100,000 prisoners were repatriated under the scheme. Many, however, were old or sick prisoners who technically should have been released under earlier quotas rather than peasant soldiers portrayed by <b>Vichy</b> propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in <b>Vichy</b> France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the <b>Vichy</b> government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} prisoners who were released early came from the upper classes.|$|E
5|$|Léopard {{had been}} {{selected}} to convince the <b>Vichy</b> government of La Réunion to join the Free French in June, but the collision and her consequent repairs delayed her mission. On the night of 27/28 November, she arrived off the island with 80 troops aboard. They were landed successfully and seized control of Saint-Denis, Réunion, the island's capital, although the governor fled into the interior. A coast-defense battery engaged the contre-torpilleur and she fired back, with men killed on both sides. The <b>Vichy</b> hold-outs surrendered on the 30th and Léopard remained in the Indian Ocean escorting convoys until March 1943.|$|E
5|$|On 18 July 1940, {{after the}} attack on the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kébir by the British, the <b>Vichy</b> {{government}} authorized a bombing raid of Gibraltar as a response. Little damage was reported to have been done.|$|E
5|$|On 20 March 1941, during World War II, {{when the}} <b>Vichy</b> French were {{in control of}} Syria, Quwatli called for {{immediate}} Syrian independence amid a period of food shortages, high unemployment and widespread nationalist rioting in the country. <b>Vichy</b> troops in the country were defeated by the Allied forces in July and Quwatli left Syria during the campaign. He returned in 1942. France officially recognized Syria's independence on 27 September. However, French troops were not withdrawn and national elections were postponed by the French Mandatory authorities.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June, the Second Armistice at Compiègne {{was signed}} between France and Germany ending hostilities. Northern and western France was placed under direct German occupation, while Alsace-Lorraine {{became part of}} Germany. Italy would control its own zone in the southeast, and an unoccupied zone, the zone libre, would be governed by the newly formed <b>Vichy</b> {{government}} (État Français) led by Pétain. <b>Vichy</b> was nominally independent, and still controlled French overseas colonies, but in practice was essentially a German client state.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Division and the 17th Brigade {{from the}} 6th Division formed {{a key part}} of the Allied ground forces during the Syria–Lebanon Campaign which was fought against <b>Vichy</b> French forces in June and July 1941. RAAF {{aircraft}} also joined the RAF in providing close air support. The Australian force entered Lebanon on 8 June and advanced along the coast road and Litani River valley. Although little resistance had been expected, the <b>Vichy</b> forces mounted a strong defence which made good use of the mountainous terrain. After the Allied attack became bogged down reinforcements were brought in and the Australian ICorps headquarters took command of the operation on 18 June. These changes enabled the Allies to overwhelm the French forces and the 7th Division entered Beirut on 12 July. The loss of Beirut and a British breakthrough in Syria led the <b>Vichy</b> commander to seek an armistice and the campaign ended on 13 July.|$|E
5|$|The 7thDivision, {{reinforced}} by the 6thDivision's 17thBrigade, formed {{a key part of}} the Allied ground forces during the Syria–Lebanon campaign which was fought against <b>Vichy</b> French forces in June and July1941.

5|$|The {{reintegration}} of French prisoners into {{civilian life}} was facilitated by {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to regain their pre-war jobs because of the shortage of labour. The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be more sympathetic to the <b>Vichy</b> regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to <b>Vichy</b> than other groups.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{troops from}} the 7th Division were already {{fighting}} in the Syria–Lebanon Campaign when the re-formed 2/3rd Battalion, along with the 2/5th Battalion and the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment, were committed as reinforcements, to help bring the 7th Division up to strength. In a bitter campaign that lasted 28 days, <b>Vichy</b> French forces attempted to resist the Allied invasion, which had been launched in order to deny the Germans the use of <b>Vichy</b> territory to launch attacks against Egypt. Against a modest Allied force with only limited armour and artillery, the well-equipped French force outnumbered the attackers and {{had the advantage of}} holding the mountainous terrain. Having contributed a company to garrison duties around Sidon in Lebanon, and provided 100 men to help re-form the shattered 2/1st Battalion, the 2/3rd was understrength– consisting of only 21 officers and 385 other ranks– when it entrained at Majdal in Palestine on 18 June 1941 to join the campaign.|$|E
5|$|By late April, British {{attention}} {{had shifted}} to the Middle East due to the Anglo-Iraqi War, although the situation was resolved {{by the end of}} May. A greater concern was that German and Italian forces had intervened in Iraq, using bases in <b>Vichy</b> Syria. With Germans and Italians threatening to gain full control of the French territory, thus jeopardising the British position in the Middle East, the Allies invaded Syria (Operation Exporter) on 8 June. In the face of stiff resistance from the <b>Vichy</b> French, the British realised that reinforcements were needed. On 13June, the 6th Infantry Division (with two infantry brigades) was ordered to reinforce the effort. The leading elements of the 16th Infantry Brigade arrived on 17June and captured Kuneitra. The 23rd Infantry Brigade arrived on 28 June. The division then took part in the Battle of Damascus. The campaign ended on 14July and the division remained in Syria.|$|E
5|$|Closer to home, Southern Rhodesian {{military}} surveyors {{contributed to}} the preliminary planning work for the Allied invasion of Madagascar in May 1942, and landed at Diego Suarez with the invading forces. They remained there long after the <b>Vichy</b> French garrison agreed to an armistice at Ambalavao on 6 November 1942—the last Rhodesian left the island in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Tzara {{took refuge}} from the German {{occupation}} forces, moving to the southern areas, controlled by the <b>Vichy</b> regime. On one occasion, the antisemitic and collaborationist publication Je Suis Partout made his whereabouts known to the Gestapo.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 France was {{overrun by}} Nazi Germany {{and for a}} brief period of time Cochet fell into war captivity. After his release he wasn't allowed to leave the country. He {{launched}} his own sporting goods store in Paris and lived on a farm in the outskirts. He gave tennis broadcasts, and accepted the <b>Vichy</b> government's offer to head its youth tennis program and after that to become a sports commissioner, who organized sport programmes for the deported French armament workers. In December 1940 the first open tennis tournament, combining amateur and professional players, was organized in Paris where Cochet lost to Paul Féret. In December 1941 he regained his amateur status granted by the French Tennis Association. This was in line with the sports policy of the <b>Vichy</b> regime which opposed professionalism. The policy was administered by Borotra who had been appointed General Commissioner for Education and Sports in August 1940.|$|E
5|$|In August 1942, the Allies {{succeeded in}} {{repelling}} a second attack against El Alamein and, {{at a high}} cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta. A few months later, the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya. This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, {{which resulted in the}} region joining the Allies. Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the occupation of <b>Vichy</b> France; although <b>Vichy</b> forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces. The now pincered Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943.|$|E
5|$|In the end, {{this did}} not eventuate, as the 7th Division was {{committed}} to the Syria–Lebanon campaign in early June, to secure the Allied eastern flank from attack. Due {{to the presence of}} <b>Vichy</b> French troops, the campaign was politically sensitive {{and as a result of}} heavy censorship not widely reported in Australia at the time; the nature of the fighting, where it was reported, was also downplayed with the <b>Vichy</b> Forces outnumbering the Allies and also being better equipped. For the 2/3rd, the campaign saw them heavily involved throughout the short, but sharply contested campaign, with each of the four machine gun companies supporting separate efforts by elements of the 7th Division and also British troops, seeing action around Merdajayoun, Metula, Quneitra, Sidon and Damour before the <b>Vichy</b> French requested an armistice in mid-July. The 2/3rd's casualties during the campaign amounted to one officer and 41 other ranks killed or wounded. In the aftermath of the campaign, the 2/3rd stayed on as part of the Allied occupation force established in Syria and Lebanon to defend against a possible drive south by Axis forces through the Caucasus. The battalion defended a position north-east of Beirut, around Bikfaya, initially but was moved around to various locations including Aleppo, on the Turkish border, throughout the remainder of 1941. They endured a bitter cold, and snowy, winter at Fih near Tripoli, which was punctuated by leave drafts to Tel Aviv.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October 1940, Adolf Hitler {{installed}} Philippe Pétain as {{the head}} of state of <b>Vichy</b> France in the Montoire Agreement, abandoning the idea of an independent Breton state to ensure French cooperation. Lu Brezon was partially disarmed, while the separatist leaders of Breton National Party were replaced with autonomists.|$|E
5|$|The 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was {{initially}} divided up, with each company {{attached to a}} different brigade of the 7th Division. Peeler's D Company—assigned to the 25th Brigade—was originally tasked with the maintenance and general repair of the road network in its locality. However, when the <b>Vichy</b> French launched a counter-attack on 15 June, the battalion was concentrated in the Merdjayoun area {{in an effort to}} prevent any further French gains. On the night of 27 June, after a costly assault against the <b>Vichy</b> French at Merdjayoun earlier that day, Peeler led out a patrol to recover the wounded. Four soldiers were discovered and brought back to the Australian lines. Despite suffering heavy casualties in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion served throughout the campaign, including participation in the decisive Battle of Damour in July.|$|E
5|$|The French Navy used light gray {{before the}} war and under the <b>Vichy</b> regime. Free French ships that {{operated}} with the British adopted one of the British schemes. Those that were refitted in American shipyards were usually repainted in the American Measure 22.|$|E
5|$|The Governor-General of the Congo, Pierre Ryckmans, {{decided on}} the day of Belgium's {{surrender}} that the colony would remain loyal to the Allies, {{in stark contrast to the}} French colonies that later pledged allegiance to the pro-German <b>Vichy</b> government. The Congo was therefore administered from London by the Belgian government in exile during the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{message was}} {{repeated}} twice {{on the international}} 600m wavelength. The BdU later changed the order slightly and U-506, U-507 and the Italian submarine Capellini were dispatched. In parallel U-156 was assisting and supplying the survivors in the numerous lifeboats that kept arriving or were picked up. U-506 arrived at 11:32 on 14 September 1942, followed by U-507 in the afternoon of 15 September. Heading to a rendezvous with <b>Vichy</b> French ships under Red Cross banners, the U-boats were attacked by a U.S. Army B-24 Liberator bomber (343d Bomb Squadron; Lieutenant James D. Harden) at 12:32 on 16 September 1942. The attack ordered by Captain Robert C. Richardson III, which killed {{a number of people}} in the lifeboats and damaged U-156, forced Hartenstein to abandon the rescue operations. A majority of survivors were later rescued by British merchant ships and two <b>Vichy</b> French warships, the cruiser Gloire and the sloop Annamite, out of Dakar, Africa.|$|E
5|$|After the war, she was modernized in 1923–25 and {{subsequently}} became a training ship. In 1931, {{the ship was}} converted into an accommodation hulk. Condorcet was captured intact when the Germans occupied <b>Vichy</b> France in November 1942 and was used by them to house sailors of their navy (Kriegsmarine). She was badly damaged by Allied bombing in 1944, but was later raised and scrapped by 1949.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean {{in early}} 1942, Formidable covered the {{invasion}} of Diego Suarez in <b>Vichy</b> Madagascar in mid-1942 against {{the possibility of a}} sortie by the Japanese into the Indian Ocean. Formidable returned home for a brief refit before participating in Operation Torch, {{the invasion of}} French North Africa in November. She remained in the Mediterranean and covered the invasions of Sicily and mainland Italy in 1943 before beginning a lengthy refit.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 the British Admiralty started {{receiving}} {{reports that}} German submarines {{were using the}} rivers in <b>Vichy</b> French parts of Africa {{as a base for}} refuelling. The unit selected to investigate the reports was the Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF) also known as No. 62 Commando. The SSRF was formed in 1941, and consisted {{of a small group of}} 55 commando-trained personnel working with the Special Operations Executive (SOE). While being under operational control of Combined Operations Headquarters, No. 62 Commando itself was under the command Major Gustavus Henry March-Phillipps, usually called Gus March-Phillipps.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, the {{regiment}} {{fought in the}} Middle East, seeing action in Syria against <b>Vichy</b> French forces, as well as operations in Iraq and Iran. It then joined 9th Armoured Brigade, seeing action in North Africa and Italy. With this formation, it {{took part in the}} Second Battle of El Alamein, spearheading the break-out of the 2nd New Zealand Division during Operation Supercharge on 2 November 1942.|$|E
5|$|Louis Stanislas {{travelled}} more through France {{than other}} members of the royal family, who rarely left the Île-de-France. In 1774, he accompanied his sister Clotilde to Chambéry on the journey to meet her bridegroom Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont, heir to the throne of Sardinia. In 1775, he visited Lyon and also his spinster aunts Adélaïde and Victoire while they were taking the waters at <b>Vichy.</b> The four provincial tours that Louis Stanislas took before the year 1791 amounted to a total of three months.|$|E
5|$|Massive {{numbers of}} workers were needed, the <b>Vichy</b> regime imposed a {{compulsory}} labour system, drafting some 600,000 French workers to construct these permanent fortifications along the Dutch, Belgian, and French coasts facing the English Channel. Efficiency of the OT decreased in late 1943 and 1944 {{as a result}} of manpower pressures, fuel shortages and the bombing of worksites, such as V-weapons sites, where some volunteer workers refused to work in such dangerous areas.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom. Paris {{fell to the}} Germans on 14 June {{and eight}} days later France signed an {{armistice}} with Germany and was soon divided into German and Italian occupation zones, and an unoccupied rump state under the <b>Vichy</b> Regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany. France kept its fleet but the British feared the Germans would seize it, so on 3 July, the British attacked it.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April 1941, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion {{embarked}} aboard HMT Queen Mary at Sydney, {{bound for}} the Middle East; Peeler's rank of staff sergeant was confirmed as substantive on the same day. After just under four weeks at sea, the troopship disembarked at Port Tewfik in Suez, where the battalion entrained for Palestine. There it {{was attached to the}} 7th Division in support of the Syrian campaign against <b>Vichy</b> French forces.|$|E
5|$|Rau {{was arrested}} by the French {{authorities}} in September 1939 and sent to Camp Vernet, an internment centre in France, and in November 1941 to a secret prison in Castres. In June 1942, he was {{handed over to the}} Gestapo by the <b>Vichy</b> regime and was held until March 1943 in the Gestapo prison in the Prince Albrecht Street. Afterwards he was sent to the Mauthausen Concentration Camp, where he remained until May 1945, when he participated in a camp rebellion as one of the organisers of a secret military camp organisation.|$|E
5|$|The 2/33rd {{remained}} at Mersa Metruh, undertaking defensive duties, until May 1941, {{but did not}} see combat. After this, the 7th Division began to prepare for an invasion of <b>Vichy</b> French-held Syria and Lebanon. A short-lived campaign, from early June until mid-July, the 2/33rd {{took part in the}} fighting around Merdjayoun– attacking Fort Khiam {{in the early stages of}} the campaign– and Jezzine, fighting mainly in disparate company groups. Following the French capitulation, the battalion undertook garrison duties in Lebanon as part of the Allied occupation force established there to defend against a possible German invasion through Turkey; in September the battalion occupied a position around the port of Tripoli. They remained there until early 1942 when the Australian government requested the return of the 7th Division to Australia, following Japan's entry into the war. The battalion's role, and indeed that of the whole 7th Division, in the fighting against the <b>Vichy</b> French was largely censored at the time due to concerns about negative public opinion in Australia and the battalion's historian, William Crooks, notes that later this caused some friction between 7th Division personnel and those from the 6th and 9th Divisions, and a general lack of public awareness of what they had done. Casualties sustained by the battalion in Syria and Lebanon numbered 21 dead, 84 wounded and 26 captured.|$|E
5|$|The Merina royal {{tradition}} of taxes paid {{in the form}} of labor was continued under the French and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to Antananarivo. Malagasy troops fought for France in World War I. In the 1930s, Nazi political thinkers developed the Madagascar Plan that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of Europe's Jews. During the Second World War, the island was the site of the Battle of Madagascar between the <b>Vichy</b> government and the British.|$|E
