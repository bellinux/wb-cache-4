5|$|Rideau Cottage is a two-level, 22-room Georgian Revival building. Originally, the {{structure}} had 14 rooms {{on a single}} floor. An 1872 remodel, using a different brick, added both the second level and a <b>verandah</b> on three sides of the ground floor. During that remodel, the exterior brick of the first floor was covered in stucco painted to appear like brick. (When the <b>verandah</b> was removed some time later, the stucco remained.) Between 1999 and 2000, the building underwent major renovations to the basement, roof and interior finishes, and the mechanical and electrical systems were upgraded. Outside, the stucco was removed and each brick and joint was individually dyed to give a uniform appearance. It was again renovated in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The 1857 {{house is}} in Regency {{architectural}} style. It was {{oriented so that}} its long side, facing north-east, was roughly parallel to Linwood Avenue. Rectangular in floor plan, the Linwood Avenue frontage had five bays, with the central bay pedimented, which gave the house a symmetrical look. An 1871 photo by Alfred Charles Barker, held by the Canterbury Museum, shows a <b>verandah</b> on the north-west {{side of the building}} only. This <b>verandah</b> was later extended to cover the front as well, and it mirrors the pedimented central bay. A hipped roof was hidden behind a balustrade.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of PLC's wartime {{occupation}} remain, with {{tunnels and}} bomb shelters accessible from below {{the stage of}} College Hall. A plaque presented to the school by the RAAF, in commemoration of PLC's wartime involvement, {{can be found on}} the school <b>verandah</b> at the entrance to the Main School.|$|E
50|$|There are double <b>verandahs</b> on {{all four}} sides and along {{the eastern side of}} the kitchen wing. While the front and side <b>verandahs</b> have {{cast-iron}} posts, balusters and valances, the back and kitchen wing <b>verandahs</b> have been enclosed with hopper windows.|$|R
50|$|The rear of {{the main}} {{building}} faces onto the eastern courtyard. Heavy three storey concrete <b>verandahs,</b> built to replace the narrower original timber <b>verandahs,</b> incorporate the original cast iron panels. The contrasting style and proportion of the concrete <b>verandahs</b> detracts from the original architecture and blocks light out of the stairwell.|$|R
50|$|Early {{photographs}} {{reveal that}} at street level on both street facades, the three shops {{shared a common}} convex iron awning supported on posts with decorative cast iron bracketing. The middle and northwest shops had cantilevered <b>verandahs</b> on the upper floors, onto which French doors opened. The <b>verandahs</b> had elaborately decorative cast iron balustrading, valances and brackets. By 1955 these <b>verandahs</b> were removed. Designed without <b>verandahs,</b> {{the facade of the}} southeast shop was distinguished by arched windows and greater use of render ornament.|$|R
5|$|James Pope-Hennessy came to Banagher in 1970 {{to write}} his {{biography}} of Anthony Trollope. Pope Hennessy had published his first book, London Fabric in 1939, {{for which he was}} awarded the Hawthornden Prize and was a well-established biographer and travel writer by the time he arrived in Banagher. Among his more notable works were a biography of Queen Mary for which he was rewarded by being created a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1960, <b>Verandah</b> (1964) a biography of his grandfather, the Irish colonial governor John Pope Hennessy and Sins of the Fathers (1967), an account of the Atlantic slave traffickers.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is above}} {{and to the}} east of Cave1 and faces north. It was created in late 6th or early 7th century. It is smaller than Cave 1, {{somewhat}} similar in terms of its floor plan, but it is dedicated primarily to Vishnu. Cave2 is reached by climbing 64 steps from the first cave. The cave entrance is a <b>verandah</b> divided by four square pillars with ends as half pillars, all carved out of the monolithic stone face. The pillars have decorative carvings with frieze of ganas (mythical dwarfs) with various facial expressions. On {{the two sides of the}} entrance are standing dvarapalas (guardians) holding flowers, not weapons. Like Cave1, Cave 2 art reflects Hindu theology and arts.|$|E
5|$|Sri Temasek was {{not used}} {{for a number of}} years and fell into disrepair. It then {{underwent}} restoration between 2006 and March 2008 by CPG Consultants under the supervision of architect Maureen Soh. As the original hand-crafted timber arches and railings on the first-storey <b>verandah</b> had been damaged by termites, replacements moulded from the originals made with an aluminium-cast alloy were used. Details on railings, doors and windows were restored, and several pintu pagar (traditional wooden half-doors) and wooden flooring reinstated. The former servants' quarters at the rear of the building were turned into a heritage gallery. The restoration works on Sri Temasek won the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Architectural Heritage Award in Category A (national monuments and fully conserved buildings) in 2008.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has a hipped corrugated iron roof to Hatherton and a gambrel roof to Kingsbury. It has <b>verandahs</b> to three sides and service buildings {{attached to the}} rear. The <b>verandahs</b> have cast iron balustrade, valance, brackets and paired columns. The northeast and southwest <b>verandahs</b> have been enclosed with multi-paned windows and hardboard panelling.|$|R
50|$|<b>Verandahs</b> {{encircle}} {{the main}} block {{of the house}} on upper and lower levels, the upper level having cast-iron balustrading and a concave curved roof sheeted in corrugated galvanised iron. The <b>verandahs</b> are supported on paired timber posts extending through two storeys. Shuttered windows and French doors open from nearly all rooms onto the <b>verandahs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} has <b>verandahs</b> {{to the first}} and second floors and is infilled under this on the ground floor. The <b>verandahs</b> have simple recently constructed timber posts and cross-braced balustrading, ...|$|R
5|$|The Badami cave temples are {{carved out}} of soft Badami {{sandstone}} on a hill cliff. The plan {{of each of the}} four caves (1 to 4) includes an entrance with a <b>verandah</b> (mukha mandapa) supported by stone columns and brackets, a distinctive feature of these caves, leading to a columned mandapa, or main hall (also maha mandapa), and then to the small, square shrine (sanctum sanctorum, garbha ghriya) cut deep inside the cave. The cave temples are linked by a stepped path with intermediate terraces overlooking the town and lake. The cave temples are labelled 1–4 in their ascending series; this numbering does not reflect the sequence of excavation.|$|E
5|$|The hospital, built between 1857 and 1859, was {{a crucial}} {{component}} of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. Located in the north-eastern corner of the prison compound, the building is H-shaped in plan, single storey with rendered and painted limestone walls. It features a wide <b>verandah</b> with timber posts. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell block, with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished, and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The terrace {{comprises}} three {{one story}} cottages, a six room cottage for the principal keeper and two three room cottages for the assistants, all {{sharing the same}} roof. Each of the cottages had a kitchen, a storeroom and a privy. The building was constructed of the same imported sandstone as the lighthouse, dressed outside and plastered inside. The roof was originally made of slate, replaced in 1901 with terracotta, with five chimneys along the ridge and a bay window and gables along the front. A low terrace was built at the rear from random stone. Photographs from the 1950s also show a rear addition with a skillion roof infilling part of the <b>verandah.</b>|$|E
50|$|Subsequent owners {{made many}} {{internal}} alterations: marble fireplaces, cedar fittings and stained glass were removed, ceilings were sheeted with asbestos, <b>verandahs</b> enclosed, rooms modified and the rear <b>verandah's</b> cast-iron balustrading sold off.|$|R
50|$|<b>Verandahs</b> on levels two {{and three}} have been {{enclosed}} with timber screens {{and an assortment of}} louvred, casement, sliding and hopper windows. <b>Verandahs</b> have solid weatherboard balustrading with inverted semicircular openings with batten infill.|$|R
50|$|This {{symmetrical}} three-storeyed {{building of}} the Federation period has deep shady <b>verandahs</b> on the upper two levels. These <b>verandahs,</b> which extend over the footpath, are decorated with cast-iron balustrades and friezes, together with timber fretwork.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1942, the Meriden {{authorities}} {{indicated that}} {{they could no longer}} house the PLC boarders, so Lauriston (now the primary school of Santa Sabina College) and Welbeck, on The Boulevarde at Strathfield, were rented for them. The PLC Council nearly kept the school at Strathfield permanently, but ultimately it was decided that PLC would reopen once again at Croydon in first term 1946. The military agreed to pay for the extensive renovations that were required, Lauriston and Welbeck were disposed of in 1946, and the Lingwood property was retained as a preparatory school. Evidence of PLC's wartime occupation remain, with tunnels and bomb shelters accessible from below the stage of College Hall. A plaque presented to the school by the RAAF, in commemoration of PLC's wartime involvement, {{can be found on the}} school <b>verandah</b> at the entrance to the Main School.|$|E
5|$|Their temple {{building}} {{activity can}} be categorised into three phases. The early phase {{began in the}} last quarter of the 6th century and resulted in many cave temples, prominent among which are three elementary cave temples at Aihole (one Vedic, one Jain and one Buddhist which is incomplete), followed by four developed cave temples at Badami (of which cave 3, a Vaishnava temple, is dated accurately to 578 CE). These cave temples at Badami are similar, in that, each has a plain exterior but an exceptionally well finished interior consisting of a pillared <b>verandah,</b> a columned hall (mantapa) and a cella (shrine, cut deep into rock) which contains the deity of worship. In Badami, three caves temples are Vedic and one in Jain. The Vedic temples contain large well sculpted images of Harihara, Mahishasuramardhini, Varaha, Narasimha, Trivikrama, Vishnu seated on Anantha (the snake) and Nataraja (dancing Shiva).|$|E
5|$|The German missionary Plebot set up {{the first}} tile factory at Mangalore in 1860. It was called the Basel Mission tile factory. Mangalorean Catholics learnt the {{technique}} of preparing Mangalore tiles. The Albuquerque tile factory, the first Indian Mangalore tile factory, was started in South Canara by Pascal Albuquerque at Panemangalore in 1868. Since then, Mangalorean Catholics have been actively involved in manufacturing the tiles. The Alvares tile factory was established in Mangalore by Simon Alvares, a Mangalorean Catholic from Bombay, in 1878. In 1991–1992, out of twelve Mangalore tile manufacturing factories in Mangalore, six were owned by Christians. These tiles, prepared from hard clay, were in great demand throughout India, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, and were even shipped to East Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Australia. These were the only tiles to be recommended for Government buildings in India, and still define Mangalore's skyline and characterise its urban setting. Urban and rural housing follows the traditional variety of laterite brick structures with Mangalore tile roofing on steeply sloped roofs. Inside the house, a spacious hall is present while a large <b>verandah</b> is present {{in front of the}} house. The traditional houses tend to have spacious porticos, red cement or terracotta floors, and have fruit trees outside the house. The old Catholic houses of South Canara bear traces of Portuguese influence. The tall windows, pointed roofs, and verandahs are some of the Portuguese influenced architectural features of the century-old houses.|$|E
50|$|From {{the entry}} porch, {{the front door}} opens into a wide hallway. The hallway, located in the stone section of the building, {{contains}} a staircase {{that leads to the}} upper level. In addition to the hallway space, the stone core has two rooms on each level, all containing fireplaces with timber mantelpieces and opening onto the enclosed <b>verandahs.</b> Openings in the thick masonry walls have deep timber reveals and timber architraves. Some timber paneled doors remain but French doors from the openings onto the enclosed <b>verandahs</b> have been removed. The enclosed <b>verandahs</b> have been partly lined with cement sheeting and the stonework walls facing onto the enclosed <b>verandahs</b> have been painted.|$|R
50|$|The {{residence}} is a single-storeyed, rendered (stuccoed) {{brick building}} with a central rectangular core surrounded by wide <b>verandahs.</b> The side and northern <b>verandahs</b> have been enclosed. The roof is an elongated hip clad in corrugated steel sheeting. On each plane of the roof, the pitch reduces along a particular line, creating a broken-back skirt over the <b>verandahs.</b> Two tall, symmetrically disposed chimneystacks pierce the north-facing plane. The principal entrance is in the northern (rear) elevation.|$|R
50|$|The former {{administration}} {{building is a}} two-storeyed, painted brick structure with a hipped roof and open <b>verandahs</b> to both levels on all sides. It has ornamental cast iron lace balustrades to the upper <b>verandahs</b> and cast iron columns to both levels. Original external timber joinery survives. The ground floor external walls have rendered quoins painted in a contrasting colour. The rear corners have timber fire escape stairs contained within {{the perimeter of the}} <b>verandahs.</b>|$|R
25|$|The initial {{house was}} {{rectangular}} in plan, divided {{down the middle}} by a hallway with two rooms on either side. The house underwent many changes both immediately after construction and over time, {{the first of which}} being the addition of the north <b>verandah.</b> The <b>verandah</b> was a sign of prestige which indicated that the occupant was of a more leisured social class. The Elizabeth Farm <b>verandah</b> is also believed {{to be one of the}} first of its nature in Australia giving birth to a feature which has become characteristic of rural homesteads in the country, a tradition that continues to the present day.|$|E
25|$|The station {{includes}} two cottages, constructed in 1960, timber framed, fibro clad, with galvanised iron roofs. One of the cottages has two storeys and a closed <b>verandah,</b> {{while the other}} is single leveled with an open <b>verandah.</b> The station also comprises a winch house, stores shed, engine room and combined workshop/radio room.|$|E

25|$|As an {{alternative}} to the main dining room, Queen Mary featured a separate cabin-class <b>Verandah</b> Grill on the Sun Deck at the upper aft of the ship. The <b>Verandah</b> Grill was an exclusive à la carte restaurant with a capacity of approximately eighty passengers, and was converted to the Starlight Club at night. Also on board was the Observation Bar, an Art Deco-styled lounge with wide ocean views.|$|E

Prior to entering the main hall, on the left of veranda are two Buddhas carved above the window and side cell. The ceiling of the main hall has remnants of painting. The sanctum Buddha is in preaching posture. The cave is known for the sculpture showing seven Buddhas with attendants on its lintel. The cave has a dedicatory Sanskrit inscription in Brahmi script in its <b>verandah,</b> and it calls the cave as a mandapa.|$|E
50|$|Foe each {{block of}} 'Nalukettu', barring the {{foundation}} and floor is made of carved and slotted wood and has a close resemblance to East Asian gabled and thatched structures. In later years, tiles replaced the coconut fronds. The enclosed courtyard is sunk and is used for ritual ablutions and to grow plants for ritual use. The courtyard is open and gives {{direct access to the}} rooms. The building is divided into two blocks by an inner temple where the family deity is kept and worshipped. The large teak doors on the outer <b>verandahs</b> are reserved for various ritual uses and are seldom opened. The outer <b>verandahs</b> on both the western and eastern <b>verandahs</b> are left open, the northern and southern <b>verandahs</b> are enclosed or semi-enclosed.|$|R
50|$|The north {{elevation}} is symmetrical with {{a central}} projecting gabled entry porch with twin side stair, recessed seat and timber louvres. The gable has shingle cladding and a lower awning supported by deep, curved timber brackets. The <b>verandahs</b> have crossbraced railing, timber posts and brackets and raked, lined ceilings. The <b>verandahs</b> have been enclosed, with {{the south and east}} having sash and casement windows, and the remaining <b>verandahs</b> having flywire.
