40|$|We {{present a}} theory of spino¤s in which the key {{ingredient}} is the originator’s private information concerning {{the quality of his}} new idea. Because quality is privately observed, by the standard adverse-selection logic, the market can at best o¤er a price that re‡ects the average quality of ideas sold. This gives the holders of above-average-quality ideas the incentive to spin o¤. We show that only workers with <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> decide to spin o¤, while workers with mediocre ideas sell them. Entrepreneurs of existing …rms pay a price for the ideas sold in the market that implies zero expected pro…ts for them. Hence, …rms’project selection is independent of …rm size, which, under some additional assumptions, leads to scale-independent growth.

40|$|Introduction Support Vector Machines try {{to achieve}} good {{generalization}} by computing the maximum margin separating hyperplane in a high-dimensional feature space. This approach eectively combines two <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>ideas.</b> The rst {{idea is to}} map the space of input vectors into a very high-dimensional feature space {{in such a way}} that nonlinear decisions functions on the input space can be constructed by using only separating hyperplanes on the feature space. By making use of kernels, we can implicitly perform such mappings without explicitly using high-dimensional separating vectors(Boser et al., 1992). Since it is very likely that the training examples will be linearly separable in the high-dimensional feature space, this method oers an elegant alternative to network growth algorithms as in(Rujan and Marchand, 1989; Marchand et al., 1990) which try to construct nonlinear decision surfaces by combining perceptrons. The second idea is to construct the separating hyperplane on t...|$|R
40|$|Few of {{the current}} major efforts to improve urban schools {{adequately}} appreciate {{the extent to which}} the problematic social climate of urban schools can undermine the implementation of even <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>ideas.</b> As a result, programs often come and go with little lasting impact. This paper uses ethnographic fieldwork to illustrate the ways dysfunctional relationships among teachers, parents, and administrators interfere with the actual implementation of reform programs even when all parties are substantially in agreement about goals and means. Data are from 16 elementary schools in Chicago (Illinois) that are trying to implement the Comer process of school reform (J. Comer, 1980 and later). The operating assumptions underlying several current reform efforts are contrasted with the day-to-day realities of schools. (Contains 54 references.)

40|$|In 1989 Ladnor Geissinger at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill devel-oped an {{extraordinary}} DOS program called Exploring Small Groups (ESG) for students learning beginning group theory.

The pro-gram is available free of charge from our website. In this article we discuss the features and philosophy of FGB and we offer some suggestions for its use. In conjunction with Parker’s labs, our perspective will give the instructor of beginning abstract algebra some <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> about using FGB to convey the intricacies of group theory as well as the sense of discovery which any research mathematician knows intimately. ...|$|R

40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Many teachers may well have <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> on how they would wish to see the curriculum changed and developed {{to meet the needs}} of a rapidly expanding technocracy. How successful they may be, however, in terms of delivery of those ideas in practice is perhaps suspect. This study is directed at arriving at some perspective on the management and delivery of change in the field of design education, although many principles and concepts may well be transferable to whole school curriculum/ organisational renewal needs. It is doubtful whether anyone feels totally prepared for change. Often those who attempt to innovate and introduce change may find it effects far less in patterns of teaching/learning than they had hoped for. Little in the way of productive theory about those conditions that might lead to desired change has until recently been readily available [...] cont'd...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} theory of firm {{dynamics}} in which workers have ideas for new projects that can be sold in a market to existing firms or implemented in new firms by them: spin-offs. Workers have private information {{about the quality of}} their ideas. Because of an adverse selection problem, workers can sell their ideas to existing firms at a price that is not contingent on their information. We show that only workers with <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> decide to spin off and set up a new firm while workers with mediocre ideas sell them. Entrepreneurs of existing firms pay a price for the ideas sold in the market that implies zero expected profits for them. Hence, firms’ project selection is independent of firm size, which, under some additional assumptions, leads to scale-independent growth. The entry and growth process of firms in this economy leads to an invariant firm-size distribution that resembles the one in the US economy. ...|$|R
