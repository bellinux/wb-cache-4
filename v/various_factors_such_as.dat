5|$|When {{it is in}} an aqueous solution, {{neptunium}} {{can exist}} in any of its five possible oxidation states (+3 to +7) and each of these show a characteristic color. The stability of each oxidation state {{is strongly dependent on}} <b>various</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the presence of oxidizing or reducing agents, pH of the solution, presence of coordination complex-forming ligands, and even the concentration of neptunium in the solution.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to <b>various</b> <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E

Social support and personal control are possibly the two most important factors that predict well-being, morbidity and mortality in adults. Other factors that may link to well-being and quality of life in the elderly include social relationships (possibly relationships with pets as well as humans), and health.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that aside from manifesting {{insensitivity}} towards human rights concerns and hypersensitivity towards public order considerations, this approach ultimately reflects a judicial perception with a primary mandate of safeguarding executive goals rather than individual liberties. What the High Court in Chan Hiang Leng Colin could have done was to take into account <b>various</b> <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the number of Jehovah's Witnesses in Singapore and whether their forbearance from military service posed a genuine threat to public order such that it warranted the curtailment of the right to religious freedom under Article 15 of the Constitution.|$|E

25|$|Naja is a genus in {{the family}} Elapidae. Linnaeus first {{described}} Naja nivea in 1758. He originally assigned the binomial name Coluber niveus, but some ten years afterwards Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti described the genus of true cobras under the name Naja. In 2007 Wüster et al. partitioned the genus Naja into four separate subgenera {{on the basis of}} <b>various</b> <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> lineage, morphology and diet. They placed Naja nivea in the subgenus Uraeus, the African non-spitting cobras: the Cape cobra (N. nivea), the Egyptian cobra (N. haje), the snouted cobra (N. annulifera), Anchieta's cobra (N. anchietae), Arabian cobra (N. arabica) and Senegalese cobra (N. senegalensis).|$|E
25|$|Accustomed {{to writing}} the scripts for movies, Gowariker {{said that he}} found it {{difficult}} to write the script for Everest. Typically, {{in the case of a}} soap opera, the story is not written entirely prior to release. Rather, it is written as the soap opera goes on, analysing <b>various</b> <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the TRPs (television rating points) and the audience feedback. Everest, however, was not written this way. Gowariker has also said that it was while writing the story that he realised the self-satisfaction that people get after climbing Mount Everest. After finishing writing the story, he realised not only that he wanted to produce the show, but also that he also needed experts to direct it. Gowariker said in a group interview that through Everest he would also be addressing the girl child issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{individuality}} of a {{being is}} a certain intricate form, not an enduring substance. In order to understand an organism, it must {{be thought of as}} a pattern which maintains itself through homeostasis – life continues by maintaining an internal balance of <b>various</b> <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> temperature and molecular structure. While the material substances that compose a living being may be constantly replaced by nearly identical ones, an organism continues functioning with the same identity as long as the pattern is kept sufficiently intact. Since patterns can be transmitted, modified, or duplicated, they are therefore a kind of information. Based on this, Wiener suggests it should be theoretically possible to transmit the entirety of a living person as a message (which is practically indistinguishable from the concept of physical teleportation) – although he admits that the obstacles to such a process would be great, because of the enormous amount of information embodied in a person, and the difficulty of reading or writing it.|$|E

25|$|Hemoglobin {{exists in}} two forms, a taut (tense) form (T) and a relaxed form (R). <b>Various</b> <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> low pH, high CO2 and high 2,3 BPG {{at the level}} of the tissues favor the taut form, which has low oxygen {{affinity}} and releases oxygen in the tissues. Conversely, a high pH, low CO2, or low 2,3 BPG favors the relaxed form, which can better bind oxygen. The partial pressure of the system also affects O2 affinity where, at high partial pressures of oxygen (such as those present in the alveoli), the relaxed (high affinity, R) state is favoured. Inversely, at low partial pressures (such as those present in respiring tissues), the (low affinity, T) tense state is favoured. Additionally, the binding of oxygen to the iron(II) heme pulls the iron into the plane of the porphyrin ring, causing a slight conformational shift. The shift encourages oxygen to bind to the three remaining heme units within hemoglobin (thus, oxygen binding is cooperative).|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Humble eBook Bundle, John Scalzi {{noted that}} <b>various</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> brand name recognition, a lack of DRM, a focus on charity, the {{uniqueness}} of the bundle and its format, and the variety of included authors, all made the Humble eBook Bundle a success. Scalzi notes that while people who participate in Humble Bundles will get less in net profit than they would have without the bundle (due to the variable percentages patrons can donate and publishers taking their cut of proceeds), but in return receive greater volume (the Humble Bundle sold 42,000 copies of eBooks in two weeks, almost as much as the average monthly bestseller). In conclusion, Scalzi lauds the idea of the Humble Bundle, and notes to future contributors that while the bundle is low-margin, it's also low-risk. Novelist Cory Doctorow, who organized both eBook bundles, noted that while no publisher aside from Tor Books would participate in the bundle because of no-DRM stipulations, they still raised around $2 million for books whose circulations were earning their authors little to no money.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft {{entered the}} {{operating}} system (OS) business in 1980 with {{its own version of}} Unix, called Xenix. However, it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance. After negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS, which was set {{to be used in the}} upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC). For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products, which it branded as MS-DOS, though IBM rebranded it to PC DOS. Following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981, Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS. Since IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to {{the operating system}}s. Due to <b>various</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> MS-DOS's available software selection, Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor. The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a publishing division named Microsoft Press.|$|E

500|$|In {{astrobiology}} {{and planetary}} astrophysics, the galactic habitable zone is {{the region of}} a galaxy in which life might most likely develop.

According to research published in August 2015, very large galaxies may [...] favor the birth and development of habitable planets more than smaller galaxies such as the Milky Way. In the case of the Milky Way, its galactic habitable zone is commonly believed to be an annulus with an outer radius of about 10 kiloparsecs and an inner radius close to the Galactic Center (with both radii lacking hard boundaries).|$|E
