25|$|It was {{reported}} that Abramovich tried to buy the entire Cagliari club when Zola refused to renege on his <b>verbal</b> <b>contract</b> with Cagliari, although Zola himself will not confirm it. Zola subsequently led Cagliari to promotion to the Italian Serie A. Then he renewed his contract for Cagliari Calcio for one more year. He retired in June 2005, after ending his career in appropriate style with a double against Juventus in his last ever professional game. His number 10 Cagliari jersey was withdrawn in his honour for the season after he left but was worn in the 2006–07 season by Andrea Capone. Zola retired as the fifth highest goalscorer of free-kicks in Serie A history, with 20 goals from set-pieces, and currently sits behind only Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio (21), Alessandro Del Piero (22), Andrea Pirlo (27), and Siniša Mihajlović (28).|$|E

40|$|The {{global demand}} for product quality and safety in Western European markets has {{motivated}} {{rapid growth of}} production and marketing codes of conduct between business partners. However, though the Kenya Horticultural Crops Development Authority’s code of conduct on contractual guidelines has promoted business to farm business (B 2 B) relationships between exporters and smallholders, the relationships have received little empirical analysis. This paper uses case analysis based on strategic marketing framework to examine the B 2 B’s purpose, target and competitive, growth, promotion, distribution, and pricing strategies. The analysis reveals that the B 2 B strategies are based on supply chain governance constructs: written and <b>verbal</b> <b>contracts.</b> The purpose of the contracts is to manage procurement of high quality and safe produce which in itself is contingent on the European Union market served. On targets, written contracts seem efficient with organized producers and <b>verbal</b> <b>contracts</b> with independent producers. As competitive edges, written contracts are orientated toward differentiation strategy and <b>verbal</b> <b>contracts,</b> low-cost strategy. Growth in written contracts is through market penetration and diversification in <b>verbal</b> <b>contracts.</b> However, sharp differences exist on distributional, promotional and pricing strategies...|$|R

6000|$|But Charles Gould, openly preoccupied now, gave not a sign, made no sound. The impenetrability of the {{embodied}} Gould Concession had {{its surface}} shades. To be dumb {{is merely a}} fatal affliction; but the King of Sulaco had words enough to give him all the mysterious weight of a taciturn force. His silences, backed {{by the power of}} speech, had as many shades of significance as uttered words in the way of assent, of doubt, of negation--even of simple comment. Some seemed to say plainly, [...] "Think it over"; others meant clearly, [...] "Go ahead"; a simple, low [...] "I see," [...] with an affirmative nod, {{at the end of a}} patient listening half-hour was the equivalent of a <b>verbal</b> <b>contract,</b> which men had learned to trust implicitly, since behind it all there was the great San Tome mine, the head and front of the material interests, so strong that it depended on no man's goodwill in the whole length and breadth of the Occidental Province--that is, on no goodwill which it could not buy ten times over. But to the little hook-nosed man from Esmeralda, anxious about the export of hides, the silence of Charles Gould portended a failure. Evidently this was no time for extending a modest man's business. He enveloped in a swift mental malediction the whole country, with all its inhabitants, partisans of Ribiera and Montero alike; and there were incipient tears in his mute anger at the thought of the innumerable ox-hides going to waste upon the dreamy expanse of the Campo, with its single palms rising like ships at sea within the perfect circle of the horizon, its clumps of heavy timber motionless like solid islands of leaves above the running waves of grass. There were hides there, rotting, with no profit to anybody--rotting where they had been dropped by men called away to attend the urgent necessities of political revolutions. The practical, mercantile soul of Senor Hirsch rebelled against all that foolishness, while he was taking a respectful but disconcerted leave of the might and majesty of the San Tome mine in the person of Charles Gould. He could not restrain a heart-broken murmur, wrung out of his very aching heart, as it were.|$|E

The early Court of Chancery dealt with <b>verbal</b> <b>contracts,</b> matters of land law and matters of trusts, and had a very liberal view when setting aside complaints; poverty, for example, was an acceptable reason to cancel a contract or obligation. Complaints were normally brought via a bill or petition, which had to show that the common law did not provide a remedy for the problem. The Chancery writs were in French, and later English, rather than the Latin used for common law bills. In the reign of Edward III, the Court found a fixed home at Westminster Hall, where it sat almost continually until its dissolution. Before this, justice was difficult to dispose because the Lord Chancellor had to travel with the King wherever he went.|$|R
