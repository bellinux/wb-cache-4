40|$|Aim : To {{evaluate}} the integral dose to carotid vessels in extended field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) (including the lower neck nodes in IMRT field) and split field IMRT (using separate single anterior field to treat lower neck nodes) in cancer nasopharynx. Materials and Methods : Dosimetric data from 10 patients of carcinoma nasopharynx, undergoing IMRT, were evaluated in this prospective study. The carotid vessels were contoured from sternoclavicular joints upto {{the base of}} skull. IMRT plans were generated for all patients with extended field and split field IMRT techniques using nine coplanar beams with 6 MV photons. A dose of 70 Gy to planning target volume (PTV) 70 Gy, 59. 4 Gy to PTV 59. 4 Gy and 54 Gy to PTV 54 Gy was delivered in 33 fractions. The dose constraints were similar for both the techniques. The integral dose to the carotid arteries was calculated as the mean dose times the volume (mean dose &# 935; <b>volume)</b> <b>in</b> <b>units</b> of liter-gray. Results : The mean dose to the carotid vessels in the extended field IMRT was 63. 88 &# 177; 0. 97 Gy (mean dose &# 177; SD) and it was 64. 43 &# 177; 0. 73 Gy for the split field technique. The integral dose in the extended field versus split field technique was 0. 29 &# 177; 0. 0207 and 0. 32 &# 177; 0. 0213 liter-gray, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 013). Conclusions : Extended field IMRT delivers a slightly lower integral dose to carotid arteries in treatment of cancer nasopharynx while maintaining good dose homogeneity to the PTV 54 Gy and can be preferred over split field radiotherapy...|$|E

Upon RBC transfusion, improvement in cerebral blood flow and oxygenation have been observed, while a more liberal transfusion policy may be associated with a better developmental outcome. The effect of the transfusion volume on long-term outcome is not known. Methods Observational follow-up study of a cohort of extremely premature born infants, treated in 2 neonatal intensive care units using a different transfusion <b>volume</b> (15 ml/kg <b>in</b> <b>Unit</b> A and 20 ml/kg <b>in</b> <b>Unit</b> B). The primary outcome was a composite of post discharge mortality, neuromotor developmental delay, blindness or deafness, evaluated at a mean corrected age (CA) of 24 months related to the transfusion volume/kg bodyweight administered during the postnatal hospital stay. Results Despite the difference <b>in</b> transfusion <b>volume</b> <b>in</b> clinically comparable groups of infants, they received a similar number of transfusions (5. 5 ± 3. 2 versus 5. 5 ± 2. 3 respectively <b>in</b> <b>Unit</b> A and B). The total transfused <b>volume</b> <b>in</b> <b>unit</b> A was 79 ± 47 ml/kg and 108 ± 47 ml/kg <b>in</b> <b>unit</b> B (p = 0. 02). Total transfused RBC volume per kg bodyweight was not an independent predictor of the composite outcome (p = 0. 96, OR 1. 0 (CI 0. 9 - 1. 1). Conclusion There was no relationship between the composite outcome at 24 months CA and transfusion volume received during the post natal hospital stay. As there was no clinical advantage of the higher transfusion volume, a more restrictive volume will reduce total transfusion volume and donor exposure. Future research on the optimal transfusion volume per event to extreme preterm infants should include larger, prospective studies with a longer follow-up period through to childhood or even adolescence. </p...|$|R

40|$|One {{possible}} {{interpretation of}} the holographic principle is the equality {{of the number of}} degrees of freedom in a bulk region of space and the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary surface. It is known that such an equality is maintained on equipotential surfaces in any static spacetime {{in the form of an}} equipartition law N_{bulk}= N_{sur}. In the cosmological context, the de Sitter universe obeys the same holographic equipartition. I argue that the difference between the surface degrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom in a region of space (which has already emerged) drives the accelerated expansion of the universe through a simple equation dV/dt = (N_{sur} - N_{bulk}) where V is the Hubble <b>volume</b> <b>in</b> Planck <b>units</b> and t is the cosmic time <b>in</b> Planck <b>units.</b> This equation reproduces the standard evolution of the universe. This approach provides a novel paradigm to study the emergence of space and cosmology and has far reaching implications. Comment: 4 pages; 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|The {{accelerated}} {{expansion of}} the universe can be interpreted as a tendency to satisfy the holographic equipartition. It can be expressed by a simple law, Δ V = Δ t(N_surf-ϵ N_bulk), where V is the Hubble <b>volume</b> <b>in</b> Plank <b>units,</b> t is the cosmic time plank units and N_surf/bulk is the degrees of freedom on the horizon/bulk of the universe. We show that this holographic equipartition law effectively implies the maximization of entropy. In the cosmological context, a system that obeys the holographic equipartition law behaves as an ordinary macroscopic system that proceeds to an equilibrium state of maximum entropy. We consider the standard ΛCDM model of the universe and have shown that it is consistent with the holographic equipartition law. Analyzing the entropy evolution we find that it also proceeds to an equilibrium state of maximum entropy. Comment: 16 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
