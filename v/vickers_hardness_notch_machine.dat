In this paper, a method that uses the <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> to estimate the yield stress of a metallic material with taking ac-count of residual stress is proposed. Although the yield stress of bulk metal can be evaluated by a tensile test, it {{cannot be applied to}} local yield stress varied by surface modification methods, such as the peening technique which introduces high compressive residual stress at the surface. Therefore, to evaluate the local yield stress employing a relatively easy way, the <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> test was conducted in this paper. Since the <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> depends on both the residual stress and the yield stress, the relationship between the residual stress and the <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> was experimentally examined. It was concluded that the yield stress of the surface treated by several peening techniques can be estimated from the <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> once this has been corrected for residual stress...|$|R

Five different size of magnesium oxide particle at different composition (0. 5 wt % to 0. 9 wt %) {{were used in}} this experiment. Each batch of composition was mixed, uniaxially pressed into 13 mm pellets and sintered at 1600 o C for 4 hours in pressureless conditions.

Microstructural observation showed that the addition of magnesium oxide greatly affected zirconia toughened alumina microstructure. Smaller Al 2 O 3 grain size is observed {{with the presence of}} MgO thus improving its mechanical properties such as hardness and density.

40|$|Dense alumina {{composites}} {{with different}} carbon nanotube content were prepared by colloidal processing and consolidated by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were distributed at grain boundaries and also into agglomerates homogeneously dispersed. Carrying out <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> {{tests on the}} cross-section surfaces instead of top (or bottom) surfaces has shown a noticeable increase in {{the reliability of the}} hardness measurements. This improvement has been mainly attributed to the different morphology of carbon nanotube agglomerates, which however does not seem to affect the <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> value. Composites with lower SWNT content maintain the <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> of monolithic alumina, whereas it significantly decreases for the rest of compositions. The decreasing trend with increasing SWNT content has been explained by the presence of higher SWNT quantities at grain boundaries.

Background: It {{has been suggested that}} different polymerisation methods, as well as the addition of glass fibre (FV) might improve the hardness of acrylic. Materials and methods: Five types of acrylic resin were tested: Vipi Wave (VW), microwave polymerisation; Vipi Flash (VF), auto-polymerisation; Lucitone (LT), QC 20 (QC) and Vipi Cril (VC), conventional heat-polymerisation, all with or without glass fibre reinforcement (GFR) and distributed into 10 groups (n = 12).

Preliminary reference <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> blocks were developed from a WC 9 –Co mixture. The WC powder used was nanoscaled {{and had a}} grain size of 150 nm and a specific surface area of 2. 5 m 2 /g. Hardness blocks were consolidated using the Sinter-HIP process.

Hardness uniformity was tested by analysis of variance, ANOVA, for single factor in order to determine if significant hardness variations across the block surface were present.
