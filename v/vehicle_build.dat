5000|$|The {{idea for}} a Viper-engined {{motorcycle}} started with two lower-level Chrysler Group employees, Bob Schroeder, a design office modeler and motorcycle rider, and Dave Chyz, <b>vehicle</b> <b>build</b> specialist and drag racer. According to designer Mark Walters, himself not a [...] "motorcycle guy", the question asked was, [...] "What {{if we had a}} Viper engine and a Champion chassis? Something like a Boss Hoss." [...] Schroeder and Chyz took the proposal to Senior Vice President of Design Trevor Creed, who initially said, [...] "we don't build bikes" [...] but still allowed some design sketches to be created, which were [...] "mind blowing" [...] enough to bring Creed on board. They eventually took the idea to Freeman Thomas, DaimlerChrysler VP of advanced design, who assigned Walters to join the effort. Thomas suggested using two front and rear wheels because a single wheel would look thin next to the unusually wide engine, inspired by the four-wheeled light cycles in the film Tron. Walters anticipated howls from bikers that this would make it not a motorcycle, but he felt uniqueness was more important, and imagined the appearance with only a single wheel in front of and behind the engine would have been visually unbalanced, saying {{he would like to see}} it made that way for comparison. By the spring of 2002, Walters had prepared a full scale design presentation, with sketches along a 20 ft wall and a borrowed Viper engine resting on an engine stand with two wheels placed fore and aft as a visual aid. This was presented to Chrysler Group COO, Wolfgang Bernhard, and CEO, Dieter Zetsche, who gave their immediate approval.|$|E

40|$|The 2010 Boise State Human Powered Vehicle Competition (HPVC) team {{proposes to}} build the most {{competitive}} vehicle to date by the university. The competition places high values on speed, endurance, ingenuity, and safety, which will be primary areas of focus during the <b>vehicle</b> <b>build.</b> The team’s goal {{is to build a}} vehicle capable of winning the overall single rider, and overall utility competition. To meet this goal requires a durable vehicle capable of speeds in excess of 45 mph in sprints, and 20 mph in a 65 km endurance event. Additionally the vehicle must be safe, innovative, and attractive. With knowledge gained from previous entries the team will build a three-wheeled recumbent trike for the 2010 entry. The vehicle will be low profile, with a narrow frontal area to minimaze drag forces. The vehicle will include a pivoting rear axle for cornering performance. An internal crank will be used to drive the front wheel for innovation and ergonomics. The vehicle will be designed and tested to exceed all ASME safety and performance specs. The material of choice is 6061 -T 6 aluminum for reduced weight. An attractive and functional fairing for protection and decreased drag will be incorporated. A combination of standard components and a custom designed and student fabricated frame will be used. In addition the front hub will be an in-house custom design and fabrication.

40|$|MBA - WBSThe recent global {{financial}} crisis has made customers {{think twice before}} purchasing anything that involves a substantial financial expense. Availability of credit from financial institutions makes purchasing of expensive goods like houses and motor vehicles much more difficult. Companies have realized this fact and now need to target their marketing activities to persuade customers to make those purchases {{that they might not}} be that willing to undertake considering these restrictions and added hassle. This research looks at the following question. What are the drivers of customer equity in acquiring and retaining customers in the South African luxury automotive industry? The Customer Equity driver model was targeted to see which of the drivers (Value, Brand and Relationship equity) is seen as more important to the customer when deciding to purchase a vehicle. A sample of 95 customers of 3 Series BMW„s and 32 BMW dealer staff were used in gathering the required data. All respondents completed an online questionnaire on importance ratings and performance against these ratings for certain competitors of BMW. The responses were analyzed using descriptive analysis as well as statistical methods of factor and principal component analysis. The results were interpreted to answer the questions posed and to see which Customer Equity (CE) drivers and their respective levers customers see as more important in this economic down turn. The results showed that the Value equity driver is seen as the most important by customers and dealers followed by Relationship equity and Brand equity drivers respectively. The Value equity lever of <b>vehicle</b> <b>build</b> quality was seen as the most important lever by both the customers and dealers. In comparing BMW‟s performance against the CE drivers {{it can be seen that}} BMW is performing well in Relationship and Brand equity driver areas but they still need to improve their Value equity driver...|$|E

30|$|Golle et al. [14] {{proposed}} a general approach {{to evaluate the}} validity of message data generated in VANET. In their scheme, every <b>vehicle</b> <b>builds</b> a model for VANET environment in which specific rules and statistical properties are implemented to validate message data received from other vehicles. The same concept for trustworthiness evaluation is also adopted later in [11, 17]. Golle et al. assumed that a node (vehicle) always trusts the data generated from its own on-board sensors. In consequence, errors from sensor-generated data, caused by malfunctioned sensors, dynamics of traffic events (e.g. {{the speed of a}} vehicle is too fast for its sensors to detect surrounding environment and gather meaningful or error-free data), and data manipulation from a malicious attacker (vehicle), were not considered in their system model. As their system model requires offline construction and parameter calibration, system flexibility and scalability may become an issue.|$|R
