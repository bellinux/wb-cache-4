In high-level tournaments, players have been forfeited {{for such things as}} arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds), receiving a call or text on a cell phone, refusing to undergo a drug test, refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices, and unsporting behavior (such as refusing to shake the opponent's hand).|$|E

5000|$|Many {{statistical}} distances are not metrics, {{because they}} lack one or more properties of proper metrics.

5|$|After Victoria {{converted}} to alphanumeric route markers the Victorian section was signed as B23. In 2013 the NSW and ACT conversion to alphanumeric routes occurred {{and the remainder}} of the highway (south of Hindmarsh Drive in the ACT) was then also signed as B23. This <b>violates</b> <b>the</b> convention in New South Wales, where numbered routes below 50 are prefixed with an 'A' and 'B' routes are numbered above 50; the violation was allowed so the number and letter would be consistent across state lines.|$|E
5|$|Current eagle feather law {{stipulates}} that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry {{enrolled in a}} federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use.

5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that <b>violates</b> <b>the</b> three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E

Food prepared in a manner that <b>violates</b> <b>the</b> Shabbat (Sabbath) may not be eaten; although in certain instances it is permitted after the Shabbat is over.|$|E
5|$|Data and Picard {{discover}} a submerged and cloaked Federation ship containing a gigantic holodeck {{set up to}} recreate the Ba'ku village. Data's malfunction stems from a Son'a attack, received when he discovered the vessel. Picard confronts Dougherty and learns that top Federation officers and the Son'a secretly planned to deceptively move the Ba'ku to the ship and forcibly relocate them to another planet, allowing the Son'a to collect the rejuvenating radiation (but poisoning the planet in the process). Dougherty orders the Enterprise to leave. Picard states the rejuvenation benefit of the radiation does not justify Dougherty's plans for the Ba'ku and <b>violates</b> <b>the</b> Prime Directive. He plans to alert the Federation of the forced relocation.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{analysing}} Indonesian political language from cooperative principle perspective. The object {{of the study is}} Indonesian political language in the forms of utterances taken from Indonesian online newspapers: The Jakarta Post. The data was analysed using Grice‘s cooperative principle (1975). The study shows that politicians <b>violated</b> <b>the</b> maxims of cooperative principles regularly. They also <b>violated</b> <b>the</b> maxim of quantity in order to express strong commitment or to hide information. Moreover, giving incorrect information <b>violated</b> <b>the</b> maxim of quality to obey quantity maxim.

5|$|The {{original}} §14 of Article IV forbade {{the incorporation}} of churches, though the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this provision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because it <b>violates</b> <b>the</b> federal constitutional right to {{the free exercise of}} religion. The court found that it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate. An amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia voters in November 2006.|$|E
5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital condom use <b>violates</b> <b>the</b> religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E
5|$|Sections 21–23 {{cover the}} review of agents and the {{liability}} of trustees for agents actions. Section 21 identifies that review and liability occurs when the trustees appoints agents, nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument. Section 22 provides a duty on trustees who delegate their powers, with the duty consisting of three elements. Firstly, trustees are required {{to make sure that}} agent is suitable for the job he is employed to do. Secondly, they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it. Thirdly, trustees are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it. Section 23 establishes trustees' liability for the actions of agents; a trustee is liable for negligence if he <b>violates</b> <b>the</b> general duty of care set out in Section 1, but not otherwise.|$|E
50|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{this means}} that an antagonistic Nature will aim to select a state that will <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> constraint whereas a sympathetic Nature will aim to select a state that will satisfy the constraint. As for the outcome, <b>the</b> penalty for <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> constraint is such that the decision maker will refrain from selecting a decision that will allow Nature to <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> constraint within the state space pertaining to the selected decision.|$|R
5000|$|On July 14, 2006, the Eighth Circuit {{reversed}} Judge Bataillon's decision.

The Eighth Circuit held that [...] "laws limiting the state-recognized institution of marriage to heterosexual couples ... do not <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> Constitution of the United States."

5|$|Under the Act, it is a {{contempt}} of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament {{on account of}} his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done or said by him or her in Parliament; or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything done or said by him or her in Parliament. It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it <b>violates</b> <b>the</b> Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law addressing this provision, and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction.|$|E
