The Behavioral Perspective Model (BPM) assumes that utilitarian reinforcement, informational reinforcement, and consumer behavior setting scope are independent dimensions of environmental influence, which can combine in particular consumption situations to produce consumer behavior. This paper empirically examines the possibility of interactions among these dimensions {{by means of the}} pleasure, arousal, and dominance (<b>PAD)</b> emotional <b>variables.</b> The <b>PAD</b> <b>variables</b> have been shown to mediate consumer behaviors such as the desire to stay or escape from the setting, to affiliate with others, and the willingness to spend money and consume.

The aims of the present study were to describe the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and its effects on prognosis and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in an international cohort of patients on hemodialysis. Methods and Results - Data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS), a prospective, international, observational study of hemodialysis patients (n = 29 873), were analyzed. Associations between baseline clinical <b>variables</b> and <b>PAD</b> were evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Cox regression models were used to test the association between PAD and risk for all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and hospitalization. PAD was diagnosed in 7411 patients (25. 3 %) with significant geographic variation. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors including age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking were identified, together with the duration of hemodialysis, as significant correlates of PAD. Diagnosis of PAD was associated with increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1. 36; P < 0. 0001), cardiac mortality (HR = 1. 43; P < 0. 0001), all-cause hospitalization (HR = 1. 19; P < 0. 0001), and hospitalization for a major adverse cardiovascular event (HR = 2. 05; P < 0. 0001).

Common approaches {{that have been used}} include using inertial sensors, multi-camera optical and IR tracking systems, X-ray and fluoroscopy based imaging, force sensors, magnetic sensors and bone-fixed pins for measurement. Soft tissue artifacts (STA) are a common source of error in most type of measurements and the standard procedure in gait analysis has been to use a combination of measurement methods for efficient estimation of joint angles and the link poses. However, there are few studies where a multiple number of methods have been compared and the correlation between results from various approaches studied. In this paper, we propose an outline for measurement for human joint motion using a number of sensors that can give complete information relating to the joints.

Pooled data from the two studies was retroactively analyzed to compare the relative effects of actual pad assignment with therapeutic pad assignment belief on sleep improvement for patients with RLS. Patients and methods: One hundred fifty-eight patients with at least moderately severe RLS, as measured by a score of 15 points or greater on the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group rating scale (IRLS), {{were enrolled in the}} study. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment (patient-controlled vibration) or sham (patient-controlled sound or light-emitting) pads. Patients and clinicians were blinded to pad assignment. The pad was placed under the patient&# 39;s legs while in bed at night and activated during an RLS episode. Improvements in Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Problems Index II (MOS-II) scores from baseline to week 4 were examined as a function of <b>pad</b> assignment (independent <b>variable)</b> and therapeutic <b>pad</b> assignment belief held by each patient (mediator variable) through mediation analysis. Results: Therapeutic pad assignment belief influenced change in MOS-II scores more than actual pad assignment. Patients who believed they had been assigned a therapeutic pad had substantially greater sleep improvement than those who concluded the opposite. When a patient believed that a therapeutic pad had been assigned, sleep improvement was comparable in magnitude, independent of the type of pad assigned (vibrating or sham). Patients assigned vibrating pads believed that they had been assigned a therapeutic pad 2. 6 times more frequently than patients assigned sham pads. Consequently, vibrating pads were more efficient at improving sleep than sham pads. Similarity of sleep improvement for those who believed that they had been assigned a therapeutic pad among vibrating, sound, and light pad patients suggests a common counter-stimulation therapeutic mechanism of action within the brain. Conclusion: Therapeutic pad assignment belief influenced improvement in MOS-II scores more strongly than actual pad assignment. Therapeutic pad assignment belief was more commonly associated with vibrating pads than sham pads. These results may have implications for the type of shams used in future device studies.

40|$|Introduction: Different {{models of}} {{tractors}} have been imported from foreign countries or assembled in Iran for many years. Consistency of foreign manufactured products with native specifications and {{the improvement of}} locally manufactured tractors are important problems that must be considered. Moreover, tractor dimensions, sitting space and some other important {{factors such as the}} ability of Iranian users to operate them must be taken into consideration. In this study, we surveyed the proper proportion of tractors dimension, location of control tools and driver’s work space, with Iranian users’ anthropometric data of drivers from five provinces. Human factors are of paramount importance in developing farm machinery given that these machines will often be operated by persons with minimum skills. Therefore, farm machinery should be made simple to operate and as free from hazards as possible. Materials and methods: Firstly, the anthropometric data for 250 users 20 - 60 years old was calculated. The drivers were selected randomly. Then the specifications of 4 tractors including: Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland were compared with the anthropometric data of user in 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. Anthropometric Data of subjects consisted of: standing height, full hand length, popliteal length, seat pan width, seat pan depth, elbow height, seat back support height, hand pan width, hand grip and full-leg length. Getting on the tractor is the first contact of an operator with a tractor. In assessing the suitability of the provision made for getting on the tractor, an experiment was arranged in which operators tried to get on 3 tractors. The mode of getting on the tractors, the agony on the operator’s face, the muscular reactions and individual opinion on the difficulties or comfort while undertaking the task were observed and recorded. The specifications of tractors compared with Anthropometric Data were measured, whiles the tractors were positioned on a level ground for measurements after the tires had been ganged. These specifications were tractor height, steering wheel height, footrest height, foot set height; tractor seat geometry as seat pan width, seat pan depth and seat pan support height; steering geometry as distance of steering wheel from seat reference point, steering wheel radius, steering wheel thickness, steering wheel inclination to the horizontal and seat reach adjustment; levers and pedals distance from seat reference point as gear lever, parking brake lever, hydraulic control lever, clutch pedal, accelerator pedal, brake pedal, front panel, workspace width and workspace length. Results and Discussion: The experiment that was conducted with operators attempting to get on the tractors indicated that tractor steps heights were higher than the desirable limit. Therefore, based on the ideas of the researcher and tractors drivers, getting on all tractors is difficult. With {{an increase in the number}} of steps or a decrease in their heights, the desirable condition can be created. Seat depth of new Holland and Valtra tractors were great for drivers in the 5 th percentile value. A <b>variable</b> thickness <b>pad</b> can solve this problem. Results of studies indicated that Seat depth of Massey Ferguson 285 and 399 was shorter than driver’s leg length of 95 th percentile value. To solve the problem an increase of 10 centimeters to pad height of these tractors was suggested. Seat pad of tractors were short for drivers in the 95 th percentile value. Distance of steering wheel from seat reference point (SRP) in Massey Ferguson 285 and Valtra was further than drivers hand length in the 5 th percentile value. Therefore, the drivers hand is short for driver’s good operation. Surveys indicated that drivers had problems for gear lever access in Massey Ferguson 399. Therefore, for good access on gear lever we must increase seat stroke range by 5 - 10 centimeters. The record available from Meteorological Organization indicated that air temperature and rain throughout the year in the study area is between 20 to 40 degrees Celsius and 100 to 300 mm change. Valtra and New Holland tractors having a driver cabs with heating and cooling equipment have the ideal space for the performance of their driver. Massey Ferguson 285 tractor does not have any driver cab and Roll Over Protection Structure (ROPS). Conclusions: This research was conducted in five provinces of Iran to assess ergonomics of some commonly and new used tractors in Iran containing Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland. As there was no data base with required details, data was collected directly by personal contact with tractor users. A questionnaire was filled out for each person and anthropometric data was calculated in all provinces for 250 users 20 - 60 year old that were selected at random. Then relevant specifications of 4 tractors were measured and compared with the relevant anthropometric data of users in the 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. The results indicated that tractor steps, Seat depth, distance of steering wheel and distance of some levers and pedals from seat reference point should be amended...|$|R
40|$|Many {{researchers}} have compared predicted stiffness and damping coefficients for tilting-pad journal bearings (TPJBs) to measurements. Most {{have found that}} direct damping is consistently overpredicted. The thrust {{of this research is}} to explain the difference between measured and predicted stiffness and damping coefficients for TPJBs, and to provide some confidence to designers that TPJB dynamic coefficients can be accurately predicted. 	Most analytical models for TPJBs are {{based on the assumption that}} explicit dependence on pad motion can be eliminated by assuming harmonic rotor motion such that the amplitude and phase of pad motions resulting from radial and transverse rotor motions are predicted by rotor-pad transfer functions. In short, these transfer functions specify the amplitude and phase of pad motion (angular, radial, translational, etc.) in response to an input rotor motion. 	A new pad perturbation model is developed including the effects of angular, radial, and circumferential pad motion and changes in pad clearance due to pad bending compliance. Though all of these <b>pad</b> <b>variables</b> have previously been included in different analyses, there are no publications containing perturbations of all four variables. In addition, previous {{researchers have}} only perturbed the journal, while both the bearing and journal motions are perturbed in the present analysis, and the applicability of comparing rotor-perturbed bearing impedance predictions to impedances measured on a bearing-perturbed test rig is discussed. This perturbation model was implemented in a Reynolds-based TPJB code to predict the frequency-dependent bearing impedances and rotor-pad transfer functions. 	Direct measurements of pad motion during test excitation were recorded to produce measured transfer functions between rotor and pad motion, and a comparison between these measurements and predictions is given. Motion probes were added to the loaded pad (having the static load vector directed through its pivot) of a 5 -pad TPJB to obtain accurate measurement of pad radial and tangential motion, as well as tilt, yaw, and pitch. Strain gages were attached to the side of the loaded pad to measure static and dynamic bending strains, which were then used to determine static and dynamic changes in pad curvature (pad clearance). 	Good agreement was found between the amplitude of the measured and predicted transfer functions concerning radial and transverse pad motions throughout the range of speeds and loads tested, while pad tilt was moderately underpredicted. 	For the bearing investigated, radial pad motions resulting from pivot compliance were as large as 60 % of the radial component of shaft motion when operating at 4400 rpm under heavily loaded conditions. Hence, if a dynamic load applied to the shaft resulted in a shaft displacement of 25 microns (1 mil), the pad would displace radially 15 microns (0. 6 mils), and the fluid film height would only decrease by 10 microns (0. 4 mils). The consequence of this pad motion is that fluid film stiffness and damping forces produced by relative rotor-pad motions are significantly reduced, resulting in a bearing having significantly less direct stiffness and damping than predicted. A similar effect occurs when shaft motions produce significant changes in pad clearance due to pad compliance. For the pad tested here, the measurements show that predicting TPJB stiffness and damping coefficients without accounting for pad and pivot compliance will produce large errors, and is not advised. 	Transverse pad motion was predicted and observed. Based on phase measurements, this motion is lightly damped, and appears to be caused by pivot deflection instead of slipping. Despite observing a lightly damped phase change, an increase in magnitude at this natural frequency was not observed. 	Predicted direct stiffness and damping for unit loads from 0 - 3200 kPa (0 - 450 psi) fit through 1. 5 ? running speed are within 18 % of measurements at 4400 rpm, while predictions at 10200 rpm are within 10 % of measurements. This is a significant improvement on the accuracy of predictions cited in literature. 	 	Comparisons between predictions from the developed bearing model neglecting pad, pivot, and pad and pivot flexibility show that predicted direct stiffness and damping coefficients for a model having a rigid pad and pivot are overestimated, respectively, by 202 % and 811 % at low speeds and large loads, by 176 % and 513 % at high speeds and high loads, and by 51 % and 182 % at high speeds and light loads. While the reader is likely questioning the degree to which these predictions are overestimated in regard to previous comparisons, these predictions are based on measured operating bearing clearances, which are 20 - 30 % smaller than the cold bearing clearances that previous comparisons were based on. 	The effect of employing a full bearing model (retaining all of the pad degrees of freedom) versus a reduced bearing model (where only journal degrees of freedom are retained) in a stability calculation for a realistic rotor-bearing system is assessed. For the bearing tested, the bearing coefficients reduced at the frequency of the unstable eigenvalue (subsynchronously reduced) predicted a destabilizing cross-coupled stiffness coefficient at the onset of instability within 1 % of the full model, while synchronously reduced coefficients for the lightly loaded bearing required 25 % more destabilizing cross-coupled stiffness than the full model to cause system instability. This overestimation of stability is due to an increase in predicted direct damping at the synchronous frequency over the subsynchronously reduced value. This increase in direct damping with excitation frequency was also seen in highly loaded test data at frequencies below approximately 2 ?running speed, after which direct damping decreased with increasing excitation frequency. This effect was more pronounced in predictions, occurring at all load and speed combinations. 	The same stability calculation was performed using measured stiffness and damping coefficients at synchronous and subsynchronous frequencies at 10200 rpm. It was found that both the synchronously measured stiffness and damping and predictions using the full bearing model were more conservative than the model using subsynchronously measured stiffness and damping. This outcome contrasts with the comparison between models using synchronously and subsynchronously reduced impedance predictions, which showed the subsynchronously reduced model to be the most conservative. This contrast results from a predicted increase in damping with increasing excitation frequency at all speeds and loads, while this increase in damping with increasing excitation frequency was only measured at the most heavily loaded conditions...|$|R
