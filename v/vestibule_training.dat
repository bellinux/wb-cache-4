2500|$|Private firms {{would still}} be {{required}} to train new workers in job-specific skills {{in the same way}} they would in a non-JG economy. However, JG workers {{are far more likely to}} have retained higher levels of skill than those who are forced to succumb to lengthy spells of unemployment. This changes the bargaining environment rather significantly because firms now have reduced hiring costs. Previously, the same firms would have lowered their hiring standards and provided on-the-job training and <b>vestibule</b> <b>training</b> in tight labour markets. The JG policy thus reduces the [...] "hysteretic inertia" [...] embodied in the long-term unemployed and allows for a smoother private sector expansion; ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>vestibuled</b> <b>train</b> is a {{passenger}} train whose cars have enclosed vestibules at their ends, {{in contrast to}} the open platforms on early cars. Typically, a vestibule has doorways on either side to allow passenger egress at stations, a door into the body of the car, and, {{at the end of the}} car, a doorway to allow access to the next car through a flexible gangway connection.|$|R
50|$|The Deccan Queen {{has several}} firsts or 'among the firsts' to her credit: she was India's first superfast train, {{she was the}} first long {{distance}} electric hauled passenger train, she was one of India's first <b>vestibuled</b> <b>trains.</b> The Deccan Queen was the first to have a Ladies Only car, and amongst the first to feature a diner. The train has an exciting and chequered history. The Deccan Queen got a brand new rake in 1966, consisting of Indian Railways standard integral anti telescopic cars. For {{the first time since the}} history of the train, third class (now second class) passengers were allowed to travel by this train. It had only reserved first class since inception until 1966.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of vestibules, passage between cars when a train was underway was both dangerous - stepping over a shifting plate between swaying cars with nothing on either side but chain guard rails - and unpleasant, due to being exposed to the weather, as well as soot, red-hot cinders and fly ash raining down from the exhaust of the steam locomotive hauling the train. As passengers were mostly confined to a single car during the trip, trains had regular meal stops built into their schedules, and sleeping cars were uncommon. The introduction of the <b>vestibuled</b> <b>train</b> {{in the late nineteenth century}} led to dining cars, lounge cars, and other specialized cars.|$|R
50|$|Most city trains do {{not have}} {{specific}} provision for bicycles, aside from the <b>vestibule</b> area. Intercity <b>trains</b> operating Newcastle, the Blue Mountains and the South Coast frequently have a single hook {{at the end of}} the carriage.|$|R
2500|$|For {{the next}} decade the Overland's {{connection}} at Ogden to and from San Francisco was with the eastbound Atlantic Express and westbound Pacific Express until October 15, 1899 when the SP inaugurated its own new Overland Limited (TR1&2) which became the UP's identically named Ogden to Omaha/Council Bluffs train providing 71-hour through service. The SP described its new first class train as [...] "An Elegant Solid <b>Vestibuled</b> <b>Train</b> of Composite Car, with library, Smoking Parlor, Buffet, etc. Luxurious Double Drawing-room Sleeping Cars, Dining Car. The Fastest Overland service {{in the history of}} transcontinental railroading." [...] On January 1, 1913 the Overland Limited became an extra-fare ($10) train when it further cut its running time from 68 to 64 hours and added amenities such as a barber, manicurist, stenographer, bath, etc. Known variously as both the Overland Limited and San Francisco Overland Limited for the next 32 years, on May 31, 1931 the service again became the San Francisco Overland Limited when its train numbers changed from [...] "1 and 2" [...] to [...] "27 and 28", and on July 10, 1947 the designation [...] "Limited" [...] was dropped from the name altogether.|$|R

50|$|There is one long, low {{platform}} that is {{long enough for}} 5 cars. In addition to the building with ticket office and waiting room, this station stop has a bench shelter next to the single track. Permitted parking is available, along with bicycle racks along the station house wall. There is a small crossing (just short enough for one <b>vestibule</b> of the <b>train),</b> where trains stop for passengers on the other track to get off.|$|R
60|$|A savage jolt {{threw him}} against the curtain, and the thin {{material}} tore from the rings. Deering went through, but came down like a cat on the floor. The brakes jarred and startled passengers ran about. For the most part, they did not wear their proper clothes, but when Deering went to bed he wore all his and he pushed through a group that blocked the <b>vestibule.</b> The <b>train</b> stopped and from the platform he saw a leaping pillar of flame and reflections on rocks and trees. The white beam from the locomotive headlamp melted in the strong illumination, and moving figures cut the dark background. The picture was distinct and vivid like a scene from a film, until a cloud of steam rolled across the light and all was blurred.|$|R
6000|$|Cooper {{made the}} exit of that stream fifty feet wide, {{in the first}} place, for no {{particular}} reason; in the second place, he narrowed it to less than twenty to accommodate some Indians. He bends a [...] "sapling" [...] to {{the form of an}} arch over this narrow passage, and conceals six Indians in its foliage. They are [...] "laying" [...] for a settler's scow or ark which is coming up the stream {{on its way to the}} lake; it is being hauled against the stiff current by a rope whose stationary end is anchored in the lake; its rate of progress cannot be more than a mile an hour. Cooper describes the ark, but pretty obscurely. In the matter of dimensions [...] "it was little more than a modern canal-boat." [...] Let us guess, then, that it was about one hundred and forty feet long. It was of [...] "greater breadth than common." [...] Let us guess, then, that it was about sixteen feet wide. This leviathan had been prowling down bends which were but a third as long as itself, and scraping between banks where it had only two feet of space to spare on each side. We cannot too much admire this miracle. A low-roofed log dwelling occupies [...] "two-thirds of the ark's length"--a dwelling ninety feet long and sixteen feet wide, let us say a kind of <b>vestibule</b> <b>train.</b> The dwelling has two rooms--each forty-five feet long and sixteen feet wide, let us guess. One of them is the bedroom of the Hutter girls, Judith and Hetty; the other is the parlor in the daytime, at night it is papa's bedchamber. The ark is arriving at the stream's exit now, whose width has been reduced to less than twenty feet to accommodate the Indians--say to eighteen. There is a foot to spare on each side of the boat. Did the Indians notice that there was going to be a tight squeeze there? Did they notice that they could make money by climbing down out of that arched sapling and just stepping aboard when the ark scraped by? No, other Indians would have noticed these things, but Cooper's Indians never notice anything. Cooper thinks they are marvelous creatures for noticing, but he was almost always in error about his Indians. There was seldom a sane one among them.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Industrial {{training}} in the Fashion Apparel Industry is confronted with difficult objectives. In this industry, continual style and fabric change challenge the effectiveness of conventional industrial training techniques and concepts. To meet this challenge, the "Self-Help" training concept was developed. "Self-Help" centers around the philosophy of training sewing machine operators to be self-sufficient when confronted with a dynamic work environment. "Self-Help" accomplishes this goal by exposing the trainees {{to the principles of}} motion economy, feel and work measurement. This training is augmented with practical exercises on various sewing machines normally found in a production sewing department. The training cycle concludes by giving each trainee the opportunity to produce garments requiring the use of lockstitch, hem and overseam sewing machines. When compared to conventional training methods, the anticipated results of "Self-Help" oriented training programs are: increased learning rates, higher overall productivity levels and reduced labor turnover. During the Fall of 1964, a "Self-Help" training program was initiated at Jantzen, Inc., Portland, Oregon. A Control Group, consisting of 73 women, was hired and given on-the-job training. A Test Group, consisting of 33 women, was hired simultaneously and <b>vestibule</b> <b>trained,</b> using the concept of "Self-Help. " Performance of the two groups was recorded over a twelve week period and then evaluated with respect to production rates and labor turnover. The results of this evaluation indicated that the learning curve for the Test Group progressed more rapidly than the corresponding curve of the Control Group. A statistical comparison of production rates for the twelfth week of employment indicated that the productivity level of the Test Group was significantly greater than the productivity level of the Control Group. During the entire twelve week evaluation period the labor turnover rate for the Test Group was substantially lower than the corresponding rate of the Control Group. By the end of the twelfth week of employment, the Test Group turnover rate was approximately one-third less than the turnover rate for the Control Group. Based on the results of the evaluation, the author concluded that the "Self-Help" approach to operator training definitely increased worker efficiency while reducing labor turnover. It is suggested, however, that additional research be conducted to further develop and refine the presentation of the unique subjects associated with the "Self-Help" training concept. It would also be advisable to consider the possibility of presenting follow-up short courses to reinforce learning on material covered during the initial "Self-Help" training cycle...|$|R

For a moment the girl hesitated, but when Lister went down the steps she gave him her hand and jumped. Lister felt her tremble and was himself conscious of some excitement. He {{did not know if}} he was rash or not, but since she meant to go, speed was important, because the man from whom she wanted to escape might see them on the line. He went to the waiting engine in front of a long row of ballast cars, on which a big gravel plough loomed faintly in the dark.|$|R
