40|$|Agroforestry {{systems can}} reduce the risks of {{investing}} in just one crop. However, there are uncertainties like other agricultural and forestry activities. Therefore, there {{is the need for}} economic studies under conditions of economic risk of agroforestry systems. This work reports an analysis of the main components of costs and revenues of an agroforestry system with coffee and banana, as well as an analysis of its economic performance through indicators: net present value, equivalent period benefit (or cost), family labor revenue and a sensitivity analysis of net present value. The main cost components in the system are the human labor and mineral and organic fertilizers applied in coffee, and the costs for the production of coffee outweigh the costs of banana production. The monthly income from the production of bananas balances the costs of coffee production, generating a positive cash flow in the studied period. Financial indicators showed positive values, demonstrating the economic viability of the system with coffee and banana. The agroforestry system is economically feasible, even with variations of ± 20 % in production costs and selling prices of their products. <b>Variables</b> <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> <b>greater</b> sensitivity on the net present value were the selling price of coffee and bananas, and the cost of coffee production...|$|E

Vislumbrou-se tambÃm um estudo de modificaÃÃes na conduÃÃo da reaÃÃo em condiÃÃes pressurizadas, buscando diminuir as condiÃÃes reacionais de temperatura e pressÃo. Os resultados obtidos demonstram que, no estudo referente a obtenÃÃo de melhores taxas de transferÃncia de massa, a utilizaÃÃo de recheios de esferas de vidro apresentaram melhor desempenho. AtravÃs do planejamento Plackett Burman 12, verificou-se que as variÃveis que apresentaram maior significÃncia no processo foram a razÃo mÃssica (Ãlcool:Ãleo) e a adiÃÃo de cossolvente, alÃm de que, observou-se que os resultados referentes a taxa de decomposiÃÃo apresentaram-se satisfatÃrios (< 5, 0 %). Com isso realizou-se um estudo cinÃtico baseado nestas duas variÃveis, onde verificou-se que a utilizaÃÃo de uma maior quantidade de Ãlcool no processo nÃo apresentou-se benÃfico, jÃ a adiÃÃo de cossolvente desempenhou um papel positivo ao possibilitar a diminuiÃÃo do tempo e temperatura de reaÃÃo, uma vez que na condiÃÃo de 275 ÂC houve um rendimento de 89, 62 %.

30|$|In this study, we {{applied the}} RIM model {{to assess the}} {{resilience}} status of 105 counties in southwestern China after the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake. We then interpreted community resilience based on the socioeconomic characteristics of each county. We also evaluated the discriminant power of every indicator, and demonstrated the association between indicators and resilience ranks across the impacted region. We found that counties located right at the epicenter area (Wenchun, Lixian, and Maoxian) had the lowest resilience, but counties immediately surrounding the epicenter area had the highest resilience. Counties that were {{farther away from the}} epicenter returned rapidly to their prequake low resilience (the Recovering Group). That counties surrounding the epicenter-counties (not those at the epicenter) had the highest resilience values was largely a result of preevent conditions, and the degree of usefulness of the preevent conditions to inform resiliency is reflected by the discriminant analysis’s classification accuracy. Through discriminant analysis, we found that the 15 selected socioeconomic variables were able to predict resilience group membership with a reasonably high degree of accuracy (85.7 %). The top four <b>variables</b> <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> <b>great</b> influence on resilience were: sex ratio, per capita GDP, percent of ethnic minorities, and average number of hospital beds.|$|R

Objetivo: Estimar la incidencia de algunas complicaciones del soporte nutricional en pacientes críticamente enfermos. Material y métodos: estudio multicéntrico, descriptivo, prospectivo en pacientes con SN en unidades de cuidados intensivos. Las {{variables}} estudiadas fueron diagnóstico médico, estado nutricional, duración del SN, vía de acceso, tipo de fórmula y diez complicaciones. Resultados: 419 pacientes evaluados, 380 recibieron nutrición enteral (NE) y 39 nutricional parenteral (NP). La complicación de mayor incidencia de la NE fue el residuo gástrico alto (24, 2 %), seguido de la diarrea (14 %) y el retiro de la sonda (6, 6 %). El residuo gástrico alto y la diarrea se asociaron con la duración del SN (p Introduction: nutritional support (NS) leads {{complications that}} must be detected and prompt treated. Objective: to estimate the incidence of some complications of nutritional support in critically ill patients. Materials and methods: a multicenter, descriptive, prospective study in patients with NS in intensive care units. Studied variables included medical diagnosis, nutritional status, length of NS, path, type of formula and ten complications. Results: 419 patients evaluated, 380 received enteral nutrition (EN) and 39 parenteral nutrition (PN). The high gastric residue was the most incident complication in the ENS (24. 2 %), followed by diarrhea (14 %) and withdrawal tube (6. 6 %). The high gastric residue and diarrhea {{were associated with the}} duration of the NS (p < 0. 05). For the PNS the complication most incidents were hypophosphatemia (38. 5 %), followed by catheter sepsis (15. 4 %). The duration of the NS was associated with cholestasis, sepsis and hypophosphatemia (p < 0. 05).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} had two purposes: first, {{to analyze}} how required sequenced college preparatory courses in mathematics, reading, and writing affect students 2 ̆ 7 academic success and, second, {{to add to}} a theoretical model for predicting student retention at a community college. Grade point average, number of degree credits earned, and re-enrollment rate were measured as determinants of academic success. The treatment group had a significantly higher grade point average than the control group. There {{was no significant difference}} in the number of degree credits earned or re-enrollment rate for the groups. A series of logistic regressions used the independent variables E-ASSET scores in math, reading, and writing; number of college prep areas required; credits earned; grade point average; students 2 ̆ 7 status; academic restrictions/required course sequencing; sex; race; and socio-economic status to determine the predictor variables for retention. The academic <b>variable</b> <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> the <b>greatest</b> potential as a predictor for retention was grade point average.

40|$|Purpose: to {{evaluate}} whether factors related to {{the adequacy of the}} sample, cell pattern and cytomorphological criteria are associated with false-negative (FN) results of cervical cytopathology during routine examinations. Methods: this is a case-control study in which the study group included 100 cytopathologic smears with FN results detected during systematic internal quality control consisting of 100 % rapid review. For each FN result detected, two smears with a true-positive diagnosis were identified by the same cytotechnician and these constituted the control group, making a total sample size of 300 smears. The variables were established in accordance with the criteria defined for the analysis of sample adequacy, cell pattern and cytomorphological analyzed criteria. The results were evaluated using bivariate analysis and logistic regression with stepwise variable selection criteria expressed in OR (95 %). Results: the number of atypical cells, the appearance of nuclear chromatin, and the distribution and presentation of atypical cells in the smear were the <b>variables</b> <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> the <b>greatest</b> risk for FN results with OR of 9. 6, 4. 2, 4. 4, and 3. 6, respectively. Inflammatory processes and the presence of blood in the smear were also identified as <b>variables</b> <b>that</b> influence the risk of FN results. Conclusions: the majority of the factors associated with FN results are dependent on the conditions and techniques of sample collection, since in the majority of cases, the lesion may not be adequately represented in the smear. Confounding factors such as blood and inflammatory processes may also impair analysis. With respect to cytomorphological alterations, thin chromatin strand was the <b>variable</b> <b>that</b> indicated the greatest risk of FN results...|$|R

The main question addresses the macroeconomic pass-through {{effects of a}} monetary policy shock, with regards to a conventional interest rate and possible different balance sheet policy changes. The analysis {{is based on a}} structural vector autoregressive model for Albanian economy that includes means of the Cholesky identification scheme and the sign restrictions approach. The former produces mixed results, that are either statistically insignificant or show a puzzle behavior. The latter is found to reduce bias, albeit with some supportive significant clear cut robustness evidences of the short run macroeconomic pass-through effects of a stimulus monetary policy that materialises within twelve periods. A stimulus monetary policy is found to support economic activity and increase price level. The effect is positive with regards to bank lending and monetary money stock variables. Exchange rate depreciates, accomplished by some higher stress on financial market condition. Both of these variables show a contemporaneously stronger response compared to the other <b>variables.</b> Analyses <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the <b>greatest</b> impact, through means of policy rate, is found to be on price level, bank lending and real money stock.

40|$|Abstract Background The rise in {{disability}} due to {{back pain}} has been exponential with escalating medical and societal costs. The relative contribution of individual prognostic indicators to {{the pattern of}} recovery remains unclear. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the prognostic value of demographic, psychosocial, employment and clinical factors on outcome in patients with low back pain Methods A prospective cohort study with six-month follow-up was undertaken at a multidisciplinary back pain clinic in central London employing physiotherapists, osteopaths, clinical psychologists and physicians, receiving referrals from 123 general practitioners. Over a twelve-month period, 593 consecutive patients referred from general practice with simple low back pain were recruited. A baseline questionnaire was developed to elicit information on potential prognostic variables. The primary outcome measures were change in 24 -item Roland Morris disability questionnaire score at six months as a measure of low back related functional disability and the physical functioning scale of the SF- 36, adjusted for baseline scores. Results Roland Morris scores improved by 3. 8 index points (95 % confidence interval 3. 23 to 4. 32) at six months and SF- 36 physical functioning score by 10. 7 points (95 % confidence interval 8. 36 to 12. 95). Ten factors were linked to outcome yet in a multiple regression model only two remained predictive. Those with episodic rather than continuous pain were more likely to have recovered at six months (odds ratio 2. 64 confidence interval 1. 25 to 5. 60), while those that classified themselves as non-white were less likely to have recovered (0. 41 confidence interval 0. 18 to 0. 96). Conclusions Analysis controlling for confounding <b>variables,</b> demonstrated <b>that</b> participants <b>showed</b> <b>greater</b> improvement if their episodes of pain during the previous year were short-lived while those with Middle Eastern, North African and Chinese ethnicity demonstrated minimal improvement.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} motor performance (target tracking), timing and amplitude of biceps and triceps muscle activity (EMG), {{in a sample}} of people with upper limb hemiplegia following stroke, before and after training in a planar robot. METHODS: In a planar robot, in which the arm was supported by a hinged arm-holder and constrained to move in 2 dimensions, five chronic stroke participants practiced a subset (chosen to be appropriate to ability) of nine tracking tasks in which trajectory (orientation and length), speed and resistance to movement were varied during 18 (n= 3) and 25 (n= 2) one-hour training sessions. During tracking, electrical stimulation (ES) (40 Hz biphasic, fixed amplitude, variable pulse-width; 0 - 300 µs) was delivered via a commercially available CE marked stimulator using surface self-adhesive electrodes to the triceps muscle. Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithms were applied to reduce tracking error on consecutive trials by adjusting the pulse width and timing of ES. Immediately before training and after session 18, EMG and tracking performance (without ES) data were recorded during nine tasks. EMG signals were recorded from seven muscles including triceps and biceps using Noraxon Dual Ag-AgCl snap electrodes positioned according to SENIAM guidelines. EMG signals for each muscle were also recorded during maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). EMG signals were sampled at 1500 Hz, amplified x 2 at the electrodes to reduce the signal to noise ratio. Further EMG signal processing was performed using Matlab (7. 2. 0. 232). Data were zero-phase filtered, using a fourth order Butterworth filter with passband 10 - 500 Hz, then full wave rectified and smoothed using a moving average filter with 0. 1 s window. EMG data was normalised using the MVIC. RESULTS: Analysis of the pre intervention EMG data <b>showed</b> <b>that,</b> for all stroke participants, timing and amplitude of peak EMG activity in biceps and triceps during all tasks differed from the mean of neurologically intact participants (n= 8) (p< 0. 05), using data recorded under the same conditions. Analysis of pre intervention and post session 18 EMG data, showed statistically significant (p< 0. 05) changes (mean of all tracking tasks) in timing and amplitude of biceps and timing of triceps EMG towards those of neurologically intact participants. Changes in tracking performance showed a statistically significant (p< 0. 03) reduction in error of the 9 tasks. An association between improved tracking performance and changes in timing and amplitude of EMG was identified. A statistically significant interaction (ANOVA) between tracking and timing of biceps (p= 0. 03) and tracking and amplitude of triceps (p= 0. 04) was detected but not between amplitude of biceps or timing of triceps (i. e. the <b>variables</b> <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> the <b>greatest</b> change towards normal). CONCLUSION: Five people with upper limb post-stroke hemiplegic underwent 18 training sessions in a planar arm robot in which ES of triceps, mediated by ILC, was used to correct tracking error. An improvement in motor performance and changes in EMG activity in biceps and triceps were observed. An interaction was found between improvement in tracking and some but not all EMG variables...|$|R

La relaci 3 n mencionada fue evaluada mediante an 1 lisis de correlaci 3 n fenot y genot, an 1 lisis de regresi 3 n, coeficientes de trayectoria y an 1 lisis de componentes principales. El n de ramas por planta, y la longitud de carga total, fueron las variables que reportaron una correlaci 3 n tanto fenot como genot de mayor magnitud con el rendimiento. Los an 1 lisis de regresi 3 n indicaron como adecuados los modelos que incluyen las variables n de ramas, n de c 1 psulas por planta, peso de 1000 semillas y longitud de c 1 psula; sin embargo, son cuestionables por el bajo coeficiente de determinaci 3 n obtenido. Los coeficientes de trayectoria identificaron al peso de 1000 semillas y al n de ramas como las variables con mayor efecto directo sobre el rendimiento, pero entre s tuvieron efectos indirectos negativos. El an 1 lisis de componentes principales fue eficiente en separar al genotipo de menor rendimiento del resto, aunque no lo fue al discriminar los genotipos de mayor rendimiento. Estos resultados {{en conjunto}} sugieren que la selecci 3 n indirecta hacia altos rendimientos deber centrarse en la selecci 3 n de genotipos con el mayor n de ramas o con el mayor peso de 1000 semillas. ABSTRACT Relationship between yield and its components in eight sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) genotypes. Comparison of methodologies To assess {{the relationship between}} sesame yield and yield components such as plant height, number of capsules per plant, number of branches per plant, total fructification length, capsule length and 1000 -seed-weight, eight field assays settled around Tur 9 n, Portuguesa State, Venezuela, were evaluated. A randomized complete block design, with four replications and eight treatments (eight sesame genotypes) was used at each assay. The evaluation was performed by means of genotypic and phenotypic correlation analysis, regression analysis, pathway coefficients, and principal components. Number of branches per plant and total fructification length were the <b>variables</b> <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> the <b>greatest</b> phenotypic and genotypic correlation with yield. Regression analysis identified number of branches and capsules, weight of 1000 seeds and capsule length {{as the most important}} variables in the regression model; however, it showed a small determination coefficient. Pathway analysis identified the weight of 1000 seeds and number of branches as the variables with the most important direct effect on yield; however, they had negative indirect effects each other. Principal components analysis was useful to discriminate the genotypes with poor yield, but it was unable to separate the genotypes with the highest yield. The results indicate that it is possible an indirect selection toward high yield by selecting plants with high 1000 seed weight or with high number of branches per plant...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Westville, 2007. Beach meiofauna {{were chosen}} as {{environmental}} indicators {{to investigate the}} impact of Illovo sugar by-products effluent. The effluent is pumped through a 20 cm diameter pipeline into surf zone at Sezela beach {{on the coast of}} KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Meiofaunal communities were considered appropriate indicators as they are relatively stable both qualitatively and quantitatively on a seasonal and year to year basis. Most meiofauna also do not have planktonic stages in their life cycles, respond rapidly to pollution due to their fast generation times, and they are often abundant with high species diversity in habitats which are subject to considerable natural physical and chemical fluctuations. In this particular study there was a specific concern about trace amounts of furfural in the effluent. Furfural has been used as the active ingredient in a product designed to kill parasitic nematodes in crop fields. A large proportion of the beach meiofauna consists of nematodes. Eight stations were sampled for meiofauna along the beaches at Sezela on 7 different occasions. Seasonal effects on meiofauna and meiofaunal recovery during the period when the factory was not pumping effluent to sea was assessed. Samples were taken on the following dates: 4 July 2000 (winter); 30 August 2000 (winter); 13 December 2000 (spring); 26 January 2001 (summer); 8 March 2001 (summer); 9 April 2001 (autumn); and 2 January 2002 (summer). PRIMER (Plymouth Routines in Multivariate Ecological Research) was used for statistical analysis and included various univariate indices such as species richness, species diversity and evenness. These indices were then analysed using one-way ANOVA to determine any significant difference between sites over the 7 sampling periods and between the different seasons. Clustering and Ordination multivariate analyses were carried out on the community data and physico/chemical data to determine community patterns and relate them to the effluent and environmental data. The Nematode/Copepod ratio was also calculated. Meiofauna were analysed at major taxa level, as well as to nematode feeding groups and harpacticoid copepod and annelid family level, to determine if analysis to major taxa level is adequate as an indicator of pollution impact. The analyses indicated a possible degree of impact at stations close to the effluent discharge when effluent was being pumped to sea and a recovery was noted at the station closest to the discharge when effluent was not being discharged and analysis was conducted to the major taxonomic rank only. No improved resolution was achieved by analysing some of the meiofaunal major taxa to family level or different feeding groups. The analysis of the Nematode/Copepod ratio was shown to correspond with the multivariate analyses, however, this ratio could not reveal the severity of the impact where both nematodes and harpacticoids i. e. total meiofauna had been reduced by adverse conditions. The physical and chemical <b>variables</b> <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> the <b>greatest</b> correlation with the meiofaunal community patterns were sediment grain size, dissolved oxygen and salinity. There was a very strong positive correlation between Kjeldahl nitrogen in the interstitial waters and total numbers of meiofauna. This and the relationship with salinity may have suggested other possible sources of influence such as enrichment from the three estuaries in the area as well as a storm water drain located 150 m north of the effluent discharge. A seasonal effect was observed with increased meiofauna numbers in autumn, but this was possibly influenced by the periods when effluent was not being pumped to sea...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVOS: Evaluar la eficacia de un curso sobre salud {{ambiental}} y dengue, impartido a alumnos de primaria y encaminado a promover en las madres de familia cambios de comportamiento que lleven a un manejo seguro del agua, a la disposición adecuada de la basura y al control de los criaderos domésticos de Aedes aegypti, el mosquito vector de la enfermedad. MÉTODOS: En el período de abril a noviembre de 2002 se llevó a cabo un ensayo de campo comunitario que incluyó cuatro escuelas públicas de la ciudad de Comayaguela, Honduras, dos {{de las cuales}} formaron el grupo de intervención (GI) y las otras dos el grupo testigo o de control (GC). Las actividades de recolección de información pre y posintervención incluyeron pruebas de conocimiento a escolares y maestros, encuestas de conocimientos, actitudes y prácticas a madres de familia, encuestas entomológicas (registro sistemático para encontrar depósitos que contengan agua, en busca de larvas de mosquitos) en las viviendas de los escolares, entrevistas a profundidad a madres de familia, observaciones participativas en las aulas y un grupo focal posintervención con los maestros. RESULTADOS: Durante el período de la intervención se presentó la mayor epidemia de dengue clásico en la {{historia de}} la ciudad capital, que motivó actividades de control a gran escala por parte de la Secretaría de Salud. En el ámbito escolar, el GI mostró un incremento significativo en el conocimiento de los alumnos en las siguientes variables: dengue causado por un virus (78, 5 % frente a 56, 6 %), ciclo de vida del vector (79, 4 % frente a 23, 6 %) y reducción de fuentes -la medida más eficaz de control del vector- (85, 2 % frente a 58, 1 %); los incrementos en todas las variables tuvieron un valor P OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} a special course on environmental health and dengue, given to primary school students and intended to promote behavioral changes in the mothers of those students that would lead to the safe handling of water, adequate disposal of trash, and control of household breeding sites of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector for dengue. METHODS: In the period from April to November 2002 a community field trial was carried out that included four public schools in the city of Comayaguela, Honduras. Two of the schools formed the intervention group, and the two others made up the comparison or control group. The data collection activities before and after the intervention included knowledge tests for the schoolchildren and the teachers; surveys of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the students' mothers; entomological surveys (systematic checking in order to find water containers, to search for mosquito larvae) in the homes of the schoolchildren; in-depth interviews with the students' mothers; observation in the classrooms; and postintervention focus group with the teachers. RESULTS: During the intervention period the largest epidemic of classical dengue ever in the history of Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, occurred. That event prompted the Secretariat of Health to undertake large-scale control activities. In the two intervention schools there was {{a significant increase in the}} students' knowledge of the following three variables: dengue caused by a virus, life cycle of the vector, and reduction of breeding sites, which is the most effective measure for controlling the vector (P < 0. 0001 for all those increases in knowledge). There were also significant increases in the knowledge of the same variables among the teachers in the intervention schools: dengue caused by a virus (P = 0. 03), life cycle of the vector (P = 0. 01), and reduction of breeding sites (P = 0. 004). Reducing the number of breeding sites as being the best measure for controlling Aedes aegypti was the knowledge <b>variable</b> <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> the <b>greatest</b> change among the mothers in the intervention group (P = 0. 02). The values for two of the entomological indices (the House index and the Breteau index) were better in the intervention group than in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, there was a statistically significant difference in the Breteau index values between the two control group schools and the one intervention school where the education course was implemented more adequately than in the other intervention school. CONCLUSIONS: The application of educational interventions directed to schoolchildren, as a part of a comprehensive plan for controlling Aedes aegypti, is an effective way to raise the awareness of teachers and parents with respect to the problem of dengue, and it also helps in encouraging family members to be involved in reducing breeding sites in the home. In moving to control the dengue vector, this strategy should take into consideration the involvement not only of families but also of civic and public institutions in the community. Given our results, it appears that this approach of using a special course for schoolchildren can constitute a fundamental pillar in the strategy for integrated dengue control...|$|R

Therefore, the CT method identified {{a small number}} (four) of relevant variables (eleven) which one could exclusively refer to when being interested in the classification of new, ungrouped investors. This might be relevant for advisory services when trying to identify new SR fund investors.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationships between}} creative design and the field of information visualization, {{with a focus on}} historical connotations and newest developments <b>that</b> <b>show</b> <b>great</b> potential. Examples <b>show</b> how designers often employ information visualization as a creative concept capable of significantly determining the design outcome, and vice versa, how information visualization can be enhanced by exploring interdisciplinary concepts, such as design cognition, user engagement, aesthetics and art. Some of the earliest symbiotic dependencies are explained and demonstrated, including the first conceptual cyberspace and information architecture definitions. This analysis proves that it is useful to consider the role of creative design when developing effective data representations. Vice versa, it is also demonstrated how designers should be more aware of the basic principles and newest developments in information visualization. Finally, several interdisciplinary disciplines are described <b>that</b> <b>show</b> <b>great</b> symbiotic potential in the near future, especially in the fields of ambient displays, informative art and location-based information awareness. ...|$|R

Empirical evidence shows how designers often employ information visualization as a creative concept capable of significantly determining the design outcome, and vice versa, how information visualization can be enhanced by exploring interdisciplinary concepts, such as design cognition, user engagement, aesthetics and art. Several symbiotic dependencies are explained and demonstrated, including the first conceptual cyberspace and information architecture definitions. This paper will argue that information visualization should be enriched with the principles of creative design and art, to develop valuable data representations that address the emotional experience and engagement of users, instead of solely focusing on task effectiveness metrics. Finally, several interdisciplinary movements are described <b>that</b> <b>show</b> <b>great</b> symbiotic potential in the near future, especially in the fields of ambient information displays, informative art and location-based information awareness. status: publishe...|$|R
