5|$|Although high {{waves and}} severe northeasterly gusts were noted from 6to 7September 1804 at St. Augustine, Florida and {{eight of the}} nine <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local port were {{rendered}} unfit for use, the town proper largely escaped damage.|$|E
5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in blood <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E
5|$|During NATO's {{intervention}} in Kosovo, Sea Kings of 814 Naval Air Squadron, operating from numerous Royal Navy <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Adriatic, including {{the aircraft carrier}} HMS Invincible, maintained a patrol of the Balkans' coast. The Sea Kings were also heavily used in the transport role during the preparations for a ground invasion of Kosovo.|$|E

5|$|Ship {{collisions}} frequently {{occur in}} Tsushima Strait {{and result in}} damaging all of whales, passengers, and vessels, hence the Japanese Coast Guard has started visual recordings of large cetaceans in Tsushima Strait to inform operating <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Kellner {{suggested}} that the large crests of the pterosaur Tapejara, {{as well as other}} species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size. There is no evidence of extra blood <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Caligula had {{two large}} ships {{constructed}} for himself (which were {{recovered from the}} bottom of Lake Nemi around 1930). The ships were among the largest <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ancient world. The smaller ship was designed as a temple dedicated to Diana. The larger ship was essentially an elaborate floating palace with marble floors and plumbing. Thirteen years after being raised, the ships were burned during an attack in the Second World War, and almost nothing remains of their hulls, though many archaeological treasures remain intact in the museum at Lake Nemi and in the Museo Nazionale Romano (Palazzo Massimo) at Rome.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich Carl {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} in 1867 until 1895, when she was removed from front-line service {{to serve as a}} training ship. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871, the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Jachmann. Engine trouble, however, plagued the ship and two of the other three <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> squadron; as a result, they made only two sorties from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade. Neither resulted in combat.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> esophagus and stomach.|$|E
5|$|In 1785 Barbary pirates, {{most notably}} from Algiers, began to seize American {{merchant}} <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean. In 1793 alone, eleven American ships were captured and their crews and stores held for ransom. To combat this problem, proposals {{were made for}} warships to protect American shipping, resulting in the Naval Act of 1794. The act provided funds to construct six frigates, but included a clause that if peace terms were agreed to with Algiers, {{the construction of the}} ships would be halted.|$|E

5|$|Re di Portogallo saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. She engaged several Austrian wooden <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> melee, {{including}} ship of the line , which rammed Re di Portogallo but inflicted no significant damage. The ship's career after the war was very limited; in 1871, she was converted into a training ship. By 1875, her wooden hull {{was found to have}} deteriorated badly, and so she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Swelling of damaged muscle {{occasionally}} {{leads to}} compartment syndrome—compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and blood <b>vessels,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same fascial compartment—leading {{to the loss}} of blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb. A second recognized complication is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a severe disruption in blood clotting that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.|$|E
5|$|The French made {{numerous}} {{efforts to}} supply their colonies during this period, attempting to use fast frigates to bring food and military stores to the Caribbean past the British blockades, themselves {{a response to}} Napoleon's Continental System, but often losing the <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. One such attempt {{was made by the}} French frigate Topaze, despatched from Brest to Cayenne with a large cargo of flour. Driven away from Cayenne by Portugal (allies of Britain, and fighting France themselves in be Peninsular War), who had recently captured the colony, Topaze took refuge under the gun batteries of Guadeloupe.|$|E

5|$|The German Imperial Navy {{began its}} second {{submarine}} offensive in February 1916, declaring, among other provisions, that all enemy <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war zone {{were to be}} destroyed without warning. On 26 February 1916, UB-2 torpedoed and sank the cargo ship Arbonne, in what was ultimately her last wartime success. The British steamer—at , the largest ship sunk by UB-2—went down {{with a loss of}} all fourteen of her crew.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Aarhus {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{industrial}} ports in northern Europe with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's container traffic and accommodating the largest container <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. The facilities handle some 9.5million tonnes of cargo a year (2012). Grain is the principal export, while feedstuffs, stone, cement and coal are among the chief imports. Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition from the Port of Hamburg and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from the peak in 2008.|$|E
