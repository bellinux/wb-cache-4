5|$|The <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{neptunium}} {{that currently}} exists on Earth {{was produced in}} artificial nuclear reactions.

5|$|While many {{bacteria}} and mitochondria have polyadenylate polymerases, {{they also have}} another type of polyadenylation, performed by polynucleotide phosphorylase itself.

It can synthesise a 3' extension where the <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bases are adenines. Like in bacteria, polyadenylation by polynucleotide phosphorylase promotes degradation of the RNA in plastids and likely also archaea.|$|E

5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E

5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work {{came in the form of}} the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium. Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E

5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} {{make up the}} <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several {{percent of the total}} welding cost.|$|E
