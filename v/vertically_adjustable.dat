50|$|The Ransome Victory Plough's most {{recognizable}} {{feature is the}} <b>vertically</b> <b>adjustable</b> pivot wheel {{in front of the}} ploughshare (as opposed to a cutting knife or wheel). This pivot wheel, combined with an offset tension bar to which the chain from the yoke is connected, causes the forward motion of oxen to force the blade into the soil. However, the tension bar is typically far weaker than the main plough beam, and is likely {{the first part of the}} plough to break. The difficulty of accessing spare parts causes many farmers to simply chain the oxen to the front of the beam, after which the ploughman must use his own strength to keep the plowshare in the soil. Another notable feature is the relatively short mouldboard, which lessens the amount of draft force necessary to pull the plow.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the optimum design of a tuned mass damper (TMD) for the {{mitigation}} of machine-induced vertical vibration of structures. Theoretically, a TMD without damping tuning to the machine operating frequency will make optimum control performance. Considering zero damping is impossible, a new field-based design procedure and an <b>adjustable</b> <b>vertically</b> moving TMD (VTMD) are proposed. The VTMD is composed of variable mass blocks and changeable springs. A prototype of the VTMD was fabricated and tested on a simply supported beam and a reinforced-concrete floor of a school building. Both experimental results confirmed the control effectiveness and usefulness of the VTMD. In the beam test, more than 90 % reduction in accelerations was observed. In the floor test, 41 - 56 % acceleration reduction can be achieved even though the mass ratio of TMD to structure is very small. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} downlink transmission in {{a cellular}} network consisting of multi-antenna base stations (BSs), single-antenna mobile users, directional antennas {{each with a}} <b>vertically</b> <b>adjustable</b> beam, and control signaling delays in feedback and backhaul links. We propose a novel transmission technique in which intercell interference management is performed via coordinating the beamforming jointly in the horizontal and vertical planes of the wireless channel, denoted as coordinated 3 D beamforming. In the horizontal plane, we focus on intercell interference cancelation (ICIC) and investigate its performance when the provided channel state information (CSI) is impaired due to delay/mobility. It is demonstrated that the superiority of ICIC over conventional intracell maximum ratio transmission is highly dependent on the CSI accuracy. In the vertical plane, we consider intercell interference control via coordinatively adapting the elevation angle of the BS antenna pattern, denoted as tilt, to {{the locations of the}} scheduled users. It is shown that with perfect CSI interference management should be performed in the horizontal plane using ICIC, while at high delay/mobility it should be done in the vertical plane via coordinated tilt adaptation. For intermediate values of delay/mobility, joint interference management in both planes is required...|$|E

40|$|Whereas in {{the past}} dental stools {{typically}} facilitated a 90 ° hip angle, a number of currently available alternative designs allow for a more extended hip posture. The present study investigated the influence of different stool types on muscle activity and lumbar posture. Twenty five participants completed a simulated dental procedure on a standard stool, a saddle and the Ghopec. The latter stool comprises a seat pan consisting of a horizontal rear part for the pelvis and an inclinable sloping down front part for the upper legs, with a <b>vertically</b> and horizontally <b>adjustable</b> back rest. Lumbar posture was most close to neutral on the Ghopec, whereas sitting on a standard/saddle stool resulted in more flexed/extended postures respectively. Sitting with a 90 ° angle (standard stool) resulted in higher activation of back muscles while sitting with a 125 ° angle (saddle and Ghopec) activated abdominal muscles more, although less {{in the presence of}} a backrest (Ghopec).

40|$|In late 2011 Bi et al. {{published}} a paper titled Jamming by Shear suggesting a signi cant modi cation {{of the well}} known Liu-Nagel phase diagram showing the transition between jammed and unjammed states in granular materials under shear stress. This claim involved two new states referred to as fragile exhibiting anisotropic force chain structure, and shear jammed exhibiting isotropic force chain structure. These states {{were found in the}} regions below the packing fraction that is widely regarded as necessary for the jammed phase. The experiment that led to the discovery was carried out in in a quasi-two-dimensional geometry under volume-preserving conditions. The purpose of our experiments and this report was to either con rm or refuse the results from Jamming by Shear but by applying shear stress to a granular material in three dimensions to determine whether the extra dimension proved to be a problem for the reproduction of the two new states. We used a cylindrical geometry featuring a central pillar, <b>adjustable</b> <b>vertically</b> to apply a shear stress to the material. We found indications of the shear jammed state, consistent with the changes to the Liu- Nagel phase diagram proposed by Bi et al. However by testing for anisotropic distribution of forcechains in the area where the material was expected to be in a fragile state, no clear indications were found. The missing indications are not necessarily due to the expansion to three dimensions, but can be founded in the technical limitations of the experiment so that {{it is not possible to}} register that the material momentarily passes the unstable fragile phase. We conclude that the Liu-Nagel phase diagram ought to be modi ed but that the area should be investigated further...|$|R
40|$|Driver posture {{data from}} a {{laboratory}} study and an in-vehicle test-track study were used to develop and to evaluate a new seating accommodation model and eyellipse for SAE Class-B vehicles. The new statistical models are configurable for population anthropometry; include the effects of steering wheel position; incorporate a new method based on driver preference for using the adjustment range of highly adjustable steering wheels as input to the models; and are customizable to any desired accommodation level. The new seating accommodation model predicts ranges of fore-aft seat-position {{that are similar to}} those in SAE J 1517, but includes simultaneous prediction of vertical seat adjustment range. The new eyellipse is almost twice as tall as the current J 941 Class-B eyellipse, due to the incorporation of vertical seat adjustment. The new eyellipse is narrower in plan view and aligned with the vehicle grid, unlike the J 941 eyellipse. Predictions from the new model compared well with driver seat positions and eye locations measured in six test vehicles, although extensive seat-position censoring in four of the test vehicles limited the comparison.

40|$|We {{consider}} a cellular network with multiantenna base stations (BSs) and single-antenna users, multicell cooperation, imperfect channel state information (CSI), and directional antennas, {{each with a}} <b>vertically</b> <b>adjustable</b> beam. We investigate {{the impact of the}} elevation angle of the BS antenna pattern, which is denoted as tilt, on the performance of the considered network when employing either a traditional single-cell transmission or a fully cooperative multicell transmission. Using the results of this investigation, we propose a novel hybrid multicell cooperation technique in which the intercell interference is controlled via either cooperative beamforming in the horizontal plane or coordinated beamforming in the vertical plane of the wireless channel, which is denoted as adaptive multicell 3 -D beamforming. The main idea is to divide the coverage area into two disjoint vertical regions and adapt the multicell cooperation strategy at the BSs when serving each region. A fair scheduler is used to share the time slots between the vertical regions. It is shown that the proposed technique can achieve performance comparable with that of a fully cooperative transmission but with significantly lower complexity and signaling requirements. To facilitate computationally efficient simulation and design space exploration, accurate approximations of the user ergodic rate are proposed for different transmission strategies under imperfect CSI...|$|E
40|$|A <b>vertically</b> <b>adjustable</b> {{electrostatic}} probe array {{was made to}} observe the previously seen low-frequency angular oscillations in LDX and identify if they are related to computationally expected convective cells. The array rests one meter from the centerline and measures edge fluctuations at field lines near the separatrix. It spans ninety degrees and has 24 probes mounted on it for total probe tip separation of 6. 8 cm. Bispectral analysis of the fluctuations show that that an inverse cascade of energy is present at times in LDX. The cascade transfers energy from small spatial scale structures to large scale structures. The wavenumber spectrum is xc k- 1. 4 to cx k- 25 at high wavenumbers, which encompasses the inverse energy cascade regime of c k- 5 / 3. The plasma also has a linear dispersion relation which gives a phase velocity of 2 - 16 k. This phase velocity is inversely correlated with neutral gas pressure in the vessel. The velocity also has a local maximum at 5 pTorr which is the pressure that produces maximum plasma density. The radial E x B drift velocities are observed to have a mean near zero, which indicates a closed structure like a convective cell. The instantaneous radial drift velocities are {{on the order of}} the ion sound speed, which is 35 km/s. by Ryan M. Bergmann. Thesis (S. M. and S. B.)

40|$|AbstractA large {{variety of}} biotic and abiotic {{processes}} take place {{close to the}} sediment-water interface, causing and being affected byphysical, biological and chemical gradients below and above this transition zone. Adequate sampling of this environment isessential for a comprehensive understanding of the complex sea floor ecological systems. The multi-horizon bottom watersampler (BoWaSnapper) presented here was developed for instantaneous sampling of the transition zone above the seafloor andcan be deployed in all types of water bodies from coastal seas to full ocean depth (6000 m). The intention was to construct aninstrument that could {{bridge the gap between}} the sampling of the bottom water column by conventional CTD rosette andsediment sampling gear such as a multiple corer. The BoWaSnapper was designed to be operated on any research ship?s wire and allows time-efficient high-resolutionsampling of bottom water. The bottommost 2 m are sampled with six <b>vertically</b> <b>adjustable</b> bottles. Prior to closure, the bottlesare aligned with the bottom current by means of a vane and flushed by bottom water for several minutes. This ensures thatparticles dispersed upon the touch-down of the BoWaSnapper are flushed away. An electronic mechanism, activated by abottom switch, initiates bottle closure after a delay pre-selected by the user. As illustrated by several examples, the transparentbottles (6 L volume each) allow the determination of particle concentrations as well as the analysis of solutes such as nutrients,dissolved gases, and natural radiotracers. Although the sampler is universally suitable for seafloor environments, its specialdomain is characterised by steep geochemical gradients such as cold vents and submarine groundwater discharge.

40|$|Automation {{technology}} in agriculture is growing, making agricultural robotics viable. Innovative field usable multi-purpose robotic platforms {{are needed for}} the successful progression of agricultural robotics. Furthermore, the field of agricultural robotics would benefit from a robotic platform design allowing for variable height, thus accommodating navigation throughout various crop growth stages. A variable height machine, Flex-Ro was developed to accommodate this feature. Multiple sub-assemblies were designed and implemented for Flex-Ro. An electronic control unit (ECU) enabled engine was used to power Flex-Ro. An embedded application program was developed to control engine speed using proprietary Controller Area Network (CAN) messages in conjunction with J 1939 standard messages. It was observed that the maximum standard deviation from the requested set speed was 8. 423 rpm. A hydrostatic transmission system was designed and implemented on Flex-Ro. An embedded application program was developed for controlling the pumps and motors of the hydrostatic transmission utilizing proprietary CAN messages. Additionally, the embedded controller operated a Control Cut Off (CCO) that regulated flow to the spring applied motor brakes and the Electronic Displacement Control (EDC) which controls pump flow. Based on the motor speed data collected, {{it was observed that}} an increase in deviation occurred as the operational speed increased with a minimum standard deviation of 6. 98 rpm at 50 RPM and a maximum standard deviation of 36. 13 rpm at 156 RPM. The measured data should be used in developing further higher level control programs. A <b>vertically</b> <b>adjustable</b> frame was developed to allow Flex-Ro to enter crops at various growth stages. A steering system was developed and programmed to allow for steering control through the CAN bus again using proprietary CAN messages. Lastly, a remote control program was developed to allow messages to be created and wirelessly transmitted to Flex-Ro’s CAN bus for teleoperation. Sub-assemblies of Flex-Ro will be further developed for fully autonomous navigation, and performing various field operations. Advisor: Santosh Pitl...|$|E
