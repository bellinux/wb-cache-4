During passaging of the cells, there was a change towards a cancer phenotype, and a shift from episomal to integrated HPV. Levels of hTERT (catalytic subunit of telomerase) mRNA, and telomerase activity in cells carrying episomal virus seemed constant during passaging. During passaging of cells containing integrated HPV, however, the levels of oncogene mRNA decreased, while hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity increased sharply. Thus, in those cells {{there is no direct}} correlation between changes of oncogene and telomerase expression. Conceivably, viral oncogene expression might trigger telomerase up-regulation in an early subpopulation of cells, which during subsequent passaging could be selected for...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: When <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> are {{encountered}} during surveillance colonoscopy {{of patients}} with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), guidelines recommend collection of additional biopsies from the surrounding mucosa to ensure the lesion has been adequately circumscribed. We aimed to determine the rate of dysplasia in mucosa biopsies collected from tissues surrounding <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> during IBD surveillance. METHODS: In a retrospective study, we collected endoscopy and pathology reports from 1065 patients undergoing colonoscopic surveillance for IBD from 2000 through 2015 at 3 centers in the Netherlands. We analyzed reports from all patients with <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> from whom biopsies of surrounding mucosa were collected. Among 194 patients with 1 or more visible <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions,</b> mucosal biopsies were collected from tissues adjacent to 140 <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> from 71 patients (63 % male; 48 % with ulcerative colitis, 42 % with Crohn's disease, and 10 % with indeterminate colitis). RESULTS: The mean number of surrounding mucosa biopsies collected per lesion was 3. 4 (range, 1 - 6). Dysplasia was detected in 7 biopsies surrounding 140 areas of dysplasia (5. 0 %) and 5 biopsies surrounding 136 areas of low-grade dysplasia (3. 7 %). Dysplasia in biopsies of surrounding mucosa could be observed during 5 of 87 white light endoscopies and during 2 of 53 chromoendoscopies. In patients with dysplasia in mucosa surrounding lesions of low-grade dysplasia, post-resection surveillance did not reveal high-grade dysplasia or colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Dysplasia is detected in only 5 % of biopsies collected from mucosa surrounding <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions.</b> This observation indicates that endoscopists accurately delineate the borders of <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> during surveillance {{of patients with}} IBD. The lack of clinical consequences from routinely collecting biopsies from areas surrounding <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> casts doubt on the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of this practice...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe protein SLIT 2 and its {{receptor}} ROBO 1 regulate different cellular processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. In {{this study}} our {{aim is to}} understand the alterations of these genes during development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Materials and MethodsFirst, molecular alterations of the genes were analyzed in 30 <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions,</b> 128 primary HNSCC samples, and 1 HNSCC cell line. Then alterations were correlated with mRNA expression (n = 22) and protein expression (n = 29). Finally, the alterations were correlated with different clinicopathologic parameters and clinical outcomes of the patients. ResultsROBO 1 had a comparatively high frequency of deletion (28. 5 %- 54. 2 %) from <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> and subsequent clinical stages than did SLIT 2 (16. 6 - 27 %). On the contrary, SLIT 2 had a high frequency (56. 6 %- 81. 2 %) of promoter methylation from <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> onward compared with ROBO 1 (20 %- 32. 8 %). Interestingly, alterations of SLIT 2 and ROBO 1 were high in <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> (80 %), followed by comparable frequencies (92. 5 %- 95. 3 %) in subsequent stages of tumor. Alterations of these genes showed concordance with their mRNA/protein expression and significant association with poor patient outcome. ConclusionsOur data suggest that inactivation of SLIT 2 and/or ROBO 1 {{is one of the}} early events in development of <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> of head and neck and has prognostic importance...|$|R

Smoking {{is considered a}} risk factor for developing OL, and <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> are more prone to malignant transformation. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the clinical features observed in dysplastic and non-dysplastic OL in both smokers and nonsmokers. A total of 315 cases of OL were retrieved and separated into either <b>dysplastic</b> or non-dysplastic <b>lesions,</b> and these cases were further categorized as originating in either smokers or non-smokers. Frequencies of the type of OL lesion, with respect to whether the patients smoked, were established. The results demonstrated that 131 cases of OL were dysplastic (74 smokers and 57 non-smokers), and 184 were non-dysplastic (96 smokers and 88 non-smokers). For OL cases in smokers for which information about alcohol consumption was also available (84 cases), the results revealed no significant difference in the amount of <b>dysplastic</b> and non-dysplastic <b>lesions.</b> <b>Dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> were more frequent in male smokers and in non-smoking females. The median age of smokers with cases of OL was significantly lower than in non-smokers; the lowest median ages were observed for female smokers with dysplastic OL.

This study {{was directed to}} evaluate the immunoexpression of LPA- 1, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis markers in preneoplastic lesions induced with cadmium chloride in rat prostate. Methods: The following parameters were calculated in ventral prostate of normal rats and rats that received Cd in drinking water during 24 months: percentages of cells immunoreactive to LPA- 1 (LILPA 1), PCNA (LIPCNA), MCM 7 (LIMCM 7), ubiquitin (LIUBI), apoptotic cells (LIAPO), and p 53 (LIp 53); volume fraction of Bcl- 2 (VFBcl- 2); and length of microvessels per unit of volume (LVMV/mm 3). Data were analyzed using Student’s t-test and Pearson correlation test. Results: The LILPA 1 in <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> and normal epithelium of Cd-treated rats {{was significantly higher than}} those in the control group. Markers of proliferation were significantly increased in <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions,</b> whereas some apoptotic markers were significantly decreased.

40|$|We report {{overexpression}} of the proto-oncogene bcl- 2 in gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesions. The bcl- 2 proto-oncogene is centrally {{involved in}} the oncogenesis of human follicular lymphoma via a chromosomal translocation t(14; 18) (q 32;q 21) and is also expressed in the epithelial regenerative compartment or the basal crypts of the normal colon and small intestine. We describe an immunohistochemical analysis of fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using both a polyclonal rabbit and a monoclonal mouse antibody to the Bcl- 2 protein. In addition to confirming bcl- 2 expression in normal colonic and small intestinal crypts, we also observed expression in the gastric epithelial regenerative compartment, the mucous neck region. No increased expression was found in nonneoplastic or inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or inflammatory or hamartomatous polyps. Increased bcl- 2 expression, however, was present in hyperplastic colonic polyps and {{in the majority of}} <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions,</b> from the earliest precursors through large adenomas, high grade flat dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma, all in comparison with adjacent internal control normal epithelium. Increased expression was present in <b>dysplastic</b> glandular <b>lesions</b> from all gastrointestinal sites, including colon, small bowel, and stomach. Furthermore, bcl- 2 expression was frequently abnormal in nondysplastic epithelium surrounding <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions,</b> suggesting that altered expression occurred before the development of morphological dysplasia. Specifically, directly contiguous morphologically nondysplastic epithelium often showed abnormal bcl- 2 expression throughout the full length of the crypt-villus axis.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{alterations}} in hormonal sensitivity {{in relation to}} proliferative activity during the development of cervical dysplasia in women infected with high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV). METHODS: Three to five biopsies of the cervix of eight patients were taken at colposcopy. Dysplasia was detected in 22 of the 32 biopsies, and 20 of these 22 biopsies contained hr-HPV. The labeling index (LI) {{as well as the}} intensity of staining of the MIB- 1 -, estrogen receptor (ER) -, and progesterone receptor (PR) -expression was assessed in each biopsy, including normal epithelium directly adjacent to the <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions.</b> RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed {{a significant increase in the}} MIB- 1 LI with increasing severity of the dysplasia. The ER LI and ER intensity of staining in <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions,</b> as well as in morphologically normal epithelium directly adjacent to the dysplasia, showed a significant inverse relation with the severity of the dysplasia. The PR LI and intensity of staining did not differ between normal epithelium and dysplasia. The ER/MIB- 1 ratio (including the ER LI and ER intensity of staining), and the PR/MIB- 1 ratio (intensity of staining only) in <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> showed a significant inverse relation with the severity of the dysplasia, while no alterations in these ratios were observed in morphologically normal epithelium adjacent to the dysplasia. CONCLUSION: Down regulation of ER expression may be the first alteration to take place in normal epithelium during the development of cervical dysplasia in women infected with hr-HPV. The significant decrease in the ER/MIB- 1 -, and PR/MIB- 1 -ratio in progressively <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> indicates a loss of normal growth control by sex steroid hormones, which is not observed in normal epithelium...|$|R

Dye spraying is believed to enhance visualization of subtle mucosal abnormalities. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the diagnostic yield of <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> in patients with IBD undergoing surveillance colonoscopy between chromoendoscopy (CE) and standard white light endoscopy (WLE). Methods: We searched electronic databases for full journal articles reporting on chromoendoscopy in patients with IBD. Pooled incremental yield (IY) of CE over WLE for dysplasia detection was determined. A fixed effects model was used unless there was significant heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed using Funnel plots or Egger's test. Results: 6 studies involving 1277 patients provided data on number of <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> detected. The difference in yield of dysplasia between CE and WLE was 7 % (95 % CI 3. 2 - 11. 3 %) on a per patient analysis with an NNT of 14. 3.

40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that vascular count significantly {{increases in the}} preneoplastic lesions of the bronchial tree, starting from very low levels in the normal epithelium to a significantly higher number of microvessels in moderate <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> and ill situ carcinomas. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expression has shown to be strictly associated with neovascularization both in human cancer and in various type of preinvasive lesions. A {{number of studies have}} demonstrated that mutant p 53 is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, and immunohistochemical detection of the p 53 protein is associated with p 53 gene mutations. In this study we looked for possible correlation between p 53 protein detection, VEGF expression and vascular count in a series of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of the bronchial tree in order to investigate the angiogenic pattern and its genetic control in the early steps of bronchial cancer development. Twenty-four retrospective bronchial lesions with different grades of dysplasia and a case of normal bronchial epithelium were analysed. Surgical specimens removed from patients either confirmed, or suspect for lung carcinoma were stained immunohistochemically for CD 34, VEGF, and p 53. There were significant increases in microvascular density (MVD), VEGF, and p 53 expression from normal bronchial epithelium through moderate dysplasia to in situ carcinoma to invasive cancer and these factors were significantly associated with moderate <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions.</b> A statistically significant difference was observed in MVD between hyperplastic-metaplastic, moderate <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> and in situ carcinoma. A similar pattern was also observed for VEGF and p 53 protein expression but no significant difference was observed between moderate <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> and in situ carcinoma with regard to VEGF protein expression. The association between MVD, VEGF expression, p 53 mutations and preinvasive lesions of the bronchial tree suggests that neoangiogenesis is 'switched' early in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development and that p 53 may have an important role in promoting angiogenesis in this human model of carcinogenesis...|$|R

40|$|There is no {{effective}} medical treatment for oral precancer, and {{surgery to remove}} these lesions is imprecise because abnormal mucosa extends beyond the visible lesion. Development of vectors for tumor-selective viral replication {{has been a significant}} advance, and viral lysis is well suited to destruction of oral precancerous mucosa. To facilitate evaluation of new treatments, we engineered dysplastic oral epithelium using keratinocytes isolated from <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions.</b> We show that these model systems recapitulate the key characteristics of the clinical lesions closely, and that topical delivery of the conditionally replicating adenovirus (CRAd) dl 922 - 947 can lyse tissue-engineered epithelia that show mild, moderate, or severe dysplasia, but normal oral epithelia are very resistant to this treatment. The lytic effect is determined by various factors, including the grade and proliferation index of the dysplastic epithelia. The presence of suprabasal cycling cells, expression of the coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR), the transcription cofactor p 300, and other aberrations that affect the regulation of the cell cycle or apoptosis and promote viral replication may also be important. The ability of dl 922 - 947 to destroy engineered oral dysplasia was significantly greater than that observed using wild-type adenovirus, d/ 1520, or viruses modified to bypass cell entry dependent on the presence of CAR.

Some of these tumours {{are associated with}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, with the types of HPV differing among papillomas and <b>dysplastic</b> or malignant <b>lesions.</b>  METHODS—The relation between squamous tumours of the conjunctiva and lacrimal sac and HPV infection was investigated in 17  individuals with such tumours. Nine of the 17  tumours were benign, four were <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions,</b> and four were carcinomas.  RESULTS—Eight specimens showed positive immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to HPV; four of these eight were papillomas, three were <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions,</b> and one was a carcinoma.

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a {{major cause}} of cancer-related deaths in much of the world. Most CRCs arise from pre-malignant (<b>dysplastic)</b> <b>lesions,</b> such as adenomatous polyps, and current {{endoscopic}} screening approaches with white light do not detect all <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions.</b> Thus, new strategies to identify such lesions, including non-polypoid lesions, are needed. We aim to identify and validate novel peptides that specifically target dysplastic colonic epithelium in vivo. We used phage display to identify a novel peptide that binds to dysplastic colonic mucosa in vivo in a genetically engineered mouse model of colo-rectal tumorigenesis, based on somatic Apc (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene inactivation. Binding was confirmed using confocal microscopy on biopsied adenomas and excised adenomas incubated with peptide ex vivo. Studies of mice where a mutant Kras allele was somatically activated in the colon to generate hyperplastic epithelium were also performed for comparison. Several rounds of in vivo T 7 library biopanning isolated a peptide, QPIHPNNM. The fluorescent-labeled peptide bound to <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> on endoscopic analysis. Quantitative assessment revealed the fluorescent-labeled peptide (target/background: 2. 17 ± 0. 61) binds ∼ 2 -fold greater to the colonic adenomas when compared to the control peptide (target/background: 1. 14 ± 0. 15), p< 0. 01. The peptide did not bind to the non-dysplastic (hyperplastic) epithelium of the Kras mice. This work is first to image fluorescence-labeled peptide binding in vivo that is specific towards colonic dysplasia on wide-area surveillance. This finding highlights an innovative strategy for targeted detection to localize pre-malignant lesions that can be generalized to the epithelium of hollow organs...|$|R
50|$|Paxillin {{has been}} shown to have a clinically-significant role in {{patients}} with several cancer types. Enhanced expression of paxillin has been detected in premalignant areas of hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia and goblet cell metaplasia, as well as <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> and carcinoma in high-risk patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Mutations in PXN have been associated with enhanced tumor growth, cell proliferation, and invasion in lung cancer tissues.|$|R
40|$|A Boxer puppy had {{an unusual}} <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesion</b> of the distal {{epiphysis}} {{of the left}} femur. Biopsy and CT examination were performed. A diagnosis of dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica (DEH) was made. To the investigators knowledge, this condition has not been described before in animals. DEH is a growth disorder involving preferentially the medial compartment of the lower limbs, and it is associated with epiphyseal hypertrophy and delayed mineralization...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{observed that}} growth inhibition of esophageal cancer cells by retinoic acid (RA) {{was associated with}} both constitutive expression and RA-induced up-regulation of RA receptor β (RAR-β). Cell lines that did not express RAR-β were also resistant to RA. To explore the expression of RAR-β mRNA in vivo, we analyzed esophageal tissue specimens from 16 normal mucosae, 30 <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions,</b> and 157 esophageal tumors by in situ hybridization. RAR-β was detected in 88 % (14 / 16) of normal esophageal tissues and in 96 % (96 / 100) of distant normal esophageal mucosa from cancer specimens. In contrast, RAR-β was expressed in only 57 % (17 / 30) of <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> and in 54 % (84 / 157) of carcinomas. Among esophageal carcinomas RAR-β mRNA was expressed in 62 % (26 / 42) of well-differentiated, 54 % (27 / 50) of moderately differentiated, and only 29 % (4 / 14) of poorly differentiated SCCs. Our {{data suggest that the}} loss of RAR-β expression is an early event associated with esophageal carcinogenesis and the status of squamous differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{anorectal}} {{human papillomavirus}} (HPV†) infection {{is related to}} the recent trends in sexual behavior in both homosexual and heterosexual groups and prevalence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Clinical presentation and natural history depend on the serotype involved. HPV 6 and 11 are found in the benign wart. Local control can be achieved with a wide selection of surgical and topical techniques. HPV 16, 18, and 31 are found in <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> and have the potential to progress to invasive anal squamous cell carcinoma. Recognition and early management of <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> is crucial to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with anal cancer. While low-grade lesions can be closely observed, high-grade lesions should be eradicated. Different strategies can be used to erad-icate the disease while preserving anorectal function. Studies on the efficacy of vaccination on anorectal HPV showed promising results in select population groups and led to the re-cent expansion of current vaccination recommendations. *To whom all correspondence should be addressed: Walter E.

40|$|Benign fibro-osseous lesions of the craniofacial complex are {{represented}} {{by a variety of}} disease processes that are characterized by pathologic ossifications and calcifications in association with a hypercellular fibroblastic marrow element. The current classification includes neoplasms, developmental <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> and inflammatory/reactive processes. The definitive diagnosis can rarely be rendered on the basis of histopathologic features alone; rather, procurement of a final diagnosis is usually dependent upon assessment of microscopic, clinical and imaging features together. Fibrous dysplasia and osteitis deformans constitute two <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> in which mutations have been uncovered. Other dysplastic bone diseases of the craniofacial complex include florid osseous dysplasia, focal cemento-osseous dysplasia and periapical cemental dysplasia, all showing a predilection for African descent individuals; although no specific genetic alterations in DNA coding have yet to be uncovered and most studies have been derived from predominant high African descent populations. Ossifying fibromas are neoplastic lesions with four subtypes varying with regard to behavior and propensity for recurrence after surgical excision. The clinicopathologic and molecular features of this unique yet heterogeneous group of diseases are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The histologic {{features}} of retinal dysplasia were studied in 26 English springer spaniel dogs {{of one day}} to four years of age. <b>Dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> in neonatal pups occurred predominantly in the peripapillary tapetal area of sensory retina. They consisted of complex linear folds and rosettes which were composed of hyperplastic neuroblasts. Dysplasia usually {{was not associated with}} incomplete differentiation of the outer neuroblastic layer. The outer limiting membrane was absent locally and numerous patent subretinal capillaries existed in the region of folds. The dysplastic features ma:y be related to aberrant development of Muller cells and of retinal capillaries. In adolescent dogs, <b>dysplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> were less complex and usually were not accompanied by aberrant capillaries. Focal or complete retinal separation was present in some adolescent dogs. In adult dogs, {{features of}} retinal atrophy were found within dysplastic areas. No significant histologic lesions were found in the extraocular tissues of 12 affected dogs which were surveyed extensively. Retinal dysplasia has been defined as anomalous differentiation of the retina [43]. It may occur either with [34] or with'out [22] other intraocular and extraocula...|$|R
