50|$|The {{parts that}} make up the stacked tube {{blowback}} are the body, trigger sear, bolt, striker/hammer, valve, <b>valve</b> <b>pin,</b> cup seal, main spring, and valve spring.|$|E
50|$|When cocked, in {{the bottom}} tube, the main spring exerts forward {{pressure}} on the striker, {{which in turn is}} held in place by the trigger sear, the valve spring exerts backwards pressure on the <b>valve</b> <b>pin</b> which closes the valve with the cup seal, thus holding back the air/. In the top tube sits the bolt which is connected by a rod to the striker and the paintball which sits in the chamber held in place by a detent.|$|E
5000|$|Sheridan Valve: Named {{after the}} Sheridan series of markers which first {{employed}} this design, markers which employ this mechanism have the bolt which loads the paintball {{is located in}} a separate tube from the hammer and valve. To cock the mechanism, the bolt is pulled backwards thus opening the breech and loading a paintball. Doing so also pulls the hammer backwards against the main spring, which is then held back by a sear connected to the trigger. The bolt is then pushed forward, which loads the paintball into the barrel and the marker is ready to fire. Pulling the trigger releases the hammer which is propelled forward by the main spring, hitting the <b>valve</b> <b>pin</b> and opening the valve which allows compressed gas to flow from the valve chamber into the barrel chamber thus propelling the loaded paintball forward and out of the barrel. The valve spring then closes the valve with the hammer still resting on the <b>valve</b> <b>pin,</b> after which this cycle must be repeared in order to fire another paintball. Notable examples of markers which operate in this way include the Sheridan K2, the Worr Games Products Sniper and the Chipley Custom Machine S6.|$|E

40|$|Polymer {{processing}} {{has been}} limited {{by the lack of}} direct flow and pressure control of the polymer melt at multiple points in space and time. Improved axial and radial valve designs are discussed that require negligible actuation force to control the flow of the pressurized melt. The forces resulting from pressure loads and shear stresses are first analyzed for an axial <b>valve</b> <b>pin.</b> Subsequently, a radial valve design is implemented and experimentally characterized using neat polycarbonate. A sigmoidal response surface is fit to the experimental data and found to very well model the observed pressure drop as a function of flow rate and <b>valve</b> <b>pin</b> position. The juncture loss at the valve port is then characterized by estimating and removing the pressure drops in the circular flow segments of the valve. Analysis indicated that the juncture loss is inversely proportional to the exposed area, or vesica piscis, formed between the circular flow channel in the valve body and the flow port on the moving <b>valve</b> <b>pin.</b> While applicable to many different polymer processing operations, the validated models are used to show the dynamic <b>valve</b> <b>pin</b> position {{as a function of the}} desired flow rate and desired cavity pressure in the hot runner of an injection mold. Finally, the impact of the designs on lower power, more compact mechanical and control system designs are discussed...|$|E

50|$|In European style systems, {{the size}} and shape of the venturi of the {{carburettor}} is designed to match the converter. In USA style systems, the air <b>valve</b> and metering <b>pins</b> in the mixer are sized to match the diaphragm size and spring stiffness in the converter. In both cases, the components are matched by the manufacturers and only basic adjustments are needed during installation and tuning.|$|R
50|$|Diesel's {{original}} engine injected fuel {{with the}} assistance of compressed air, which atomized the fuel and forced it into the engine through a nozzle (a similar principle to an aerosol spray). The nozzle opening was closed by a <b>pin</b> <b>valve</b> lifted by the camshaft to initiate the fuel injection before top dead centre (TDC). This is called an air-blast injection. Driving the compressor used some power but the efficiency and net power output was more than any other combustion engine at that time.|$|R
50|$|The valve {{motions and}} the inside {{connecting}} rod were enclosed in an oil bath consisting of a vertical steel box located between the main frame members, containing 40 imp gal of oil. About 2 in depth of oil lay in the bath; the inside big end was splash-lubricated, and two pumps sprayed oil through perforated pipes over the various <b>valve</b> motion <b>pins.</b> None of this was particularly revolutionary, being borrowed from internal-combustion engine practice; and for use with steam it was established practice for steam motors at the Sentinel Waggon Works. It was thought that the arrangement would obviate the daily need to oil all moving parts and as they were protected from the elements {{they should be able}} to run 100,000 mi without attention. It was this consideration that meant the continued use of the system, albeit in modified form, on Bulleid's Leader class.|$|R
5000|$|Sterling [...] "Hybrid" [...] Valve: A {{variation}} or bybrid {{of these}} two methods of operation has been employed {{in the design of}} the Arrow Precision Sterling, wherein the bolt is located in a separate tube, as in a Sheridan valved marker, the hammer latches to a carrier similar to how it would to the bolt in a Nelson valve design, and when release it hits a Sheridan styled <b>pin</b> <b>valve.</b> There is significant debate as to what type of operations the Sterling employs, as some consider it to be a hybrid between the two main designs, and others simply consider it to be a stacked-tube Nelson.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Microfluidic biochips are {{replacing}} the conven-tional biochemical analyzers {{and are able}} to integrate the necessary functions for biochemical analysis on-chip. In this paper we are interested in flow-based biochips, in which the fluidic flow manipulated using integrated mi-crovalves, which are controlled from external pressure sources, connected to “control pins”. By combining several microvalves, more complex units, such as micropumps, switches, mixers, and multiplexers, can be built. The cur-rent practice is to design these biochips by hand in draw-ing tools such as AutoCAD, and to program them manual-ly by individually controlling each valve. Recent research has proposed top-down physical synthesis Computer-Aided Design tools, and programming languages and com-pilation techniques to automatically derive the control signals for the valve actuations. However, researchers have so far assumed that the number of ports used to drive the <b>valves</b> (control <b>pins)</b> is unlimited, which has resulted in very expensive, bulky and energy consuming off-chip con-trol and infeasible control routes in the biochip control layer. In this paper, we propose a methodology {{to reduce the number of}} control pins required to run a biochemical application. We focus on the compilation task, where the strategy is to delay operations, without missing their dead-lines, such that the sharing of control signals is maximized. The evaluation shows a significant reduction in the num-ber of control pins required. I...|$|R

40|$|NoM 3 / 2 {{sintered}} {{high speed}} steel and composite materials processed by initial admixing of 5 wt. % TiC (to decrease wear) and 5 wt. % MnS (to minimise friction) powders, singly and in combination, were assessed in pin-on-disc tribometers specially constructed to simulate use in the automotive <b>valve</b> train. <b>Pins</b> were of the sintered materials and the mating tribological material discs of T 1 {{high speed steel}}. For comparison with existing conventional materials, identical tests were performed with discs and pins of two types of spheroidal cast iron. Testing at 110 °C, employing {{a few drops of}} fresh Shell Helix Standard SAE: 15 W- 40, API: SJ/CF oil, in daily segments of 5000 m of sliding distance was carried out until the break of the boundary film and appearance of the early signs of seizure. Accordingly the conditions were initially elastohydrodynamic, then mixed lubrication, then boundary, and finally decaying boundary. In comparison with the baseline cast iron system, the friction, wear and lifetime performance of all the high speed steel systems was markedly superior. MnS further lowered the coefficient of friction and TiC increased the load carrying capacity of M 3 / 2 steel. The lifetime, test distance until seizure, was the most discriminating parameter between the high speed steel systems, being 1. 5 ¿ 3 times longer for the unmodified M 3 / 2 than the composites and 10 times longer than that of the cast irons system...|$|R
5000|$|Short-Stroking: On {{mechanical}} Autocockers, {{the trigger}} both fires the marker (by releasing the sear) and re-cocks it (by pulling the timing rod and activating the 3-way). The {{pull of the}} trigger accomplishes first one, then the other, in a precisely timed operation, making it necessary for the player to fully pull and release the trigger each time. Only partially pulling the trigger, known colloquially as [...] "short-stroking", will alter the duration of time the pneumatics are actively operating the recocking mechanism, or may eliminate the re-cocking cycle altogether. Short-stroking can thus cause many malfunctions related {{to one or more}} steps of the recocking process not being performed. For instance, if the back block does not move fully rearward, the hammer may not be caught by the sear, and will be released into the <b>pin</b> <b>valve</b> immediately upon the back block moving forward again. If the back block is not kept rearward long enough for a paintball to drop fully into the chamber, a [...] "dry fire" [...] or a [...] "ball chop" [...] may occur, the latter being extremely frustrating as it drastically affects accuracy of future shots until the barrel, breech and bolt are cleaned. The need for a full trigger pull on mechanical Autocockers also results in a slower rate of fire.|$|R
40|$|Invention {{of oxygen}} {{cylinder}} {{was one of}} the most important developments in the field of medical practice. Oxygen and other gases were compressed and stored at high pressure in seamless containers constructed from hand-forged steel in 1880. Materials technology has continued to evolve and now medical gas cylinders are generally made of steel alloys or aluminum. The filling pressure as well as capacity has increased considerably while at the same time the weight of cylinders has reduced. Today oxygen cylinder of equivalent size holds a third more oxygen but weighs about 20 kg less. The cylinders are of varying sizes and are color coded. They are tested at regular intervals by the manufacturer using hydraulic, impact, and tensile tests. The top end of the cylinder is fitted with a valve with a variety of number and markings stamped on it. Common <b>valve</b> types include: <b>Pin</b> index <b>valve,</b> bull nose, hand wheel and integral valve. The type of valve varies with cylinder size. Small cylinders have a <b>pin</b> index <b>valve</b> while large have a bull nose type. Safety features in the cylinder are: Color coding, pin index, pressure relief device, Bodok seal, and label attached etc., Safety rules and guidelines must be followed during storage, installation and use of cylinders to ensure safety of patients, hospital personnel and the environment...|$|R
5000|$|In Spool-valve-based {{electropneumatic}} markers, {{the bolt}} also {{acts as the}} valve. This {{eliminates the need for}} a stacked tube construction; spool valve markers have a more compact profile. Instead of a cycling hammer or ram that strikes a <b>pin</b> <b>valve,</b> the movement of the bolt is controlled by the routing of air into small chambers in front of or behind the bolt. An air reservoir behind the bolt contains the air that is to fire the paintball. When the marker is at rest, air is routed {{to the front of the}} bolt to prevent the air in the reservoir from escaping. In an [...] "unbalanced spool valve" [...] design, when the trigger is pulled, that air is exhausted from the marker, allowing the air in the reservoir to push the bolt forwards. In a [...] "balanced spool valve" [...] design, the air in the reservoir cannot force the bolt open; instead, the air from the front of the bolt is rerouted to a small chamber behind the bolt, separate from the reservoir, which then pushes the bolt forward. In either case, the movement of the bolt forward exposes pathways in the bolt or the marker that allow the air in the reservoir behind the bolt to surge forward and fire the paintball. Afterwards, airflow to the front of the bolt is restored, pushing the bolt back into its resting position.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "poppet valve" [...] (or simply [...] "poppet") design {{functions}} {{similarly to}} a mechanical blowback or Autococker-style marker; when the trigger is pulled, low-pressure {{air from the}} solenoid brings the bolt forward to chamber the paintball and also sends a connected, weighted ram into a <b>pin</b> <b>valve,</b> which opens to allow high-pressure air into the chamber, launching the ball. Then, either additional air from the solenoid in a [...] "two-way" [...] design, or a spring in a [...] "FASOR" [...] (Forward Air, Spring-Operated Return) design, returns the bolt and ram to the open position. Another paintball drops into the open chamber and the action is ready to fire again. Poppets are typically valued for high gas efficiency, as the low-pressure system to move the ram and the limited time the high-pressure valve is open saves gas compared to most competing designs. However, {{the nature of the}} mechanism produces very loud [...] "pops" [...] when the marker is fired, and the movement of the ram and bolt and the sudden high-pressure release of air can increase recoil, affecting accuracy during rapid fire. They are also more mechanically complex; most designs require two regulators, one to adjust the [...] "high-pressure" [...] air launching the ball, and a second one to further lower the pressure to operate the ram.|$|R
40|$|In modern medicine, {{biomaterials}} {{are increasingly}} {{used to support}} or restore human body function. A biomaterial {{can be defined as}} man-made material designed to interact with living tissue or with body fluid. Joint prostheses, heart <b>valves,</b> external fixator <b>pins,</b> catheters, and contact lenses can all be considered examples of successful applications of biomaterials. Despite the fact that biomaterials have led to great improvements in medicine, they all have one thing in common: they tend to attract infectious micro-organisms leading to the occurrence of biomaterial-associated infections. The biomaterial itself then has become the focus of infection. These infections are mainly caused by direct contamination during surgery, but they can also be caused by haematogenous spread of bacteria from an infection site somewhere else in the human body. The clinically important step of bacterial attachment to the surface of a biomaterial is then followed by aggregation of other bacteria and growing of the bacteria, resulting in biofilm formation. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the reasons for diagnostic problems of infection in total joint prostheses in a University Hospital setting. Diagnostic problems are analyzed during the work up for revision surgery as well as during the peri-operative hospital stay after primary hip replacement. A possible method of preventing clinical signs of infection of a percutaneous orthopaedic implant, which is even more susceptible to infection than totally internal implants, is investigated in an animal model. ...|$|R
