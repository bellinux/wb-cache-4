500|$|In the 1940s, {{radio was}} the {{electronic}} medium for family entertainment and information. In the 1950s, it was television {{that was the}} new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing <b>visual</b> <b>entertainment,</b> first in black and white, then in colour, to the world. By the 1970s, games could be played electronically, then hand-held devices provided mobile entertainment, and by {{the last decade of}} the 20th century, via networked play. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The [...] "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" [...] together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films. One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid obsolescence of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded. One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a Wii console, [...] "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953". Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called [...] "digital revolution" [...] has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up. Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing [...] "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available." [...] Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as [...] "professional engagers" [...] shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.|$|E

40|$|This study {{reports on}} {{an attempt to}} enhance our {{understanding}} of the reasons behind virtual world usage. By providing a mixture of utilitarian and hedonic value, virtual worlds represent an emerging class of multipurpose information systems (MPIS). Previous research seems to fall short in explaining MPIS adoption, especially since key extrinsic and intrinsic motivators are left out of consideration. Drawing upon IT adoption research, motivation theory and the consumer behavior literature, this research extends available works and provides insight into the influence and roles of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. Hypotheses are postulated and tested using a sample of 1627 users of the virtual world Second Life. The results confirm the majority of the hypotheses and support the comprehensive model. The findings indicate instantaneous effects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, and highlight reinforcing effects of intrinsic motivation. Implications for research and practice are discussed. virtual worlds; multipurpose information system; extrinsic motivation; intrinsic motivation; adoption behavior; escapism; <b>visual</b> attractiveness; <b>entertainment</b> value motivation; adoption behavior; escapism; <b>visual</b> attractiveness; <b>entertainment</b> value...|$|R

The exhibition Eyes, Lies and Illusions held at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) in Melbourne and the Hayward gallery in London was a selection from the 20, 000 optical toys, scientific instruments, antiquarian books and <b>visual</b> <b>entertainments</b> in the collection of Werner Nekes, the German experimental film maker. This essay begins with a consideration of the historical trajectory of belief in the afterlife in relation to ‘animation’, the imputation of a soul to anything that appeared to move itself. The second section suggests that animation techniques bear witness to the persistence of atavistic beliefs in modernity. The third addresses the proximity of technology and magic in animation, and proposes a more extended use of the term ‘animation’. Open Acces...|$|R
