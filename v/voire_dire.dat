A <b>voire</b> <b>dire</b> is held by the trial judge to review the evidence in question before it is presented towards to the court or jury. This helps to ensure that any evidence brought before the courts has been legally seized {{by the police and}} that it does not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.|$|E
40|$|Although a {{relatively}} new area of scientific study, theory and research on nonverbal communication in the courtroom has produced important findings for students and practitioners in five key areas: <b>voire</b> <b>dire</b> and jury analysis; opening and closing statements; client demeanor and direct examination; cross-examination; and judge demeanor and communication. During "voire dire, " attorneys should build rapport with potential jurors by using warm nonverbal behaviors such as close distances, eye contact, and soft vocal tones. Research suggests that good rapport {{may be associated with}} an interactants ' adopting similar postures (mirroring), speech styles, facial expressions, and patterns of coordinated movement. In general, an attorney's delivery is likely to be helped by suc: 1 factors as a moderately fast speech rate, fluent speech, strong eye contact, channel consistency, confident and varie...|$|E
40|$|This Essay {{considers}} the narrow question of whether, in changing venue, a court ought {{in principle to}} consider the demographic diversity of the venue. Deciding this issue require consideration of two preliminary questions: what is an impartial jury? And what role, if any, does racial diversity play in empaneling an impartial jury? The Rodney King trial {{raises questions about the}} dynamics of the jury panel, rather than the qualifications of individual jurors. After the Rodney King verdict, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning in the Batson line of cases seems naive for two reasons. First, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s faith in the ability of <b>voire</b> <b>dire</b> to remove racial bias from the jury seems overstated. Second, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s attention seems to be focused erroneously on the freedom from bias of individual jurors. The qualities of the panel as a whole [...] apart from the qualifications of individual jurors [...] are so important to accurate fact-finding that the size of the jury has been held to be essential to due process of law...|$|E
40|$|In {{cases of}} {{forensic}} dental identification, {{a key factor}} in the comparison of the dental status of deceased persons with antemortem dental records is the matching of dental restorations in individual teeth. Many studies have been performed showing the prevalence of dental interventions. This has mostly been performed by counting the numbers of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) in each mouth without detailed data collection on a per-tooth basis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the research question: to what extent would data on the distribution and prevalence of restoration types in the human dentition facilitate forensic identification? A database program was developed to allow efficient collection and collation of dental trait information. Provision was made for storing information relating to a subject's individual teeth, such as restorative materials used and surfaces filled. Other data, such as missing teeth, caries status on a per-individual tooth basis and presence and details of types of prostheses may be stored. iii Data from patients attending a private group practice in Hobart was collected and a system was devised to enable the likelihood of dental trait occurrence to be calculated in cases of forensic dental identification. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated in a series of mock cases of dental identification. An opportunity to make use of the database for which it was designed arose in relation to the analysis of person identification evidence in a murder trial at the Tasmanian Supreme Court. The use of this reference database in evidence invoked lengthy debate involving the judge, crown prosecutor and defence barristers. The resulting <b>voire</b> <b>dire</b> was resolved in favour of conclusions drawn from the use of the database being admitted in evidence. The legal precedent set in the Marlow trial may possibly offer encouragement for practising odontologists to further the concept of establishing and using reference databases of dental traits in population groups in other parts of Australia...|$|E
