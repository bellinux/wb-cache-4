5|$|In 2010, the Kinect was {{released}} by Microsoft as a 3D scanner/webcam hybrid peripheral device which provides full-body detection of Xbox 360 players and hands-free control of the user interfaces of video games and other software on the console. This was later modified by Oliver Kreylos of University of California, Davis {{in a series of}} YouTube videos which showed him combining the Kinect with a PC-based virtual camera. Because the Kinect is capable of detecting a full range of depth (through computer stereo vision and Structured light) within a captured scene, Kreylos demonstrated the capacity of the Kinect and the virtual camera to allow free-viewpoint navigation of the range of depth, although the camera could only allow a <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> of the scene as shown {{to the front of the}} Kinect, resulting in fields of black, empty space where the camera was unable to capture video within the field of depth. Later, Kreylos demonstrated a further elaboration on the modification by combining the video streams of two Kinects in order to further enhance the <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> within the view of the virtual camera. Kreylos' developments using the Kinect were covered among the works of others in the Kinect hacking and homebrew community in a New York Times article.|$|E
5|$|When {{it comes}} to video walkthroughs of games, {{gameplay}} may be recorded in multiple ways, such as {{through the use of}} screencast software, built-in recording features in some emulators or via a <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> device connected to a console or another computer. Some video games also include built-in recording features, such as Grand Theft Auto V(2013), which included in-game recording and editing features in its PlayStation 4 and Xbox One re-releases, allowing players to record and edit gameplay to share with others. Video content is typically shared over the internet via streaming, using video sharing and media streaming websites such as YouTube and Twitch, where the content has a potential audience consisting of millions of people.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} {{character}} animations for the game, actors {{were placed in}} front of a gray background and performed the motions, which were recorded on videotape (using a broadcast-quality, $20,000 Sony camera instead of the standard Hi8 camera used for the original Mortal Kombat). The <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> footage was then processed into a computer, and the background was removed from selected frames to create sprites. Towards the end of the game's development, they opted to instead use a blue screen technique and processed the footage directly into the computer for a similar, simpler process. The actors were lightly sprayed with water to give them a sweaty, glistening appearance, while post-editing was done on the sprites afterward to highlight flesh tones and improve the visibility of muscles, which Tobias felt set the series apart from similar games using digitized graphics. Animations of Shang Tsung morphing into other characters were created by Midway's John Vogel using a computer, while hand-drawn animations were used for other parts of the game, such as the Fatalities. For animating Goro and Kintaro, clay sculptures were created by Tobias' friend Curt Chiarelli and then turned into 12-inch latex miniatures that were used for stop motion filming. Because of technical restrictions, the actors' costumes had to be simple and no acrobatic moves such as backflips could have been recorded; the hardest moves to perform were some of the jumping kicks.|$|E

25|$|Windows Vista {{introduces}} DirectX Video Acceleration (DXVA) 2.0 which {{enhances the}} implementation of the video pipeline and adds a host of other DDIs, including a Capture DDI for <b>video</b> <b>capture.</b> The DDIs it shares with DXVA 1.0 are also enhanced with support for hardware acceleration of more operations. Also, the DDI functions are directly available to callers and need not be mediated by the video renderer. As such, pipelines for simply decoding the media (without rendering) or post-processing and rendering (without decoding) can also be created. These features require the Windows Display Driver Model drivers.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel automated camera control method for capturing desktop presentations. For this purpose, we first discuss typical features of shots and their cameraworks that frequently appear in TV programs. To realize those features in our automated <b>video</b> <b>capturing</b> system, we classify {{the purpose of}} a camerawork from two points of view: target and aspect-of-target. Then, we consider the correspondence between the classification and typical shots and cameraworks. We propose the virtual-frame control algorithm based on this idea, and the implementation in our video production system. We then show experimental results that verified our method through two kinds of experiments: virtual <b>video</b> <b>capturing</b> using CG animations and real <b>video</b> <b>capturing</b> of real presentations. 1...|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] was {{directed}} by Mark Romanek over a course of six days at Universal Studios, Universal City, California. Madonna had first approached Romanek to direct the music video of her Erotica single, [...] "Bad Girl" [...] (1993). Romanek recalled in the DVD, The Work of Director Mark Romanek, that [...] "Bad Girl" [...] was ultimately directed by David Fincher, but he got later approached by the singer's team for [...] "Bedtime Story". Romanek contacted storyboard artist Grant Shaffer to create the storyboards for the video. He met with Romanek the next day, who played [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] for Shaffer and also showed him some photographs of Madonna, which {{were supposed to be}} used as the album cover. The surrealism inspired images portrayed a mystical looking Madonna, with white hair billowing behind her. Romanek wanted to have the music <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> the same look. Madonna called from Florida and together with Romanek they described to Shaffer every aspect of the video, including budget and their concepts. For the next few days, Shaffer sketched the storyboards and faxed them to Romanek for review. About 20 days later, Shaffer dropped the final sketches at Propaganda Films, who were producing the video.|$|E

2500|$|Late in the 2000s {{smartphones}} {{increased in}} usage, with radar viewing applications frequently used. Particularly, [...] on the iOS platform and [...] on Android are favored. Other apps {{may be used}} as are browsers for viewing meteorological data and accessing social networking services. Some handsets can be used as WiFi hotspots and wireless cards may also be used to avoid committing a handset to tethering or operating as a hotspot. Some hotspots operate as mobile broadband MNVO devices using any radio spectrum that is both available and is in contract with a service provider. Such devices may expand mobile data range beyond a single carrier's service area and typically can work on month-to-month contracts. Adoption of tablet computers is expanding as of the early 2010s. 4G LTE has been adopted when available and can be especially useful for uploading HD video. A gradual uptick of those selecting mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs) began in the mid-2010s although DSLR remains heavily favored. Usage of DSLR for <b>video</b> <b>capture,</b> called HDSLR, is common, although HD camcorders remain popular due to their greater functionality (many chasers still shoot both).|$|E

2500|$|From {{the onset}} of {{computer}} video entertainment, video game players with access to screenshot capture software, <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> devices, and screen recording software have recorded themselves playing through games, often as part of walkthroughs, longplays, speedruns or other entertainment form. For example, the Japanese television program GameCenter CX had the host challenged to complete retro games within a single day, and others like Skip Rodgers had provided VHS tapes describing to players how to complete difficult games. One such form these took was the addition of running commentary, typically humorous in nature, along with the screenshots or videos; video-based playthroughs would typically be presented without significant editing to maintain the raw response the players had to the game. The presenter would also often poll the readers or viewers to certain in-game decisions as to provide an element of interactivity for longer games.
