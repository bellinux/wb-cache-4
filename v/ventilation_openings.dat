5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, <b>ventilation</b> <b>openings,</b> roof openings or cables.|$|E

In the greenhouses, air change coefficient must be more than 50 h- 1 in order to supply effective air ventilation. Temperature differences like air change coefficient can be regarded as a criterion to determine efficiency of ventilation in the greenhouses. In this study, the temperature values were calculated by using energy balance and Bernoulli equation at different <b>ventilation</b> <b>opening</b> ratios (AV/AG) depending on climatic properties in the Mediterranean region (Antalya).

ABSTRACT: In Ethiopia almost most greenhouses are equipped with fixed ventilation owing {{to the fact that}} its influence on CO 2 concentration, indoor temperature and RH % which affects plant growth is not clearly understood or due to lack of capacity. Particularly, relative humidity in the greenhouse not only affects plant growth but also major factor for pest-disease which should be maintained at the required range. In this study, the influences of fixed <b>ventilation</b> <b>opening</b> on indoor CO 2 concentration, temperature and relative humidity which consequently affect yield were investigated. To execute simulation and examine the influence of <b>ventilation</b> <b>opening</b> on indoor climate and yield a generic tool or a model set up in Matlab software was employed. For the existing ventilation configuration, simulation of indoor climate was conducted and the result illustrated that low CO 2 particularly during day time and high and low temperatures are major problems in the greenhouse. The observed indoor climate beyond the required range inhibits growth. The result of the sensitivity analysis for summer period showed that one percent increase in <b>ventilation</b> <b>opening</b> increases the CO 2 concentration by 0. 013 %, decreases canopy temperature and vapor concentration by 0. 065 % and 0. 114 % respectively and increases yield by 0. 328 %. During winter period, a percent increase in ventilation area resulted in 0. 036 % and 0. 075 % reduction in canopy temperature and vapor concentration respectively, 0. 012 % increased indoor CO...|$|R

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{concentration}} of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and formaldehyde emitted from building materials and furnishings, {{it has been suggested}} that new buildings undergo a bake-out.

For a practical use of bake-out, several ventilation strategies such as natural and mechanical ventilation can be considered. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of decreasing the concentration of indoor air pollutants according to ventilation strategies during a bake-out. For this purpose, four experimental cases were tested under different ventilation and heating conditions in a newly built apartment building using a radiant floor heating system in Korea.
