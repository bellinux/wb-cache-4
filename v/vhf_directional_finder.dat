50|$|During the Second World War, Telefunken was a {{supplier}} of vacuum tubes, transmitters and radio relay systems, and developed Funkmess facilities (later called radar devices by the US navy) and <b>directional</b> <b>finders,</b> adding extensively to the German air defence against British-American Aerial Bombing. During the war, manufacturing plants were shifted to and developed in west of Germany or relocated. Thus, Telefunken, under AEG, {{turned into the}} smaller subsidiary, with the three divisions realigning and data processing technology, elements as well as broadcast, television and phono. Telefunken was also the originator of the FM radio broadcast system. Telefunken, through the subsidiary company Teldec (a joint venture with Decca Records), was for many decades {{one of the largest}} German record companies, until Teldec was sold to WEA in 1988.|$|R

50|$|A 2m signal {{goes to a}} relay {{and then}} the signals are diplexed, with 2m and < going to a lo-pass filter. The signal gets diplexed again using a hi-pass filter, {{separating}} out the 2 m signal from the HF-6 meter signal path. The rx signal passes through the <b>VHF</b> <b>directional</b> coupler/power detector (not used in rx) to a lo-pass filter and then passes by 2 PIN diodes (both HSU277). These diodes and related components form T/R isolation switches that operate {{similar to that of}} the 70 cm front end. Rx signal passes through the half which is not used for 70 cm and then to the RX RF output and is then passes to the MAIN unit. Here the signal enters and then passes through a transformer, along with a varactor and related components and forms an electrically-tuned filter/matching network, the 2 meter preamplifier. The output of the preamplifier goes through 2 electronically tuned transistors. Finally, the output goes through to get to the rx mixer. For 2 m rx, the PIN diode bias is provided by the PA unit to 2 m preamplifier.|$|R
40|$|Lightning {{strike is}} a {{dangerous}} natural phenomenon that can cause various problems. Telecommunication subscriber lines (TSLs) and electrical power lines are two systems that are almost always affected by nearby lightning strikes. Voltages in the telecommunication subscriber line (TSL) do get induced by nearby lightning strikes. The induced voltage can be carefully measured and lightning parameters such as the lightning current wave shape, lightning peak current and strike locations be reproduced. Better designs of lightning protection systems can be realised if data on lightning strike distribution in a given region is known. Commercial lightning mapping or locating systems are based on several technologies (Araujo, 2001; Kenneth, 2003). The two most popular methods are those based on the Time of Arrival (ToA) and the <b>Directional</b> <b>Finder</b> (DF) principles. An example of the lightning locating system (LLS) based on the ToA method is the country- wide LLS owned by the Malaysian national power company (TNB). The system is capable of determining the coordinates of the cloud-to-ground lightning strikes within 500 m accuracy. However, for a localised distribution of lightning, say within 1 square km area, this accuracy is too large for the data to be meaningful...|$|R
5000|$|<b>VHF</b> Omni <b>Directional</b> Radio Range (VOR) {{is a type}} of {{short-range}} {{radio navigation}} system for aircraft, enabling aircraft with a receiving unit to determine their position and stay on course by receiving radio signals transmitted by a network of fixed ground radio beacons. It uses frequencies in the very high frequency (VHF) band from 108.00 to 117.95 MHz. Developed in the United States beginning in 1937 and deployed by 1946, VOR is the standard air navigational system in the world, [...] used by both commercial and general aviation. By 2000 there were about 3,000 VOR stations around the world including 1,033 in the US, reduced to 967 by 2013 with more stations being decommissioned with the widespread adoption of GPS.|$|R
40|$|Lightning mapping or {{lightning}} locating {{systems are}} based on several working principles such as the Time of Arrival and the <b>Directional</b> <b>Finder.</b> The country wide lightning locating system (LLS) operated by Tenaga Nasional Berhad Malaysia is able to determine the coordinate of the cloud-to-ground lightning strike with an uncertainty of about 500 m. The LLS is made of high performance sensors positioned throughout the country together with a central processing unit. An alternative method known as the localised lightning locating system (LLLS) is proposed to determine the coordinate of any cloud-to-ground lightning strike within a certain local region. The LLLS {{is based on the}} measurement of induced voltages due to lightning strikes in the vicinity of an existing overhead twisted telephone lines. The system consists of twisted pair overhead lines, induced voltage signal transducers, signal transmission cables, and a user friendly processing unit. The overhead lines have been constructed and laid in such a way to form a cartesian system suitable for lightning strike coordinate calculation with a total coverage area of 210 m x 270 m. The processing software which has been programmed in LabView is able to detect and plot the strike locations. Calibration results on the LLLS performance for one axis (y-axis) show less than 1 % error of coordinate position. The field measurements in the month of August 2008 showed a significant result of lightning strike activities. Comparing the lightning density detected by the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) and the LLLS for the same day, the LLLS has detected more lightning strikes than NLDN. This {{may be due to the}} inability of the LLLS to differentiate between valid cloud-ground discharges and other types of discharges. The developed LLLS can be used as an alternative measuring system to determine a lightning strike location within a small area with a better accuracy due to the small coverage area...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{is looking}} to develop {{alternative}} navigation means to global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and GPS. While the national airspace (NAS) includes many navigation systems such as distance measuring equipment (DME), <b>VHF</b> omni <b>directional</b> ranging (VOR), or non directional beacon (NDB), they are not capable to supporting the increased capabilities, capacity and efficient operations that GPS will provide. Thus {{it is important to}} examine, design and develop new alternatives capable of providing similar level of service and operational efficiencies as GPS. One idea is to develop alternatives based on existing or soon to be existing FAA systems and infrastructure. The paper details a preliminary study on using FAA infrastructure such as DME and ground based transceiver (GBT) as building blocks for a future system. The system is to be capable for providing navigation to support future needs of the NAS even in the event of GPS interference or outage...|$|R
40|$|Lightning strikes to {{man-made}} {{systems can}} include lightning strikes to telecommunication subscriber lines (TSLs) and electrical power lines, {{the two systems}} that are almost always affected by nearby lightning activities. Better designs of lightning protection systems can be realised if data on lightning strike distribution in a given region is known. Lightning mapping or locating systems can be based on several of technologies [1, 2]. The two most popular methods are those based on the Time of Arrival (ToA) and the <b>Directional</b> <b>Finder</b> (DF). The Malaysian wide lightning locating system (LLS) owned by TNB {{is known to be}} able to determine the coordinate of the cloudto-ground lightning strike within 500 m accuracy. In this chapter, we will propose a new method to determine the coordinate of any cloud-to-ground lightning strike within a certain local region with an improved accuracy of up to within 20 m. Although the covergae area of our new system is much smaller than the LLS, it can be used for specific local needs as well as to function as a calibrating system for the LLS. This new LLS is based on the measurement of induced voltages due to lightning strikes in the vicinity of an existing overhead telephone lines [3, 4, 5, and 6]. Many studies were done by several researchers in relation to the lightning induced voltages and their models. Diendorfer [7] numerically calculates the wave shape of the induced voltage on an overhead line due to nearby lightning return stroke by solving the transmission line equation using Agrawalâ€™s time domain approach [3]. The return strokeâ€™s vertical and horizontal electric fields were calculated using the travelling current source model. The same method is applied to calculate the induced current and voltage on the inner conductor of shielded cable [8]. Pokharel [9] studies the transient-induced voltages on a distribution line over finitely conducting ground. Using a different method, Piantini [10] studies the lightning induced voltages on overhead lines of power distribution systems using the scale model technique which are prohibitively complex to be treated theoretically. The contribution of the electromagnetic field components in field-to-transmission line interaction based on the transmission line approximation using three different equivalent formulations was studied by Nucci [11]. The effect of distances and height of TSL to lightning strike position was studied in [12] and the induced voltage in a complex TSL as well as a simplified wire model was studied in [13]. Other studies include the observation of lightning surges induced in a telecommunication building [14], the effect of strike locations along the telecommunication line on the amplitude and shape of the induced voltages [15], and the calculation of corresponding electromagnetic fields from known lightning sources [16]. The experimental approach to test the theory of lightning induced voltages on an overhead wire was carried out in [17, 18]. In this work, the time difference of arrival method is implemented in a localised lightning locating system, in particular, to calculate the lightning strike coordinate based on the lightning induced voltage timing information measured from a purposely installed telephone overhead lines...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} combining range data from both a set of sonar sensors {{as well as from}} a <b>directional</b> laser range <b>finder</b> to e#ciently take advantage of the characteristics of both types of devices when exploring and mapping unknown worlds. We call our approach "just in time sensing" because it uses the more accurate but constrained laser range sensor only as needed, based upon a preliminary interpretation of sonar data. In this respect, it resembles "just in time" inventory control which attempts to judiciously obtain materials for industrial manufacturing only when and as needed. Experiments with a mobile robot equipped with sonar and a laser rangefinder demonstrate that by judiciously using the more accurate but more complex laser rangefinder to deal with the well-known ambiguity which arises in sonar data, we are able to obtain a much better map of an interior space at little additional cost (in terms of time and computational expense) ...|$|R
40|$|Adult harbour seals at Froan nature reserve, Central Norway, were tagged with VHF radio tags and depthvelocity, hart {{rate and}} stomach {{temperature}} sensors combined with ultrasonic transmitters. An automatic shore based VHF station received and logged information on surfacing intervals, surface times, and haul out periods. VHF signals {{were used to}} locate seals, and when seals were located at sea they were tracked at dose proximity by inflatable boats with <b>directional</b> <b>VHF</b> receiver and hydrophones receiving ultrasonic transmitted behavioural and physiological data. A combination of VHF and depth-velocity data was {{used to describe the}} activity of seals as transit-, foraging-, and resting behaviour. Swimming speed of about 1. 1 - 1. 6 ml sec and dive duration of 3. 3 min (s. d. 1. 9) were typically recorded for transit and foraging dives. There {{was no significant difference in}} dive times of transit dives and foraging dives. However, the dive profiles were dearly different, showing V-shaped transit dives and U-shaped foraging dives. Each seal used one or a few resting sites where seals typically congregated. However, solitary haul outs were also recorded. Tracking free ranging seals at dose proximity, made it possible to identify and describe their resting, foraging and display areas. When foraging, all tagged harbour seals operated solitarily, and they returned repeatedly to the same or approximately the same foraging sites. The radio tagged seals used different types of foraging habitats, ranging from shallow offshore kelp beds to 150 - 200 deep basins with muddy sea floor located few hundred meters off the respective haul out sites. Harbour seal foraging trips of up to 20 km were recorded. Grey seals congregate at Froan in the breeding season. Towards the end of lactation, adult females were tagged with satellite linked transmitters. Shortly after end of lactation they dispersed and foraged at distances of up to 500 km from their breeding sites. After the first dispersal, grey seals settled (for an unknown period) and made repetitive short range trips at sea. These trips were interpreted as foraging movements. There was considerable overlap in the diet of harbour and grey seals in this area. Both seal species were foraging at or dose to the sea floor. However, herring was the dominant species in the diet of harbour seals, while gadoids were more important in grey seals...|$|R
