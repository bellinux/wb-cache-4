50|$|Available as a kei truck, it {{was based}} on the Honda TN360. The <b>Vamos</b> used <b>a</b> 354 cc 2-cylinder, mid mounted, air-cooled, {{overhead}} camshaft gasoline engine shared with the Honda TN360, N360, and the Z360. The <b>Vamos</b> was <b>a</b> competitor at the time to the Suzuki Jimny and the Daihatsu Fellow buggy. According to the article for this vehicle at Japanese Wikipedia, only 2,500 were sold. Honda had hoped the popularity of the Honda Dax minibike with its off-road image would be associated with the Vamos. Because of the installation of the spare tire {{on the front of the}} vehicle and the sound from the air-cooled engine, it had a Volkswagen Type 2 reputation but because of the open cabin design, it wasn't very popular due to a lack of four-wheel drive.|$|R
40|$|For most low {{orbiting}} earth {{observation satellite}} missions, the timeline is generated on- ground and during dedicated uplink sessions the corresponding tele-commands {{are sent to}} the spacecraft. Bene�ts of this approach are easy maintainability of the complex planning software and quick response times to customer input. However this approach has two major drawbacks: On the one hand the spacecraft behavior is not completely predictable in terms of constraining resources, which means that even detailed modeling requires margins for the on-board resources within the on-ground scheduling algorithms. On the other hand, the reaction time to onboard detected events includes at least the two upcoming ground station contacts, since data downlink and evaluation, (re-) planning and tele-command uplink have to be awaited before the spacecraft can perform new activities. This paper describes the �nal design and use cases of <b>VAMOS,</b> <b>an</b> experiment of DLR/GSOC, which {{will be part of}} the FireBird mission. <b>VAMOS</b> consists of <b>a</b> combined onboard / on-ground planning system, which resolves the above mentioned drawbacks by supplying limited onboard autonomy to the satellite, retaining the bene�ts of a ground based planning system as far as possible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Neutron {{monitors}} {{have reported}} {{the observation of}} a Forbush decrease on March 7, 2012. <b>VAMOS,</b> <b>an</b> engineering array built for the HAWC (High Altitude Water Cherenkov) Observatory, was operational at that time. This array was composed of six water Cherenkov detectors located at the HAWC site near the volcano Sierra Negra in Mexico. VAMOS had two data acquisition (DAQ) systems, one designed to readout full air shower events (Main DAQ) and the other designed to monitor the count rates of the individual PMTs (Scaler DAQ). We have analyzed data from both the Main DAQ and the Scaler DAQ systems. We present a comparison between the observation of this transient event in VAMOS and neutron monitor detectors located in Mexico City and the South Pole. We also describe the necessary corrections in the count rates due to atmospheric effects...|$|R

The {{main goal}} of this dissertation is to prove the Bott periodicity theorem in the complex K-theory. Accordingly, we will develop the vector bundle theory and we will define the K-theory groups {{of a pair of}} compact spaces. Furthermore, we will prove that K-theory is a generalized cohomology theory. As a consequence, {{we will be able to}} define the ring K*(X) ...|$|R
