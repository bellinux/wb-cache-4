40|$|An {{efficient}} Nyström {{scheme is}} developed for solving three-dimensional (3 D) electromagnetic (EM) problems by volume integral equations (<b>VIEs).</b> Although the surface integral equations (SIEs) are preferred whenever available, the <b>VIEs</b> {{are important and}} indispensable in the integral equation methods when the problems involve inho-mogeneous media. Currently, the <b>VIEs</b> are usually solved by the method of moments (MoM) and the Nyström method as a good alternative for the MoM has not receive sufficient attention in the <b>VIEs.</b> In this work, we present an efficient Nyström scheme for 3 D <b>VIEs</b> based on a robust local correction method. The local correction method first interpolates the unknown function based on the quadrature points in the tetrahedral elements with self or near interactions, and then derives the solutions of the resulting hypersingular integrals from singularity subtraction in the Cauchy-principle- value (CPV) sense. Numerical examples for EM scattering by 3 D penetrable objects are used to demonstrate the scheme. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Therefore, <b>VIEs</b> can be voluntary to an importing country. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{develops}} {{an efficient}} solver based on collocation points for solving numerically {{a system of}} linear Volterra integral equations (<b>VIEs)</b> with variable coefficients. By using the Euler polynomials and the collocation points, this method transforms the system of linear <b>VIEs</b> into the matrix equation. The matrix equation corresponds {{to a system of}} linear equations with the unknown Euler coefficients. A small number of Euler polynomials is needed to obtain a satisfactory result. Numerical results with comparisons are given to confirm the reliability of the proposed method for solving <b>VIEs</b> with variable coefficients...|$|R
