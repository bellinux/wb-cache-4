40|$|Abstract: A novel polymer microarrays {{fabrication}} {{technique is}} presented, {{and applied to}} the realization of {{a new type of}} biochip for cellulomics purposes. The proposed microfabrication technique is optimized for production cost reduction when small series (100 to 10000 chip series) are needed, which is the case when the actual market of cellulomic is considered. As a demonstration, a biochip for highly parallelized transfection of arrays of living cells was realized, and the feasibility of parallel lipofection on this biochip was demonstrated. Two different plasmids encoding respectively eGFP and DsRED 2 were inserted into HEK 293 T cells. The transfection was monitored through fluorescence observation after 72 hours. Successful expression of both genes was observed. The proposed microfabrication technique is derivated from a macroscale rapid prototyping technique called <b>vacuum</b> <b>casting.</b> The master <b>part</b> is here performed through combining microfabrication technologies and rapid prototyping technologies. The corresponding three-dimensional female structure, combining micro and macro-size features is molded in a flexible silicone-material.
