40|$|Abstract. Compact <b>vacuum</b> <b>devices</b> {{of output}} power even at 1 W and at {{terahertz}} (THz) frequencies above 100 GHz offer enormous applications for wide band communication, imaging radars, and spectroscopy. These active <b>vacuum</b> <b>devices</b> are also required in many more unexplored areas of scientific, industrial and medical applications. Such <b>vacuum</b> <b>devices</b> at frequency above 100 GHz {{are very small}} in dimension and microelectronic technology is needed for their fabrication. Successful development of THz <b>vacuum</b> microelectronic <b>devices</b> therefore needs fusion of vacuum tube technology with the semi-conductor technology. Significant efforts are being carried out worldwide to develop successfully such compact <b>vacuum</b> <b>devices</b> using available LIGA and DRIE semiconductor technologies. This paper presents some details on THz <b>vacuum</b> microelectronic <b>devices.</b> Initially <b>vacuum</b> <b>devices</b> were developed {{in the form of}} diode, triode, tetrode, pentode, that are being used as high power amplifiers and oscillators at low RF frequency.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the impressive advances in somatic research of erectile dysfunction (ED), scientific literature shows contradictory reports {{on the results of}} psychotherapy for the treatment of ED. Authors conducted a meta-analysis {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} psychological interventions for the treatment of ED compared to oral drugs, local injection, <b>vacuum</b> <b>devices,</b> or other psychological intervention. Distinct sources of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched: electronic databases (between 1966 and 2007), cross checking of references, and contact with scientific societies. For dichotomous outcomes the pooled relative risks were calculated and for continuous outcomes mean differences between interventions. Statistical heterogeneity was addressed. Eleven RCTs involving 398 men met the inclusion criteria. There is evidence that group therapy improves ED. Focused sex group therapy showed greater efficacy than control group. Men randomized to receive psychotherapy plus sildenafil showed significant improvement of ED and were less likely than those receiving only sildenafil to drop out.
