50|$|The {{imperial}} <b>venus</b> <b>clam,</b> Chione latilirata, is a bivalve mollusc in {{the family}} Veneridae.

5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi lives {{predominantly}} on muddy bottoms, {{where it}} is a predator of bivalve molluscs. In its native environment, it hides among colonies of polychaetes to avoid being preyed on by the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. It is an important predator of the quahog, Mercenaria mercenaria, in Narragansett Bay, and of the barnacle Balanus improvisus in Delaware Bay. In the Adriatic Sea, {{it has been observed}} to feed on the striped <b>venus</b> <b>clam,</b> Chamelea gallina, and the introduced Asian date mussel, Musculista senhousia.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Venus</b> <b>clam,</b> Cyclina sinensis, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bivalves in China. In recent years, increasing expansive morbidity has occurred in breeding areas, imposing significant losses on the national economy. To understand the molecular mechanisms of immune-related genes, we analyzed and sequenced hemolymph samples that were injected with two pathogenic microorganisms using the Illumina Miseq system. After trimming, more than 12 M PE reads with an average length greater than 410 bp were assembled into 70, 079 transcripts with a mean length of 980 bp. Using a homology analysis, 102 (135 transcripts) potentially immune-related genes were identified, and most of them exhibited a similar pattern in both samples. These data indicated that the response of the clam to both types of bacterial infection might follow a similar molecular mechanism. Using the TreeFam method, 9, 904 gene families and 1, 031 unique families of the clam were preliminarily classified in comparison to five related species. A significant number of SSRs were identified, which could facilitate the identification of polymorphisms in <b>Venus</b> <b>clam</b> populations. These datasets will improve our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms driving the immune response to bacterial infection in clam populations and will provide basic data about clam breeding and disease control...|$|R
50|$|Characteristics of the La Jolla Complex include handstones and basin or slab millingstones (manos and metates), rough percussion-flaked stone edge tools, flexed burials, and {{extensive}} exploitation of shellfish, particularly <b>venus</b> <b>clam</b> (Chione spp.), scallop (Argopecten aequisulcatus), mussel (Mytilus californianus), and oyster (Ostrea lurida). Cogged stones and discoidals are distinctive but unusual artifacts. Other uncommon artifacts include shell ornaments (primarily spire-removed Olivella spp. beads) and projectile points (Pinto, Gypsum, and Elko forms). Bones from sea mammals and fish occur in La Jollan middens, {{but they are}} not abundant. Fish remains usually represent near-shore species, pointing to a littoral rather than maritime economy.|$|R

The clam reached a length of 24. 4, 31. 9 and 37. 7 mm at the end of 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd year of its life.

40|$|Given the {{ecological}} and economic importance of bivalve molluscs, {{the evaluation of}} their welfare {{is one of the}} primary aims for both biologists and people working in shell fishing. After a three year-long period monitoring the cytotoxic activity exerted by the hemolymph from the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, we have concluded that cytotoxicity represents a useful parameter to evaluate the status of the immune activity and therefore the health of mussels in a specific period of the year. During 2007, we compared the mussel cytoxicity with that of the <b>Venus</b> <b>clam</b> Chamelea gallina from contiguous areas of the Northern Adriatic Sea. Our observations indicate that the cytotoxicity of the hemolymph of the two species follows a similar course during the year, suggesting that cytotoxic activity is primarily determined by the life/reproductive cycles...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to describe morphological variations and enzyme polymorphism inthe Ribbed <b>Venus</b> <b>Clam</b> Gafrarium tumidum from five marine coastal locations in Mindanao, Philippines. Thirteen morphological characters and two enzymes were evaluated following standard methods ofmorphological measurements and enzyme pattern analysis. Results show variations in selectedmorphological characters and in the two enzyme loci among the populations examined. Enzymepolymorphism and the high heterozygosity in the populations examined can be attributed to theexternal fertilization and extended dispersal of planktonic larvae of this bivalve species. Factors such asheterozygote advantage during larval life, and the minimal effects if any of human exploitation canalso be considered to explain the high heterozygote frequencies. Since only a few loci wereinvestigated, it was postulated that the results may be different if a higher number of loci would beincluded in the evaluation of genetic variation in this species...|$|R
