Scully defends Skinner to the Office of Professional Responsibility, but it does no good and he is fired. Mulder {{believes}} this was done to weaken the X-Files. Mulder, {{with the help of}} Agent Pendrell finds a face imprint in the airbag which is not Skinner's. He goes to see the prostitute's boss again but discovers that she has been murdered. The agents hope to use Judy, an employee who saw the man who actually hired the prostitute and use her to set up another meeting with him. They agree to meet at the Ambassador Hotel in an hour. Skinner goes to see his wife, telling her why he could not sign the divorce papers. An alarm on Sharon's <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> monitor starts sounding, but as Skinner is about to run for help, the old woman once again takes the place of Sharon, beckoning him to come closer. As Skinner leans in, he sees his wife again, now awakened from the coma; she says something inaudible to him.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{injury is}} a major issue for firefighters as they wear {{insulated}} clothing and cannot shed the heat generated from physical exertion. Early detection of heat issues is critical to stop dehydration and heat stress becoming fatal. Early onset of heat stress affects cognitive function which combined with operating in dangerous environment makes heat stress and dehydration a critical issue to monitor. Firefighter physiological status monitoring is showing promise in alerting EMS and commanders {{to the status of}} their people on the fire ground. Devices such as PASS device alert 10–20 seconds after a firefighter has stopped moving in a structure. Physiological status monitors measure a firefighter's <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> status, fatigue and exertion levels and transmit this information over their voice radio. This technology allows a degree of early warning to physiological stress. These devices are similar to technology developed for Future Force Warrior and give a measure of exertion and fatigue. They also tell the people outside a building when they have stopped moving or fallen. This allows a supervisor to call in additional engines before the crew get exhausted and also gives an early warning to firefighters before they run out of air, as {{they may not be able}} to make voice calls over their radio. Current OSHA tables exist for heat injury and the allowable amount of work in a given environment based on temperature, humidity and solar loading.|$|E

The port has gone through several expensive projects throughout its history, and many have been seen as beneficial to the economic growth of the Greater Miami area in the long run, such as in the 1950s when the deteriorating Port of Miami, then located in the mainland in downtown, was moved to its current home, the man-made Dodge Island. The current port director of the Port of Miami Bill Johnson states that these new port infrastructure projects should be able to double the port's container capacity over the next decade. Miami City Commissioner Marc Sarnoff stated that [...] "This is the best public works project ever."

40|$|Aim: {{to examine}} and explore factors that may {{influence}} the recording of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> in adult patients within the initial 15 min and again within 60 min of arrival in the “resuscitation” and “major” areas of the emergency department (ED). Methods: a retrospective analysis of recording of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> was performed on 400 consecutive sets of notes from adult patients presenting to the “major” or “resuscitation” areas of a district general hospital ED. The effect of staffing levels, triage category and attendances on the recording of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> was examined using logistic regression. The main outcome measures were the proportion of patients with all <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> recorded within 15 min of arrival, the proportion of patients with all <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> repeated within 60 min of arrival and the outcomes of logistic regression analysis. Results: only 223 / 387 patients (58 %) had all <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> recorded within 15 min of arrival and only 29 / 387 (7 %) had all <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> repeated at 60 min. There was {{a significant relationship between}} the failure to record <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> and lower triage categories. There was no evidence that staffing levels or number of attendances predicted the recording of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> within 15 min of arrival. Conclusion: recording of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> was poor and unrelated to staffing levels or numbers of patients attending the ED. Failure to record patients’ <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> undermines strategies to detect and manage ill patients. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To {{document}} {{the relationship between}} triage <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> and in-hospital mortality among emergency department (ED) patients with acute poisoning. Methods Poisoning patients who admitted to our emergency department {{during the study period}} were enrolled. Patient’s demographic data were collected and odds ratios (OR) of triage <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> to in-hospital mortality were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the proper cut-off value of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> that predict in-hospital mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed to test the association of in-hospital mortality and <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> after adjusting for different variables. Results 997 acute poisoning patients were enrolled, with 70 fatal cases (6. 7 %). A J-shaped relationship was found between triage <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> and in-hospital mortality.

2500|$|The Penguin Social History of Britain {{noted that}} [...] "by the 1920s {{newspapers}} {{were filled with}} advertisements for 'lingerie' and 'undies' {{which would have been}} classed as indecent a generation earlier". Thus, in Ben Travers' comic novel Rookery Nook (1923), a young woman evicted from home in her nightwear and requiring day clothes remarked, [...] "Combies. That's all right. But in the summer you know, we don't ...", while in Agatha Christie's thriller, The Seven Dials Mystery (1929), the aristocratic heroine, Lady [...] "Bundle" [...] Brent, wore only [...] "a negligible trifle" [...] under her dress; like many real life [...] "it girls" [...] of her class, she had been freed from the [...] "genteel expectations" [...] of earlier generations. In Hollywood the actress Carole Lombard, who, in the 1930s, combined feistiness with sexual allure, never wore a brassière and [...] "avoided panties". However, she famously declared that though [...] "I live by a man's code designed to fit a man's world ... at the same time I never forget that a woman's first job is to choose the right shade of lipstick" [...] Coincidentally, sales of men's undershirts fell dramatically in the United States when Lombard's future husband, Clark Gable, was revealed not to be wearing one in a famous motel bedroom scene with Claudette Colbert in the film It Happened One Night (1934). According to Gable, [...] "the idea was looking half-naked and scaring the brat into her own bed {{on the other side of}} the blanket [...] ". However, he [...] "gave the impression that going without was a <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> of a man's virility" [...] More generally, the adoption by the American movie industry of the Hays Production Code in the early 1930s had a significant effect on how moral, and especially sexual, issues were depicted on film. This included a more conservative approach to matters of dress. Whereas the sort of scanty lingerie on show in some earlier productions (for example, Joan Blondell and Barbara Stanwyck in Night Nurse, 1931) had tended to reflect trends that, in the 1920s, defied convention and were regarded many young women as liberating, by the early years of the Depression such displays came to be regarded quite widely as undesirable. Developments in the late 1960s and 70s, when the strictures of the code were abandoned, followed a similar pattern, although, by then, it was often women themselves who were in the vanguard of resistance to sexualised imagery.|$|E

Deep {{accidental}} hypothermia with {{core temperature}} below 24 °C presenting with <b>vital</b> <b>signs.</b> High Alt Med Biol. 15 : 58 - 63, 2014. -Background: According to the Swiss hypothermia clinical staging, patients with stage III are unconscious with preserved <b>vital</b> <b>signs,</b> with core temperature usually between 24 ° and 28 °C. With stage IV, <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> are absent with core temperature < 24 °C. Aims: To describe a patient presenting with HT stage III with <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> but a core temperature of < 24 °C, and {{to search for}} similar patients in the medical literature. Materials and methods: MEDLINE was used to search for cases of deep accidental hypothermia (< 24 °C) and preserved <b>vital</b> <b>signs.</b> Results: We found 22 cases in addition to our case (n= 23). Median age was 44 years (IQR 36; range 4 - 83) and median core temperature 22 °C (IQR 1. 7; 17 - 23. 8). <b>Vital</b> <b>signs</b> were often minimal. Seven patients developed ventricular fibrillation (VF). Twenty patients survived with excellent neurological outcome. Conclusions: <b>Vital</b> <b>signs</b> can be present in hypothermic patients with core temperature < 24 °C.

Objective: To establish a profile of nurses' <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> monitoring practices, related dialogue, and adherence to health service protocol in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Direct observations of nurses' working practices were conducted in two wards. The observations focused on times of the day when <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> were generally measured. Patient interactions were recorded if occurring any time during the observation periods. Participants (n = 42) included nursing staff on one chronic disease medical and one acute surgical ward in a large urban teaching hospital in New South Wales. Results: We observed 441 patient interactions. Measurement of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> occurred in 52 % of interactions. The minimum five <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> measures required by New South Wales Health policy were taken in only 6 – 21 % of instances of <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> monitoring. <b>Vital</b> <b>signs</b> were documented immediately on 93 % of vitals-taking occasions and documented according to the policy in the patient's chart on 89 % of these occasions. Nurse–patient interactions were initiated for the purpose of taking <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> in 49 % of interactions, with nurse–patient discourse observed during 88 % of all interactions. Nurse–patient dialogue led to additional care being provided to patients in 12 % of interactions.
