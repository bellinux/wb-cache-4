40|$|It is {{important}} to consider the physiological and behavioral mechanisms that allow users to physically interact with virtual environments. Inspired by a neuroanatomical model of perception and action known as the two <b>visual</b> <b>systems</b> hypothesis, we conducted a study with two controlled experiments to compare four different kinds of spatial interaction: (1) voice-based input, (2) pointing with a visual cursor, (3) pointing without a visual cursor, and (4) pointing with a time-lagged visual cursor. Consistent with the two <b>visual</b> <b>systems</b> hypothesis, we found that voice-based input and pointing with a cursor were less robust to a display illusion known as the induced Roelofs Effect than pointing without a cursor or even pointing with a lagged cursor. The implications of these findings are discussed, with an emphasis on how the two <b>visual</b> <b>systems</b> model can be used to understand the basis for voice and gestural interactions that support spatial target selection in large-screen and immersive environments.

5|$|Path {{integration}} in mammals {{makes use of}} the vestibular organs, which detect accelerations in the three dimensions, together with motor efference, where the motor system tells {{the rest of the}} brain which movements were commanded, and optic flow, where the <b>visual</b> <b>system</b> signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes. Information from other senses such as echolocation and magnetoreception may also be integrated in certain animals. The hippocampus is {{the part of the brain}} that integrates linear and angular motion to encode a mammal's relative position in space.|$|E
5|$|Visual Impairment – Athletes {{with visual}} {{impairment}} ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. This includes impairment {{of one or more}} component of the <b>visual</b> <b>system</b> (eye structure, receptors, optic nerve pathway, and visual cortex). The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete {{with visual impairment}} and the guide are considered a team. Beginning in 2012, these guides (along with sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football became eligible to receive medals of their own.|$|E
5|$|The {{nervous system}} is large {{relative}} to the bird's size. The most developed {{part of the brain}} is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis, New World vultures and tubenoses. The avian <b>visual</b> <b>system</b> is usually highly developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual fovea. Birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>visual</b> <b>systems</b> is constrained by a trade-off between {{spatial and temporal}} resolution. In this paper we aim at identifying {{the causes of the}} trade-off at the retinal level in both artificial and natural <b>visual</b> <b>systems.</b> We start by selecting two factors that limit the values of spatial and temporal resolution. Then we show in two experiments on the {{evolution of}} an artificial system that the two factors induce trade-off curves connecting the evolved values of spatial and temporal resolution. A comparison of the experimental results with the resolution evolved in natural <b>visual</b> <b>systems</b> leads us to the conclusion that in natural systems the same factors are responsible for the observed trade-off...|$|R

5|$|With its slender, lithe body, the whitetip reef shark {{specializes in}} wriggling into narrow crevices and {{holes in the}} reef and extracting prey {{inaccessible}} to other reef sharks. Alternatively, it is rather clumsy when attempting to take food suspended in open water. This species feeds mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and goatfishes, as well as octopuses, spiny lobsters, and crabs. The whitetip reef shark is highly responsive to the olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey, while its <b>visual</b> <b>system</b> is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency sounds in the 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish.|$|E
5|$|An active {{predator}} of mobile, {{relatively large}} organisms, the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, orange roughy, lantern fishes, and rattails). It {{has also been}} known to take other sharks and invertebrates (such as the medusa Atolla wyvillei), as well as scavenging from whale carcasses. The Portuguese dogfish has more acute vision than many other deepsea sharks: {{in addition to having}} a large pupil and lens, and a tapetum lucidum, its eyes also contain a high concentration of ganglion cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the horizontal plane. The <b>visual</b> <b>system</b> of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence: the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey, such as the squids Heteroteuthis dispar, Histioteuthis spp., Lycoteuthis lorigera, and Taningia danae.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, BLM {{said it would}} reduce the herd from its {{existing}} 195 adults to 120. The stated goal was to temporarily remove horses from the refuge to allow the range {{to recover from the}} historic overgrazing caused by livestock, not because BLM believed there were too many horses on the range. Sixty percent of the remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth. The agency said it would remove 30 horses a year from the herd and stable them at a yearly cost of $18,000 to $21,000 until the correct herd size and sex ratios had been reached. Horses to be removed from the herd included those which did not closely fit the conformity type; which were genetically well represented; which were 11 to 15 years of age, had sired or foaled, and were not band stallions; and were between five and 10 years of age or 16 to 20 years of age. Genetic diversity would be measured by visual observation of the herd's conformity to type using a <b>visual</b> <b>system</b> developed by Dr. Sponenberg, and measures taken to improve genetic diversity if signs of inbreeding occurred. The Cloud Foundation and Front Range Equine Rescue, both feral horse advocacy groups, challenged the roundup in federal court. A federal district court judge delayed the roundup three days to consider their request, but on September 2, 2009, rejected the injunction and allowed the roundup to proceed.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{is primarily}} a visual hunter; experiments in nature show that they strike at fish-shaped targets without any electrical, chemical, vibrational, or behavioral cues. At night, they are guided by the bioluminescence of planktonic dinoflagellates and ostracods disturbed by moving prey. This species' <b>visual</b> <b>system</b> is attuned to the wavelengths of light emitted by these planktonic organisms, showing the importance of night hunting. Pacific angelsharks {{are more likely to}} strike at prey approaching from the front. It usually waits until the prey approaches to , as its attack is less accurate beyond this distance. The strike is a stereotyped behavior in which the shark presses the forward lobes of its pectoral fins against the bottom and thrusts its head upwards at up to a 90° angle. Its mouth forms a tube when opened, creating a suction force, while its jaws protude forward to secure the prey between sharp teeth. During the strike, the eyes roll backward into the head for protection. The strike is often completed in under a tenth of a second.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the <b>visual</b> <b>system,</b> for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{statistics}} of natural images. The first question {{that is to be}} answered is: what are natural images and why do we study them. We start with our definition, and then discuss the properties and uses of natural images. An image is a projection of an environment, and natural images are those that are taken from a natural environment, i. e., an environment that is commonly encountered by a particular organism. This means that these images represent the natural visual input (natural stimulus) of an eye. In general, images may include optical information extending over space, time (time-varying images), as well as wavelength (colour images). In this thesis, however, we restrict ourselves to images of light intensity (black and white images) that either extend exclusively over space (still images) or exclusively over time (time series). The motivation for investigating natural images is {{to gain a better understanding}} of neural processing in <b>visual</b> <b>systems.</b> Natural images and visual processing in biological systems are linked by the hypothesis that evolution has optimised <b>visual</b> <b>systems</b> to process natural stimuli. The analysis of the optimal performance of biological <b>visual</b> <b>systems</b> may inspire the building of artificial <b>visual</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
