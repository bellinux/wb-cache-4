5|$|Unlike {{most other}} episodes, the scenes which {{featured}} multiple clones were filmed using traditional locked-off cameras {{rather than the}} time-consuming Technodolly camera set-up. The episode featured the longest continuous shot filmed in Orphan Black, where a scene between Felix, Tony and Sarah was filmed in one take. It took almost three days to film the 15-second sequence of Scott drilling into Kira's tooth, involving three rented cameras and a prop tooth that was painted red inside and filled with white dust to achieve the desired effect when drilled into. The scene in which Cosima and Delphine use a <b>vaporiser</b> to get high was mostly improvised by Maslany and Brochu; instead of inhaling actual helium, the pitch of their voices was altered in post-production. A stunt double {{was used for the}} second-to-last scene, wherein Cosima falls to the ground after vomiting blood.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days, the gas was {{administered}} through simple inhalers {{consisting of a}} breathing bag made of rubber cloth. Today, the gas is administered in hospitals {{by means of an}} automated relative analgesia machine, with an anaesthetic <b>vaporiser</b> and a medical ventilator, that delivers a precisely dosed and breath-actuated flow of nitrous oxide mixed with oxygen in a 2:1 ratio.|$|E
25|$|An inhalational {{anaesthetic}} is {{a chemical}} compound possessing general anaesthetic properties {{that can be}} delivered via inhalation. They are administered by anaesthetists (a term which includes anaesthesiologists, nurse anaesthetists, and anaesthesiologist assistants) through an anaesthesia mask, laryngeal mask airway or tracheal tube connected to an anaesthetic <b>vaporiser</b> and an anaesthetic delivery system. Agents of significant contemporary clinical interest include volatile anaesthetic agents such as isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane, and anaesthetic gases such as nitrous oxide and xenon.|$|E

50|$|A new 1,275MW plant {{consisting}} of three natural gas-fired units capable of generating enough electricity to supply around one million homes has been constructed {{on the site}} {{at a cost of}} £500m. The power station is able to transfer up to 340MW of heat energy recovered from the steam condensation to run the <b>vaporisers</b> in the nearby Liquefied natural gas Terminal, allowing for a reduction in carbon emissions of up to 350,000 tonnes a year.|$|R
25|$|Clover's {{chloroform}} apparatus {{was invented}} in 1862. Chloroform, being much more potent than ether, was much easier to give in overdose. At {{a time when the}} anaesthetist was often an untrained assistant, many deaths occurred through accidental overdose. Clover's solution was a large reservoir bag of known capacity, lined with goldbeater's skin to make it airtight, into which a measured volume of chloroform liquid was placed. Inflating the bag to its capacity with a bellows provided a known, accurate and constant concentration of chloroform vapour in air, making delivery safer and more controllable. A <b>vaporiser</b> was no longer necessary, but the bag was large and cumbersome.|$|E
50|$|In 1926 he {{developed}} an improved {{version of the}} carburettor named the Godward <b>Vaporiser.</b> The <b>Vaporiser</b> enabled motor vehicles to use fuel oil instead of petrol. The Mitten Company of Philadelphia, {{one of the largest}} public transport operators in the United States, adopted the invention. Some 580 buses and 3000 taxis were fitted with the <b>vaporiser.</b> It was said to increase horsepower by 15%.|$|E

50|$|Marijuana iscommonly smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes, pipes, {{or water}} pipes (bongs),however {{it can be}} used in <b>vaporisers,</b> turnedinto a tea, or used as an {{ingredient}} in foods as an edible. The THC in marijuana is responsible forchanging how the brain works, by distorting how the mind perceives the worldand making the heart beat faster. In particular marijuana is used to heighten perception, affect mood, and feelrelaxed: it alters senses, sense of time, changes in mood, impaired bodymovement (coordination), difficultly in thinking (judgment), and impairedmemory.|$|R
50|$|Other gases or vapors {{which produce}} general {{anaesthesia}} by inhalation include nitrous oxide, cyclopropane and xenon. These {{are stored in}} gas cylinders and administered using flowmeters, rather than <b>vaporisers.</b> Cyclopropane is explosive {{and is no longer}} used for safety reasons, although otherwise it was found to be an excellent anaesthetic. Xenon is odourless and rapid in onset, but is expensive and requires specialized equipment to administer and monitor. Nitrous oxide, even at 80% concentration, does not quite produce surgical level anaesthesia in most persons at standard atmospheric pressure, so it must be used as an adjunct anaesthetic, along with other agents.|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{cigarettes}} (e-cigarettes) are <b>vaporisers</b> of liquids often containing nicotine. In the inhaled aerosol carcinogens, ultrafine {{and metal}} particles are detected usually in concentrations below those measured in tobacco smoke. Therefore, {{these products are}} expected to be less harmful. This has not yet been proven. The long-term safety of e-cigarettes is unknown. Short duration use leads to airway irritation and increased diastolic blood pressure. So far only two randomised controlled trials have investigated efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation: No clear advantage was shown in comparison to smoking cessation medication. Due to insufficient evidence, e-cigarettes cannot be recommended for smoking cessation. Problematic are the lack of regulation and standardisation of e-cigarette products, which makes general conclusions impossible...|$|R

50|$|Körting engines (initially {{paraffin}} {{engines and}} later diesel engines) were used extensively in early German submarines. The 6 cylinder 2-stroke submarine engine was reviewed in The Engineer magazine in August 1906. This utilised crankcase compression, with the piston controlling all the ports. It {{was referred to}} as using petroleum, though this was almost certainly the less volatile peraffin/kerosene type, as it had exhaust heaters for the carburetors, and electric pre-heating of both cylinders and <b>vaporisers,</b> with the engine being turned over for some time by electrical power before being put to work. This allowing the engine to be started after 5 minutes. The engine was rated at 200bhp at 500rpm, and two were installed per submarine.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the earlier}} single {{cylinder}} tractor made by Hornsby, {{this was a}} twin cylinder, with the cylinders {{at an angle to}} each other in a vertical plane and sharing a common crankshaft. The engine ran at 350 rpm and had a governor which operated by cutting the fuel supply in a hit and miss method, though the driver could override the governor for [...] "spurts". The framing was of conventional steam traction engine type, with rear wheels 7 foot diameter, the front wheels 42 inches diameter. The cylinders were each 13 inch diameter and 18 inch stroke. Starting was by compressed air after pre-heating the <b>vaporisers</b> with bunsen torches. Sliding spur gears offered forward speeds of 1.5, 3, 5 and 8 mph, and a reverse.|$|R
40|$|Sevoflurane is a non-pungent {{volatile}} {{anaesthetic agent}} {{with a low}} blood-gas solubility coefficient. It has been studied in concentrations of up to 8 % for induction of anaesthesia. Previous work has suggested {{that there may be}} a ceiling effect with increasing concentration of sevoflurane above 6 %, but there are no published studies using 12 % sevoflurane. This study compared 8 and 12 % sevoflurane to induce anaesthesia in adults. Sevoflurane was administered using two adapted datum <b>vaporisers</b> with the interlock removed. Induction with 12 % sevoflurane compared to 8 % sevoflurane produced a significant decrease in the time to achieve central pupils, corresponding to surgical anaesthesia and the third part of Guedel's stage 3 of anaesthesia (mean time (SD) 201 s (81) and 247 s (39), respectively, p < 0. 05). Twelve-percent sevoflurane produced a similar stable cardiovascular profile to 8 % sevoflurane, and there was no increase in respiratory complications...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND In {{developing}} country like India with limited resources {{we need to}} find ways and means of cutting the anaesthetic cost without compromising safety of patient. With the availability of various intravenous analgesics and sedatives drugs safe anaesthesia can be delivered without the use of costly volatile agents and <b>vaporisers.</b> METHODS 90 Adult diabetic and/or hypertensive patients were divided into three groups of 30 each. Group I patients received inj. Morphine followed by Midazolam. Group II patients received inj. Diazepam followed by Buprenorphine. Group III patients were induced with inj. Fentanyl followed by Thiopentone sodium while maintenance of anaesthesia was achieved using halothane. Hemodynamic parameters, induction and awakening time, postoperative analgesia, and cost were statistically analyzed. RESULTS Hemodynamic parameters showed no significant fluctuations and stayed within the acceptable sinus range in all three groups. Induction time was short but awakening time was longer in group III as compared to other two groups. Postoperative analgesia was longest in group II and this group was cost effective too. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is {{difficult}} to design a system to reliably deliver volatile anaesthetics such as halothane or isoflurane to in vitro preparations such as tissues or cells cultures: the very volatility of the drugs means that they can rapidly dissipate from even carefully-prepared solutions. Furthermore, many experiments require the control of other gases (such as oxygen or carbon dioxide) which requires constant perfusion. New method: We describe a constant perfusion system that is air-tight (i. e., allows the accurate administration of hypoxic or hypercapnic gas mixtures), in which volatile anaesthetic is delivered via calibrated <b>vaporisers</b> by constant bubbling into the perfusing solution (and continuously monitored for stability by infrared spectroscopy in the headspace above the solution). Results: We have confirmed the accuracy (i. e., linear relationship of dissolved concentrations with vapour dial settings) and stability (i. e., over time) of the anaesthetic concentrations in solutions in samples taken from the bottles into which anaesthetic is bubbled, and from samples taken from the tissue perfusion bath, using gas chromatrography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Conclusions: It is possible to deliver volatile anaesthetics in accurate concentrations to cell/tissue preparations whilst adjusting ambient air composition rapidly, stable over sustained time periods...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundNon-specific cough {{has been}} defined as {{non-productive}} cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology and is common in childhood. These children are treated with a variety of therapies, including non-pharmacological treatments. There is a wide variety and a growing market for these non-pharmacological treatments that include air-modification modalities. ObjectivesTo determine the efficacy of air-modification modalities, (ionisers, <b>vaporisers,</b> humidifiers, air filters, regular vacuuming), in treating children with non-specific cough. Search methodsThe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group. The latest searches were performed in November 2008. Selection criteriaAll randomised controlled trials comparing air-modification modalities with a placebo treatment, for any duration. Data collection and analysisResults of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. Five papers were considered for inclusion but no eligible trials were identified and thus no data was available for analysis. Main resultsNo randomised controlled trials that examined the efficacy of air-modification modalities in the management of prolonged, non-specific cough in children were found. Authors 2 ̆ 7 conclusionsBased on the evidence currently available, a recommendation can not be given for air-modification interventions in the treatment of prolonged, non-specific cough in children...|$|R

40|$|Users of e-cigarettes are unwitting volunteers {{participating}} in a worldwide epidemiological study. Because of the obvious benefits of e-cigarettes compared with traditional cigarette smoking, these electronic devices have been introduced {{all around the world}} to support tobacco smoking cessation. Same potential harm reduction could be considered by cannabis vaping for marijuana smokers. However, the toxicities of liquids and aerosols remain under investigation because although the use of e-cigarettes is likely to be less harmful than traditional cigarette smoking, trace levels of contaminants have been identified. Simultaneously, other electronic devices, such as e-vaporisers, e-hookahs or e-pipes, have been developed and commercialised. Consequently, misuse of electronic devices has increased, and experimentation has been documented on Internet web fora. Although legal and illegal drugs are currently consumed with these e-devices, no scientific papers are available to support the observations reported by numerous media and web fora. Moreover, building on illegal drug vaping and vaporisation with e-devices (vaping misuse), legal drug vaping (an alternative use of vaping) could present therapeutic benefits, as occurs with medical cannabis vaporisation with table <b>vaporisers.</b> This review seeks to synthesise the problems of e-cigarette and liquid refill toxicity in order to introduce the dangers of illegal and legal drugs consumed using vaping and vaporisation for recreational purposes, and finally, to present the potential therapeutic benefits of vaping as a new administration route for legal drugs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe use of {{electronic}} cigarettes (e-cigarettes), {{also known as}} personal <b>vaporisers</b> (PVs), has increased rapidly in Australia despite legal barriers to the sale, possession and use of nicotine for non-therapeutic purposes. Australia {{is one of many}} countries {{in the process of developing}} regulations for these devices yet knowledge of consumers’ views on e-cigarette regulation is lacking. MethodsAn online survey was completed by 705 e-cigarette users recruited online. Participants answered questions about their smoking history, e-cigarette use, as well as their opinions on appropriate regulation of e-cigarettes. ResultsMost participants were male (71 %), employed (72 %), and highly educated (68 % held post-school qualification). They tended to be former heavy smokers who had stopped smoking entirely and were currently vaping. Participants generally agreed that the government should enforce minimum labelling and packaging standards and there was majority support for minimum quality standards. Most supported making e-cigarettes available for sale to anyone over the age of 18, but expressed concern about the government's motivation for regulating e-cigarettes. There was strong opposition to restricting sales to a medicines framework (prescription only or pharmacy only sales). ConclusionE-cigarette users in Australia are in favour of e-cigarettes being regulated as long as those regulations do not impede their ability to obtain devices and refill solutions, which they view as important for them to remain smoke free. These views align with some aspects of appropriate policy designed to maximise the public health potential of e-cigarettes in society, but conflict with some of the proposed regulatory models. Governments should consider how future regulation of e-cigarettes will affect current consumers while helping to maximise the number of smokers who switch to e-cigarettes and minimise the possibility of non-smokers becoming addicted to nicotine...|$|R
