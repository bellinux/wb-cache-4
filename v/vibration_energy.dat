DARPA has funded efforts to harness energy from leg and arm motion, shoe impacts, and blood pressure for low level power to implantable or wearable sensors. The nanobrushes are {{another example of a}} piezoelectric energy harvester. They can be integrated into clothing. Multiple other nanostructures have been exploited to build an energy-harvesting device, for example, a single crystal PMN-PT nanobelt was fabricated and assembled into a piezoelectric energy harvester in 2016. Careful design is needed to minimise user discomfort. These energy harvesting sources by association affect the body. The <b>Vibration</b> <b>Energy</b> Scavenging Project is another project that is set up to try to scavenge electrical energy from environmental vibrations and movements. Microbelt can be used to gather electricity from respiration. Besides, as the vibration of motion from human comes in three directions, a single piezoelectric cantilever based omni-directional energy harvester is created by using 1:2 internal resonance. Finally, a millimeter-scale piezoelectric energy harvester has also already been created.|$|E

The distribution pattern of normal lung <b>vibration</b> <b>energy</b> for healthy individuals evolves centrally (presumably reflecting early airflow distribution in central large airways) and develops centrifugally in a simultaneous fashion for left and right lungs. Following peak inspiration, there is centripetal regression of <b>vibration</b> <b>energy</b> {{toward the end of}} inspiration. The same pattern is repeated during expiration phase accordingly. The peak of inspiratory <b>vibration</b> <b>energy</b> is higher than expiratory energy peak due to inspiration being more active process compared to expiration. At the Maximum Energy Frame (MEF) (a frame on the dynamic image representing the maximum distribution of <b>vibration</b> <b>energy</b> at the peak of inspiration), the right and left zones has a similar shape, area and image intensity, with a tendency, however, to greater intensity on the left. The <b>vibration</b> <b>energy</b> graph is a graphical representation of the behavioral pattern for both lungs and each lung individually. For a healthy individual with normal lungs, the graph has a consistent pattern that is repeated throughout the 12 second breathing period. The graph increases to the peak at the MEF frame on inspiration, and then decreasing to expiration. During expiration the graph pattern looks similar to that of inspiration, however at a lower intensity.

The following Based on the fundamental principles of triboelectric nanogenerators, various technologies have been demonstrated for harvesting <b>vibration</b> <b>energy.</b> This application of triboelectric nanogenerator has been demonstrated in the following aspects: 1. Cantilever-based technique is a classical approach for harvesting mechanical energy, especially for MEMS. By designing the contact surface of a cantilever with the top and bottom surfaces during vibration, TENG has been demonstrated for harvesting ambient <b>vibration</b> <b>energy</b> based on the contact-separation mode. 2. To harvest the energy from a backpack, we demonstrated a rationally designed TENG with integrated rhombic gridding, which greatly improved the total current output owing to the structurally multiplied unit cells connected in parallel. 3. With the use of 4 supporing springs, a harmonic resonator-based TENG has been fabricated based on the resonance induced contact-separation between the two triboelectric materials, which has been used to harvest <b>vibration</b> <b>energy</b> from an automobile engin, a sofa and a desk. 4. Recently, a three-dimensional triboelectric nanogenerator (3D-TENG) has been designed based on a hybridization mode of conjunction the vertical contact-separation mode and the in-plane sliding mode.36 The innovative design facilitates harvesting random <b>vibration</b> <b>energy</b> in multiple directions over a wide bandwidth. The 3-D TENG is designed for harvesting ambient <b>vibration</b> <b>energy,</b> especially at low frequencies, under a range of conditions in daily life, thus, opening the applications of TENG in environmental/infrastructure monitoring, charging portable electronics and internet of things.|$|E
