40|$|Since {{the first}} success in cloning sheep, the {{production}} of <b>viable</b> <b>animals</b> by somatic <b>cell</b> nuclear transfer (SCNT) has developed significantly. Cattle {{are by far the}} most successfully cloned species but, despite this, the technique is still associated with a high incidence of pregnancy failure and accompanying placental and fetal pathologies. Pre- and early post-implantation losses can affect up to 70 % of the pregnancies. In the surviving pregnancies, placentomegaly and fetal overgrowth are commonly observed, but the incidence varies widely, depending on the genotype of the nuclear donor cell and differences in SCNT procedures. In all cases, the placenta is central to the onset of the pathologies. Although cellular organisation of the SCNT placenta appears normal, placental vascularisation is modified and fetal-to-maternal tissue ratios are slightly increased in the SCNT placentomes. In terms of functionality, steroidogenesis is perturbed and abnormal estrogen production and metabolism probably play an important part in the increased gestation length and lack of preparation for parturition observed in SCNT recipients. Maternal plasma concentrations of pregnancy-associated glycoproteins are increased, mostly due to a reduction in turnover rate rather than increased placental production. Placental glucose transport and fructose synthesis appear to be modified and hyperfructosemia has been observed in neonatal SCNT calves. Gene expression analyses of the bovine SCNT placenta show that multiple pathways and functions are affected. Abnormal epigenetic re-programming appears to be a key component of the observed pathologies, as shown by studies on the expression of imprinted genes in SCNT placenta...|$|R

25|$|Cholesterol, {{from the}} Ancient Greek chole- (bile) and stereos (solid) {{followed}} by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol, is an organic molecule. It is a sterol (or modified steroid), a type of lipid molecule, and is biosynthesized by all <b>animal</b> <b>cells,</b> {{because it is an}} essential structural component of all <b>animal</b> <b>cell</b> membranes; essential to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity.

40|$|AbstractPlant {{and animals}} have evolved {{different}} strategies for their development. Whether this {{is linked to}} major differences in their cell mechanics remains unclear, mainly because measurements on plant and <b>animal</b> <b>cells</b> relied on independent experiments and setups, thus hindering any direct comparison. In this study we used the same micro-rheometer to compare animal and plant single cell rheology. We found that wall-less plant cells exhibit the same weak power law rheology as <b>animal</b> <b>cells,</b> with comparable values of elastic and loss moduli. Remarkably, microtubules primarily contributed to the rheological behavior of wall-less plant cells whereas rheology of <b>animal</b> <b>cells</b> was mainly dependent on the actin network. Thus, plant and <b>animal</b> <b>cells</b> evolved different molecular strategies to reach a comparable cytoplasmic mechanical core, suggesting that evolutionary convergence could include the internal biophysical properties of cells...|$|R

We have based this on a model validated over batch and fed-batch conditions and have examined four possible objective functions.

40|$|Cultivation of microorganisms, {{plants or}} <b>animal</b> <b>cells</b> {{requires}} liquid agitation {{in order to}} ensure oxygen and nutrient transfer and to maintain cell suspension. However, In such suspensions both mechanical agitation and sparging aeration can cause cell death. Many studies on <b>animal</b> <b>cell</b> damage due to mechanical agitation and sparging aeration have shown that mechanical damage of freely suspended <b>animal</b> <b>cells</b> is in most cases associated with bursting bubbles at the air–liquid interface (Barrett et al., 2010, Nienow et al., 1996). Gas bubbles are usually generated by direct air sparging to propagate oxygen in a culture suspension. Mechanical agitation may also introduce gas bubbles to the culture fluid through vortexing entrainment from the free surface. In this work oxygen transfer performance of an unbaffled stirred vessel is presented in view of its use as biochemical reactor for <b>animal</b> <b>cell</b> growth. As a matter of fact, oxygen mass transfer can occur through the free surface deep vortex which takes place when agitation is started. If this is not allowed to reach impeller blades, bubble formation and subsequent bursting inside the reactor is avoided. Experimental results showed that this kind of bioreactor can provide sufficient oxygen mass transfer for <b>animal</b> <b>cell</b> growth, so resulting in a valid alternative to more common sparged reactors...|$|R
