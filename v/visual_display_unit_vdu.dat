40|$|Summary <b>Visual</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Units</b> (<b>VDUs)</b> {{have been}} {{hailed as the}} first step to the {{wonderful}} electronic office of the future. They have also been accused of causing cataracts, deterioration in eye sight and even backache. Are they a blessing&mdash;by removing tedious and boring paperwork or are they a hazard to health? There is at present no evidence that they can damage health either by radiation or any other effect on eyesight. However, there can be problems of discomfort and fatigue which although temporary, reduce the well being and the efficiency of the user. This paper examines some of these problems and suggests how they can be avoided by the application of ergonomics to the design, implementation and use of VDUs. All too often VDUs represent the only visible part of a major system development which may be being introduced without due regard to human factors. However, when the ergonomics have been taken seriously, VDUs can actually improve clerical work. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{several experiments}} aimed at evaluating the image quality of <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>units</b> (<b>VDUs).</b> A number of quality metrics are presented, i. e. scaled preference, based on numerical ratings and paired comparisons; search velocity in a letter-search task; and two metrics derived from eye movement recordings. The former two metrics {{are found to}} be practical. The latter metrics, which are hard to determine, turn out to correspond with search velocity. With varying luminance contrast the scaled preference correlates closely with search velocity. With increasing resolution, however, this is true up to a moderate bandwidth, beyond which search velocity and the eye movement metrics saturate, while scaled preference continues to increase. Small quality differences across various commercially available VDUs are reflected by both search velocity and visual comfort. The results are consistent within subjects. Scaling differences across subjects can be understood by allowing for a subject-dependent weighting of underlying perceptual attributes like sharpness and brightness contrast. It is shown that visual comfort and performance are supplementary metrics that are both useful for modelling VDU image quality...|$|R

Non-invasive tear break up time (NIBUT), blinking rate (BR) and palpebral aperture size (AS) were measured before and after VDU work and non-VDU work. Reading for NIBUT, BR and AS were normalized by converting into log 10 unit. ResultsMANCOVA analysis shows that logNIBUT is significantly reduced after both nearwork (F 1, 49 = 58. 10, p 0. 01). Pairwise comparison shows that modes of nearwork produce significant different effect in post-task logBR (F 1, 53 = 7. 13, p= 0. 01) and logAS (F 1, 53 = 11. 00, p< 0. 01).

This paper aims to assess the impact that full implementation of this law would have on a radiologist's practice and to more broadly examine the issue of eye care as an occupational health issue in radiology. The authors conclude that eye care in the setting of regular VDU use among radiologists is an important quality control and occupational health issue. There is a clear legal basis requiring employers to provide regular eye examinations and reporting breaks. In the absence of leadership from employers on this issue individual radiologists have a responsibility to ensure that their work practices reflect the legal situation and minimise the effect of eye strain on their performance...|$|R

40|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Units</b> (<b>VDUs),</b> {{capable of}} <b>displaying</b> video data at High Definition (HD) and Ultra HD (UHD) resolutions, are {{frequently}} employed {{in a variety}} of technological domains. Quantization-induced video compression artifacts, which are usually unnoticeable in low resolution environments, are typically conspicuous on high resolution VDUs and video data. The default quantization matrices (QMs) in HEVC do not take into account specific display resolutions of VDUs or video data to determine the appropriate levels of quantization required to reduce unwanted compression artifacts. Therefore, we propose a novel, adaptive quantization matrix technique for the HEVC standard including Scalable HEVC (SHVC). Our technique, which is based on a refinement of the current QM technique in HEVC, takes into consideration specific display resolutions of the target VDUs in order to minimize compression artifacts. We undertake a thorough evaluation of the proposed technique by utilizing SHVC SHM 9. 0 (two-layered bit-stream) and the BD-Rate and SSIM metrics. For the BD-Rate evaluation, the proposed method achieves maximum BD-Rate reductions of 56. 5 % in the enhancement layer.

The twenty included studies were divided into those with (1 - 7) and without (8 - 21) use of physical examination {{in the definition of}} cases. The main conclusion of this review is the documentation of evidence for the VDU work per se, none or insufficient lower arm support and non-neutral positions of the wrist as predictors of distal upper limb disorders (DULDs). These findings are based solely on studies that use physical examination or objective signs to define the DULDs, and the conclusions are not changed after inclusion of studies based only on self-reported symptoms. When the last category of studies is included as documentation in the review, the amount of VDU work (and an exposuredose/ effect relationship) will also be documented as predictors. The referred studies indicated that not only the VDU work per se, but also (and in particular) VDU work for more than 20 hours per week combined with limited opportunity for rest breaks and without lower arm support is a predictor of DULDs. Another conclusion is that critical reviews may benefit from use of   both strict criteria and less strict criteria for inclusion of studies, to optimize the conclusions drawn from existing documentation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} effect of a {{vertical}} height adjustment of the chair and <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>VDU)</b> on work-related upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain (WRUQMP) and sitting comfort in office workers. The upper quadrant refers to the occiput, cervical and upper thoracic spine, including the clavicles and scapulae. Methods: A single subject (N = 1) study, in which the subject serves as her own control, was conducted using the ABC design. An ergonomic workstation adjustment of VDU and chair height was compared to the subject’s usual workstation settings. Pain and sitting comfort was measured using visual analogue scales (VAS). The subject was assessed over three four-week phases as she performed her typical VDU work. The results were compiled and tabulated. Results: Both the mean and variance in pain intensity decreased after the workstation intervention. A deterioration in sitting comfort was noted. Conclusion: The vertical height adjustment of the chair and visual display unit may have contributed to a decrease in work-related upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain in this subject. This safe, economical workstation intervention may be a practical management option for the computer user suffering from work-related upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain.

Exposure to <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>units</b> (<b>VDUs)</b> at work was assessed from information supplied at interview. Results-No evidence of an increased risk of spontaneous abortion was found inwomenwho reported that they used a VDU at work compared with women who reported that they did not (odds ratio (OR) = 09, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) = 0 - 6 - 1 - 4); and no relation with {{the amount of time spent}} actively using a VDU was evident (OR = 0 - 9, 95 % CI = 0 - 5 - 1 - 6 for women who worked with a VDU for 21 hours or more each week). No effect of passive exposure to VDUs at work was found (OR = 0 9, 95 % CI = 0 - 6 - 1 - 6 for women who reported working less than 10 feet away from a VDU that was usually switched on). These findings were not explained by maternal age, marital state, housing tenure, partner's socia...|$|R
40|$|Upper {{extremity}} musculoskeletal {{complaints and}} disorders are frequently reported among <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>units</b> (<b>VDU)</b> workers. These complaints include cold forearms, hands or fingers. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} systematic review was to gain an insight into the relationship between objective and subjective temperature decrease and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in the upper extremity in a VDU work environment by (internal or external) cooling of the arm and hand. Two questions were formulated: (1) Is a VDU work environment (temperature between 15 and 25 degrees C) associated with temperature decrease of the arm, hand or fingers in healthy subjects? (2) Is there a difference in arm, hand and finger temperature between patients with upper extremity MSDs and healthy subjects in a VDU work environment? METHODS: Through a systematic literature search in six databases between 1989 and October 2005, 327 articles were retrieved and 17 included. RESULTS: Forearm, hand and finger temperature significantly decreases when the ambient temperature (between 15 and 25 degrees C) decreases. The skin temperature in the hand that uses a computer mouse {{is lower than the}} other hand in the same ambient temperature. At baseline, no objective temperature differences are found between patient groups and controls, whereas in patients with cold hand complaints, lower skin temperatures are found compared to controls. The association between temperature (changes) in the forearm, hand or fingers during VDU work, and MSDs in the upper extremity is not clear. CONCLUSION: There is no consistent evidence available for the association between upper extremity MSDs and temperature changes in forearm, hand or fingers in an office work environmen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>units</b> (<b>VDU’s)</b> such as laptops, tablets, smartphones, computers, game {{consoles}} and televisions {{have become an}} essential part of our modern life both in school and at work places (Izquierdo & Townsend, 2008). Up to 90 % of computer users may experience visual symptoms {{at one time or another}} with the use of VDU’s (Barthakur, 2013). Asthenopia (eyestrain) is typically associated with near-work and symptoms include dry eyes, eye fatigue and difficulty focusing. The major cause of computer-induced asthenopia is fatigue of the ciliary and extra-ocular muscles due to prolonged accommodation and vergence required by near-vision work (Tiwari et al., 2011). The severity of the symptoms is proportional to the time spent using a VDU device and symptoms are substantially reduced after discontinuing usage; even so, the symptoms can affect work productivity and quality of life (Barthakur, 2013). Conventional treatment for asthenopia includes correction of refractive errors, use of occupational glasses, eye drops and punctal occlusion (Garin, 2014); ergonomic measures can also be helpful (Barthakur, 2013). Homoeopathy is a holistic treatment modality based on the “Law of Similars” (Dekkers, 2009). Homoeopathic remedies enhance the body’s own curative abilities, enabling the body to heal itself (Ahmad, 2005). Homoeopathic remedies may provide a safe complementary treatment option for asthenopia. The homoeopathic complex eye drop solution used in this study consists of Conium maculatum 6 X, Natrum muriaticum 6 X, Ruta graveolens 6 X and Senega officinalis 6 X. It is a widely available eye drop solution indicated for the relief of computer-induced asthenopia. To date, no specific research could be found on the effect of this eye drop complex on the symptoms of computer-induced asthenopia...|$|R
