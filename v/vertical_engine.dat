25|$|The , 744-ton wooden {{propeller}} ship Comet, {{along with}} her sister ship, the Rocket, was launched in 1857 by Peak and Masters of Cleveland, Ohio. Her direct-acting <b>vertical</b> <b>engine</b> was manufactured by Cuyahoga Steam Furnace of Cleveland. Comet was originally built as a pure workhorse. Upper deck cabins for passenger accommodations were not added until the winter layup of 1859–60.|$|E
25|$|A Wilkinson engine weighed about eleven tons, carried 160 {{gallons of}} water and had a bunker capable of {{carrying}} nine cubic feet of coke. It was a <b>vertical</b> <b>engine</b> with a vertical boiler. The cylinders were of small bore and acted upon a crankshaft through which motion was communicated to the four coupled wheels by cog-wheel gears. Exhaust steam was not condensed but was superheated in a patent contrivance in the firebox whence it escaped to the atmosphere through the chimney.|$|E
25|$|These were 30ft single deckers with twin-steering front axles. The Gnu had a {{front-mounted}} <b>vertical</b> <b>engine</b> {{and either}} front or central doors. The TEP1 sold three, two to Scottish operator Walter Alexander who built 41-seat front entrance bus and coach bodies, {{the first one}} a 1937 Earls' Court show exhibit. The other one went to City Coach Company of Brentwood Essex, who fitted a centre-door 43-seat Duple body. City had bought large numbers of three-axle Tigers and was the only customer for the TEC2 Gnu, designed for centre-entrance bodywork, and having much {{more in common with}} the Leyland Steer lorry.|$|E

25|$|The side-lever was an {{adaptation}} of the earliest form of steam engine, the beam engine. The typical side-lever engine {{had a pair of}} heavy horizontal iron beams, known as side levers, connected in the centre {{to the bottom of the}} engine with a pin; this connection allowed a limited arc in which the levers could pivot. These levers extended, on the cylinder side, to each side of the bottom of the <b>vertical</b> <b>engine</b> cylinder. A piston rod, connected vertically to the piston, extended out of the top of the cylinder. This rod attached to a horizontal crosshead which, at each end, was connected to vertical rods (known as side-rods). These rods connected down to the levers on each side of the cylinder. This formed the connection of the levers to the piston on the cylinder side of the engine. The other side of the levers (the opposite end of the lever pivot to the cylinder) were connected to each other with a horizontal crosstail. This crosstail in turn connected to and operated a single connecting rod, which turned the crankshaft. The rotation of the crankshaft was driven by the levers which, at the cylinder side, were driven by the piston oscillating vertically.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] wooden {{propeller}} steamer Curlew, {{was built}} in 1856 by Samuel Sneden of Greenpoint, New York for the Commercial Steamboat Company of Providence, Rhode Island. She was equipped with a direct-acting, two cylinder, <b>vertical</b> <b>engine</b> with a bore of 32inches and a stroke of 2 feet. [...] The boiler was on the main deck. Curlew was rigged as a three masted schooner as were many of the propeller steamers in this service. [...] She was configured with a full length spar deck which was enclosed above the main deck.|$|E
2500|$|The Siamese engine, also {{referred}} to as the [...] "double cylinder" [...] or [...] "twin cylinder" [...] engine, was another early alternative to the beam or side-lever engine. This type of engine had two identical, <b>vertical</b> <b>engine</b> cylinders arranged side-by-side, whose piston rods were attached to a common, T-shaped crosshead. The vertical arm of the crosshead extended down between the two cylinders and was attached at the bottom to both the crankshaft connecting rod and to a guide block that slid between the vertical sides of the cylinders, enabling the assembly to maintain the correct path as it moved.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>engines</b> came to {{supersede}} {{almost every other}} type of marine steam engine toward {{the close of the}} 19th century. Because they became so common, <b>vertical</b> <b>engines</b> are not usually referred to as such, but are instead referred to based upon their cylinder technology, i.e. as compound, triple-expansion, quadruple-expansion etc. It {{should be noted that the}} term [...] "vertical" [...] for this type of engine is imprecise, since technically any type of steam engine is [...] "vertical" [...] if the cylinder is vertically oriented. An engine described as [...] "vertical" [...] should therefore not be assumed to be of the vertical inverted direct-acting type unless the term [...] "vertical" [...] is unqualified.|$|R

5000|$|Austin's {{resolute}} {{refusal to}} countenance new <b>vertical</b> <b>engines</b> for his Wolseleys, whatever his directors might wish, led to Austin handing in his resignation {{the year before}} his contract ended. Curiously in his new Austin enterprise all the <b>engines</b> proved <b>vertical</b> but there he had to suffer a new financial master. Vickers replaced Austin by promoting Wolseley's London sales manager, John Davenport Siddeley to general manager. As Austin was aware Vickers had earlier built, in association with Siddeley, Siddeley's vertical-engined cars at their Crayford Kent factory. The new Siddeley cars began to overtake Wolseley's sales of [...] "old-fashioned" [...] horizontal-engined cars. In early 1905 they hired Siddeley for their London sales manager and purchased the goodwill and patent rights of his Siddeley car.Siddeley, on his appointment to Austin's former position, promptly replaced Austin's horizontal engines with the now conventional upright engines. With him he brought his associate Lionel de Rothschild {{as a member of}} the Wolseley board. Together they gave the business a new lease of life. At the November 1905 Olympia Motor Show, the first at the former National Agricultural Hall, two small 6 hp and 8 hp cars were still exhibited with horizontal engines but there were also Siddeley's new 15, 18 and 32 hp cars with <b>vertical</b> <b>engines.</b> This switch to <b>vertical</b> <b>engines</b> brought Wolseley a great deal of publicity and their products soon lost their old-fashioned image.|$|R

50|$|Two {{things were}} {{noticeable}} about Austin's new design.

After that Harvey Du Cros junior of the Swift Cycle Co and Austin each held {{approximately half of the}} ordinary capital. Herbert Austin remained chairman and managing director.|$|E

Common verticals include shopping, the automotive industry, legal information, medical information, scholarly literature, job search and travel. Examples of <b>vertical</b> search <b>engines</b> include Mocavo, Nuroa, Trulia and Yelp. In contrast to general web search engines, which attempt to index large portions of the World Wide Web using a web crawler, <b>vertical</b> search <b>engines</b> typically use a focused crawler which attempts to index only relevant web pages to a pre-defined topic or set of topics.|$|R
