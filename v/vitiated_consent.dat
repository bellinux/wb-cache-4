50|$|Despite {{the initial}} scope of {{revision}} being ‘technical reform’, the 1992 BW enacted substantive modifications {{to both the}} prior Code and established case-law. The technical focus of the revised code is borrowed from the German BGB. The distinction between civil law and commercial law was done away with and brought under the broader ambit of private law. The Code now covers all aspects of commercial regulation—company, insurance, transport, consumer, and labour laws. For example, the 1992 Code now specifically regulates commercial contracts (Book 6, art. 119(a)). An unjust enrichment action is available (Book 6, art. 212), as are rescissory actions for <b>vitiated</b> <b>consent</b> or an ‘abuse of circumstances’ (Book 6, art. 44(4)). More generally, requirements of good faith now {{appear to be a}} constant theme throughout the Code: Book 6, art. 1 provides that both parties in a relationship are to behave equitably and reasonably towards each other. This appears to extend beyond contracts into other areas of law. The 1992 Code is more technical, systematic, and abstract than its predecessor. It is also more conceptual, providing for many well-defined principles at differing levels of abstraction. Throughout, the Code lays out a strict pattern of general rules upon which are built detailed ones. For example, tortious liability is founded on a general concept of an unlawful civil wrong. The concept will have differing applications in different circumstances. The Code is also more nuanced, providing for degree and qualification where an ‘all or nothing’ approach may have prevailed under the prior Code. The Code also loosens the legal positivism of the French system in favour of granting courts wider discretion in adjudicating cases. This discretion permits ‘intermediate solutions’ (i.e., not slavishly statutory) to complex problems.|$|E

The thesis applies to the legislation of mistake in relation to contracts in general as provided in the civil code, s. 583 - 585 and analyzes the legal consequences made by mistake. The keyword - mistake - is defined in the text in two ways - firstly as discrepancy between the genuine will of the acting person and manifestation of the will, secondly as a defect of the will. The study is primarily focused on the latter case. The text analyzes thoroughly conditions which must be satisfied so that so-called substantial mistake affects legal consequences. These conditions include determining circumstance, mistake caused by the second party and excusability of mistake. A separated chapter is devoted to mistake caused by fraud which is a special type of mistake because of its graveness, and therefore the act provides requirements which are different from those leading to the substantial mistake. The next chapter focuses on mistake caused by the third person. At the end of the work, legal consequences of mistake are illustrated - the right to avoid a [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Australian superannuation system {{seeks to}} ensure that {{individuals}} have income in retirement. The government implemented the superannuation contributions splitting scheme to allow spouses to share their superannuation with each other. The scheme was intended to provide low-income and non-working spouses with superannuation assets under their control. This was expected to benefit women in particular. However, {{there is a risk}} that the scheme will operate to the detriment of spouses and jeopardise their financial position in retirement. There is a lack of safeguards to protect spouses from applying to split their contributions where their decision is not free, informed or independent. Further, imposing the scheme’s application process into the superannuation system’s trust structure has caused a dissociation between the legal and practical decision maker under the scheme. These issues are particularly detrimental in light of the heightened risk of <b>vitiated</b> <b>consent</b> between spouses for financial decisions. This thesis seeks to examine these issues and their impact and propose potential solutions to prevent the scheme operating to spouses’ detriment and remedy the situation where it occurs. It is argued that the scheme does not sufficiently protect spouses’ interests. It is also argued that the dissociation between the legal and practical decision maker exposes trustees to potential liability and leaves spouses without a clear avenue of recourse where their contributions are transferred in circumstances of impaired consent. Thus, both the trustees and spouses are left in a difficult position under the scheme. As a result, despite the government’s intentions, the contributions splitting scheme may disadvantage, rather than benefit, vulnerable spouses...|$|E

They may pose as UPS delivery persons or homebuyers, or they may say {{they are looking for}} a kidnapping victim or a pedophile, when really they are looking for drugs or guns. Recent years have brought hundreds of reported decisions concerning such police ruses. When the police lie about their identity or their purpose to enter a home, as when they pose as a homebuyer, the courts surprisingly, but routinely, approve these deceptions under the Fourth Amendment. Such intrusions, the courts reason, do not violate a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy and therefore do not even trigger Fourth Amendment protection. But the Supreme Court has announced a new Fourth Amendment test based on the civil law of trespass, and this new test promises to provide more Fourth Amendment protection against police deception. Now, under United States v. Jones and Florida v. Jardines, any time the police trespass to gain information, they trigger Fourth Amendment protections. Although Jones and Jardines did not involve police deception, this Article applies, for the first time, the police trespass rule stated in these cases to police deception cases. It makes the claim that the new trespass test should change the outcomes in the leading police deception cases. After all, these deceptive intrusions would otherwise count as trespasses absent consent, and under ordinary trespass principles deception <b>vitiates</b> <b>consent.</b> Without consent, the intrusion counts as a civil trespass and triggers Fourth Amendment protection...|$|R
40|$|Erreur in French law and {{mistake in}} English law have {{different}} aims. Erreur is interpreted broadly {{in order to}} ensure the parties’ consent. Conversely, mistake is narrowly defined, so as to ensure that contracts are valid. The Court of Appeal case of Great Peace (2002) has confirmed this difference in putting an end to the concept of mistake in Equity. This opposition is obvious when illustrated by mistake as to the authenticity of works of art. If a party buys a painting mistakenly believing that it is genuine, he can rescind the contract in French law, since an erreur <b>vitiates</b> <b>consent.</b> Mistake as to the authenticity of a work of art is not a ground for rescission in English law. The subjectivity of consent is not taken into account. It is however possible to attain a similar result by other means, such as misrepresentation or breach of contract. This example illustrates that any European harmonisation cannot be attained simply by harmonising concepts. It should be done by the definition of common contractual terms, as envisaged by the European Commission in its recent Action Plan on European contract law. Such a harmonisation would encourage a unified European art market...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} the {{autonomy}} of the will plays a central structuring role in Quebec's positive law.

40|$|Legal theorists, liberal philosophers, {{and feminist}} {{scholars}} have {{written extensively on}} questions surrounding consent and sexual consent, with particular attention paid to the sorts of conditions that validate or <b>vitiate</b> <b>consent,</b> and {{to whether or not}} consent is an adequate metric to determine ethical and legal conduct. So too, many have written on the historical construction of childhood, and how this concept has influenced contemporary legal culture and more broadly informed civil society and its social divisions. Far less has been written, however, on a potent point of contact between these two fields: age of consent laws governing sexual activity. Partially on account of this under-theorization, such statutes are often taken for granted as reflecting rather than creating distinctions between adults and youth, between consensual competency and incapacity, and between the time for innocence and the time for sex. In this Article, I argue for relatively modest reforms to contemporary age of consent statutes but propose a theoretic reconstruction of the principles that inform them. After briefly historicizing age of consent statutes in the United States (Part I), I assert that the concept of sexual autonomy ought to govern legal regulations concerning age, age difference, and sexual activity (Part II). A commitment to sexual autonomy portends a lowered age of sexual consent, decriminalization of sex between minors, heightened legal supervision focusing on age difference and relations of dependence, more robust standards of consent for sex between minors and between minors and adults, and greater attention to the ways concerns about age, age difference, and sex both reflect and displace more normatively apt questions around gender, gendered power and submission, and queer sexuality (Part III). Ultimately, because adolescent youth as a class are positioned as uniquely desiring and dependent subjects, they warrant particularized treatment under law (Part IV). However, contemporary U. S. law, on account of its adherence to formal neutrality and its predominant language of prohibition, is ultimately a poor forum to detect and adjudicate coercion that arises at the interface of gender, sexuality and age differences. Therefore, not only should age of consent law be reformed and its principles rethought, but law itself should be deemphasized and refigured as a way to help better frame the problems of age and sex rather than as a way to resolve them (Part V) ...|$|R

5000|$|Though Canadian {{federal law}} does not contain any HIV-specific statutes, HIV {{transmission}} and exposure are otherwise prosecuted under general offense laws. R. v. Mabior, (2012) SCC 47 reflects the Supreme Court of Canada's most recent decision outlining criminal liability for serostatus nondisclosure. After being diagnosed with HIV in 2004, Clato Mabior underwent aggressive antiretroviral therapy and was adhering to treatment {{at the time of}} pursuing sexual relations with multiple partners between 2004-2006. Despite intermittent condom use, HIV was never transmitted to his partners. Ultimately, the Court convicted Mabior with six counts of aggravated sexual assault. The Mabior ruling comes fourteen years after R. v. Cuerrier (1998) 127 CCC (3d) 1 (SCC) where the defendant was charged with aggravated assault for the sexual transmission of HIV under s268 Canadian Criminal Code. The Supreme Court of Canada found that the trial judge had misdirected himself and ordered a new trial on two counts of aggravated assault but, in May 1999, the Attorney-General for British Columbia announced that a new persons trial would not take place. The Supreme Court ruling caused difficulty because even though it only concerned non-disclosure of HIV-positive status in sexual situations, it unanimously rejected of the English authority of R v Clarence, L’Heureux-Dubé stating that any fraud could <b>vitiate</b> <b>consent</b> to all types of assault because the autonomy and physical integrity of the person has been violated. Thus, because the Canadian legislature has declined to criminalize the transmission of HIV, the judiciary must address the issues as and when they arise. Subsequent legal precedent has established that failure to disclose HIV-positive status, combined with failure to utilize protective measures (condom use), is sufficiently fraudulent behaviour to constitute turning [...] "consensual" [...] sex into aggravated sexual assault, since the other party has been denied the information necessary to give properly informed consent. The Court's vague justification for serostatus disclosure under circumstances that lead to [...] "significant risk of bodily harm" [...] remained a particularly contentious issue in the aftermath of Cuerrier. Because Cuerrier did not expressly define [...] "significant risk", lower courts inconsistently criminalized HIV-positive defendants based on varied interpretations of the clause. In large part, Mabior represents a response to Cuerrier and an attempt to sharpen the criteria. In Mabior, the Court found that [...] "significant risk of bodily harm is negated if (i) the accused’s viral load at the time of sexual relations was low, and (ii) condom protection was used." [...] Many anti-criminalization groups maintain that even this clarification is equally ambiguous without explicitly defining a threshold for low viral load.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{economic}} duress was recently {{considered for the}} first time in depth by the Supreme Court of Appeal in Medscheme Holdings (Pty) Limited & Another v Bhamjee (as yet unreported) SCA Case 214 / 04 (judgment of Nugent JA handed down on 27 May 2005). The concept of duress in general was explained by the Supreme Court of Appeal as follows: ‘in general terms, an undertaking that is extracted by an unlawful or unconscionable threat of some considerable harm, is voidable’ (para 6). Since the harm threatened in Medscheme was economic harm, the Supreme Court of Appeal had to consider whether a threat of economic harm could ever amount to duress in our law. Economic duress (or business compulsion) may broadly be described as imposition, oppression or taking undue advantage of the business or financial stress or extreme necessity or weakness of another (Lafayette Dramatic Productions Inc v Ferentz 9 NW 2 d 57 (1943); Hackley v Headley 8 NW 511 (1881)). To put it differently, economic duress is constituted by illegitimate commercial pressure exerted on a party to a contract, which induces him to enter into the contract, and which amounts to a coercion of the will which <b>vitiates</b> his <b>consent</b> (see Occidental Worldwide Investment Corporation v Skibs A/S Avanti [1976] 1 Lloyds Rep 293 at 335; North Ocean Shipping Co Ltd v Hyundai Construction Co Ltd [1979] AC 704; Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980] AC 614 at 635 – 6; Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers’ Federation [1982] 2 All ER 67 (HL) at 75 – 6, 88 – 9; Alec Lobb (Garages) Ltd v Total Oil GB Ltd [1983] 1 All ER 944 (Ch) at 960).

5000|$|Piercing the {{corporate}} veil16. I should {{first of all}} {{draw attention to the}} limited sense in which this issue arises at all. [...] "Piercing {{the corporate}} veil" [...] is an expression rather indiscriminately used to describe a number of different things. Properly speaking, it means disregarding the separate personality of the company. There is a range of situations in which the law attributes the acts or property of a company to those who control it, without disregarding its separate legal personality. The controller may be personally liable, generally in addition to the company, for something that he has done as its agent or as a joint actor. Property legally vested in a company may belong beneficially to the controller, if the arrangements in relation to the property are such as to make the company its controller's nominee or trustee for that purpose. For specific statutory purposes, a company's legal responsibility may be engaged by the acts or business of an associated company. Examples are the provisions of the Companies Acts governing group accounts or the rules governing infringements of competition law by [...] "firms", which may include groups of companies conducting the relevant business as an economic unit. Equitable remedies, such as an injunction or specific performance may be available to compel the controller whose personal legal responsibility is engaged to exercise his control in a particular way. But when we speak of piercing the corporate veil, we are not (or should not be) speaking of any of these situations, but only of those cases which are true exceptions to the rule in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd, i.e. where a person who owns and controls a company is said in certain circumstances to be identified with it in law by virtue of that ownership and control. 17. Most advanced legal systems recognise corporate legal personality while acknowledging some limits to its logical implications. In civil law jurisdictions, the juridical basis of the exceptions is generally the concept of abuse of rights, to which the International Court of Justice was referring in In re Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co Ltd when it derived from municipal law a limited principle permitting the piercing of the corporate veil in cases of misuse, fraud, malfeasance or evasion of legal obligations. These examples illustrate the breadth, at least as a matter of legal theory, of the concept of abuse of rights, which extends not just to the illegal and improper invocation of a right but to its use for some purpose collateral to that for which it exists.18. English law has no general doctrine of this kind. But it has a variety of specific principles which achieve the same result in some cases. One of these principles is that the law defines the incidents of most legal relationships between persons (natural or artificial) on the fundamental assumption that their dealings are honest. The same legal incidents will not necessarily apply if they are not. The principle was stated in its most absolute form by Denning LJ in a famous dictum in Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley:"No court in this land will allow a person to keep an advantage which he has obtained by fraud. No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything. The court is careful not to find fraud unless it is distinctly pleaded and proved; but once it is proved, it vitiates judgments, contracts and all transactions whatsoever…"The principle is mainly familiar in the context of contracts and other consensual arrangements, in which the effect of fraud is to <b>vitiate</b> <b>consent</b> so that the transaction becomes voidable ab initio. But it has been applied altogether more generally, in cases which can be rationalised only on grounds of public policy, for example to justify setting aside a public act such as a judgment, which is in no sense consensual, a jurisdiction which has existed since at least 1775. Or to abrogate a right derived from a legal status, such as marriage. Or to disapply a statutory time bar which {{on the face of the}} statute applies. These decisions (and there are others) illustrate a broader principle governing cases in which the benefit of some apparently absolute legal principle has been obtained by dishonesty. The authorities show that there are limited circumstances in which the law treats the use of a company as a means of evading the law as dishonest for this purpose....34. These considerations reflect the broader principle that the corporate veil may be pierced only to prevent the abuse of corporate legal personality. It may be an abuse of the separate legal personality of a company to use it to evade the law or to frustrate its enforcement. It is not an abuse to cause a legal liability to be incurred by the company in the first place. It is not an abuse to rely upon the fact (if it is a fact) that a liability is not the controller's because it is the company's. On the contrary, that is what incorporation is all about....35. I conclude that there is a limited principle of English law which applies when a person is under an existing legal obligation or liability or subject to an existing legal restriction which he deliberately evades or whose enforcement he deliberately frustrates by interposing a company under his control. The court may then pierce the corporate veil for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of depriving the company or its controller of the advantage that they would otherwise have obtained by the company's separate legal personality. The principle is properly described as a limited one, because in almost every case where the test is satisfied, the facts will in practice disclose a legal relationship between the company and its controller which will make it unnecessary to pierce the corporate veil....52. Whether assets legally vested in a company are beneficially owned by its controller is a highly fact-specific issue. It is not possible to give general guidance going beyond the ordinary principles and presumptions of equity, especially those relating to gifts and resulting trusts. But I venture to suggest, however tentatively, that in the case of the matrimonial home, the facts are quite likely to justify the inference that the property was held on trust for a spouse who owned and controlled the company. In many, perhaps most cases, the occupation of the company's property as the matrimonial home of its controller will not be easily justified in the company's interest, especially if it is gratuitous. The intention will normally be that the spouse in control of the company intends to retain a degree of control over the matrimonial home which is not consistent with the company's beneficial ownership. Of course, structures can be devised which give a different impression, and some of them will be entirely genuine. But where, say, the terms of acquisition and occupation of the matrimonial home are arranged between the husband in his personal capacity and the husband in his capacity as the sole effective agent of the company (or someone else acting at his direction), judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to be sceptical about whether the terms of occupation are really what they are said to be, or are simply a sham to conceal the reality of the husband's beneficial ownership.|$|R
