The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine <b>viability</b> <b>thresholds</b> in the ischemic penumbra, defined as the perfusion/diffusion mismatch in hyperacute stroke, by the use of diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI (DWI and PWI, respectively).

The mean rCBF ratio was optimal in distinguishing the parts of the penumbra recovering or progressing to infarction.

An improved automated iterative-self-organizing-data-analysis-algorithm (ISODATA) was developed to dynamically track ischemic tissue fate on a pixel-by-pixel basis during the acute phase. ISODATA-resolved clusters were overlaid on the CBF-ADC scatterplots and image spaces. Tissue volume ADC, and CBF of each ISODATA cluster were derived. In contrast to the single-cluster normal left hemisphere (ADC = 0. 74 +/- 0. 02 x 10 (- 3) mm 2 /s, CBF = 1. 36 +/- 0. 22 mL g(- 1) min(- 1), mean +/- SD, n = 8), the right ischemic hemisphere exhibited three ISODATA clusters, namely: 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 (normal ADC and CBF), 2 ̆ 2 ischemic core 2 ̆ 2 (low CBF and ADC), and at-risk 2 ̆ 2 perfusion-diffusion mismatch 2 ̆ 2 (low CBF but normal ADC).

Methods—Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 20 -minute tMCAO (n 10) or sham operation (n 10). Sensorimotor behavioral testing and multimodal (diffusion, perfusion, T 2, and functional) MRI, as well as postmortem hematoxylin-eosin staining, were performed before and up to 21 days after tMCAO.

Serial measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were performed. Lesion volumes were calculated by using <b>viability</b> <b>thresholds</b> or by visual inspection, and correlated with infarct volume defined by TTC staining at 24 h after MCAO. At the very early phase of ischemia, high-resolution resulted in a significantly larger ADC-derived lesion volume and a smaller PWI/DWI mismatch. At 3 h after MCAO, ADC and CBF lesions showed similar robust correlations with TTC-defined infarct volumes for both groups using previously established thresholds. When lesions were determined visually, low-resolution resulted in a substantial overestimation of TTC-defined infarct volume and a lower inter-observer reliability (r = 0. 75), whereas high-resolution produced an excellent correlation with TTC-defined infarct volume and inter-observer reliability (r = 0. 96). In conclusion, high-resolution MRI resulted in substantial temporal averaging of the ischemic lesion during the early phase, but was clearly superior in visual determination of final infarct size.

Using diffusion and perfusion imaging, we compared the spatiotemporal evolution of ischemia in Sprague Dawley rats after permanent suture MCAO (sMCAO; n= 8) and embolic MCAO (eMCAO; n= 8). METHODS: Serial measurements of quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were performed up to 180 minutes after MCAO.

40|$|Abstract Background Protein-protein {{interactions}} {{are central to}} cellular organization, and must have appeared {{at an early stage}} of evolution. To understand better their role, we consider a simple model of protein evolution and determine the effect of an explicit selection for Protein-protein interactions. Results In the model, viable sequences all have the same fitness, following the neutral evolution theory. A very simple, two-dimensional lattice representation of the protein structures is used, and the model only considers two kinds of amino acids: hydrophobic and polar. With these approximations, exact calculations are performed. The results do not depend too strongly on these assumptions, since a model using a 3 D, off-lattice representation of the proteins gives results in qualitative agreement with the 2 D one. With both models, the evolutionary dynamics lead to a steady state population that is enriched in sequences that dimerize with a high affinity, well beyond the minimal level needed to survive. Correspondingly, sequences close to the <b>viability</b> <b>threshold</b> are less abundant in the steady state, being subject to a larger proportion of lethal mutations. The set of viable sequences has a "funnel" shape, consistent with earlier studies: sequences that are highly populated in the steady state are "close" to each other (with proximity being measured by the number of amino acids that differ). Conclusion This bias in the the steady state sequences should lead to an increased resistance of the population to environmental change and an increased ability to evolve. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Viral {{diversity}} {{is a key}} problem {{for the design of}} effective and universal vaccines. Virtually, a vaccine candidate including most of the diversity for a given epitope would force the virus to create escape mutants above the <b>viability</b> <b>threshold</b> or with a high fitness cost. Presentation of the hypothesis Therefore, I hypothesize that priming the immune system with polyvalent vaccines where each single vehicle generates and displays multiple antigen variants in vivo, will elicit a broad and long-lasting immune response able to avoid viral escape. Testing the hypothesis To this purpose, I propose the use of yeasts that carry virus-like particles designed to pack the antigen-coding RNA inside and replicate it via RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This would produce diversity in vivo limited to the target of interest and without killing the vaccine vehicle. Implications of the hypothesis This approach is in contrast with peptide cocktails synthesized in vitro and polyvalent strategies where every cell or vector displays a single or definite number of mutants; but similarly to all them, it should be able to overcome original antigenic sin, avoid major histocompatibility complex restriction, and elicit broad cross-reactive immune responses. Here I discuss additional advantages such as minimal global antagonism or those derived from using a yeast vehicle, and potential drawbacks like autoimmunity. Diversity generated by this method could be monitored both genotypically and phenotypically, and therefore selected or discarded before use if needed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} rearranging {{the limits of}} {{geographic}} distributions of species. The populations inhabiting the latitudinal margins of a species' range {{are likely to be}} sensitive to climatic drivers. If these populations are extirpated, a latitudinal shift of the range is produced. When species are spatially structured into metapopulations, these will experiment a negative growth trajectory, and eventually become extirpated, when extinction rate (e) of local populations (demes) exceeds the rate of establishment of new colonies in available empty patches (mp). Dispersal among patches is a process of central significance for the recolonization rate (mp). Therefore, the loss of longitudinal connectivity in river networks is likely to enhance the latitudinal displacement of a species' range in its rear edge, by reducing that rate. Moreover, if climate drifts towards more meridional conditions, the thermal habitat of some species can become constrained, and the extinction rates of local populations increased. This might be the case of salmonid species in southern Europe. In this work the functioning of a salmonid metapopulation has been modeled by means of several coupled logistic population dynamics models with population <b>viability</b> <b>thresholds.</b> It has been parameterized for a very simple real metapopulation of introduced Salvelinus fontinalis in a glacier lakes system in the mountains of Central Spain.

Sensorimotor behavioral testing and multimodal (diffusion, perfusion, T 2, and functional) MRI, as well as postmortem hematoxylin-eosin staining, were performed before and up to 21 days after tMCAO. MRI and histological parameters were evaluated in 5 regions of interest within the sensorimotor network. Diffusion, perfusion, and T 2 lesion volumes were calculated according to previously established <b>viability</b> <b>thresholds.</b> RESULTS: Diffusion and perfusion lesions were present during occlusion but disappeared completely and permanently within 30 minutes after reperfusion, with no T 2 lesions seen. Functional MRI and behavioral deficits did not normalize until 1 and 21 days after tMCAO, respectively. Histology demonstrated selective neuronal cell death at 7 and 21 days after reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-minute tMCAO produced distinct changes on multimodal MRI, histology, and behavioral parameters acutely and chronically. Normal findings on MRI after transient ischemia may not indicate normal tissue status, as behavioral and histological anomalies remain. Behavioral dysfunction persisting long after the recovery of MRI parameters may relate to the subtle neuronal damage seen on histology. Together, these results may help explain unremitting neurological deficits in stroke or transient ischemic attack patients with normal MRI findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between recovery of brain function and behavior after transient cerebral ischemia in {{animals and humans}} is incompletely characterized. Quantitative diffusion- (DWI), perfusion- (PWI), T(2) -weighted (T(2) WI), and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) were performed before, during, and up to 1 day after 20 -mins transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO; n= 6) or sham operation (n= 6) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. <b>Viability</b> <b>thresholds</b> were employed to calculate diffusion, perfusion, and T(2) lesion volumes. Region of interest analysis was used to evaluate structural and functional MR signal changes within the sensorimotor network, which were then related to corresponding behavioral measures. Post-mortem 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was performed 24 h after ischemia. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion produced lesions on DWI and PWI, which fully recovered by 30 mins after reperfusion. Ipsilesional fMRI responses to hypercapnia and forepaw stimulation were significantly impaired after ischemia and did not fully normalize until 3 and 24 h after tMCAO, respectively. No abnormalities were observed on imaging or TTC at 24 h despite significant behavioral dysfunctions including contralesional forelimb impairment and ipsilesional neglect. No MRI, behavioral, or TTC anomalies were observed in sham-operated rats. There were no significant correlations between MRI parameters, behavior, and TTC in either group. Together, these results suggest that normal findings on diffusion, perfusion, and T(2) imaging shortly after transient ischemia may not indicate normal tissue status as indicated by fMRI and behavior, which may help explain the persistence of neurologic deficits in patients with normal conventional MRI after cerebral ischemia...|$|R
40|$|Nature {{conservation}} is increasingly {{based on a}} landscape approach rather than a species approach. Landscape planning that includes nature conservation goals requires integrated ecological tools. However, species differ widely in their response to landscape change. We propose a framework of ecologically scaled landscape indices {{that takes into account}} this variation. Our approach is based on a combination of field studies of spatially structured populations (metapopulations) and model simulations in artificial landscapes. From these, we seek generalities in the relationship among species features, landscape indices, and metapopulation viability. The concept of ecological species profiles is used to group species according to characteristics that are important in metapopulations' response to landscape change: individual area requirements as the dominant characteristic of extinction risk in landscape patches and dispersal distance as the main determinant of the ability to colonize patches. The ecological profiles and landscape indices are then integrated into two ecologically scaled landscape indices (ESLI) : average patch carrying capacity and average patch connectivity. The field data show that the fraction of occupied habitat patches is correlated with the two ESLI. To put the ESLI into a perspective of metapopulation persistence, we determine the viability for six ecological profiles at different degrees of habitat fragmentation using a metapopulation model and computer-generated landscapes. The model results show that the fraction of occupied patches is a good indicator for metapopulation viability. We discuss how ecological profiles, ESLI, and the <b>viability</b> <b>threshold</b> can be applied for landscape planning and design in nature conservation...|$|E
40|$|Animals {{that build}} {{structures}} {{have only two}} ways of obtaining their building materials: collecting them from the environment or secreting them. We identify a clear pattern among invertebrates: collected materials dominate in structures that bear loads predominantly in compression, whereas self-secreted materials dominate in structures that bear loads in tension. Among vertebrates, by contrast, structures in tension are much less common and may make use of either self-secreted or collected materials. Two possible explanations are examined for the difference between invertebrates and vertebrates. It may be {{that there has been}} evolutionary constraint on bodily secretions of vertebrates. Alternatively, the cost-effectiveness of self-secreted building materials diminishes with the load they bear in tension, and most vertebrates, because of their characteristically greater weight compared with invertebrates, exceed the <b>viability</b> <b>threshold.</b> Invertebrates have adapted biochemically varied secretions from a variety of glands to perform specialized mechanical roles. However, vertebrates have secretions with the potential to become building materials, in particular keratin, but only mucus-like secretions have evolved as building materials. The cost of suspended structures is predicted to become relatively greater with increased weight, whilst it will also become more difficult to find supports rigid enough to resist the forces they impose. This conforms to the relatively small size and small number of vertebrate structures in tension. The much larger, heavier suspended structures built by some social insects demonstrate that ecological factors may have important effects on the determination of weight thresholds...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Protein-protein {{interactions}} {{are central to}} cellular organization, and must have appeared {{at an early stage}} of evolution. To understand better their role, we consider a simple model of protein evolution and determine the effect of an explicit selection for Protein-protein interactions. RESULTS: In the model, viable sequences all have the same fitness, following the neutral evolution theory. A very simple, two-dimensional lattice representation of the protein structures is used, and the model only considers two kinds of amino acids: hydrophobic and polar. With these approximations, exact calculations are performed. The results do not depend too strongly on these assumptions, since a model using a 3 D, off-lattice representation of the proteins gives results in qualitative agreement with the 2 D one. With both models, the evolutionary dynamics lead to a steady state population that is enriched in sequences that dimerize with a high affinity, well beyond the minimal level needed to survive. Correspondingly, sequences close to the <b>viability</b> <b>threshold</b> are less abundant in the steady state, being subject to a larger proportion of lethal mutations. The set of viable sequences has a "funnel" shape, consistent with earlier studies: sequences that are highly populated in the steady state are "close" to each other (with proximity being measured by the number of amino acids that differ). CONCLUSION: This bias in the the steady state sequences should lead to an increased resistance of the population to environmental change and an increased ability to evolve...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Cerebral {{perfusion}} imaging with {{computed tomography}} (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) is widely available. The optimum perfusion values to identify tissue {{at risk of}} infarction in acute stroke are unclear. We systematically reviewed CT and MR perfusion imaging in acute ischemic stroke. Methods: We searched for papers on MR or CT perfusion performed < 24 hours after stroke that assessed perfusion thresholds, mean perfusion lesion values, or lesion volumes. We extracted definitions and perfusion values. We compared definitions and evaluated perfusion thresholds for "nonviable"/" at risk" and "at risk"/" not at risk tissue" thresholds. Results: Among 7, 152 papers, 69 met inclusion criteria for analysis of definitions (49 MR and 20 CT), 21 MR (n = 551), and 10 CT (n = 266) papers, median sample size 22, provided thresholds. We found multiple definitions for tissue states, eg, tissue at risk, 18; nonviable tissue, 12; 16, no definition. Perfusion parameters varied widely; eg, 9 different MR, 6 different CT parameters for the "at risk"/" not at risk threshold. " Median threshold values varied up to 4 -fold, eg, for the "at risk"/" not at risk threshold," median cerebral blood flow ranged from 18 to 37 ml/ 100 g/min; mean transit time from 1. 8 to 8. 3 seconds relative to the contralateral side. The influence of reperfusion and duration of ischemia could not be assessed. Interpretation: CT and MR perfusion imaging <b>viability</b> <b>thresholds</b> in stroke are derived from small numbers of patients, variable perfusion analysis methods and definitions of tissue states. Greater consistency of methods would help determine reliable perfusion viability values for wider clinical use of perfusion imaging...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{effects of}} reperfusion on the spatiotemporal {{dynamics}} of transient (60 minutes) focal ischemic brain injury in rats were evaluated on a pixel-by-pixel basis using quanti-tative {{cerebral blood flow}} (CBF) and apparent diffusion coef-ficient (ADC) measurements every 30 minutes for 3 hours and compared to post-mortem histology at 24 hours. Four biologi-cally relevant clusters were classified based on ADC (0. 53 ± 0. 02 × 10 − 3 mm 2 /s, SD) and CBF (0. 30 ± 0. 09 ml/g/min) viabil-ity thresholds, namely: (1) the “normal ” cluster with ADC and CBF> thresholds; (2) the “mismatch ” cluster with ADC> threshold but CBF threshold. The spa-tio-temporal progression of tissue volumes, ADC and CBF of each cluster were evaluated. Pixels of each cluster on the CBF-ADC space were mapped onto the image space. Following reperfusion, 28 % of the “core ” pixels and 90 % of the “mis-match ” (defined at 60 minutes) pixels were salvaged at 180 minutes, which correlated with histology. The ADC and CBF of subsequently salvaged tissues {{were significantly higher than}} those became infarcted. Salvaging “core ” pixels indicated that reduced ADC was not synonymous with irreversible injury; duration of exposure and severity of reduced ADC and CBF were likely critical. Projection profiles showed a bimodal ADC, but uni-modal CBF, distributions. The ADC bimodal minima, obtained without histological correlation, were similar to the histology-derived ADC and CBF <b>viability</b> <b>thresholds,</b> and could have potential clinical applications. This study demon-strated a simple but powerful approach to evaluate, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the spatio-temporal evolution of ischemic brain injury, and a potential for statistical prediction of tissue fate...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diffusion {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) is the current-state-of-the-art technique to clinically investigate acute (0 – 24  h) ischemic stroke tissue. However, reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) —considered a marker of tissue damage—was observed to reverse spontaneously during the subacute stroke phase (24 – 72  h) which means that low ADC cannot be used to reflect the damaged tissue after 24  h in experimental and clinical studies. One reason for the change in ADC is that ADC values drop with cytotoxic edema (acute phase) and rise when vasogenic edema begins (subacute phase). Recently, combined 1 H- and 23 Na-MRI was proposed as a more accurate approach to improve delineation between reversible (penumbra) and irreversible ischemic injury (core). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of reperfusion on the ADC and the sodium MRI signal after experimental ischemic stroke in rats in well-defined areas of different viability levels of the cerebral lesion, i. e. core and penumbra as defined via perfusion and histology. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in male rats by using the intraluminal filament technique. MRI sodium, perfusion and diffusion measurement was recorded before reperfusion, shortly after reperfusion and 24  h after reperfusion. The animals were reperfused after 90  min of ischemia. Results: Sodium signal in core did not change before reperfusion, increased after reperfusion while sodium signal in penumbra was significantly reduced before reperfusion, but showed no changes after reperfusion compared to control. The ADC was significantly decreased in core tissue at all three time points compared to contralateral side. This decrease recovered above commonly applied <b>viability</b> <b>thresholds</b> in the core after 24  h. Conclusions: Reduced sodium-MRI signal in conjunction with reduced ADC can serve as a viability marker for penumbra detection and complement hydrogen diffusion- and perfusion-MRI in order to facilitate time-independent assessment of tissue fate and cellular bioenergetics failure in stroke patients...|$|R
