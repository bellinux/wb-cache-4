40|$|In this article, I {{investigate}} {{the strength of}} intergenerational transmission of <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> non-profit associations in The Netherlands. Data from the Family Survey of the Dutch Population 2000 reveal that there are significant relations between current volunteering and parental volunteering in the past. While the transmission of <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> religious and quasi-religious (‘pillarized’) associations is due largely to the transmission of religion and social status from parents to their children, parental <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> pillarized associations has increased the likelihood of children’s <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> secular associations, even controlling for parental and children’s religion, education, wealth and personality characteristics. Consistent with a value internalization explanation, this spillover effect was not due to the direct social pressure of parents. ...|$|R
