50|$|When a {{contract}} is entered into without the free {{consent of the}} party, it is considered a <b>voidable</b> <b>contract.</b> The definition of the act states that a <b>voidable</b> <b>contract</b> is enforceable by law {{at the option of}} one or more parties but not at option of the other parties. A <b>voidable</b> <b>contract</b> may be considered valid if it is not cancelled by the aggrieved party within a reasonable time.|$|E
5000|$|... 9. <b>Voidable</b> <b>contract</b> 2(i):- An {{agreement}} is a <b>voidable</b> <b>contract</b> {{if it is}} enforceable by Law {{at the option of}} {{one or more of the}} parties there to (i.e. the aggrieved party), and it is not enforceable by Law at the option of the other or others.|$|E
50|$|The act of invalidating the {{contract}} {{by the party}} exercising its rights to annul the <b>voidable</b> <b>contract</b> is usually referred to either as voiding {{the contract}} (in the United States and Canada) or avoiding the contract (in the United Kingdom, Australia and other common law countries).|$|E

50|$|An {{agreement}} {{to carry out}} an illegal act {{is an example of}} a void agreement. For example, a contract between drug dealers and buyers is a void contract simply because the terms of the contract are illegal. In such a case, neither party can go to court to enforce the contract. A void agreement is void ab initio, i e from the beginning while a <b>voidable</b> <b>contract</b> can be voidable by one or all of the parties. A <b>voidable</b> <b>contract</b> is not void ab initio, rather, it becomes void later due to some changes in condition. In sum, there is no scope of any discretion on the part of the contracting parties in a void contract. The contracting parties do not have the power to make a void contract enforceable.|$|E
50|$|A <b>voidable</b> <b>{{contract}},</b> {{unlike a}} void contract, {{is a valid}} contract which may be either affirmed or rejected {{at the option of}} one of the parties. At most, one party to the contract is bound. The unbound party may repudiate (reject) the contract, at which time the contract becomes void.|$|E
50|$|Where {{a person}} enters into a {{contract}} {{on the strength}} of a misrepresentation made to him, or as a result of duress or undue influence by the other party, the agreement is nevertheless valid because there is no dissensus. Since the consensus was improperly obtained, however, the contract is voidable at the instance of the innocent party. The remedy used to set aside a <b>voidable</b> <b>contract</b> is rescission coupled with restitution (known as restitutio in integrum), and is available as both an action and a defence. Of course, the innocent party may also elect to uphold the contract.|$|E
50|$|In every case, {{third parties}} {{involved}} with bad faith in void or <b>voidable</b> <b>contracts</b> {{not only are}} affected by nullity, but may also be liable for statutory damages.|$|R
50|$|Cancellation {{takes effect}} ex nunc (from that point onwards) {{when the other}} party is {{informed}} of it. Cancellation is in this way different from recission, which applies to <b>voidable</b> <b>contracts</b> ex tunc (from {{the beginning of the}} contract).|$|R
5000|$|The Contract Act, 1872 is {{the chief}} {{contract}} law in Bangladesh. Based on English contract law and the British Indian contract law, it was enacted in the 19th century and re-enacted by the Parliament of Bangladesh after the country's independence. It includes chapters on offer and acceptance, <b>voidable</b> <b>contracts,</b> contingent contracts, performance, breach of contract, contractual relations, the sale of goods, bailment, agency and partnership. It also covers topics such as consideration, misrepresentation and indemnity.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{contract}} {{theory has}} also permitted remedies on alternative theories such as promissory estoppel. Also, modifications to existing lease agreements (as {{opposed to the}} creation of a new lease agreement) do not require consideration, nor do modifications to existing sale contracts [...] Furthermore a promise to perform a moral obligation—the classic example is of a promise to support a person injured while coming to the rescue of the promisor—is enforceable provided the promissee was harmed in conferring a benefit on the promisor and the promise is not disproportionate to the benefit. The promise to pay a debt discharged by bankruptcy, the promise to perform a conditional responsibility despite the nonoccurrence of the condition, and the promise to perform on a <b>voidable</b> <b>contract</b> form a category of moral obligations that can bind in the absence of consideration.|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{distinction}} between the alternative explanations for the remedy of insurance risk avoidance in the event of breach of the duty of utmost good faith. It asks whether the remedy is an avoidance of a void contract, or a rescission of a <b>voidable</b> <b>contract.</b> The article then considers the general significance of that distinction to the capacity of a party to exercise its primary right of avoidance, and to the secondary rights of the contracting parties - arising in consequence of the avoidance - to prevent unjust enrichment or achieve restitution. Before considering the potential for - and the desirability of - further reform in the area, the article evaluates the importance of the legal characterisation of insurance risk avoidance in the particular context of insurance contracts affording indemnity to multiple insured parties...|$|E
40|$|H. Kempner (Unincorporated), of Galveston, Texas, is a dynastic {{business}} trust. During {{the early}} 1920 s, the firm, through two subsidiaries, permitted {{a group of}} German and French textile mills to finance cotton purchases by combining an ordinary business practice [...] speculation in the futures market on borrowed money [...] with a standard business form [...] the conversion contract. The practice, while both common and legal in the United States, produced a <b>voidable</b> <b>contract</b> in Germany, dependent on the whether the parties principally intended legitimate business purposes or speculative ones. When the American futures market declined, the spinners absorbed ever-increasing losses until, confronted with bankruptcy, they repudiated their contractual obligations. After failing to settle the disputes by negotiation, H. Kempner sued the mills. From 1928 until the outbreak of World War II, the cases gradually worked {{their way through the}} German and French courts. Although both sides presented consistent positions throughout the litigations, decisions varied from case to case as judges evaluated the individual actions to discover intent. Statutory gambling prohibitions, procedural evidentiary requirements, Great Depression economic factors and Nazi racial policies complicated the legal course. The 1940 German invasion of France, which plunged Europe into total war, effectively terminated the pending suits. H. Kempner subsequently sought redress, through private Congressional legislation, from the Alien Property Custodian's Fund which contained assets seized from German nationals during World War I. After substantial efforts by Senator Tom Connally and Congressman Clark Thompson, both from Texas, Congress enacted a relief bill for H. Kempner in 1946. President Truman vetoed the bill. However, within a year, Truman signed similar legislation on behalf of the Association of American Awardholders. A powerful group of large corporations with claims similar to H. Kempner's, the Association succeeded where H. Kempner failed because of superior political position. H. Kempner subsequently renewed its efforts. Texas congressmen in both houses, including Lyndon B. Johnson in the Senate, introduced relief bills in every legislative session. Finally, in 1953, after several years of committee wrangling, Congress enacted a second bill. Relying on Truman's precedent, President Eisenhower vetoed the legislation. This set-back, after more than a generation of controversy, litigation, and legislation, caused H. Kempner to abandon its cause...|$|E

The Florida Supreme Court's {{distinction}} between void and <b>voidable</b> <b>contracts</b> was, as Cantero had said, irrelevant under Prima Paint and Southland.

5000|$|A void {{contract}} cannot be enforced by law. Void contracts {{are different from}} <b>voidable</b> <b>contracts,</b> which are contracts that may be (but not necessarily will be) nullified. However, when a contract is being written and signed, there is no automatic mechanism available in every situation that can be utilized to detect the validity or enforceability of that contract.

25|$|The lending {{agreements}} {{called for}} all disputes between the borrower and lender {{to be settled}} in arbitration. The original plaintiffs argued that the entire contract, including the arbitration clause, was invalid because it violated the law. When it was appealed to the High Court, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote {{for a majority of}} seven that the Federal Arbitration Act, as previously interpreted by the Court, settled a question that had long been debated by legal scholars and lower-court judges. The opinion distinguished void and <b>voidable</b> <b>contracts,</b> requiring that in the latter an arbitrator rule on all issues including the legality of the contract unless the arbitration clause was itself challenged. The only dissenter was Clarence Thomas, who restated his belief that the Arbitration Act does not supersede state law.|$|R
40|$|Bankruptcy {{courts have}} {{frequently}} been characterized as courts of equity. Often this characterization has accompanied unusually relaxed interpretation or {{application of a}} provision of the Bankruptcy Code. However, this understanding does not exhaust the meaning of equity in bankruptcy. Historically, equity covered a large range of topics–trusts and estates, injunction, contracts, specific performance, unjust enrichment, restitution, and disgorgement. In addition, equity {{was not limited to}} particular remedies. Equity’s remedies certainly included money damages but recognized many more. The law of equity was substantive as well as remedial; it recognized primary rights as well as secondary rights of rectification. Among equity 2 ̆ 7 s primary rights were equitable interests in property. And section 541 (a) of Bankruptcy Code includes such equitable interests in its definition of property of the estate. If equity once boasted a substantial substantive content, what was it? The answer is found in the title of the Restatement Third, Restitution and Unjust Enrichment (R 3 RUE). Unjust (or unjustifiable) enrichment provides the conceptual core of this body of law. As the converse of tort law, which identifies unjustified harms to another, unjust enrichment recognizes unjustified benefits to another, at least to the extent they come at the claimant’s expense. Notwithstanding the merger of law and equity, in the mid- 1990 ’s the American Law Institute appointed Andrew Kull as the reporter for the R 3 RUE. With final approval in 2010, we can expect to see the R 3 RUE affect the legal landscape in the near future. It is that impending impact in bankruptcy that constitutes the burden of this article. Part I briefly summarizes the substantive law of equity as expressed in the R 3 RUE. It addresses the substantive core of law of equity. Distinct categories of operative facts such as benefits conferred by mistake or without request, pursuant to a <b>voidable</b> <b>contract,</b> or as a result of wrongful interference with the rights of a claimant ground unjust enrichment. Part II surveys the remedial aspects of the R 3 RUE comprising the four so-called proprietary remedies–constructive trust, equitable lien, subrogation, and the paired set of rescission and restitution. These proprietary remedies are the equitable interests in property {{that are part of the}} property of the estate. Finally, Parts III–VI focus on these four remedies in greater depth and examine how courts operating under the Bankruptcy Code have (mis) applied them. I conclude with specific observations about how the R 3 RUE can and indeed should affect the development of equitable interests by firmly recognizing their place as property of the estate...|$|E
25|$|The company {{moved to}} have the case {{dismissed}} and compel arbitration. When that was denied, it petitioned the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal which ruled that arbitration was required because the entire contract had been challenged, not the severable arbitration clause. But then that decision was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which reversed {{on the grounds that}} the contract was illegal ab initio and thus the arbitration clause was unenforceable. It read Prima Paint to distinguish between void contracts that could never have legal standing, such as the one at issue, and <b>voidable</b> <b>contracts</b> where that result could come to pass later as a result of dispute resolution but where the contract was legal on its face.

Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract.

50|$|Lord Scarman {{said that}} duress not only renders a <b>contract</b> <b>voidable</b> {{but is also}} a tort if it causes damage or loss (referring to Barton v Armstrong and Pao On v Lau Yiu Long).

40|$|Contractual {{liability}} is {{an important}} topic of the ongoing reform of the effective Serbian Law on Obligations (2007 - 2009), which aims to harmonize the national legislation in this field with {{the laws of the}} European Union. In this paper the author analyzes the evolution of the traditional European civil codes (the German BGB, French Code civil, the Austrian ABGB the Swiss OR and the Hungarian Civil Code), with due attention to the doctrine and jurisprudence, taking into account the proposed reforms of the effective Serbian Law on Obligations concerning issues of contractual liability, such as the legal consequences of nonperformance, misperformance, default, etc. The author is of the opinion that the notion of the breach of contract doesn't cover all the cases in which contractual liability arises, although it embraces nonperformance, misperformance and default. The notion of contractual liability, namely, covers not only the cases of breach of contract, but the infringement of public policy, good morals and mandatory rules, which all lead to the nullity of the contract. In cases of <b>voidable</b> <b>contracts</b> (that is in case of defects of contractual will, such as mistake, deceit and duress) it is questionable whether the scope of contractual liability should be extended to mistake, which is a case of nonconscious discrepancy between contractual will and its expression. It is undisputable that contractual liability arises in case of deceit and duress, to the burden of the party acting in bad faith. The rescission of contract entails a separate complex of legal issues, since it may be justified by the other party's breach of the contract. It can also be onesided, two-sided or by a mutual agreement. Furthermore, specific rules apply to rescission of contract due to changed circumstances. In case of termination of a contract by mutual agreement, the parties usually agree on the extent of liability, that is on the extent of indemnification. Contractual liability is also specific that, according to the principle of parties' autonomy, the parties always may in advance agree on the extent of damages for the case of breach of contract, in a form of a clause on liquidated damages, forfeit money, suretyship for indemnification, the limitation of the sum insured in insurance contracts, clauses in the general conditions of business, etc. The author calls {{attention to the fact that}} these clauses in certain extent limit the scope of the indemnification for breach of a contract, according to which this liability differs from the liability for torts, where the principle of full indemnification applies as a rule...|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{the effect}} of {{misrepresentation}} {{is that it makes}} the <b>contract</b> <b>voidable</b> not void ab initio. This is important for two reasons. Firstly because the represent can continue to be bound by the contract at his or her will. Secondly because the transactions and effects of the (voided) contract are recognised to have taken place, therefore, if a party transfers title of property to a third party of which the former holds the title only, pursuant to the voided contract, the third party can retain legal title. Rescission can be done either by informing the representor or by requesting an order from the court. There are certain circumstances where rescission is not possible though. The idea behind rescission is that the parties are restored to the positions they were before entering into the contract. Therefore, if this is not possible, rescission is not an option.|$|R
50|$|Undue {{influence}} {{is also a}} form of improper pressure brought to bear upon a person to induce a contract, but the pressure is more subtle, involving as it does, without any threat of harm, an undermining of {{the will of the}} other party. The pressure usually emanates from a close or fiduciary relationship in which one party abuses a superior position to influence the other. To set aside a contract on the ground of undue influence, the party so affected must establish that the other party obtained an influence over him, that this influence weakened his powers of resistance and rendered his will compliant, and that the other party used this influence in an unscrupulous manner to induce an agreement that he would not have concluded with normal freedom of will. (Some authority also requires prejudice, but this is disputed.) Unconscionable exploitation of another's emergency is akin to undue influence: Both have been described as abuse of circumstances, and both render the <b>contract</b> <b>voidable.</b> In suitable cases, delictual damages may also be claimed.|$|R
50|$|The most {{relevant}} protective measure at common law {{today is the}} right of borrowers to cancel mortgages if they were misrepresented about the mortgage's terms, or if they entered agreements because of undue influence. In the leading case, Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge (No 2), a group of appeals all involved a husband allegedly pressuring his wife into signing a mortgage agreement with a bank, where security was over the family home. The House of Lords agreed that undue influence would make a <b>contract</b> <b>voidable,</b> and if a bank should have realised this possibility, it could not enforce the mortgage agreement against the spouse's share of the home. Accordingly, if banks wished to ensure valid mortgages {{they would need to}} have confirmation from an independent solicitor that the spouse fully understood the transaction. This ruling was intended to eliminate cases where people do not understand the consequences of mortgages. Alternatively, if despite independent advice, a spouse is still unduly influenced or is misrepresented the facts, he or she will have no recourse against a bank selling the home, but may have a claim against the solicitor for negligence.|$|R

Beyond common law, there are three main kinds of statutory protection. First, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 codified a system of licensing for mortgage lenders. The Financial Conduct Authority maintains a Code of Practice and enforces compliance with the threat of license withdrawal. Second, the Consumer Credit Act 1974 empowers the Office of Fair Trading to engage in similar regulation of the second mortgage market. Third, the content of mortgage is regulated by ordinary consumer contract protection in the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. The general thrust of the law is to ensure complete transparency, and to cancel extortionate credit agreements, so that consumers know what they are getting, and do not get an unfair bargain.|$|R
