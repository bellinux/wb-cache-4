60|$|And now--as if sent {{to drive}} away sad {{thoughts}} and vain regrets-- before our feet lay a jest of Nature's, almost as absurd as a 'four- eyed fish,' or 'calling-crab.' A rough stick, {{of the size of}} your little finger, lay on the pitch. We watched it a moment, {{and saw that it was}} crawling--that it was a huge Caddis, like those in English ponds and streams, though of a very different family. They are the larvae of Phryganeas--this of a true moth. {158} The male of this moth will come out, as a moth should, and fly about on four handsome wings. The female will never develop her wings, but remain to her life's end a crawling grub, like the female of our own <b>Vapourer</b> moth, and that of our English Glow-worm. But more, she will never (at least, in some species of this family) leave her silk and bark case, but live and die, an anchoritess in narrow cell, leaving behind her more than one puzzle for physiologists. The case is fitted close to the body of the caterpillar, save at the mouth, where it hangs loose in two ragged silken curtains. We all looked at the creature, and it looked at us, with its last two or three joints and its head thrust out of its house. Suddenly, disgusted at our importunity, it laid hold of its curtains with two hands, right and left, like a human being, folded them modestly over its head, held them tight together, and so retired to bed, amid the inextinguishable laughter of the whole party.|$|E

[FN#1] Villages {{notorious for}} the {{peculiar}} Egyptian revelry, an undoubted {{relic of the}} good old times, when [...] "the most religious of men" [...] revelled at Canopus with an ardent piety in honour of Isis and Osiris. [FN#2] [...] "Haykal" [...] was a pleasant fellow, who, having basely abused {{the confidence of the}} fair ones of Wardan, described their charms in sarcastic verse, and stuck his scroll upon the door of the village mosque, taking {{at the same time the}} wise precaution to change his lodgings without delay. The very mention of his name affronts the brave Wardanenses to the last extent, making them savage as Oxford bargees. [FN#3] The Barrage is a handsome bridge,-putting the style of architecture out of consideration,-the work of French engineers, originally projected by Napoleon the First. It was intended to act as a dam, raising the waters of the Nile and conducting them to Suez, the salt lakes, and a variety of other places, through a number of canals, which, however, have not yet been opened. Meanwhile, it acts upon the river's trunk as did the sea of old upon its embouchures, blocking it up and converting the land around it to the condition of a swamp. Moreover, it would have cleaned out the bed by means of sluice gates, forming an artificial increase of current to draw off the deposit; but the gates are wanting, so the piers, serving only to raise the soil by increasing the deposit of silt, collect and detain suspended matter, which otherwise would not settle. Briefly, by a trifling expenditure the Barrage might be made a blessing to Egypt; in its present state it is a calamity, an [...] "enormous, cruel wonder," [...] more crushing to the people than were the pyramids and sphinxes of old. [FN#4] Those skilled in simples, Eastern as well as Western, praise garlic highly, declaring that it [...] "strengthens the body, prepares the constitution for fatigue, brightens the sight, and, by increasing the digestive power, obviates the ill-effects arising from sudden change of air and water." [...] The traveller inserts it into his dietary in some pleasant form, as [...] "Provence-butter," [...] because he observes that, wherever fever and ague abound, the people, ignorant of cause but observant of effect, make it a common article of food. The old Egyptians highly esteemed this vegetable, which, with onions and leeks, enters into the list of articles so much regretted by the Hebrews (Numbers, xi. 5; Koran, chap. 2). The modern people of the Nile, like the Spaniards, delight in onions, which, as they contain between 25 and 30 per cent. of gluten, are highly nutritive. In Arabia, however, the stranger must use this vegetable sparingly. The city people despise it as the food of a Fellah-a boor. The Wahhabis have a prejudice against onions, leeks, and garlic, because the Prophet disliked their strong smell, and all strict Moslems refuse to eat them immediately before visiting the mosque, or meeting for public prayer. [FN#5] A policeman; see Chap. I. [FN#6] The stricter sort of Moslems, such as the Arabs, will not wear gold ornaments, which are forbidden by their law. [FN#7] See [...] "The Gold Mines of Midian," [...] and [...] "The Land of Midian (Revisited)," [...] by Sir R. F. Burton. [FN#8] The projecting latticed window, made of wood richly carved, for which Cairo was once so famous. But they are growing out of fashion with young Egypt, disappearing before heating glass and unsightly green blinds. [FN#9] Caste in India arises from the peculiarly sociable nature of the native mind, for which reason [...] "it is found existing among sects whose creeds are as different and as opposite as those of the Hindu and the Christian." [...] (B. A. Irving's Prize Essay on the Theory and Practice of Caste.) Hence, nothing can be more terrible to a man than expulsion from caste; the excommunication of our feudal times was not a more dreadful form of living death. [FN#10] With us every man's house is his castle. But caste divides a people into huge families, each member of which has a right to know everything about his [...] "caste-brother," [...] because a whole body might be polluted and degraded by the act of an individual. Hence, there is no such thing as domestic privacy, and no system of espionnage devised by rulers could be so complete as that self-imposed by the Hindus. [FN#11] The Calcutta Review (No. 41), noticing [...] "L'Inde sous la Domination Anglaise," [...] by the Baron Barchou de Penhoën, delivers the following sentiment: [...] "Whoever states, as the Baron B. de P. states and repeats, again and again, that the natives generally entertain a bad opinion of the Europeans generally, states what is decidedly untrue." [...] The reader will observe that I differ as decidedly from the Reviewer's opinion. Popular feeling towards the English in India was [...] "at first one of fear, afterwards of horror: Hindus and Hindis (Moslems) considered the strangers a set of cow-eaters and fire-drinkers, tetrae beluae ac molossis suis ferociores, who would fight like Iblis, cheat their own fathers, and exchange with the same readiness a broadside of shots and thrusts of boarding-pikes, or a bale of goods and a bag of rupees." [...] (Rev. Mr. Anderson-The English in Western India.) We have risen in a degree above such a low standard of estimation; still, incredible as it may appear to the Frank himself, it is no less true, that the Frank everywhere in the East is considered a contemptible being, and dangerous withal. As regards Indian opinion concerning our government, my belief is, that in and immediately about the three presidencies, where the people owe everything to and hold everything by our rule, it is most popular. At the same time I am convinced that in other places the people would most willingly hail any change. And how can we hope it to be otherwise,-we, a nation of strangers, aliens to the country's customs and creed, who, even while resident in India, act the part which absentees do in other lands? Where, in the history of the world, do we read that such foreign dominion ever made itself loved? [FN#12] This was written three years before the Indian Mutiny. I also sent into the Court of Directors a much stronger report-for which I duly suffered. [FN#13] In the Arabic [...] "Muruwwat," [...] generosity, the noble part of human nature, the qualities which make a man. [FN#14] [...] "For medicine," [...] means for an especial purpose, an urgent occasion. [FN#15] [...] "Allah Karim!" [...] said to a beggar when you do not intend to be bountiful. [FN#16] Read an account of Tipu Sahib's treatment of his French employes. If Rangit Singh behaved better to his European officers, it was only on account of his paramount fear and hatred of the British. The Panjabi story of the old lion's death is amusing enough, contrasted with that Anglomania of which so much has been said and written. When the Sikh king, they declare, heard of our success in Afghanistan-he had allowed us a passage through his dominions, as ingress into a deadly trap-his spirits (metaphorically and literally) failed him; he had not the heart to drink, he sickened and he died. [FN#17] The Rajputs, for instance, [...] "whose land has ever been the focus of Indian chivalry, and the home of Indian heroes." [...] [FN#18] As my support against the possible, or rather the probable, imputation of [...] "extreme opinions," [...] I hold up the honoured name of the late Sir Henry Elliot (Preface to the Biographical Index to the Historians of Mohammedan India). [...] "These idle <b>vapourers</b> (bombastic Babus, and other such political ranters), should learn that the sacred spark of patriotism is exotic here, and can never fall on a mine that can explode; for history will show them that certain peculiarities of physical, as well as moral organisation, neither to be strengthened by diet nor improved by education, have hitherto prevented their ever attempting a national independence; which will continue to exist to them but as a name, and as an offscouring of college declamations." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1993 by violinist and {{composer}} Jane Harbour, whose classical and electronica influences met with the punk influences of Vann and Hunt.  Their early experiments centred around reworking traditional folk tunes, particularly those of the North of England, but Harbour's growing fascination with minimalist systems began to impact on the group and were evident {{by the time of}} the independently released Pole Star (1997), which fused both influences. The album was critically well received, and the band continued to play live, including writing and performing for theatre. However no further albums were released until the BBC's use of several Pole Star tracks brought them to the attention of manager Alan James and Real World Records, for whom they have recorded three further studio albums, Lightbox (2009), Kaleidophonica (2012) and Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow (2015). The latter two in particular largely feature original melodies and more intricate composition. Real World also re-released Pole Star (2014), a vinyl-only compilation album Repeater (2016) and a mini-album, The <b>Vapourer</b> (2013), with live recordings by the group and Moog versions of two of their compositions by Portishead's Adrian Utley.  The band have toured internationally, and in 2016 received nominations for the BBC Folk Awards and Songlines Awards.|$|E
40|$|A {{review is}} given of the {{recurrent}} outbreaks of the tentcaterpillar, Malacosoma neustria L., affecting the elm {{trees in the}} city of Amsterdam in the period 1930 — 1957. An outbreak of the brown tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea L., in 1935 — 1936 is also mentioned and some occasional loss of foliage through the caterpillars of the <b>vapourer</b> moth, Orgyia antiqua L. Large fluctuations {{in the size of the}} Malacosoma populations were found. After some years in which the damage was negligeable, the increase always started in the N. W. part of the centre of the city. In the following years the outbreaks moved to adjacent parts of the centre and finally sometimes even to more eccentric parts (see Fig. 6 — 9). However, the occurrence of really harmful numbers of tentcaterpillars was mostly restricted to the centre of the town. The merits of the control measures which were carried out with derris/talcum powder spread by motordusters are discussed. The insecticide was thought to be the only sufficiently harmless for its use in the centre of a city. Some cases of defoliation and other inconveniences caused by the presence of crowds of caterpillars could apparently be reduced by the control measures. In several instances, however, the efficacy of the method remained doubtful. The urgency is stressed of further studies of the bionomics of Malacosoma under local conditions and some suggestions are made for a better organization of the measures applied...|$|E
