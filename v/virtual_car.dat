40|$|Vehicle Satellite Navigation Systems {{are commonplace}} {{but from a}} safety point of view, can be problematic. They are {{situated}} on small screens and often placed at an angle which {{is not in the}} driver’s field of view. This promotes glances away from the road and reduces situational awareness for events which occur. Audio commands and visual maps which are used to instruct drivers typically require translation to situationally meaningful actions before execution in the real world. This increases the driver’s workload and risk of distraction. A <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> head-up display concept which is novel to this thesis is introduced. The design was motivated by issues in the literature regarding workload and risk of distraction and was shaped using a field study. Also, as head-up displays are becoming common in new vehicles, the benefits they offer have been explored {{in the design of the}} <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> head-up display. Navigation instructions would be embedded in a familiar object to the driver; a car image, to support driving practices (e. g. indicating, lane positioning and turning) which are absent in the abstract commands and visual maps employed by vehicle satellite navigation systems. The navigation instructions used by the <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> head-up display are easy to understand and can reduce the processing times for the instructions. For example, rather than translate audio commands e. g. “after 200 yards turn left”, the driver sees the <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> indicate left 200 yards from the turn and sees it turn left on arrival at the turn. Also, rather than translate complex visual maps, the driver replicates the actions of the <b>virtual</b> <b>car.</b> An initial prototype for the <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> head-up display was designed after which usability evaluation was carried out in a driving simulator to refine the concept. The first two studies were part of the design process and involved assessing the feasibility and conformity of the <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> head-up display. It was found that the <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> head-up display was an intelligible way to present the navigation instructions to drivers and that it was better to conform the <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> to the external environment. The third study compared the prototype of the <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> head-up display with the prototype of an arrow head-up display and vehicle satellite navigation system. It was found that the <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> head-up display had the least workload and risk of distraction and was the easiest to use.

We analyzed the manipulation of knobs, con-trols, flaps, mirrors and other components in a real car and classified them with respect to their constraints. Based on this classification, we developed a set of pseudo-physical direct interaction techniques, which closely approximate the real world behavior without employing a force-feedback device. Our approach uses a hierarchical grasp heuristic to decouple the interaction from the collision of the fingers with the <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> components. This approach makes the in-teraction more robust while no haptic feedback is available.

40|$|Although {{manipulating}} 3 D virtual {{models with}} mid-air hand gestures had {{the benefits of}} natural interactions and free from the sanitation problems of touch surfaces, many factors could influence the usability of such an interaction paradigm. In this research, the authors conducted experiments to study the vision-based mid-air hand gestures for scaling, translating, and rotating a 3 D <b>virtual</b> <b>car</b> displayed on a large screen. An Intel RealSense 3 D Camera was employed for hand gesture recognition. The two-hand gesture with grabbing then moving apart/close to each other was applied to enlarging/shrinking the 3 D <b>virtual</b> <b>car.</b> The one-hand gesture with grabbing then moving was applied to translating a car component. The two-hand gesture with grabbing and moving relatively along the circumference of a horizontal circle was applied to rotating the car. Seventeen graduate students {{were invited to participate}} in the experiments and offer their evaluations and comments for gesture usability. The results indicated that the width and depth of detection ranges were the key usability factors for two-hand gestures with linear motions. For dynamic gestures with quick transitions and motions from open to close hand poses, ensuring gesture recognition robustness was extremely important. Furthermore, given a gesture with ergonomic postures, inappropriate control-response ratio could result in fatigue due to repetitive exertions of hand gestures for achieving the precise controls of 3 D model manipulation tasks...|$|E

30|$|The {{available}} database {{is enormous}} {{but should be}} regarded inhomogeneous and, for some parts, as questionable. Some studies are based on modeled data (<b>virtual</b> <b>cars),</b> some on laboratory measurements with isolated engines, and some based on unified test schemes about actually driving the car. Some measurements were performed on laboratory test stands, others on real streets. They are also based on cars with various curb weights. Accordingly, there are strongly deviating results: Sullivan et al. [30], for example, resumed that, by 2015, diesel-driven cars will (still) have 14 % to 27 % less CO 2 emission due to a higher TTW efficiency, compared to petrol-fuelled cars and based on German certification data. But in reality, consumers preferred bigger motorization than modeled. A comparison by a German non-governmental organization revealed that certified CO 2 emissions of new diesel cars on German streets increased since 2000 and coincided with falling CO 2 emissions of new petrol-fuelled cars at 173 g CO 2 /km in 2006 (reviewed by Helmers [1]).|$|R
