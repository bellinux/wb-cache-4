Type of glucocorticoid and dose per pulse is not standardized, but usually consists of methylprednisolone 500 – 1000 mg per pulse or dexamethasone 100 – 200 mg per pulse. 2 Pulse therapy is usually given intravenously rather than orally, without {{evidence to support the}} necessity of the intravenous route. Oral therapy is preferable because it avoids <b>venipunctures,</b> decreases costs, and im-proves patient convenience.

25|$|<b>Venipuncture</b> {{is useful}} {{as it is}} a {{minimally}} invasive way to obtain cells and extracellular fluid (plasma) from the body for analysis. Blood flows throughout the body, acting as a medium which provides oxygen and nutrients to tissues and carries waste products back to the excretory systems for disposal. Consequently, the state of the bloodstream affects, or is affected by, many medical conditions. For these reasons, blood tests are the most commonly performed medical tests.|$|E

Results revealed no interaction and no main effects of condition or coping style. However, coping on caregiver-report of child pain approached significance. T-tests revealed significant differences between approach and avoidance coping styles, with children with an approach coping style experiencing significantly less pain compared to children with an avoidance coping style. Descriptive statistics revealed the presence of a mixed coping style, suggesting that children’s coping styles may be continuous.

40|$|Clinical and {{scientific}} work routinely relies on antecubital <b>venipunctures</b> for hematological, immunological or other analyses on blood.

Most surprisingly, we identified the greatest difference not to exist between arterial and venous circulation, but between the distal (radial artery & dorsal hand veins) and proximal (antecubital veins) sampling sites. Naïve T cells had a higher cell count distally compared to proximally and the reverse was true for effector memory T cells. Despite these differences there were high correlations between the different sampling sites, which partially supports our initial hypothesis. Our findings are crucial for the future design and interpretation of immunological research, and for clinical practice.

25|$|A {{peripheral}} cannula is {{the most}} common intravenous access method utilized in both hospitals and pre-hospital services. A peripheral IV line (PVC or PIV) consists of a short catheter (a few centimeters long) inserted through the skin into a peripheral vein (any vein not situated in the chest or abdomen). This is usually {{in the form of a}} cannula-over-needle device, in which a flexible plastic cannula comes mounted over a metal trocar. Once the tip of the needle and cannula are introduced into the vein via <b>venipuncture,</b> the cannula is advanced inside the vein over the trocar to the appropriate position and secured, the trocar is then withdrawn and discarded. Blood samples may be drawn directly after the initial IV cannula insertion.|$|E
25|$|The {{intravenous}} tubing {{leads to}} a room next to the execution chamber, usually separated from the condemned by a curtain or wall. Typically, a prison employee trained in <b>venipuncture</b> inserts the needle, while a second prison employee orders, prepares, and loads the drugs into the lethal injection syringes. Two other staff members take {{each of the three}} syringes and secure them into the IVs. After the curtain is opened to allow the witnesses to see inside the chamber, the condemned person is then permitted to make a final statement. Following this, the warden signals that the execution may commence, and the executioner(s) (either prison staff or private citizens depending on the jurisdiction) then manually inject the three drugs in sequence. During the execution, the condemned's cardiac rhythm is monitored. Death is pronounced after cardiac activity stops. Death usually occurs within seven minutes, although, due to complications in finding a suitable vein, the whole procedure can take up to two hours, {{as was the case with}} the execution of Christopher Newton on May 24, 2007. According to state law, if a physician's participation in the execution is prohibited for reasons of medical ethics, then the death ruling can be made by the state medical examiner's office. After confirmation that death has occurred, a coroner signs the condemned's death certificate.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{appraise}} critically and {{to synthesize}} existing Maternal Kangaroo Care (MKC) intervention studies for neonatal procedural pain. Methods Four electronic databases were systematically searched and eligible studies selected by two independent reviewers. Of 93 abstracts, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings were extracted and methodology assessed based on best-synthesis methodology. Results There {{is evidence that}} MKC can significantly reduce pain from a single pain procedure in full-term infants and stable preterm infants (> 26 weeks GA).

25|$|The {{standard}} U.S. {{medical school}} curriculum is four years long. Traditionally, {{the first two}} years are composed mainly of classroom basic science education, while the final two years primarily include rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand. Today, clinical education is spread across all four years with the final year containing the most clinical rotation time. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published mandatory rules, obliging on all inpatient and outpatient teaching settings, laying down the guidelines for what medical students in the United States may do, if they have not completed a clerkship or sub-internship. These rules apply to when they are in the clinical setting in school, not when they are, for example, helping staff events or in other non-formal educational settings, even if they are helping provide certain clinical services along with nurses and the supervising physicians- for example, certain basic screening procedures. In the formal clinical setting in school, they can only assist with certain patient evaluation and management tasks, after the vital signs, chief complaint and the history of present illness have been discerned, but prior to the physical examination: reviewing the patient's signs and symptoms in each body system, and then reviewing the patient's personal medical, genetic, family, educational/occupational, and psychosocial history. The student's supervising physician (or another physician with supervisory privileges if the original doctor is no longer available, for some reason) must be in the room during the student's work, and must conduct this same assessment of the patient before performing the actual physical examination, and after finishing and conferring with the student, will review his or her notes and opinion, editing or correcting them if necessary, and will also have his or her own professional notes; both must then sign and date and I.D. the student's notes and the medical record. They may observe, but not perform, physical examinations, surgeries, endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures, radiological or nuclear medicine procedures, oncology sessions, and obstetrics. The patient must give consent for their presence and participation in his or her care, even at a teaching facility. Depending on the time they have completed in school, their familiarity with the area of medicine and the procedure, and the presence of their supervisor, and any others needed, in the room or nearby, they may be allowed to conduct certain very minor tests associated with the physical examination, such as simple <b>venipuncture</b> blood draws, and electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms, for learning and experience purposes, especially when there is no intern or resident available.|$|E

40|$|Background: Multiple {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest repeated painful procedures {{early in life}} may permanently disrupt the developing central nervous system. Painful diagnostic, medical, and minor surgical procedures performed in the neonatal intensive care unit such as <b>venipunctures,</b> heel lances, immunizations, and central venous catheter insertion are {{a significant portion of}} painful events experienced by infants. The objective of this systematic review is to synthesize findings from published clinical trials evaluating the effect of repeated painful procedures experienced during the plasticity of the developing peripheral and central nervous system and their influence on future pain responsivity. Methodology/Principal Findings: A systematic review of peer-refereed clinical trials was conducted. Clinical trials examining the effect of repeated painful procedures experienced during the plasticity of the developing peripheral and central nervous system and their influence on future pain responsivity were identified from electronic databases PUBMED, MEDLINE and CINAHL. Application of inclusion/exclusion criteria and limitations identified five clinical trials for critical reviewed. Findings suggest that repetitive pain experienced during a critical window of neuro- development alters the structure and function of an infant’s nervous system, influences subsequent pain responses through childhood and may {{contribute to the development of}} chronic pain. Conclusions: Current research asserts that inadequate relief of infant pain and distress during tissue-damaging procedures may permanently decrease an individual’s pain tolerance, and increase pain responses later in life...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionEstablishing an {{effective}} midline program {{involves more than}} simply learning an insertion technique for a new product. Midline catheters provide a reliable vascular access option for those patients with difficult venous access who would otherwise require multiple <b>venipunctures</b> {{or the use of}} higher-risk central lines to maintain access. An effective midline program establishes a protocol for device selection and includes standing orders to facilitate speed to placement. MethodsOur retrospective descriptive review evaluated the successful integration of midline programs into existing vascular access bedside insertion programs in 2 acute care hospitals. The investigator reviewed a convenience sample of hospital patients. Participants in the study included vascular access team managers and team members from the sample sites. ResultsThe results of this 2 -hospital study demonstrate successful integration of a midline program into a bedside insertion program with 0 midline-related infections since initiation. Documentation of overall central line-associated bloodstream infection rates for hospital 1 changed from 1. 7 / 1000 catheter-days to 0. 2 / 1000 catheter-days, reflecting a 78 % reduction in infections and a projected cost avoidance of $ 531, 570 annually. Both hospitals demonstrated reduced rates of infection following implementation of a midline program. ConclusionsMidlines have a history of lower risk for both infection and thrombosis compared with central venous devices. Although more research is needed on the more recently developed midline catheters, available evidence suggests that midlines provide a safe and reliable form of vascular access, reducing costs and the risk of infection associated with central venous catheters, especially those placed solely for patients with difficult venous access...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the AV fistula and the use of interposition graft little improvement has been made in the vascular access field. Still, vascular access related complications, {{are one of the most}} important reasons for patient hospitalization, morbidity and even mortality (1, 2). Interestingly, the costs of vascular access related care was found to be more than fivefold higher for patients with AVG compared with patients with a functioning AVF (3). In an attempt to improve overall patency rates and reduce access related costs, the NFK-DOQI committee currently recommends that in any dialysis center the majority of new dialysis patients should have a primary AVF constructed (4, 5). Unfortunately, creation of an AVF is not always possible as a consequence of prior vascular access surgery, insufficient caliber of forearm vessels or sclerosis caused by prior <b>venipunctures.</b> Although less thrombotic and infectious complications occur in AVF, the AVF is not ideal, i. e. 100 % successful. Adequate maturation of AVF, i. e. sufficient dilatation and arterialization, fails in up to 30 % of all newly created fistulae, resulting in delayed initiation of dialysis treatment or placement of temporary central venous dialysis catheters, and related morbidity (6 - 10). Optimalization of patient selection could improve AVF patency rates and access related morbidity. Considering the increasing age of hemodialysis patients, prolongation of the dialysis therapy, and the worldwide increase of the number of patients requiring hemodialysis, the number of AV grafts will probably increase rather than decrease. As a consequence, vascular access complications, particularly thrombosis, will continue to challenge vascular access care in the future...|$|R
