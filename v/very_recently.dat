5|$|Female {{sexuality}} {{is often not}} adequately represented in texts and documents. Until <b>very</b> <b>recently,</b> much {{of what has been}} documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} {{has changed}} significantly {{since the first}} taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. One {{of the greatest challenges}} has been the classification of the aye-aye, which has been a topic of debate up until <b>very</b> <b>recently.</b> Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. However, the placement of the aye-aye within the order Primates remained problematic until <b>very</b> <b>recently.</b> Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates. Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes, and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.|$|E
5|$|After a {{successful}} (8–1–1) football season in 1955, Tech {{was invited to}} play in the 1956 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against the University of Pittsburgh. It would be the school's fifth straight bowl appearance under renowned coach Bobby Dodd. Pittsburgh had a black starting player, fullback Bobby Grier, but as Tech had played a 1953 game against a desegregated Notre Dame team, and the University of Georgia had <b>very</b> <b>recently</b> played out-of-state games against desegregated opponents, president Van Leer and the Tech Athletic Association saw the game's contract as acceptable. However, racial tension in the South was high following the recent Brown v. Board of Education decision. Georgia Governor Marvin Griffin had privately given Dodd his support, but he surprised the campus and the state on Friday, December 2, 1955 by bowing to pressure from segregationists and sending a wire to the Georgia Board of Regents chairman, Robert O. Arnold, requesting not only that Tech not play the game, but that all University System of Georgia teams play only segregated games.|$|E

5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only <b>very</b> <b>recently</b> that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The mouse {{reference}} genome has {{at least}} 21 distinct Mup genes (with open reading frames), and a further 21 Mup pseudogenes (with reading frames disrupted by a nonsense mutation or an incomplete gene duplication). They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 megabases of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral Class A Mups, and 15 central Class B Mups. The central Class B Mup gene cluster formed {{through a number of}} sequential duplications from one of the Class A Mups. As all the Class B genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred <b>very</b> <b>recently</b> in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means {{they are likely to be}} unstable and may vary in number among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more different from each other and are therefore likely to be more stable, older genes but what, if any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using current DNA sequencing technology. Consequently, the Mup gene cluster is one of the few parts of the mouse whole genome sequence with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.|$|E
