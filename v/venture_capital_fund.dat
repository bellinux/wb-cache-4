500|$|Nobumasa Yokoo, former {{banker who}} {{had dealt with}} Olympus when he worked for Nomura, is also cited as being behind certain other of the {{transactions}} under the spotlight. Having founded Global Company in the late 1990s, he persuaded Olympus to invest ¥30billion in their <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>fund</b> in 2000. In 2003, Olympus made a piecemeal acquisition of an information technology group, ITX. Akinobu Yokoo, Yokoo's older brother, was chief financial officer for ITX. The elder Yokoo became a group executive officer after Olympus became majority owners. Nobumasa Yokoo also introduced three small, unprofitable companies {{in which he was}} shareholder and executive that Olympus acquired for ¥73.4billion – News Chef, a maker of microwave cookware, Altis and Humalabo. According to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Olympus acquired the companies from Cayman Island-based funds between 2007 and 2010. Nikkei Business reported informed sources deriding these as [...] "shell companies". Part of the transaction took place on 25 April 2008, when Olympus paid the equivalent of 7million to funds named Dynamic Dragons II and Global Targets. Seventeen Cayman and BVI special purpose vehicles were used to make payments; funds flowed through Commerzbank AG, Societe Generale SA and LGT Bank. The WSJ noted that there were a large number of frequent and complex corporate changes (name and ownership) but determined from the paper trail that Dynamic Dragons II [...] "was part of a network of elusive Japanese firms and financiers that often invested together, and whose ties and identities were constantly shifting." [...] Kenji Takasago, associate professor at Kobe University suggested the complexity of the scheme was to obscure the money trail.|$|E
