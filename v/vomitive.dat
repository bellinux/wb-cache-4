5000|$|Writing for AllMusic, Blake Butler rated Tomahawk {{four stars}} out of five, {{describing}} the album as [...] "moody, violent, beautiful, sarcastic, <b>vomitive,</b> silly and heartstopping". Butler praised Patton's versatility, calling the vocalist [...] "a complete and utter musical visionary, and a mind-blowing and standard-warping genius". Pitchfork Luke Buckman award the album {{a rating of}} 7 out of 10, similarly highlighting Patton's vocals as exemplary. Buckman called Patton [...] "one of the greatest male vocalists around today"; and felt that [...] "Flashback" [...] and [...] "Cul de Sac" [...] were among the album's best songs. Mark Reed of Drowned in Sound rated the album 8 out of 10, noting the [...] "wit" [...] and [...] "style" [...] of the songwriting. Reed felt that the album {{was among the most}} conventional of those recorded by Patton, but still described it as featuring [...] "supercatchy, earstretching vocals, dark lyrics rich in black humour, swathes of crunchy guitars and some of the most unusual rhythms to be played by human hands since time began".|$|E
40|$|An ethnobotanical {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in two phases in the Dja region in 1995 and 2000. A total of 63 herbalists prescribed 45 plants and 84 recipes {{in the treatment of}} jaundice. These plants are distributed in 44 genera and 31 botanical families. The fact that a same plant species be mentioned by different persons or by the same persons after five years for treating the same ailment, is a credibility index which can be attributed to that plant species. Annickia chlorantha, Harungana madagascariensis, Carica papaya, Bidens pilosa, Cassia alata, Coffea canephora, Emilia coccinea are such plant species. A. chlorantha and H. madagascariensis are also confirmed in the literature to possess effective chemical compounds against jaundice. Some 34. 5 % of the recipes cited were also indicated by healers to possess diuretic, purgative or <b>vomitive</b> effect. Such effects are confirmed in the literature for E. coccinea and H. madagascariensis. These results lead credibility to the folk medicine use in the Dja Reserve, and to the method used to identify medicinal plants indicated in traditional medicine. Â© 2009 Academic Journals.
