5|$|On a {{hard pitch}} in <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather,</b> Small Heath had already conceded twice at Blackburn Rovers before Billy Ollis was injured {{midway through the}} first half and played no further part. The {{visitors}} put up a fight, but the numerical disavantage was too much for them and the final score of 9–1 remains the club's joint-record losing margin. With no competitive fixture scheduled for the next two weeks, the club undertook a tour. Their opening match, in Plymouth, was the first visit of a professional club to the south-west of England. The Home Park club had ambitions to bring professional league football to the region, and in front of a crowd of 4,000 their team performed well before conceding three second-half goals. Small Heath's tour ended with a 2–1 defeat at Manchester City, and they returned to a celebratory dinner in honour of the club's promotion to the First Division. The chairman presented medals to the players, congratulated them on their showing thus far, and proposed a toast to their health, in the hope that a full-strength team might be available by the next League match in ten days time.|$|E
25|$|The {{ocean is}} at its coldest in February or early March, thus around coastal areas February is often the coldest month, but inland {{there is little to}} choose between February and January as the coldest. Temperatures tend to drop lowest on late winter nights inland, in the {{presence}} of high pressure, clear skies, light winds and when there is snow on the ground. On occasions, cold polar or continental air can be drawn in over the United Kingdom to bring <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
25|$|The German {{defenders}} {{had prepared}} {{the area with}} blockhouses, minefields, barbed wire, and booby-traps, hidden by the snow. There were also numerous bunkers in the area, mostly belonging to the deep defenses of the Siegfried Line, which were also centers of resistance. The dense forest allowed infiltration and flanking attacks and it was sometimes difficult to establish a front line or to be confident that an area had been cleared of the enemy. The small numbers of routes and clearings had also allowed German machine-gun, mortar and artillery teams to pre-range their weapons and fire accurately. Apart from the bad and <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather,</b> the dense forest and rough terrain also prevented proper use of the Allied air superiority, which presented great difficulties in spotting any targets.|$|E
5000|$|Laumės were dangerous, {{especially}} to men. They could tickle or tweak {{them to death}} and then eat their bodies, {{and in this way}} they were similar to Lamia of Greek mythology. The Lithuanian myth also claimed Laumės kept huge cows which could be milked by all people. However, after <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weathers,</b> the cows died; pieces of belemnitida were considered to be the remains of their udders. Laumės were afraid of tools made from iron.|$|R

25|$|The {{viscosity}} {{requirement of}} diesel fuel is usually specified at 40°C. A disadvantage of diesel {{as a vehicle}} fuel in cold climates is that its viscosity increases as the temperature decreases, changing it into a gel (see Compression Ignition – Gelling) that cannot flow in fuel systems. Special low-temperature diesel contains additives to keep it liquid at lower temperatures, but starting a diesel engine in <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> may still pose considerable difficulties. Another disadvantage of diesel engines compared to petrol/gasoline engines {{is the possibility of}} diesel engine runaway failure. Since diesel engines do not need spark ignition, they can run as long as diesel fuel is supplied. Fuel is typically supplied via a fuel pump. If the pump breaks down in an open position, the supply of fuel will be unrestricted, and the engine will run away and risk terminal failure.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, {{the regiment}} traveled another [...] in <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> before {{searching for a}} suitable place to make camp. Lieutenant Jeremiah Davidson of the advance guard {{was in charge of}} selecting a camp site. Proceeding with a guide far ahead of the advance guard, he suddenly found himself surrounded by five rebels. Davidson deceived the rebels, saying he was scouting for a campsite for Colonel Albert G. Jenkins' (rebel) cavalry. He also said that he got his blue uniform from a [...] "Yankee". Satisfied, the rebels let Davidson proceed. Shortly thereafter, the rebels saw the rest of the advance guard of the 2nd Virginia Cavalry, and fled into the woods. The rebels were all captured, including a lieutenant captured by Major Powell. The regiment continued {{to the top of the}} mountain in extreme cold. [...] A snow storm began that night (possibly earlier), and it was still snowing on the morning of the 26th.|$|E
500|$|The nest hole {{is usually}} [...] {{high in a}} tree and is lined with fur, fine grass, and {{shredded}} bark. The clutch is 5 to 9 eggs which are creamy-white, speckled with reddish brown, and average [...] in size. The eggs are incubated by the female for 13 to 14days prior to hatching, and the altricial chicks fledge in a further 18 to 26days. Both adults feed the chicks in the nest and {{for about two weeks}} after fledging, and the male also feeds the female while she is incubating. Once independent, juveniles leave the adults' territory and either establish their own territory or become [...] "floaters", unpaired birds without territories. It is probably these floaters which are mainly involved in the irregular dispersals of this species. This species of nuthatch roosts in tree holes or behind loose bark when not breeding and has the unusual habit of removing its feces from the roost site in the morning. It usually roosts alone except in <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather,</b> when up to 29birds have been recorded together.|$|E

50|$|Lake Laberge is a {{widening}} of the Yukon River north of Whitehorse, Yukon in Canada. It is fifty kilometres long and ranges {{from two to}} five kilometres wide. Its water is always <b>very</b> <b>cold,</b> and its <b>weather</b> often harsh and suddenly variable.|$|R
50|$|The general {{shape of}} the tree is conical with tiered, {{horizontal}} branches that are often somewhat pendulous toward the tips. Cunninghamia bears softly spined, leathery, stiff, green to blue-green needle-like leaves that spiral around the stem with an upward arch; they are 2-7 cm long and 3-5 mm broad at the base, and bear two white or greenish-white stomatal bands underneath and sometimes also above. The foliage may turn bronze-tinted in <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> winter <b>weather.</b>|$|R

2500|$|During the winter, {{other sites}} {{continuously}} operate cooling towers with [...] water leaving the tower. [...] Basin heaters, tower draindown, and other freeze protection methods are often employed in cold climates. Operational cooling towers with malfunctions can freeze during <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather.</b> Typically, freezing {{starts at the}} corners of a cooling tower with a reduced or absent heat load. Severe freezing conditions can create growing volumes of ice, resulting in increased structural loads which can cause structural damage or collapse.|$|E
50|$|Like much of {{the south}} Atlantic region of the United States, Yulee has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen Cfa), with mild weather during winters and hot and humid weather during summers. Seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months from May through September, while the driest months are from November through April. Due to Yulee's low latitude and proximity to the coast it allows for <b>very</b> little <b>cold</b> <b>weather,</b> and winters are typically mild and sunny.|$|R
5000|$|It {{gained the}} common name of [...] "snorkel parka" [...] because the hood can be zipped right up {{leaving only a}} small tunnel (or snorkel) for the wearer to look out of. This is {{particularly}} effective in <b>very</b> <b>cold,</b> windy <b>weather</b> although it has the added liabilities of seriously limiting the field of vision and hearing. Earlier (Vietnam-era) hoods had genuine fur ruffs on the hoods; later versions used synthetic furs. Original manufacturers of this parka for the government included Skyline, Southern Athletic, Lancer, Greenbrier, Workroom For Designers, Alpha, and Avirex.|$|R
50|$|On April 23, Michael Pineda started {{another game}} against the Red Sox. This game was away at Fenway Park. Not unlike the start against the Boston Red Sox on April 10, Pineda had another foreign {{substance}} on his body. Shockingly, {{it was a large}} amount of the substance on his neck. This occurred in the second inning, as the Red Sox manager John Farrell decided to appeal against the pitcher. As a result, umpire Gerry Davis examined the substance on Michael Pineda's neck. The substance was indeed pine tar, an illegal foreign substance. Thus, Davis immediately ejected Michael Pineda from the game and Pineda was put on a 10-game suspension. The controversy triggered analysts to discuss the possibility of Major League Baseball changing the rules and making a small amount of pine tar available for pitchers to use in <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weathers</b> to gain a grip on the ball. However, the substance wouldn't be allowed in decent weather. Analysts believe the rule, if looked into, could be made effective as of the 2015 season. Pineda took responsibility for cheating, however, and claimed that he would learn from his mistake.|$|R
2500|$|... 18 {{players are}} {{permitted}} to take the field for each team, with an additional four players on an interchange bench (although this number often varies in exhibition and practice matches). The equipment needed {{to play the game}} is minimal. As in other kinds of football, players wear boots with stops (known as [...] "cleats" [...] or [...] "studs" [...] in some regions) in the soles, shorts, and a thick, strong shirt or jumper known as a guernsey, normally sleeveless, although long sleeve jumpers are sometimes worn in <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> by some players.|$|E

2500|$|One popular [...] "upgrade" [...] {{to older}} (and even new) Yugos is autogas (LPG) {{conversion}} which has gained widespread popularity in Serbia. Because most Yugos do not feature fuel injection, converting them to LPG is cheap and easy, and is paid off very quickly. One drawback of such conversions {{is that an}} already small trunk becomes almost useless, since an LPG tank takes up space. Such converted cars achieve better reliability since use of an unreliable gasoline pump is avoided. However, some cars have starting problems in <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather,</b> because of improper LPG installation.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{photochromic}} compounds fade back {{to their}} clear state by a thermal process, the higher the temperature, the less dark photochromic lenses will be. This thermal effect is called [...] "temperature dependency" [...] and prevents these devices from achieving true sunglass darkness in very hot weather. Conversely, photochromic lenses will get <b>very</b> dark in <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> conditions. Once inside, away from the triggering UV light, the cold lenses take longer to regain their transparency than warm lenses.|$|R

Bluff {{is at the bottom}} of the middle island, and is away down south, nearly fort y-seven degrees below the equator. It lies as far south of the line as Quebec lies north of it, and the climates of the two should be alike; but for some reason or other it has not been so arranged. Quebec is hot in the summer and cold in the winter, but Bluff's climate is less intense; the <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> is not <b>very</b> <b>cold,</b> the hot <b>weather</b> is not very hot; and the difference between the hottest month and the coldest is but 17 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|R
2500|$|Hargeisa has a {{semi-arid}} climate (Köppen: BSh). The city generally features warm winters and hot summers.
