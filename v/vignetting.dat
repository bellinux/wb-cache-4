5|$|As all lens systems, natural <b>vignetting</b> (gradual {{reduction}} of an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the focal length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens <b>vignetting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Light falloff is also {{sensitive}} to f-stop. Many wide-angle lenses will show a significant light falloff (<b>vignetting)</b> {{at the edges}} for large apertures.|$|E
25|$|Left 4 Dead {{uses the}} 2008 version of Valve's Source engine, with {{improvements}} such as multi-core processor support and physics-based animation to more realistically portray hair and clothing, {{and to improve}} physics interaction with enemies when shot or shoved in different body parts. Animation was also improved to allow characters to lean realistically when moving in curved paths. Rendering and artificial intelligence were scaled up {{to allow for a}} greater number of enemies who can navigate the world in better ways, such as climbing, jumping, or breaking obstacles. Lighting was enhanced with new self-shadowing normal mapping and advanced shadow rendering that is important to convey information about the environment and player actions. Wet surfaces and fog are used to create mood. Many kinds of post processing cinematic visual effects inspired by horror movies {{have been added to the}} game. There is dynamic color correction that accentuates details based on importance, contrast and sharpening to focus attention on critical areas, film grain to expose details or imply details in dark areas and <b>vignetting</b> to evoke tension and a horror-film look.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Denial" [...] was {{directed}} by Harvey B-Brown. It was his first solo video project, following the discontinuation of his 18-year partnership with Carolyn Corben. The video was produced by Francesca Barnes, while Tom Gander served as the art director. It was shot in various formats, including 16 mm film, Bolex, Super 8 film and three still cameras. Aman King, a smoke artist from Golden Square, collaborated with Brown to devise treatments of the stills. Multiple film effects {{were used in the}} video, including colour correction, <b>vignetting</b> and film grain, with the intention of creating visuals inspired by Vogue. It premiered on the Sugababes' official website on 7 January 2008.|$|E
500|$|Legion {{was filmed}} with Arri Alexa cameras, with two Alexa XT cameras and an Alexa Mini {{used for the}} pilot and then Minis used {{for the rest of}} the season; the footage was {{captured}} in 4K Ultra-high-definition. Gonzales described the series as [...] "essentially a one-camera show", but [...] "if we can get a bonus view [...] that doesn’t compromise the look of A-camera, that’s great." [...] Lenses for the series were a mixture of spherical and anamorphic, including a 9.8 Kinoptik camera lens to film [...] "some of the more bizarre mindscapes", which Kubrick used to film A Clockwork Orange. The Kinoptik lenses caused <b>vignetting,</b> which Gonzales would crop out of the image in post-production, though sometimes [...] "we just left it" [...] to add character. The series changes aspect ratio to reflect Haller's state of mind, [...] "going narrower when he feels boxed in by the nefarious forces pursuing him", though Gonzales [...] "didn’t always want the anamorphics to make the audience feel this big jump, but I wanted these subtle differences like the background bokeh to be a little different." [...] The season's [...] "memory work" [...] sequences were filmed with anamorphic lenses, but were then cropped to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Gonzales and Hawley both [...] "don’t care too much for" [...] steadicams, and instead relied on jib arms, dollies, and 30-foot technocranes, both on set and location. The production also made extensive use of a Ronin camera stabilizer, allowing the camera to be moved around by camera men and transitioned between hand use and cranes without endangering the camera operators.|$|E
40|$|Text-to-scene {{conversion}} requires {{knowledge about}} how actions and locations {{are expressed in}} language and realized in the world. To provide this knowlege, we are creating a lexical resource (<b>VigNet)</b> that extends FrameNet by creating a set of intermediate frames (vignettes) that bridge between the high-level semantics of FrameNet frames and {{a new set of}} low-level primitive graphical frames. Vignettes {{can be thought of as}} a link between function and form – between what a scene means and what it looks like. In this paper, we describe the set of primitive graphical frames and the functional properties of 3 D objects (affordances) we use in this decomposition. We examine the methods and tools we have developed to populate <b>VigNet</b> with a large number of action and location vignettes...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to an aperture stop, a photographic lens may have one or more field stops, which limit the system's field of view.

6000|$|The portrait, I {{have already}} said, {{was that of}} a young girl. It was a mere head and shoulders, done in what is {{technically}} termed a vignette manner; much {{in the style of the}} favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the bosom, and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole. The frame was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque. As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. But it could have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me. Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person. I saw at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the <b>vignetting,</b> and of the frame, must have instantly dispelled such idea--must have prevented even its momentary entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted upon the portrait. At length, satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed. I had found the spell of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at first startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me. With deep and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position. The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories. Turning to the number which designated the oval portrait, I there read the vague and quaint words which follow: ...|$|E

5000|$|Unlike the {{previous}} types, natural <b>vignetting</b> (also known as natural illumination falloff) {{is not due}} to the blocking of light rays.

Wideangle rangefinder designs and the lens designs used in compact cameras are particularly prone to natural <b>vignetting.</b> Telephoto lenses, retrofocus wideangle lenses used on SLR cameras, and telecentric designs in general are less troubled by natural <b>vignetting.</b> A gradual grey filter or postprocessing techniques may be used to compensate for natural <b>vignetting,</b> as it cannot be cured by stopping down the lens. Some modern lenses are specifically designed so that the light strikes the image parallel or nearly so, eliminating or greatly reducing <b>vignetting.</b>|$|E
