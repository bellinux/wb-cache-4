In addition, this <b>Mediation</b> <b>System</b> is unsuited in presenting a metric that measures the level of confidence of security access rights. This creates a black-box perspective from the client towards the <b>Mediation</b> <b>System</b> and also gives no assurance to these clients that they have assigned the proper security access rights that reflect the current environment of the <b>mediation</b> <b>system.</b> ^ This dissertation presents a Collaborative Information System (CIS) that uses an agent based approach to encapsulate collaborative information and security policies within the <b>Mediation</b> <b>System</b> which are {{under the control of}} the clients of the <b>Mediation</b> <b>System.</b> In conjunction with the CIS 2 ̆ 7 s Stochastic Security Framework it is possible to take a probabilistic approach in modeling the security access rights of a collaboration transaction. The research results showed that it is feasible to construct a <b>Mediation</b> <b>System</b> utilizing agents and stochastic equations to establish an environment where the client has authority and administrative control in assigning security access rights to their collaborative data that can establish a metric that measures the level of confidence of these assigned rights. ...|$|R

While such techniques help data sharing among different sources, they {{increase the risk}} for data security, such as violating access control rules. Successful protection of information by an effective access control mechanism is a basic requirement for interoperation among heterogeneous data sources. ^ This dissertation first identified the challenges in the <b>mediation</b> <b>system</b> {{in order to achieve}} both interoperability and security in the interconnected and collaborative computing environment, which includes: (1) context-awareness, (2) semantic heterogeneity, and (3) multiple security policy specification. Currently few existing approaches address all three security challenges in <b>mediation</b> <b>system.</b> This dissertation provides a modeling and architectural {{solution to the problem of}} mediation security that addresses the aforementioned security challenges. A context-aware flexible authorization framework was developed in the dissertation to deal with security challenges faced by <b>mediation</b> <b>system.</b> The authorization framework consists of two major tasks, specifying security policies and enforcing security policies. Firstly, the security policy specification provides a generic and extensible method to model the security policies with respect to the challenges posed by the <b>mediation</b> <b>system.</b> The security policies in this study are specified by 5 -tuples followed by a series of authorization constraints, which are identified based on the relationship of the different security components in the <b>mediation</b> <b>system.</b> Two essential features of <b>mediation</b> <b>systems,</b> i. e., relationship among authorization components and interoperability among heterogeneous data sources, are the focus of this investigation. Secondly, this dissertation supports effective access control on <b>mediation</b> <b>systems</b> while providing uniform access for heterogeneous data sources. The dynamic security constraints are handled in the authorization phase instead of the authentication phase, thus the maintenance cost of security specification can be reduced compared with related solutions. ...|$|R

Objectives: The objective of this thesis is to identify the key requirements for databases that can be used as part of <b>Mediation</b> <b>systems,</b> gain a thorough understanding of various features, the data models commonly used in databases and to benchmark their performance. Methods: Previous work that has been carried out on various databases is studied as a part of literature review. Test bed is set up as a part of experiment and performance metrics such as throughput and total time taken were measured through a Java based client. Thorough analysis has been carried out by varying various parameters like data volumes, number of threads in the client etc. Results: Cassandra has a very good write performance for event and batch operations. Cassandra has a slightly better read performance when compared to MySQL Cluster but this differentiation withers out in case of fewer number of threads in the client. Conclusions: On evaluation of MySQL Cluster and Cassandra we conclude that they have several features that are suitable for <b>mediation</b> <b>systems.</b> On the other hand, Cassandra does not guarantee ACID transactions while MySQL Cluster has good support.
