40|$|A new {{implementation}} of a Computational Aeroacoustics formulation, based on Lighthill’s Analogy, has been <b>validated</b> <b>on</b> two physical tests. The implementation involves sequential solutions, first of a static CFD, followed by a transient CFD, followed by the acoustical propagation. All of the solutions are performed using finite element methods, and the acoustic sources are integrated directly onto the acoustic mesh from within the CFD, not interpolated afterwards. The process is <b>validated</b> <b>on</b> both an engine cooling fan installed in a mock hood and cooling package, and on a single-blade, self-propelled, walk-behind lawn mower...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{take full}} {{advantage}} of future HPC systems, hybrid parallelization strategies are required. In a previous work, we demonstrated the Divide and Conquer, D&C, approach for efficient parallelization of finite element methods on unstructured meshes. In this paper we experiment the concept of proto-application as a proxy between computer scientists and application de- velopers on a real industrial use-case. The D&C library has been entirely developed on the proto-application and then <b>validated</b> <b>on</b> the original application. We also ported the D&C library to another fluid dynamic application, AETHER, developed by Dassault Aviation. The results show that the speed-up <b>validated</b> <b>on</b> the proto-application can be reproduced on other full scale applications using similar computational patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} of thermal reaction furnaces of Sulfur Recovery Units (SRUs) {{is a rather}} complex problemsince it involves different modeling scales such as the kinetic/molecular scale, the reactor scale, andthe chemical process scale. This work introduces the multi-scale modeling approach to characterize thekinetic and reaction engineering scales for the thermal section of SRUs, involving the reactor furnaceand the waste heat boiler. Specifically, also the waste heat boiler is modeled using detailed kineticsto characterize the recombination effects, which cannot be neglected any longer since they significantlyinfluence the outlet compositions. The proposed models are <b>validated</b> <b>on</b> experimental and literature datafor the kinetic scale. The reactor scale is <b>validated</b> <b>on</b> the industrial data coming from SRUs operating inNanjing and Mumbai plants...|$|R
