25|$|In 2014 Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania {{notified}} the European Commission that they consider Australia requires a visa for their citizens.

40|$|Between 2009 and 2010, five Western Balkan {{countries}} were granted Schengen <b>visa</b> <b>exemptions</b> by the EU {{for the short}} travel of their citizens to the Schengen area in return for signing readmission agreements. Turkey, in contrast, was only offered a vague promise for the initiation of a visa liberalisation “dialogue” in return for initialling the readmission agreement. Taking this development as a genuine research puzzle the present article asks: What are the domestic dynamics that have driven this differential outcome? This article argues that the EU’s ongoing restrictive visa regime towards Turkey stems from the issue’s securitisation in certain member states (Germany, Austria and the Netherlands). Security-framing practices thereby occurred in both the political (elite-level discourse) and bureaucratic arena (visa-issuing process) {{as part of the}} same security dispositif. Two crucial implications follow from the findings: on the one hand, European visa authorities seem to follow their own visa-issuing policies despite regulations put in force at the EU level (Visa Codex). On the other hand, the purported theoretical divide between the Copenhagen and Paris School’s approaches to securitisation seems empirically rather disadvantageous. Treating these theoretical lenses as distinct may lead researchers to miss out on interrelated securitisation practices...|$|R
5000|$|The EU Commissioner of Interior Affairs Cecilia Malmström {{indicated}} on 29 September 2011 that visa requirement for Turkish citizens {{will eventually be}} discontinued. Visa liberalisation will be ushered in several phases. Initial changes were expected {{in the autumn of}} 2011, which would include the reduction of visa paperwork, more multi-entry visas, and extended stay periods. In June 2012, the EU authorised the beginning of negotiations with Turkey on <b>visa</b> <b>exemptions</b> for its citizens. Turkish EU Minister Egemen Bağış stated that he expected the process to take 3-4 years. The current visa policy of the EU is a cause of much concern for Turkish businessmen, politicians and Turks with family members in the EU. Egemen Bağış described the situation as: [...] "Even non-candidate countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia are currently negotiating for visa-free travel." [...] In September 2012, Turkish Economy Minister Zafer Çağlayan, during a meeting at the WKÖ, said: [...] "We have had a Customs Union for 17 years, and half of our (Turkey's) external trade is with Europe. Our goods can move freely, but a visa is required for the owner of the goods. This is a violation of human rights." ...|$|R
25|$|Many {{individuals}} who would need visas {{to enter the}} UK can transit though the UK to another destination without a <b>visa,</b> but this <b>exemption</b> is not available to those wishing to travel through the UK to Ireland. Visa nationals wishing to transit though the UK to Ireland must have a valid UK visa (in addition to an Irish visa if necessary) and pass though UK immigration before continuing their journey.|$|R
25|$|Canadians {{who want}} to work in the U.S. with {{intention}} to immigrate to the U.S., or who are ineligible for TN status, can also work under the H-1B status. Unlike other nationalities, they are exempted from obtaining the physical visa from a U.S. embassy or consulate. Apart from the <b>visa</b> <b>exemption,</b> other procedures are the same with all foreign nationals.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>visa</b> <b>exemption</b> period, Australian {{citizens}} {{are permitted to}} work in Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden. In addition, Australian citizens intending to stay and work in Estonia for up to 90 days can do so without a visa {{as long as the}} employer has completed a 'registration of short-term employment'.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania {{notified}} the European Commission that they consider Australia requires a visa for their citizens.

50|$|As an {{alternative}} to obtaining a New Zealand passport, New Zealand citizens with another nationality and a foreign passport/travel document can apply for an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship from Immigration New Zealand (INZ). The endorsement can either be physically affixed inside the foreign passport/travel document or can be electronically linked in INZ's database to the foreign passport/travel document. An endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship is valid {{for the duration of}} the foreign passport/travel document it is endorsed in or electronically linked to. An endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship costs NZ$130 for first time applications and NZ$80 for subsequent applications, which means that it is cheaper than obtaining a regular adult New Zealand passport. The fee for the endorsement is completely waived if electronically linked to or affixed inside a passport issued by Austria, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Italy or Turkey. Given that the maximum validity of New Zealand passports is 10 years for adults and 5 years for under 16 year olds, an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship may work out to be an even more economic option if affixed inside or linked electronically to a foreign passport/travel document which has a longer validity (e.g. 10 years). It is also easier to obtain an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship than a New Zealand passport overseas, since an endorsement can be issued at INZ offices in Apia, Bangkok, Beijing, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong, Jakarta, London, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Nuku’alofa, Pretoria, Shanghai, Singapore, Suva, Sydney and Taipei, whilst New Zealand passports are only issued overseas by the Department of Internal Affairs in Sydney and London. However, New Zealand citizens with dual/multiple nationality travelling on a passport/travel document issued by another country may be unable to access New Zealand consular assistance whilst overseas and may not be able to enjoy as many <b>visa</b> <b>exemptions.</b> For example, a dual New Zealand and Samoan citizen travelling only on a Samoan passport with an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship affixed inside is unable to obtain a Special Category Visa (SCV) upon arrival in Australia and must obtain an Australian visitor visa before travelling, since to obtain an SCV a New Zealand citizen must present a valid New Zealand passport.|$|R
