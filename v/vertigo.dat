5|$|<b>Vertigo</b> {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of <b>vertigo</b> is benign paroxysmal positional <b>vertigo,</b> when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} <b>vertigo.</b>|$|E

5|$|U2's 2005–2006 <b>Vertigo</b> Tour was {{preceded by}} several complications. A sudden illness to the Edge's {{daughter}} nearly resulted in the tour's cancellation, before the group decided to adjust the tour schedule to accommodate her treatment. Additionally, ticket presales on the band's website were plagued with issues, as subscribing members encountered technical glitches and limited ticket availability, partially due to scalpers exploiting the system. Commencing in March 2005, the <b>Vertigo</b> Tour consisted of arena shows in North America and stadium shows internationally across five legs. The indoor stage replaced the heart-shaped ramp of the Elevation Tour with an elliptical one and featured retractable video curtains around the stage, while the stadium stage used a massive LED video screen. Setlists on tour varied {{more than in the}} group's past and included songs they had not played in decades. Like its predecessor, the <b>Vertigo</b> Tour was a commercial success, ranking as the top-earning tour of 2005 with US$260million grossed.|$|E

5|$|In a 2011 {{article for}} the International Journal of Otolaryngology, Jeremy Hornibrook {{discussed}} the inner ear disorder Benign paroxysmal positional <b>vertigo</b> (BPPV). BPPV {{is the most common}} cause of <b>vertigo,</b> a problem attributed to a detached otoconia in one of the semicircular canals. Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the Epley maneuver, and afterwards recommended carrying out a Dix–Hallpike test to assess the status of BPPV. If such a test was positive, Hornibrook recommended using a Magic Wand to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process.|$|E
5|$|Peter Milligan, {{a veteran}} of the <b>Vertigo</b> line, having written both Shade, The Changing Man and Animal Man at the publisher's inception, then took over, {{starting}} with a short story in the landmark 250th issue, and taking over full-time following this. His run implemented several major changes, including John Constantine's wedding and the loss of his thumb.|$|E

5|$|A tie-in comic from DC Comics and <b>Vertigo</b> Comics {{has been}} created, I Am Legend: Awakening. The project draws upon {{collaboration}} from Bill Sienkiewicz, screenwriter Mark Protosevich, and author Orson Scott Card. The {{son of the}} original book's author, Richard Christian Matheson, also collaborated on the project. The project will advance from the comic to an online format in which animated featurettes (created by the team from Broken Saints) will be shown on the official website.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylum {{has also}} been praised for Gaspar Saladino's {{distinctive}} lettering work and giving characters their own fonts. The practice of giving characters customized lettering treatments has since become widespread, especially in DC's <b>Vertigo</b> line and many Marvel comics. Different speech bubbles were used for many characters: Batman's is black with white lettering, Maxie gets blue with a Greek font, while Joker's speech is without a bubble at all; the red, ink-spattered script used for his dialogue is as ungovernable as the character himself.|$|E

5|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with a tour across North America, Europe, and Australia in 2006. The tour originally had 69 concerts, {{which were then}} expanded with three gigs in Hawaii, one of them opening for U2's <b>Vertigo</b> Tour in Honolulu. The first leg of the North American tour focused on the Northeastern United States, and then the band moved to the Midwest and the West Coast for the tour's second leg.|$|E
5|$|Pre-{{production}} for U2 3D officially {{started in}} early 2004, {{and the production}} was handled by 3ality Digital, a company formed from Schklair's Colbalt Entertainment and his partnership with the Modells and the Shapiros. Midway through the year, Bono agreed to let the 3ality Digital crew record test footage, which was accomplished using a single 3D camera at one of U2's <b>Vertigo</b> Tour concerts in Anaheim, California in March 2005. U2 were dissatisfied with their 1988 rockumentary feature film, Rattle and Hum, which mixed backstage footage and interviews with concert performances. The filmmakers decided that U2 3D would only have concert footage. The producers originally wanted to shoot in Los Angeles where all the filming equipment was located, but Owens and the band decided they needed a more enthusiastic audience. U2 ultimately chose to film in five cities in Latin America from February to March 2006, believing their absence from the region for eight years would foster an energetic atmosphere. The {{only one of the}} eight Latin American shows that was not shot was the first in Monterrey, Mexico. The project enabled U2 to share the outdoor stadium concerts with audiences in the US, where the band only performed at indoor arenas on the <b>Vertigo</b> Tour.|$|E
5|$|The British {{magazine}} Sight & Sound {{has produced}} a Top Ten list surveying film critics every decade since 1952, and is {{regarded as one of}} the most respected barometers of critical taste.
