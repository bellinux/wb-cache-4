50|$|The {{interior}} was updated {{to move with}} the times. There was now an all-anti-dazzle-black interior (including black instrument dial bezels instead of the previous chrome versions). The padded fascia board had crash pads {{at the top and}} bottom, and improvements were made with the <b>ventilation</b> by <b>fitting</b> directionally variable ventilator jets, as used by Ford.|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the local loss coefficients {{is important for the}} accurate calculation of ventilation duct pressure loss. In practice, the pressure loss of ventilation duct is very often forecasted, what causes the wrong design of the ventilating fan. A large number of local loss coefficients exist, but the published data are different. The local loss coefficient can be estimated experimentally by the measurement on the real model, or with using of numerical simulation. The paper presents the using of CFD simulation for local loss coefficients of <b>ventilation</b> duct <b>fittings</b> (especially elbows and bends). The simulation results were compared with published data...|$|R
50|$|In 1890, {{the tender}} for the {{erection}} {{of the new}} school of £3,890 by Moir Cousins and Co was accepted. Prior to construction, the plan of the building was reversed, apparently as the extent of levelling to Denham Street was not sufficient {{to allow for the}} positioning according to the original plans. Delays in completion were apparently caused by repeated alterations to the building specification, including increased <b>ventilation</b> and the <b>fitting</b> of forty-four cedar venetian shutters.|$|R
50|$|Also, much {{consolidation}} {{has come}} into effect since the merging of the two original trusts. This has involved the closure of many wards and departments at the Burnley General Hospital, with much speculation of the site's belittlement. Despite this, a new building was completed in May 2006 (known as Phase 5). The trust continues to make major investments on the Burnley site, with £32 million development of the Lancashire Women & Newborn Centre and £0.3M <b>fitting</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems in two operating theatres, to undertake additional orthopaedic surgery.|$|R
2500|$|In {{common with}} the London & North Eastern Railway Gresley Pacifics from which its valve gear design was derived, the centre {{cylinder}} and centre connecting rod's big end bearing were located beneath the steam chest and boiler where they were exposed to great heat. This problem was exacerbated by [...] reduced <b>ventilation</b> following the <b>fitting</b> of streamlining and the faster running associated with their Spirit of Progress service from 1937 onwards. The grease-lubricated locomotive axles also suffered overheating problems from the sustained higher speed running. The VR addressed both issues by switching to a [...] "red oil" [...] lubricant which had a higher resistance to heat.|$|R
