25|$|The {{organization}} {{of a computer}} <b>vision</b> <b>system</b> is highly application dependent. Some systems are stand-alone applications which solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a sub-system of a larger design which, for example, also contains sub-systems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, man-machine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer <b>vision</b> <b>system</b> also depends on if its functionality is pre-specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions which are found in many computer vision systems.|$|E

40|$|<b>Vision</b> <b>systems</b> are {{increasingly}} {{used in many}} applications including optical character recognition, mechanical inspection, automotive safety, surveillance and traffic monitoring. The current trend in <b>vision</b> <b>systems</b> is to propose solutions for specific problems as each application has different requirements and constraints. There is no generalized model or benchmark, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, which can be used for providing generic solutions for different class of <b>vision</b> <b>systems.</b> Providing a generic model in <b>vision</b> <b>systems</b> is a challenging task due to number of influencing factors. However, common characteristic can be identified in order to propose an abstract model. The majority of vision applications focus on the detection, analysis and recognition of objects. These tasks are reduced to vision functions which can be used to characterize the <b>vision</b> <b>systems.</b> In this report, we have analysed different types of <b>vision</b> <b>systems,</b> both wire and wireless, individual <b>vision</b> <b>systems</b> as well as a vision node in a Wireless Vision Sensor Network (WVSN). This analysis leads to the development of a system taxonomy, in which vision functions are considered as characteristics of the systems. The taxonomy is evaluated by using a quantitative parameter which shows that it covers 95 percent of the investigated <b>vision</b> <b>systems</b> and its flow is ordered for 50 percent of the systems. The proposed taxonomy will assist designers to classify their systems and enable researchers to compare their results with a similar class of systems.

40|$|Humans can {{effortlessly}} see {{and interpret}} the world around them. Yet, the development of computer <b>vision</b> <b>systems</b> capable of doing the same is an extremely challenging task. In developing <b>vision</b> <b>systems,</b> computer <b>vision</b> experts should explicitly express the knowledge required to guide the systems. The complex nature of <b>vision</b> <b>systems</b> however means that vision experts are only quasiexperts. They lack a strong understanding of the specific vision task {{or the ability to}} articulate their knowledge. Although some approaches automatically derive this knowledge using pattern recognition and machine learning methods, lack of sufficient labelled data makes these infeasible in some domains. The evolving nature of expertise, incrementally available data and shifting nature of the underlying vision tasks make it difficult for experts to express all knowledge a priori. This is especially true of domains such as medical imaging, where data tends to trickle in over time and expert's discover the precise knowledge only by applying different vision algorithms over time. Therefore, <b>vision</b> experts develop <b>systems</b> incrementally, by trial-and-error, and each ad-hoc revision to the system, although well intended, may in fact degrade the system performance. This thesis proposes ways to mitigate the risks that ad-hoc incremental revisions pose to <b>vision</b> <b>systems.</b> It presents ProcessRDR and ProcessNet frameworks, which are an adaptation of the incremental validated change strategy employed by Ripple Down Rules for the vision domain. These frameworks assist the expert in systematically revising parts of a system, while maintaining the integrity of the whole. The thesis also establishes the role of quasi-expertise in vision domains, and studies its influences {{on the quality of the}} resulting <b>vision</b> <b>systems.</b> The studies suggest ways for experts to mitigate the influences of quasi-expertise and support the need for incremental development of <b>vision</b> <b>systems.</b> Incremental development of computer <b>vision</b> <b>systems</b> give experts the capacity to adapt <b>vision</b> <b>systems,</b> as better expertise and more data becomes available. Although the frameworks do not eliminate quasiexpertise or lack of labelled data, they do support the expert in incrementally developing <b>vision</b> <b>systems</b> despite it. The systematic incremental revisions mean that the <b>vision</b> <b>systems</b> can continue to improve over time...|$|R

This thesis discusses development of a future <b>visioning</b> <b>system</b> model that can be adopted to create new product concepts for consumer electronics companies operating in a highly competitive business environment. The research work investigates consumer electronic product companies and their market environment to identify problematic issues and indicates that a proactive new product strategy which opens new markets through developing concept-led products is a strategic priority, thus the concept development stage in new product development process {{is in need of}} improvement. An evaluation of existing concept development tools for the purpose of proactive product strategy is presented and concludes that future visioning procedure is the most appropriate tool. To develop a future <b>visioning</b> <b>system</b> model as a concept development tool, the theoretical future <b>visioning</b> <b>system</b> models are analysed and mapped to extract essential structure and contents of future visioning procedure. The consequent future <b>visioning</b> <b>system</b> model is then revised according to the findings and suggestions from the field research work which investigated four major consumer electronics product companies in practice. The findings also validates the necessity of adopting a proactive product strategy and evaluates acceptability of the future <b>visioning</b> <b>system</b> model for practical use. The final future <b>visioning</b> <b>system</b> model is defined after the opinions of the design managers are considered and applied. The major suggestions from the research findings are: (1) Executing proactive product strategy can be a valuable strategic tool (2) A new process is necessary for the companies to create one-step-ahead product (3) Future <b>visioning</b> <b>system</b> is recommended as an advanced approach that creates new product concept. (4) Future <b>visioning</b> <b>system</b> model should consist of eight stages: project initiation, environmental scanning, future visioning, generating product concepts, scenario planning, concept testing, concept visualisation, and finalized concepts. (5) Product concepts can be generated from future vision by applying backcasting. (6) Scenario planning should be used in the future <b>visioning</b> <b>system</b> model as a concept testing tool providing objective validating criteria.
