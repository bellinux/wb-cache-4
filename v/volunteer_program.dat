The Conservancy launched its first fundraising campaign in 1986, mapping out a 15-year restoration plan that sought to remain true to the original design. Over the next several years, Campaign for the Central Park Conservancy restored landmarks {{in the southern part of}} the park – Grand Army Plaza, Shakespeare Garden, and Cedar Hill.
