60|$|Sixthly: a <b>volcanic</b> <b>stratum,</b> 250 feet in thickness, of so varying {{a nature}} that I {{do not believe}} a score of {{specimens}} would show all the varieties; much is highly amygdaloidal, much compact; there are greenish, blackish, purplish, and grey varieties, rarely including crystals of green augite and minute acicular ones of feldspar, but often crystals and amygdaloidal masses of white, red, and black carbonate of lime. Some of the blackish varieties of this rock have a conchoidal fracture and resemble basalt; others have an irregular fracture. Some of the grey and purplish varieties are thickly speckled with green earth and with white crystalline carbonate of lime; others are largely amygdaloidal with green earth and calcareous spar. Again, other earthy varieties, of greenish, purplish and grey tints, contain much iron, and are almost half composed of amygdaloidal balls of dark brown bole, of a whitish indurated feldspathic matter, of bright green earth, of agate, and {{of black and white}} crystallised carbonate of lime. All these varieties are easily fusible. Viewed from a distance, the line of junction with the underlying semi-porcellanic strata was distinct; but when examined closely, it was impossible to point out within a foot where the lava ended and where the sedimentary mass began: the rock at the time of junction was in most places hard, of a bright green colour, and abounded with irregular amygdaloidal masses of ferruginous and pure calcareous spar, and of agate.|$|E
60|$|The pile of strata here {{described}} attains a great thickness; {{and above}} the last-mentioned <b>volcanic</b> <b>stratum,</b> there were several other great tufaceous beds alternating with submarine lavas, which I had not time to examine; but a corresponding series, several thousand feet in thickness, is well exhibited on the crest and western flank of the range. Most of the lava- streams {{on the western side}} are of a jet-black colour and basaltic nature; they are either compact and fine-grained, including minute crystals of augite and feldspar, or they are coarse-grained and abound with rather large coppery-brown crystals of an augitic mineral. (Very easily fusible into a jet-black bead, attracted by the magnet: the crystals are too much tarnished to be measured by the goniometer.) Another variety was of a dull- red colour, having a claystone brecciated basis, including specks of oxide of iron and of calcareous spar, and amygdaloidal with green earth: there were apparently several other varieties. These submarine lavas often exhibit a spheroidal, and sometimes an imperfect columnar structure: their upper junctions are much more clearly defined than their lower junctions; but the latter are not so much blended into the underlying sedimentary beds {{as is the case in}} the eastern flank. On the crest and western flank of the range, the streams, viewed as a whole, are mostly basaltic; whilst those on the eastern side, which stand lower in the series, are, as we have seen, mostly feldspathic.|$|E

Using samples {{collected from the}} inferred failure surface of the massive 1980 collapse of Mount St. Helens (MSH), we determined rock {{shear strength}} via laboratory tests designed to mimic conditions in the pre-collapse edifice. We observed that the 1980 failure shear surfaces formed primarily in pervasively shattered older dome rocks; failure was not localized in sloping <b>volcanic</b> <b>strata</b> or in weak, hydrothermally altered rocks. Our test results show that rock shear strength under large confining stresses is reduced ∼ 20 % as a result of large quasi-static shear strain, as preceded the 1980 collapse of MSH.

Sediment dispersal was transverse-dominated and occurred through coa-lescing alluvial fans from the immediate hanging wall and/or footwall of the detachment.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves [120]- 122 Folded map in pocket (missing 9 / 1 / 83) The Miocene Alverson Formation {{represents}} {{the most extensive}} Neogene volcanism along the western boundary of the Salton Trough. The formation occurs from the U. S. A. -Mexican border north to the Fish Creek Mountains as small outcrops generally less than 5 square kilometers and separated by a few to tens of kilometers. These local exposures of Alverson strata have received only cursory examination until now. The stratigraphy of the Alverson <b>volcanic</b> <b>strata</b> was analyzed and columnar sections prepared for four localities: Fossil Canyon, Painted Gorge, northern Red Rock Canyon, and Superstition Mountain. At each locality the Alverson strata were divided into members, which consist {{of a series of}} lava flows, pyroclastic rocks and volcanic plugs. The <b>volcanic</b> <b>strata</b> were apparently deposited subaerially. The lava flows are dominantly aa type with locally thick flow-breccias. A major lapilli tuff deposit separates the upper and lower compound lava flows in Fossil Canyon and Painted Gorge and caps the Miocene section at Superstition Mountain. Localized agglomerate deposits occur in northern Red Rock Canyon and Painted Gorge, and are proximal to minor vents. The occurrence of volcaniclastic deposits in the stratigraphic sections of Fossil Canyon and Painted Gorge indicates quiescent intervals of the Miocene volcanism. The stratigraphic sequence indicates at least three distinct episodes of volcanism, which consist of two periods of basaltic lava separated by explosive eruption of andesitic ash flow deposits. The Alverson strata are locally underlain by either pre-Tertiary basement rocks or the Miocene Split Mountain Formation. Intertonguing of Alverson and Split Mountain strata or incorporation of volcanic clasts within the Split Mountain strata occurs locally in the area investigated. This implies that the formations are at least in part contemporary. The overlying strata may be locally the Imperial Formation, Quaternary terrace or fanglomerate deposits. All are generally discordant upon the Alverson Volcanics. Correlation of the Alverson strata was accomplished by comparisons of stratigraphic relationships and tuffaceous deposits between the areas investigated. The flows between the areas investigated were correlated as compound units (successive series of flows) with corresponding stratigraphic relationships, and not on a "one-for-one" basis. The dominant tuff deposit was used as a key bed for correlation based on distinctive lithologic and mineralogic characteristics. Radiometric dating of the volcanic rocks sampled by this writer indicate an early to middle Miocene age for the Alverson Formation (24. 8 ?? 7. 4 m. y. to 14. 9 ??. 5 m. y.). These results indicate a major difference in age between the Alverson and succeeding Pliocene Imperial strata...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} field, petrographic, structural, and geophysical {{analysis of}} the Panther Creek half -graben (PCHG), in east -central Idaho, was undertaken to determine its tectonic origin. Two competing theories as to {{the origin of the}} PCHG exist. One suggests that it formed as part of the TransChallis fault system (TCFS), a system of northeast-trending normal faults, eruptive centers, and graben that formed in Middle Eocene time. The graben of this system are bounded by northeast-striking normal faults, and show evidence of syn-tectonic deposition of basin-filling <b>volcanic</b> <b>strata.</b> The other theory suggests that the PCHG may have evolved {{as a result of a}} post-Challis volcanic extension event (Late Eocene to Early Oligocene). Graben of this event are bounded by NNW-striking normal faults, and Challis <b>volcanic</b> <b>strata</b> are uniformly tilted; this evidence suggests post-volcanic basin formation. This study demonstrates that formation of the PCHG was mostly synchronous with volcanism and that there was very little post-volcanic deformation. Other conclusions of this research are 1) Rates of slip on basin-bounding faults were high, and slip was episodic. Slip occurred on both NE and NNWstriking faults, but more occurred on the NE-striking basin-bounding fault. This is consistent with the dominant NE strike of faults within the TCFS. 2) Most of the older volcanic units in the basin dip more steeply to the SE than overlying younger units, this is evidence for synvolcanic deposition. 3) There is significant hanging wall deformation in the form of folds and normal faults, particularly in the northern and southern portions of the basin. 4) Paleocurrents determined from provenance studies and imbricate fabric in exposed conglomerate beds indicate a flow direction largely to the northwest. This paleocurrent flow crosses the strike of the syn-extensional basin-filling units. 5) The composition of the clasts in the post-volcanic basin -fill deposits suggests that the thick volcanic units preserved in the basin never blanketed highlands NE, E, and SE of the basin and that the footwall of the basinbounding fault system was the main source of sediment in the basin. 6) The magnetic and bouguer gravity surveys indicate a sizable intrusion (most likely related to the nearby Casto pluton) beneath the west-central portions of the basin. The intrusion(s) may be responsible for east-plunging folds in the tuff of Castle Rock. 7) Work initiated during this study to determine the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar incremental-release mineral ages and the polarity of the tuff of Castle Rock and the tuff of Challis Creek will help determine the relationship between these two units and will precisely date basin development. However, it is clear that the basin was nearly fully formed by the end of Challis volcanism...|$|R

These ridges are formed of east-dipping blocks of interbedded welded and nonwelded tuff that are offset along steep, mostly west-dipping faults that have tens to hundreds of meters of vertical separation. Yucca Mountain is currently under study as a potential site for underground storage of high-level radioactive waste, with the principle goal being the safe isolation of the waste from the accessible environment. To this end, {{an understanding of the}} behavior of ground-water flow through the mountain in the unsaturated zone and beneath the mountain in the saturated zone is critical.

We propose that these variations, when taken together, imply that the two segments of the western zone currently juxtaposed by the active Agua Blanca fault were accreted to North America diachronously and did not share a common history prior to the late Early Cretaceous. The Santiago Peak arc segment north of the fault developed on oceanic lithosphere juxtaposed with the continental margin prior to and during arc magmatism. Conversely, the Alisitos arc segment developed on oceanic lithosphere exotic to North America prior to accretion at 115 – 108 Ma.

The 11. 2 Ma age, which was the core datum for a middle Miocene proto–Gulf of California origin for the underlying rocks, is discordant with all other isotopic and microfossil ages. An alternative interpretation, utilizing all available geologic and geochronologic data except this discordant age, is that marine strata on Isla Tiburón are latest Miocene to early Pliocene age. Reinterpretation of these strata supports a simplified history of marine incursion into the Gulf of California. Marine rocks as old as 8. 2 Ma in the southern Gulf of California indicate an early marine incursion, perhaps flooding a region of more intense proto–Gulf of California continental extension. Flooding of the entire basin by 6. 5 – 6. 3 Ma correlates to the sudden onset of significant Pacific–North American plate-boundary motion within the Gulf of California...|$|R
