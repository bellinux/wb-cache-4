40|$|Abstract Background Suction drains are {{routinely}} used after {{modified radical mastectomy}} and are an important factor contributing to increased hospital stay as the patients are often discharged only after their removal. Amongst various factors that influence the amount of postoperative drainage, the negative suction pressure applied to the drain {{has been reported to}} be of great significance. While a high negative suction pressure is expected to drain the collection and reduce the dead space promptly, it may also prevent the leaking lymphatics from closing and lead to increased drainage from the wound. Against this background a prospective randomized clinical study was conducted to compare the amount and duration of drainage between a half negative <b>suction</b> and full <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drainage in patients following modified radical mastectomy. The associated postoperative morbidity was also compared between the two groups. Methods 85 FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) proven cases of locally advanced breast cancer were randomized. (Using randomly ordered sealed envelops, which were opened immediately before the closure of the wound) in to 50 patients with full <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> (pressure = 700 g/m 2) and 35 cases in to half <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drainage (pressure = 350 g/m 2) groups. The two groups were comparable in respect of age, weight, and technique of operation and extent of axillary dissection. Surgery was performed by the same surgical team comprising of five surgeons (two senior and three resident surgeons) using a standardized technique with electrocautery. External compression dressing was provided over the axilla for first 48 hrs and following that patients were encouraged to do active and passive shoulder exercises. The outcomes measured were postoperative morbidity and the length of hospital stay. Statistical methods used: Descriptive studies were performed with SPSS version 10 and group characteristics were compared using student t-test. Results Half <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drains were removed earlier than the full <b>suction</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drains. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of seroma formation in the two groups and there was a significant reduction in the total hospital stay in patients with half <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drainage systems as compared to the full suction drainage group (p Conclusions Half negative suction drains provide an effective compromise between no suction and full or high suction drainage after modified radical mastectomy by reducing the hospital stay and the post operative morbidity including post operative seromas. </p...|$|R

40|$|Mesoporous spherical-silica {{particles}} (MSPs) were {{modified by}} N-[3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyllethylenediamine (EDA) solution and were employed as sorbents to study thermodynamics and regeneration Of CO 2 adsorption from gas streams. The thermodynamic analysis gave low isosteric heats of adsorption, which are typical for physical adsorption. The cyclic CO 2 adsorption on MSP(EDA) {{showed that the}} adsorbed CO 2 could be effectively desorbed via thermal treatment at 120 degrees C for 25 min while the adsorbed CO 2 due to physical interaction could be effectively desorbed via <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> at 0. 145 bar for 30 min. If a combination of thermal treatment and <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> was conducted at 120 degrees C and 0. 145 bar, the time for effectively desorbing CO 2 could be shortened to 7. 5 min and thus reduces {{a significant amount of}} energy penalty. The adsorption capacities and the physicochemical properties of MSP(EDA) were preserved after 15 cycles of adsorption and regeneration. These results suggest that the MSP(EDA) can be stably employed in the prolonged cyclic adsorption and that they are thus possibly cost-effective sorbents for CO 2 capture from flue gases.

The NASA estimates that in 2020 the amount of material throughout the engine for 20 % to 25 % will be TiAl based alloys. TiAl based alloy has many outstanding characteristics, it has a good combination property, such as: (1) has a relatively low density, high temperature resistant material than the current-temperature nickel based alloy is even lower than 50 %; (2) having high specific strength and specific modulus, and high temperature can maintain sufficiently high strength and rigidity; (3) has a good resistance to creep and oxidation resistance.

It occurs in 1 % to 2. 5 % of radical neck dissections, with the majority (75 % to 92 %) being on the left side. In a consecutive series of patients, we investigated {{the effect of a}} systematic approach to the complication. Over a period of 5 years, the drain production of 221 patients who underwent a neck dissection was analyzed. One hundred thirty-two right-sided and 139 left-sided neck dissections were performed. In 11 patients a chyle fistula occurred, 1 right-sided and 10 lift-sided. In all cases closed <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drainage was continued and dietary modifications (medium-chain triglycerides [MCT]/Peptison nasogastric tube feeding [PNTF]) were made. In 5 patients dietary modifications were sufficient to stop the leak. In the other 6 patients total parenteral nutrition via the subclavian vein (TPN) was started. In 2 cases with a severe intractable hypoalbuminemia, surgical intervention was necessary. The leak was closed by a pectoralis major muscle flap transfer, after local application of fibrin sealant (Tissucol). Chylous leakage is a controllable complication after neck dissection for which is most cases a stepwise conservative approach consisting of dietary modifications, maintaining closed <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> drainage, seems to be sufficient.

Primary closure of the sternum with high <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> using Redon drains is an alternative that may reduce hospital stay. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe for the first time, the results of VAC compared with Redon drainage. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 132 patients undergoing VAC (n = 89) or primary closure of the sternum with Redon drains (n = 43) as treatment for post-sternotomy mediastinitis between January 2000 and January 2011. Patient characteristics, risk factors and procedure-related variables were analysed. Duration of therapy, treatment failure, hospital stay and mortality as well as C-reactive protein and blood leucocyte counts on admission and at various time intervals during hospital stay were determined. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 12. 5 % in the VAC group compared with 14 % in the Redon group (P = 0. 96). Treatment failure in the VAC and Redon groups occurred in 28 and 23 % of the patients, respectively (P = 0. 68). Intensive-care stay in the VAC group was 6. 8 ± 14. 4 days, and 4. 8 ± 10. 1 days in the Redon group (P = 0. 99).
