Over the past few years, multidetector CT (MDCT) using dual-phase scanning protocol has become the imaging modality of choice in high-energy deceleration traumas. The objective of this article was to review the role of dual-phase MDCT in the identification and management of acute <b>vascular</b> <b>injuries,</b> particularly in the chest and abdomen following multiple traumatic injuries. In addition, this article will provide examples of MDCT features of acute <b>vascular</b> <b>injuries</b> with correlative surgical and interventional findings...|$|R

25|$|In {{skin wound}} healing, CYR61 is highly {{expressed}} in the granulation tissue by myofibroblasts, which proliferate and rapidly synthesize ECM to maintain tissue integrity and to promote regeneration of parenchymal cells. However, excessive matrix deposition can lead to fibrosis, scarring, and loss of tissue function. In skin wounds, CYR61 accumulates in the granulation tissue as myofibroblasts proliferate, and eventually reaches a sufficiently high level to drive the myofibroblasts themselves into senescence, whereupon these cells cease to proliferate and express matrix-degrading enzymes. Thus, CYR61 limits synthesis and deposition of ECM by myofibroblasts, {{reducing the risk of}} fibrosis during wound healing. In addition to skin wound healing, CYR61 expression is elevated in remodeling cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction, in <b>vascular</b> <b>injury,</b> and in the long bones during fracture repair. Blockade of CYR61 by antibodies inhibits bone fracture healing in mice. In the kidney, CYR61 is expressed in podocytes in normal adult and embryonic glomeruli, but expression is decreased in IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and membranous nephropathy, particularly in diseased kidneys with severe mesangial expansion.|$|E

2500|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{occurs when}} there is abnormal activation of digestive enzymes within the pancreas. [...] This occurs through inappropriate activation of inactive enzyme precursors called zymogens (or proenzymes) inside the pancreas, most notably trypsinogen. [...] Normally, trypsinogen is converted to its active form (trypsin)) {{in the first part}} of the small intestine (duodenum), where the enzyme assists in the digestion of proteins. [...] During an episode of acute pancreatitis, trypsinogen comes into contact with lysosomal enzymes (specifically cathepsin), which activate trypsinogen to trypsin. [...] The active form trypsin then leads to further activation of other molecules of trypsinogen. [...] The activation of these digestive enzymes lead to inflammation, edema, <b>vascular</b> <b>injury,</b> and even cellular death. [...] The death of pancreatic cells occurs via two main mechanisms: necrosis, which is less organized and more damaging, or apoptosis, which is more controlled. [...] The balance between these two mechanisms of cellular death is mediated by caspases which regulate apoptosis and have important anti-necrosis functions during pancreatitis: preventing trypsinogen activation, preventing ATP depletion through inhibiting polyADP-ribose polymerase, and by inhibiting the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). [...] If, however, the caspases are depleted due to either chronic ethanol exposure or through a severe insult then necrosis can predominate.|$|E

2500|$|Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is neuropathic pain {{which is}} caused by damage to the neurons in the brain (central nervous system), {{as the result of}} a <b>vascular</b> <b>injury.</b> One study found that up to 8% of people who have had a stroke will develop central post-stroke pain, and that the pain will be {{moderate}} to severe in 5% of those affected. [...] The condition was formerly called [...] "thalamic pain", because of the high incidence among those with damage to the thalamus or thalamic nuclei. Now known as CPSP, it is characterized by perceived pain from non-painful stimuli, such as temperature and light touch. This altered perception of stimuli, or allodynia, can be difficult to assess due to the fact that the pain can change daily in description and location, and can appear anywhere from months to years after the stroke. CPSP can also lead to a heightened central response to painful sensations, or hyperpathia. Affected persons may describe the pain as cramping, burning, crushing, shooting, pins and needles, and even bloating or urinary urgency. [...] Both the variation and mechanism of pain in CPSP have made it difficult to treat. Several strategies have been employed by physicians, including intravenous lidocaine, opioids/narcotics, anti-depressants, anti-epileptic medications and neurosurgical procedures with varying success. Higher rates of successful pain control in persons with CPSP can be achieved by treating other sequelae of stroke, such as depression and spasticity. As the age of the population increases, the diagnosis and management of CPSP will become increasingly important to improve the quality of life of an increasing number of stroke survivors.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The study aims {{to present}} the {{indications}} and emphasise the role of embolisation for <b>vascular</b> <b>injuries</b> in orthopaedic surgery. Methods: Thirty-one patients with <b>vascular</b> <b>injuries</b> complicating elective orthopaedic surgery had embolisation from 2003 to 2010. N- 2 -butyl cyano-acrylate (NBCA) was used as embolic agent in 28 patients, gelatin sponge in three and coil embolisation in addition to NBCA or gelatin sponge in two patients. The mean follow-up period was 37 months (range, 4 - 96 months). Results: The most common orthopaedic operations associated with <b>vascular</b> <b>injuries</b> amenable to embolisation were hip-joint procedures; and the most common injuries were arterial tears of branch vessels or non-critical axial vessels, most commonly of the superior glutaeal artery. In all cases, angiography showed the bleeding point, and a single embolisation session effectively stopped bleeding. Embolisation-related complications were not observed. Conclusions: Embolisation should be considered the treatment of choice for <b>vascular</b> <b>injuries</b> of branch vessels or non-critical axial vessels following elective orthopaedic surgery because {{of the advantages of}} minimally invasive therapy and the lack of complications. © 2011, Elsevier Taiwan LLC.
