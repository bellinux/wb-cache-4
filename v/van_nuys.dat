She was enrolled in Emerson Junior High School and was taken to weekly Christian Science services with Lower.

5|$|Parks and Recreation faced early {{production}} delays because Poehler {{was pregnant}} when she signed on; filming {{had to be}} postponed until she gave birth. Principal photography began on February 18, 2009. The show was filmed in Southern California, and the construction pit featured throughout the season was dug by the episode's producers at an undeveloped property in <b>Van</b> <b>Nuys,</b> a district of Los Angeles. The producers went door-to-door in the neighborhood, seeking residents' permission for the dig. The pit was guarded 24hours a day, and paparazzi regularly came to the set to take photos of the actors during filming. The exterior of the Pawnee government building, {{and several of the}} hallway scenes, were shot at Pasadena City Hall. The parks and recreation department interiors, as well as the Town Hall courtyard, were filmed on a sound stage. The set's windows were outfitted with water systems to simulate falling rain, and the windowsills included fake pigeons. Scenes set in playgrounds and elsewhere outdoors were filmed on location in Los Angeles, and the public forum scenes in the premiere episode were filmed in one of the city's middle schools.|$|E

The filmmakers expressed an interest in Iceland for scenes on Delta Vega, but decided against it: Chambliss enjoyed the challenge of filming scenes with snow in southern California. Other Vulcan exteriors were shot at Vasquez Rocks, a location that was used in various episodes of the original series. A Budweiser plant in <b>Van</b> <b>Nuys</b> was used for Enterprises engine room, while a Long Beach power plant was used for Kelvins engine room.|$|E
