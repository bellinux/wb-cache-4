30|$|Groundwater {{needs to}} be protected. Policy chosen should be {{recommended}} based on responses of the consumers who are directly affected {{by the quality of}} groundwater. Households’ perception on groundwater-related issues decides their behavior to the potential markets through the price or the willingness to pay (WTP) to prevent the pollution that they cope with the health risks. The potential or contingent markets for public good like groundwater are policies proposed to prevent the pollution. Economically, WTP estimate is to measure the monetary amount that the household is willing to pay to avoid the losses from pollution. In other words, an economic <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> groundwater <b>protection</b> measures the social welfare to be maintained if the pollution problem can be avoided.|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{biodiversity}} {{can be found in}} private forests, and protecting it requires taking into consideration the preferences of key stakeholders. In this study, we examine and compare the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> forest attributes across the general public, private non-industrial forest owners and forest officials in Sweden by conducting a choice experiment. Our results indicate that citizens have a positive <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> biodiversity <b>protection.</b> Moreover, their valuation is statistically higher than those of forest owners, implying that there is room for compensation. Interestingly, our results suggest that both forest owners and forest officials have a strong orientation towards production, with higher valuation than the general public of the common management practice of similar age and clear felling. Even though the Swedish Forestry Act regards production and environmental goals as equally important, we find that forest officials prefer management practices that promote production rather than biodiversity protection.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of factor analysis so as to identify consumer preferences for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> a Natural Area. We combine the use of factor analysis with the valuation data obtained by contingent valuation survey. The survey, conducted via in-person questionnaires in 1997, is targeted at the economic <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>protection</b> benefits <b>of</b> the Parque Natural Alentejano e Costa Vicentina, a natural protected area along the southwest coastline of Portugal. Factor analysis {{results show that the}} consumer is characterized by a three-factor motivational structure: use, warm glow and non-use motivation factor, respectively. We introduce these motivation factors, together with the respondent's socio-economic characteristics, in the economic <b>valuation</b> function <b>of</b> such natural protected area. Estimation results show that consumer motivation factors have an econometrically robust role. Therefore, consumer motivations are interpreted as crucial information for accurate social cost-benefit analysis <b>of</b> alternative <b>protection</b> scenarios, and thus serve as an important cornerstone in designing an effective and broadly accepted management policy for the Parque Natural Alentejano e Costa Vicentina. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

We also estimate households' <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> spring <b>protection</b> and simulate the welfare impacts of {{alternatives to the}} current system of common property rights in water, which limits incentives for private investment. Spring infrastructure investments reduce fecal contamination by 66 %, but household water quality improves less, due to recontamination. Child diarrhea falls by one quarter. Travel-cost based revealed preference estimates <b>of</b> households' <b>valuations</b> are much smaller than both stated preference valuations and health planners' valuations, and are consistent with models in which the demand for health is highly income elastic. We estimate that private property norms would generate little additional investment while imposing large static costs due to above-marginal-cost pricing, private property would function better at higher income levels or under water scarcity, and alternative institutions could yield Pareto improvements.

50|$|A {{particular}} design {{problem for}} {{this system is}} that it will face many uncertainties in the future. The threat of terrorism may increase, decrease or remain the same, the type of terrorism and location are difficult to predict, and there are technological uncertainties. Yet we want to design a terrorism system conceived and designed today in order to prevent acts of terrorism for a decade or more. A potential solution is to incorporate flexibility into system design for the reason that the flexibility embedded can be exercised in future as uncertainty unfolds and updated information arrives. And the design and <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>protection</b> system should not be based on a single scenario, but an array of scenarios. Flexibility can be incorporated {{in the design of the}} terrorism system in the form of options that can be exercised in the future when new information is available. Using these 'real options' will create a flexible Anti-terrorism system that is able to cope with new requirements that may arise.|$|R
40|$|Coral reefs {{are highly}} {{productive}} ecosystems that provide various valuable ecosystem services. The worldwide decline in coral cover and the expected increase of hurricane frequencies and sea level rise {{have raised the}} attention to one ecosystem service in particular. This is the coastal <b>protection</b> service <b>of</b> coral reefs, {{which is based on}} the principle that reefs dissipate wave energy by wave breaking or friction by reef structures and thus protecting coastal assets against floods. There have been several regional and local studies on economic value <b>of</b> coastal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> coral reefs, each of which adopted simplifying assumptions on critical parameters such as reef and wave characteristics, climate and coastal development. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a comprehensive analytical framework for spatial assessment and <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> coastal <b>protection</b> services by coral reefs. The analytical framework is tested in the context of the United States Virgin Islands. The study is innovative because several aspects are explicitly integrated in the conceptual framework such as flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs), reef typology, a wave model and the depth-damage model. The coastal <b>protection</b> value <b>of</b> coral reef ecosystems in the USVI is estimated at an annual value of 1. 2 M USD attributed to friction of coral structures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIWe {{conduct a}} <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> species <b>protection</b> in central Chile's Campana National Park (CNP) using the choice {{experiment}} (CE) method. The CNP {{has been recognized}} as having global relevance {{for the conservation of}} biological diversity. Specifically, the aim is to estimate thewillingness to pay (WTP) of park visitors for <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> different protected species in the area: popular species of flora and fauna that are known by visitors of the park, inconspicuous species (phytofagous, fungus) that are unknown to visitors, and species with conservation problems of which visitors are unaware. We also investigate the WTP for different levels <b>of</b> species biodiversity <b>protection</b> within the sample as the WTP for biodiversity protection is sensitive {{to the way in which}} biodiversity is presented to respondents. The levels <b>of</b> species biodiversity <b>protection</b> are represented using “icon” inconspicuous species and numbers of inconspicuous species protected in La Campana National Park. This methodology allowed us to obtain information on the sensitivity of the participants to the scope of the information provided. Overall, visitors attach positive and significant values to the local conservation of species. These values are derived not only from the desire to preserve popular species in the area but also from the preservation or assured existence of inconspicuous species that are protected in the park. Visitors behave as consumers who are sensitive to changes in the price of park admission as a result of the implementation of specific strategies for wildlife conservation management in the park. Furthermore, the study also elucidates the observations that the public is able to perceive biodiversity conservation in broader terms than a single species and that greater benefits are attached to the conservation of multiple species than single ones. Results also provide insights into methodological considerations regarding the conceptual framework used to assess the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> biodiversity changes in developing countries, including the level of biological diversity and the scale of the change...|$|R
40|$|Households’ {{monetary}} <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> {{water quality}} {{is a prerequisite}} for efficient water resource management and the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> water quality <b>protection</b> policies. Individuals are commonly questioned about their perception <b>of</b> risk in <b>valuation</b> surveys based on stated-preference methods and revealed-preference methods such as averting-behavior models. These subjective and often discrete measures are commonly used to explain individuals’ actions to protect themselves against these risks. Perceptions appear as endogenous variables in traditional theoretical averting decision models but, quite surprisingly, endogeneity of perceived risk is not always controlled for in empirical studies. In this article, we argue that perceptions have to be treated as endogenous to averting decisions in order to produce accurate and reliable measures <b>of</b> households’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> water quality improvements. We present various binary averting decision models featuring an endogenous discrete variable (such as risk perception). In particular, we compare the traditional bivariate probit model with the special regressor model, which is less well-known and relies on a different set of assumptions. In the empirical illustration using household data from Australia, Canada, and France, we study how the perceived health impacts of tap water affect a household’s decision to drink water from the tap. Individuals’ perceptions are found to be endogenous and significant for all models, but the estimated marginal effect is sensitive to the chosen model. Our empirical application also includes some tests of the special regressor estimator’s sensitivity to underlying assumptions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{two problems}} in valuing the benefits <b>of</b> biodiversity <b>protection.</b> These are, firstly, that preferences for biodiversity protection may be lexicographic rather than utilitarian. The more individuals for whom this is true, the less is cost-benefit analysis validated {{as a means}} of decision making for biodiversity protection, since lexicographic preferences are incompatible with the Kaldor-Hicks Compensation Test. Secondly, people may be poorly informed about the meaning of biodiversity, complicating the use <b>of</b> contingent <b>valuation</b> {{as a means of}} measuring preservation benefits. This paper first discusses the meaning of biodiversity, and trends in diversity over time. We offer some empirical evidence with regard to lexicographic preferences; consider the implications of having poorly-informed consumers; and then report the results <b>of</b> a contingent <b>valuation</b> study <b>of</b> biodiversity <b>protection</b> with varying levels of information. We find that willingness to pay for biodiversity protection increases with the level of information provided.

40|$|Towards {{management}} of {{water as a}} social and economic good: {{the need for new}} approaches in resource-economics for solving the water crisis in the Beijing region by Eva Sternfeld In socialist China for many years water has without being questioned has been managed as a „social good “ that should be freely or with little costs made accessible to users. Only in recent years in the course of economic reforms efforts have been undertaken to embrace economic <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> scarce resources and the costs of water supply and environmental protection. The case study investigates the economic challenges of the present water crisis in the Beijing region. For many years in the wake of impressive urban development and population growth demand for fresh water resources have by far exceeded the region’s renewable supply. As Beijing has been hit by an ongoing severe drought since 1999, the 14 million metropolis is now facing a severe water crisis. The reserves of the Miyun reservoir, the Chinese capital’s main drinking water supplier will – according to media reports – only last for a few more months {{and as a result of}} excessive withdrawals groundwater resources are being depleted at unprecendented speed. Closer inspection reveals that the Beijing water crisis is not merely the result of a natural calamity. A water economy that for a long time did not reflect the value of the scarce resource promoted inefficient use and waste of water, neclectance of waste water treatment and uncontrolled withdrawals of groundwater and surface water in the catchment area of the reservoir. The presentation discusses a range of possible strategies from economic instruments such as adjustment of water tariffs, subsidies and incentives to development of a system for economic <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> water <b>protection</b> activities in groundwater protection zones and catchment areas of the reservoir in Beijing and neighboring Hebei province.

40|$|Purpose: Investigating the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> dynamic fund <b>protection</b> under hidden Markov models Originality: Compared with {{traditional}} put options, dynamic fund protection (DFP) plans protect investors {{from the whole}} investment period against financial risks. This feature {{is the main reason}} why the dynamic fund protection plans have attracted increasing attention from both academic researchers and market practitioners. On the other hand, hidden Markov models present a natural choice for modelling transitions in hidden states of an economy. So it is of significant and practical value to investigate the pricing <b>of</b> dynamic fund <b>protection</b> under hidden Markov models. Design/methodology/approach: The parameters of our model are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state hidden Markov chain. Firstly, we introduce approaches to estimate the states of the hidden Markov chain. We then employ the Esscher transform to select a pricing kernel for valuing the DFP and adopt the approach partial differential equations to value dynamic fund protections. Findings: Findings include numerical examples to illustrate our approach to value the dynamic fund protection, methods to calculate the price <b>of</b> dynamic fund <b>protection</b> and comparison <b>of</b> the prices in different economy states. Sensitivity tests are also conducted to assess the impacts of different parameters on dynamic fund protection prices. 2 page(s...|$|R

RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE EXTENT <b>of</b> legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> investors in a country is an important determinant of the development of its financial markets.

Moreover, systematic differ-ences among countries in the structure of laws and their enforcement, such as the historical origin of their laws, account for the differences in financia...|$|R

Analysts suggest that bank management as of {{the inception of the}} financial crisis have exploited the unverifiable fair value goodwill accounting opportunistically. This suggestion implicitly implies that bank management was more likely than management of other industries to exploit goodwill accounting during the financial turmoil. In this thesis, I test whether the value relevance <b>of</b> banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was affected differently than other industries during the financial turmoil. To do so, I use the value relevance of the pharmaceutical industry’s <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill as a control group for banks. Further, I hypothesize that (1) banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was value irrelevant since investors should have impounded the information of the analysts in the stock price; (2) pharmaceutical industry’s <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was value relevant since the financial turmoil did not severely affect its core business.
