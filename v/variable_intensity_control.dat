40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, a thin {{cylindrical}} shell is actively controlled by photostrictive patches which can produce photodeformation strains under the illumination of ultraviolet lights. Governing equations of the {{cylindrical shell}} laminated with the photostrictive actuators oriented in the circumferential direction are established. With the uniform illumination and the alternate illumination schemes, the bending control effect and the membrane control {{effect of the}} new actuator configuration are analyzed and evaluated {{with respect to the}} curvature angles of the cylindrical shell. Considering the multi-field coupling behavior of the photo-strictive actuators, two types of control algorithms with constant light <b>intensity</b> and <b>variable</b> light <b>intensity</b> are adopted. Using the two control algorithms, time histories of the transverse displacement, <b>control</b> light <b>intensity,</b> photo-induced electric field, temperature, and control force are presented. The results of time history analysis show that the constant light <b>intensity</b> <b>control</b> provides better control performance as compared with the <b>variable</b> light <b>intensity</b> <b>control.</b> Based on the configuration of two paired actuators, both the uniform illumination and the alternate illumination schemes are analyzed and compared. The alternate illumination scheme improves the modal control effects to some modes which are decided by the actuator configuration and the mode shapes of the cylindrical shell.
