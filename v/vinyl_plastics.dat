40|$|Certain {{phthalate}} esters used {{widely in}} <b>vinyl</b> <b>plastics</b> and other consumer products {{have been associated}} with impaired neurodevel-opment, 1 altered genital development, 2 and respiratory problems 3 in people. Studies of dermal absorption of phthalates have largely focused on direct contact of the skin with the chemicals, but some models predict that transdermal uptake directly from ambient air may be a potentially important route of expo-sure. 4 In this issue of EHP, researchers confirm experimentally in humans that dermal uptake from indoor air may be a meaningful exposure pathway for some phthalates. 5 In a series of experiments, six participants were exposed to elevated air concentrations of diethyl phthalate (DEP) and di(n-butyl) phthal-ate (DnBP).

40|$|The polymer/clay nanocomposites {{have been}} studied for several years yet Weak {{attention}} has been given to poly(VinylChloride) /clay nanocomposites, although PVC is the best known and the most widely used <b>vinyl</b> <b>plastics</b> This paper focuses to the clay volume optimalization at compositions based on soft PVC Different clay content was used to find out the optimum between properties, filling grade and level of exfoliation. Modified type of clay, Cloisite 3013, and unmodified type of clay, Cloisite Na(+), were employed as the inorganic phase In the first case the clay gives good exfoliation degree and in the second case the degree of exfoliation is very low. These two systems were select due to better understanding the role of clay content and exfoliation degree in relation to the final properties of polymer/clay nancomposites Clay volume differs from 0 to 40 % In case of Cloisite 30 B composition with clay content 0 - 20 % was prepared due to thermal stability of mixing systems As the intercalation and co-intercalation agent was used low molecular plasticizer dioctyphthalate (DOP) The melt intercalation method was used for PVC/clay nanocomposite preparation All intercalates and co-intercalates were reached at 80 degrees C in laboratory mixer Thermomix For mixture compounding, the KO-kneader was chosen The morphology of investigated materials was studied by XRD and TEM The final composition properties were characterized by tensile stress and strain, dynamical thermo-mechanical analysis and by barrier properties It was observed, that relative value of complex modulus /E*/ is growing rapidly with increasing temperature The enhancement is more intensive for materials based on Cloisite 30...|$|E

Then, the following two profits were obtained: 1). The pulsatory motion of water flow, one of defects of the fixed float type paddle wheel, was not observed with the new movable float type and the velocity of water flow gave a value 10 ~ 30 % larger than that obtainable before. 2).

50|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, <b>vinyl</b> <b>plastic</b> {{emerged as a}} {{versatile}} material {{for a wide range}} of applications, from shower curtains to cable insulation. A major ingredient in vinyl film was tricresyl phosphate (TCP), which was used as a plasticizer.

50|$|Normally rabbit {{vibrators}} {{are made}} out of a jelly-like substance (polyvinyl chloride), silicone (semi-organic polymer), rubber (elastic hydrocarbon polymer) or latex (natural rubber) materials. Silicone vibrators are easier to clean and care for, since this material is not porous, therefore no bacteria or foreign matter is absorbed by the toy. Silicone retains heat and has no odour. Jelly material is porous and cannot be sterilised in boiling water and has a scent of rubber that some find unappealing. In order to escape this smell some producers aromatise the products with more pleasurable scents. Rabbit vibrators made from <b>vinyl,</b> <b>plastic,</b> metal, and elastomer materials can be also found. They are much less porous than jelly, or entirely non-porous, but the texture is smooth and firm.|$|R

5000|$|The Dictabelt, {{in early}} years {{and much less}} {{commonly}} also called a Memobelt, is an analog audio recording medium commercially introduced by the American Dictaphone company in 1947. Having been intended for recording dictation and other speech for later transcription, it is a write-once-read-many medium consisting of a [...] thick transparent <b>vinyl</b> <b>plastic</b> belt 3.5 in wide and 12 in around. The belt is loaded onto a pair of metal cylinders, put under tension, then rotated like a tank tread. It is inscribed with an audio-signal-modulated helical groove by a stylus which is slowly moved across the rotating belt. Unlike the stylus of a record cutter, the Dictabelt stylus is blunt and in recording mode it simply impresses a groove into the plastic rather than engraving it and throwing off a thread of waste material.|$|R

Urine was assayed by a method that would measure unchanged DEHP {{as well as all}} phthalic acid-containing metabolities. In two patients, at most 60 and 90 % of the infused dose, respectively, was excreted in the urine collected for 24 hours post-transfusion.
