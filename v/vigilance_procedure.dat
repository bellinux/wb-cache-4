40|$|The {{introduction}} of a legalframework for the supply of medical implants is discussed {{with reference to the}} Active Implantable Medical Device Directive and the Medical Device Directive. The dejinitions of medical device and manufacturer are discussed. The application of the Directives to deviceldrug combinations is considered. All implants must meet certain essential requirements to ensure that they do not harm the patient, clinician or any third party. For most implants this will be indicated on the product or its packaging by CE marking involving an independent organization called a Notified Body; the latter are appointed by the Competent Authority of the Member State. Devices are classified in proportion to the risk associated with them. The steps needed to be taken by manufacturers are outlined and the verijication options discussed. The role of standards and the new approach to writing them in Europe is presented. After placing a product on the market, the manufacturer must set up a system of post-market surveillance, including a <b>vigilance</b> <b>procedure,</b> in order to monitor product performance. Individual Member States can exercise the safeguard clause when a product appears to have had the C E marking incorrectly applied...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on the availability {{and quality of the}} technical documentation (file) of medical devices. Manufacturers of medical devices are obliged to prepare and maintain documentation complying with the provisions in the Medical Device Directive (MDD). Manufacturers are legally required to affix a CE mark to their medical devices in order {{to gain access to the}} European market. Under the MDD several procedures are available for manufacturers enabling them to obtain CE marking. The investigation focused on the procedure described in Annex II of the MDD which includes a full quality system ranging from product design up to post marketing surveillance. For this purpose manufacturers (national and international) were selected who reported (near) incidents involving medical devices to the Dutch Competent Authority. The investigation showed that in the sample the Annex II procedure is currently not functioning adequately. A considerable number of moderate and severe shortcomings was observed in the assessed documentation, while most files were incomplete when initially submitted for assessment. Most shortcomings were found in file items such as risk analysis, clinical evaluation, labelling, instructions for use, and post market surveillance and <b>vigilance</b> <b>procedures</b> (procedures to collect experiences with medical devices and to monitor performance). These items are essential for the continuous quality and safety of medical devices. Improvement of the availability and quality of the technical documentation is therefore necessary. The results of this investigation support the need for adjustments to Annex II of the MDD that have already been proposed during the current review process by the European Commission...|$|R
40|$|La procédureThe Bram-Alarme {{meteorological}} warning procedure, in operation {{from the end}} of 1993 to 2001, has been systematicaly evaluated from two viewpoints; by the producer, Météo- France, and by the user, the Civil Safety Services. Here the global results are resented at national, regional and local levels. They show that, despite some shortcomings, the quality of forecasts of severe weather allows a useful integration of these forecasts in the decision making in the safety services. The conclusions of this evaluation have been maken into account in the definition of the new alert <b>procedure</b> (<b>Vigilance)</b> that succeeded to the Bram-Alarme messages...|$|R
40|$|University {{plagiarism}} policies {{aimed at}} assuring academic integrity provide for increased <b>vigilance</b> and disciplinary <b>procedures</b> {{to deal with}} transgressions. Many policies also include guidelines to teaching staff {{to ensure that students}} are adequately informed about the meaning of plagiarism and its consequences, and about methods of citing within the particular referencing system in use. However, the experience of academic advising has indicated that receiving such information is insufficient for students who, for a variety of reasons, inadvertently lapse into plagiarism. This is particularly the case for international students for whom English is a second or additional language. A simple and not excessively timeconsuming strategy is proposed for academics to ensure that students have the opportunity to learn not only the mechanics of what they are required to do, but also the reasons for the requirements and assistance in learning the language for fulfilling these requirements. The strategy involves, firstly, the induction of students into the concept of evidence-based learning as the essential characteristic of university learning, teaching and research, and secondly, the application of a tool such as genre analysis for mastering the language of their discipline. This is an awareness and development issue that is particularly important for international students whose time within the English-speaking Australian university environment may be limited to three or four years. The proposed strategy ha...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} ease {{of detecting}} internet plagiarism has intensifi ed debate in Australia, {{as well as}} the UK and the USA, on eff ective deterrents in the face of increasing evidence of plagiarism. Many universities are re-vamping their plagiarism policies and some conferences have themes entirely devoted to the subject of academic integrity. Policies and conference discussions relating to academic values and integrity have focussed on improved information on the rules of citation and attribution, coupled with more systematic <b>vigilance</b> and disciplinary <b>procedures.</b> Th e literature has also become increasingly insistent that information on rules of citation and attribution needs to be coupled with an appropriate apprenticeship into the conventions and language of academic writing. Yet there is a fi rst step that is still being overlooked, the initial induction of students into the research-led, evidence-based culture of academic endeavour. By focussing on rules and strategies for avoiding plagiarism, but ignoring the basic reasons for these requirements, we have put the cart before the horse. Th is paper suggests that tertiary induction of new students needs to focus fi rstly on developing an appreciation of the culture of enquiry that characterises learning at the tertiary level and that success is more likely if the students’ goal is something positive: to achieve a new approach to learning, than if it is something negative: to avoid ‘committing’ plagiarism.

40|$|During 1990 - 2001, a {{total of}} 518 fires {{occurred}} in all metal/ nonmetal mining categories; 296 of those fires caused 308 injuries and 4 fatalities. Surface operations had the most fires and the highest injury risk rate values. Forty-five fires destroyed or heavily damaged facilities and equipment (including 19 pieces of mobile equipment) because of failure of firefighting methods, late fire detection, undetected fires, or fire size. In the future, many of these fires and injuries might be prevented or detected and extinguished at their earliest stage by improving current fire safety procedures, adopting existing/ improved fire detection and suppression technologies, and/or developing new technologies. Several strategies for reducing and/or preventing the number of fires and fire injuries follow. I. Increase <b>vigilance,</b> improve safety <b>procedures,</b> and develop new technologies {{in order to prevent}} fires and injuries caused by fame cutting and welding operations. 2. Improve equipment hydraulic/fuel/electrical systems inspection programs; adopt fire-resistant hydraulic fluids and electrically powered motors for use in underground mines; develop new technologies (equipment/cab rapid fire detection/ prevention/suppression systems, emergency line drainage systems, and fire barriers); adopt an optimal ground level location for the activation of emergency systems; improve operator's fire preparedness training programs; and develop effective and rapid local firefighting response capabilities. 3. Adopt existing/improved systems for continuous and early detection of combustion gases and smoke along beltlines. 4. Adopt existing/improved technologies for monitoring equipment (beltlines) operational functions. 5. Increase vigilance and adopt improved safety procedures for handling f amenable liquids and refueling fuel in the vicinity of heat sources...|$|R
