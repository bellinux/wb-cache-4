40|$|Steady-state visual evoked {{potential}} (SSVEP) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has attracted great attention in BCI research due to its advantages over the other electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI paradigms, such as high speed, high signal to noise ratio, high accuracy, commands scalability and minimal user training time.

40|$|Abstract — Conventional {{stereoscopic}} displays require {{viewers to}} unnaturally keep eye accommo-dation fixed at one focal distance while they dynamically change vergence to view objects at different distances. This forced decoupling of reflexively linked processes fatigues eyes, causes discomfort, compromises image quality, and {{may lead to}} pathologies in developing visual systems. Volumetric displays can overcome this conflict, but only for small objects placed within a limited range of <b>viewing</b> <b>distances</b> and accommodation levels, and cannot render occlusion cues correctly. Our multi-planar True 3 -D displays generate accommodation cues that match vergence and stereoscopic retinal dispar-ity demands and can display images and objects at <b>viewing</b> <b>distances</b> throughout {{the full range of}} human accommodation (from 6. 25 cm to infinity), better mimicking natural vision and minimizing eye fatigue...|$|R

2500|$|Scoliosis {{may be a}} {{byproduct}} of strong selection for bipedalism. For a bipedal stance, a highly mobile, elongated lower spine is very beneficial. For instance, the human spine takes on an S-shaped curve with lumbar lordosis, which allows for better balance and support of an upright trunk. Selection for bipedality was likely strong enough to justify the maintenance of such a disorder. Bipedality is hypothesized to have emerged {{for a variety of}} different reasons, many of which would have certainly conferred fitness advantages. It may increase <b>viewing</b> <b>distance,</b> which can be beneficial in hunting and foraging as well as protection from predators or other humans; it makes long distance travel more efficient for foraging or hunting; and it facilitates terrestrial feeding from grasses, trees, and bushes. Given the many benefits of bipedality which depends on a particularly formed spine, it is likely that selection for bipedalism played a large {{role in the development of}} the spine as we see it today, in spite of the potential for [...] "scoliotic deviations". According to the fossil record, scoliosis may have been more prevalent among earlier hominids such as Australopithecus and Homo erectus, when bipedality was first emerging. Their fossils indicate that there may have been selection over time for a slight reduction in lumbar length to what we see today, favoring a spine that could efficiently support bipedality with a lower risk of scoliosis.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Detection of {{low-contrast}} details {{is highly}} dependent on the adaptation state of the eye. It is important therefore that the average luminance of the observer's field of view (FOV) matches those of softcopy radiological images. This study establishes the percentage of FOV filled by workstations at various <b>viewing</b> <b>distances.</b> Methods: Five observers stood at <b>viewing</b> <b>distances</b> of 20, 30 and 50 cm from a homogenous white surface and were instructed to continuously focus on a fixed object at a height appropriate level. A dark indicator was held at this object and then moved steadily until the observer could no longer perceive it in his/her peripheral vision. This was performed at 0 °, 90 °, 180 ° and 270 ° clockwise from the median sagittal plane. Distances were recorded, radii calculated and observer and mean FOV areas established. These values were then compared with areas of typical high and low specification workstations. Results: Individual and mean FOVs were 7660, 15463 and 30075 cm 2 at <b>viewing</b> <b>distances</b> of 20, 30 and 50 cm respectively. High and low specification monitors with respective areas of 1576. 25 and 921. 25 cm 2 contributed between 5 to 21 % and 3 to 12 % respectively to the total FOV depending on observer distance. Limited inter-observer variances were noted. Conclusions: Radiology workstations typically comprise between only 3 and 21 % of the observer's FOV. This demonstrates the importance of measuring ambient light levels and surface reflection coefficients in order to maximise adaptation and observer's perception of low contrast detail and minimise eye strain...|$|R
