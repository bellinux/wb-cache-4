5|$|Hume criticised the <b>view</b> <b>that</b> {{we cannot}} speak about God, and {{proposed}} that {{this view is}} no different from the skeptical <b>view</b> <b>that</b> God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Ignosticism is the <b>view</b> <b>that</b> a {{coherent}} {{definition of a}} deity must be put forward before {{the question of the}} existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed.

5|$|After the Bar Kokhba revolt was crushed, Hadrian {{converted}} the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine {{dedicated to the}} Greek god Adonis, to honour his favourite, the Greek youth Antinous.

5|$|Apathetic agnosticism: The <b>view</b> <b>that</b> {{no amount}} of debate can prove or {{disprove}} the existence {{of one or more}} deities, and if one or more deities exist, they {{do not appear to be}} concerned about the fate of humans. Therefore, their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little interest.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} the representation of gender relation and gender role and Eka Kurniawan’s and Djenar Maesa Ayu’s different visions of the two. The data sources were Cantik Itu Luka, a novel by Eka Kurniawan and Nayla, a novel by Djenar Maesa Ayu. The data were analyzed {{by means of the}} qualitative descriptive technique through categorization, tabulation, and inference employing the feminist literary criticism theory. The findings are as follows. First, Cantik Itu Luka represents the gender relation dominated by patriarchal power especially in the public domain, while Nayla represents the gender relation leading to superior women against the patriarchal power. Second, Eka Kurniawan <b>views</b> <b>that</b> men have dominant positions in relation to women, while Djenar Maesa Ayu <b>views</b> <b>that</b> men’s domination must be opposed by presenting dominant female figures. Third, Eka Kurniawan <b>views</b> <b>that</b> patriarchal domination in gender role still cannot be opposed by women, while Djenar Maesa Ayu <b>views</b> <b>that</b> women must be able to compete with men especially in the public role...|$|R
5|$|Despite growing {{pressure}} for his deposition, Stigand continued {{to attend the}} royal court and to consecrate bishops, until in 1070 he was deposed by papal legates and imprisoned at Winchester.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{perception}} of mother/fathers about the Anganwadicentres in a rural block of Lucknow district.  Study design:Cross-sectional study. Study site: Kakori Block of Lucknow district, UP. Study subjects:Mothers/fathers whose children were attending the Anganwadicentre to receive the ICDS scheme. Results: A total of 453 mothers/fathers were interviewed. Majority (86. 8 %) belonged to Hindu community and scheduled caste (62. 8 %). More than half(63. 8 %) of the respondents <b>viewed</b> <b>that</b> their children received cooked food item as one full glass measure (80 grams) per day. About half (53. 9 %) of the respondents <b>viewed</b> <b>that</b> their children consumed food items at the AWCs itself, while 24. 2 % <b>viewed</b> <b>that</b> children brought it partially at home. However, 21. 9 % of them <b>viewed</b> <b>that</b> they brought all the food items at home whatever they received.  About one third (33. 8 %) of the respondents perceived {{that the purpose of}} enrolment at AWCs of their children was learning. Majority (81. 9 %) of the respondents <b>viewed</b> <b>that</b> there were the benefits of AWC in the village. Conclusions: The ICDS scheme may be very attractive but beneficiaries do not realize its importance.  Proper and sufficient nutritional supplementation provided to beneficiaries may help children towards leading a nutritionally sound and healthy life and combat malnutrition...|$|R

5|$|In that article, he {{attempted}} to show how mental representations, specifically sentences {{in the language of}} thought, are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian <b>view</b> <b>that</b> such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean <b>view</b> <b>that</b> they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E
5|$|Interactionist dualism, {{or simply}} interactionism, is the {{particular}} form of dualism first espoused by Descartes in the Meditations.

5|$|Non-reductive Physicalism is the <b>view</b> <b>that</b> mental {{properties}} form {{a separate}} ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states.
