30|$|Thermal {{resistance}} (Rct) {{and water}} <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance</b> (Ret) of clothing indicate {{how well it}} can transport metabolic heat and water vapour to the environment, which affects the thermal comfort during fire-fighting (Prasad et al. [2002]). The thermal resistance of a fabric {{is closely related to}} the type of fiber, fabric construction and fabric thickness. High thermal resistance, particularly for the inner layer of the protective clothing can result in heat stress. However, for the outer layer, the thermal resistance should be sufficiently high in order to prevent the external heat entering into the body system. On the other hand, water <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance</b> affects comfort properties while sweating and low water <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance</b> is preferred for fabrics used for FFPPC.

40|$|Clothing {{heat and}} vapour {{resistances}} are important inputs for standards and models dealing with thermal comfort, heat- and cold-stress. A vast database of static clothing heat resistance values is available, {{and this was}} recently expanded with correction equations to account for eects of movement and wind on the static value of heat resistance {{in order to obtain}} the dynamic heat resistance of clothing ensembles. For clothing <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance,</b> few data were available so far. Indices for vapour permeability (im) and reduction factors for vapour transfer (Fpcl) of clothing were used instead, using a relation between heat and <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance</b> to derive the clothing <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance</b> from the value for clothing heat resistance. This paper reviews the two commonly used approaches (im and Fpcl), as well as five alternative approaches to the problem. The dierent approaches were evaluated for their accuracy and their usability. The present paper shows that the currently used relations are not adequate when the wearer of the clothing starts moving, or is exposed to wind. Alternative approaches are shown to improve the determination of dynamic clothing <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance,</b> though some are thought to be too complex. An empirical description of the relation between the clothing permeability index (im) and the changes in clothing heat resistance due to wind and movement was selected as the most promising method for deriving clothing <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance.</b> For this method the user needs to know the static heat resistance, the static im value of the clothing and the wind- and movement-speed of the wearer.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} associated with Chemical Warfare Protective Clothing (CW) is the additional heat load created by the garments. For CW-overgarments, research {{in the direction of}} reducing material thickness and thus heat and <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance</b> have not resulted in major improvements. The thickness and heat/vapour resistance of the com-plete clothing assembly including air layers is hardly affected. A different approach, which so far has received only minimal attention, is the increase in air permeability of the garment materials. Such an increase could result in improved ventilation of the clothing micro-climate (especially during movnd in wind) and thus in reduced heat and <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance.</b> Research on the effect of increased air permeability on CW-protection has shown that for some types of CW-materials protection can be maintained at higher levels of air permeability. Using a trace gas diffusion technique, the <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance</b> of several types of CW over- and undergarments with a variety of air permeabilities was tested on three subjects as to its behaviour in wind (0., 0. 5, 1. 4, 5. 0 m×s- 1) and during movement (walking speeds: 0., 0. 5, 1. 4 m×s- 1). Both wind and movement led to vast reductions in <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance.</b> Differences due to different air permeabilities were found for standing in the absence of wind and for the higher wind speeds. Movement reduced the differences related to air permeability. An increase in air permeability by a factor two, resulted in a reduction in <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance</b> by 18 - 22 %. An increase by a factor five resulted in a 22 to 37 % reduction in <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance,</b> depending on movementovement and wind speed. Increasing air permeability thus shows a good potential for reducing heat stress by CW protective clothing. Of the air ventilating the outermost air space under the CW-garment, only a part (55 - 85 %) penetrates the inner garments and reaches the skin. Wind and movement affect this fraction, be it in a limited fashion...|$|E

A thermal manikin 'Walter' was used to measure the thermal insulation and moisture <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance</b> of the T-shirts in a chamber with controlled temperature, relative humidity and air velocity. The tests included four conditions: manikin standing still in the no-wind and windy conditions and walking in the no-wind and windy condition. It was found that adding fullness in the T-shirt design (F- 1) to create the 'flared' drape can significantly reduce the T-shirt's thermal insulation and moisture <b>vapour</b> <b>resistance</b> under walking or windy conditions. Heat and moisture transmission through the T-shirt can be further enhanced by creating small apertures on the front and back of the T-shirt with specially added fullness.

40|$|The growing cost {{of energy}} {{combined}} with the increasing energy demand has driven {{the need for more}} efficient energy use. Air-to-air energy recovery in buildings has been shown to provide substantial energy savings in many cases. A new type of air-to-air energy recovery system, known as a run-around energy exchanger (RAEE), and which has excellent potential for the retrofit market, has been proposed and numerically modelled for heat and moisture exchange by Fan et al. (2006). This thesis focuses on the material properties of semi-permeable membranes required for each RAEE exchanger core. Two commercially available membranes are considered in this thesis: a spunbonded polyolefin manufactured by DuPont™ with the trade name Tyvek®, and a two layer polypropylene laminate material manufactured by the 3 M™ Company with the trade name Propore™. The moisture transfer effectiveness of the RAEE system depends mostly on the ability of its membrane to transfer water vapour. This effectiveness is investigated by measuring the <b>vapour</b> diffusion <b>resistance</b> of Tyvek® and Propore™ using a dynamic moisture permeation cell (DMPC). For Tyvek®, the average <b>vapour</b> diffusion <b>resistance</b> is 440 s/m, which corresponds to an expected typical RAEE energy recovery effectiveness of 52 %. For Propore™, the average <b>vapour</b> diffusion <b>resistance</b> is 140 s/m, which corresponds to an RAEE effectiveness of 62 % in the same exchanger system. The air permeability is also measured using the DMPC with Tyvek® having a Darcy air flow resistance of 27 nm- 1 and Propore™ having a Darcy air flow resistance of 111 nm- 1. The lower air flow resistance of Tyvek® is undesirable since air transfer is undesirable in the RAEE system. The liquid penetration pressure is determined using a modified standard method that resembles the geometry of a membrane in the RAEE exchanger. It is found that the Propore™ has a liquid penetration pressure beyond the measurement capabilities of the apparatus (276 kPa); while the Tyvek® membrane has a liquid penetration pressure of 18 kPa which agrees well with published values. The elastic moduli of the membranes are required to predict the membrane deflection under typical operating pressures and to properly size a support screen. The elastic modulus is determined using two tensile standards and a bulge test. The bulge test results are used in the design since the geometry of the bulge test better represents the situation of a pressurized membrane in the RAEE. The elastic modulus of Propore™ is found to be 20 ± 3 MPa and the elastic modulus of Tyvek® is found to be 300 ± 45 MPa. The values are used in subsequent calculations for sizing the square screen, where it is found that a screen with square openings of 12. 7 mm (0. 5 in.) is required to support the membrane. The degradation of Tyvek® and Propore™ with UVC exposure is also investigated. It is found that both materials deteriorate when exposed to UVC radiation, and that the degradation is primarily a function of the exposure time and not the exposure intensity. Considering all material properties tested, it is concluded that the Propore™ membrane is a better membrane choice for the RAEE than the Tyvek® membrane...|$|R
