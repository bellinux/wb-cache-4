50|$|One trick {{which has}} to be {{considered}} with electrostatic accelerators is that usually <b>vacuum</b> <b>beam</b> lines are made of steel. However, one cannot very well connect a conducting pipe of steel from the high voltage terminal to the ground. Thus, many rings of a strong glass, like Pyrex, are assembled together {{in such a manner}} that their interface is a vacuum seal, like a copper gasket; a single long glass tube could implode under vacuum or fracture supporting its own weight. Importantly for the physics, these inter-spaced conducting rings help to make a more uniform electric field along the accelerating column. This beam line of glass rings is simply supported by compression {{at either end of the}} terminal. As the glass is non-conducting, it could be supported from the ground, but such supports near the terminal could induce a discharge of the terminal, depending on the design. Sometimes the compression is not sufficient, and the entire beam line may collapse and shatter. This idea is especially important to the design of tandems, because they naturally have longer beam lines, and the beam line must run through the terminal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In the ITER NB, {{conventional}} gas insulated beam source (GIBS) cannot be utilized {{because of the}} radiation-induced conductivity of the insulation gas. Thus a <b>vacuum</b> insulated <b>beam</b> source (VIBS), where the whole beam source is immersed in vacuum, has been developed at JAERI. Recently, voltage holding capability of the VIBS was drastically improved by the large stress ring, which reduces the electric field concentration at the triple junction. Up to now, a high current density H- b am of 102 A/m 2 (140 mA) at 800 keV has been accelerated. The beam acceleration was quite stable and accomplished for several hundreds hots. The degradation of the voltage holding due to the beam acceleration and/or Cs seeding was not observed.

40|$|A formal {{eigenmode}} {{method to}} solve for electromagnetic fields in a longitudinally translationally invariant multizone dielectric-lined waveguide is presented. The method is specialized {{to the development}} of wakefield theory for rectangular dielectric-lined structures which have an arbitrary number of dielectric layers. It is shown that the fields excited by a drive particle moving through the <b>vacuum</b> <b>beam</b> channel in such a structure can simultaneously include both propagating and decaying modes. The decaying modes characterize the short-range self-fields that move together with the particle, while the propagating modes characterize the long-range radiation fields or wakefields that carry energy away from the particle. It is also shown that the formal solution obtained in rectangular structures is applicable to all translationally invariant dielectric-lined waveguides, for example, cylindrical structures. Two important identities which the method relies upon are computationally confirmed for rectangular two-zone dielectric-lined structures. This theory may be employed for calculations of space charge effects, particularly for low or moderate-energy beams where self-field effects cannot be neglected...|$|E

40|$|The PEP-II B-Factory is {{presently}} engaged design and fabrication of several unique magnets {{referred to as}} septum quadrupoles. This family of magnets is required to contain a low energy beam of positrons (3. 1 GeV) and a high energy electron beam (9. 0 GeV) in adjacent beam pipes housed within a common magnet. One beam will be focused while the other passes through an almost field free region. To do this, an asymmetric magnet must be designed having a pure, high quality quadrupole field in the magnet aperture and an adjacent low field bypass channel. A current sheet or ``septum`` coil must be placed between these two regions to produce the desired magnetic results.

40|$|The {{harmonic}} {{magnetic field}} properties due to eddy currents {{have been studied}} {{with respect to the}} geometry of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>beam</b> chamber. We derived a generalized formula enabling the precise prediction of any field harmonics generated by eddy currents in beam tubes with different cross-sectional geometries. Applying our model to study the properties of field harmonics in beam tubes with linear dipole magnetic field ramping clearly proved that the circular cross section tube generates only a dipole field from eddy currents. The elliptic tube showed noticeable magnitudes of sextupole and dipole fields. We demonstrate theoretically that it is feasible to suppress the generation of the sextupole field component by appropriately varying the tube wall thickness as a function of angle around the tube circumference. This result indicates {{that it is possible to}} design an elliptical-shaped beam tube that generates a dipole field component with zero magnitude of sextupole. In a rectangular-shaped beam tube, one of the selected harmonic fields can be prevented if an appropriate wall thickness ratio between the horizontal and vertical tube walls is properly chosen.
