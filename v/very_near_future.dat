5|$|On 6 September 2012, the ECB {{announced}} to offer additional financial {{support in the}} form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM. A eurozone country can benefit from the program if -and for as long as- it is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete market access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement. Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement. Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both short-term and long-term interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly stressed rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence in the <b>very</b> <b>near</b> <b>future</b> helped to calm the markets).|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades {{gastrointestinal}} endoscopy has developed from a purely diagnostic technique to one having numerous therapeutic gastrointestinal applications. Simultaneously, minimal invasive surgery is increasingly replacing traditional open abdominal procedures. These trends have led to a new and innovative way of accessing the peritoneal cavity through the orifices of the body (mouth, anus and vagina) by means ofendoscopic surgery: natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Thanks to excellentcollaboration between surgeons and gastroenterologists and experimental animal research, NOTES has developed extremely rapidly over {{the past few}} years. Although many limitations need to be surmounted before NOTES can reach the human clinical trial stage, the prospect of safe, minimal invasive and scar-less surgery appears <b>very</b> promising.

40|$|A global {{agreement}} {{on how to}} reduce and cap human footprint, especially their GHG emissions, is <b>very</b> unlikely in <b>near</b> <b>future.</b> At the same time, bilateral agreements would be inefficient because of their neural and balanced nature. Therefore, unilateral actions would have attracted attention as a practical option. However, any unilateral action would most likely fail {{if it is not}} fair and also if it is not consistent with the world trade organization's (WTO's) rules, considering highly heterogeneity of the global economy. The modified GHG intensity (MGHGINT) indicator, hereafter called Inequality-adjusted Production-based GHGINT (IPGHGINT), was put forward to address this need {{in the form of a}} universal indicator applicable to every region regardless of its economic and social status. Nonetheless, the original MGHGINT indicator ignores hidden consumption-related emissions, and therefore it could be unfair to some production-oriented regions in the current bipolar production/consumption world. Here, we propose two generalizations, called Inequality-adjusted Consumption-based GHGINT (ICGHGINT) and Inequality-adjusted Production/Consumption-Insensitive GHGINT (IIGHGINT), to the IPGHGINT in order to combine both production and consumption emissions in a unified and balanced manner. The impact of this generalizations on the associated border carbon tax rates is evaluated in order to validate their practicality. Comment: 17 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|Background: Recognising {{patients}} who {{will die in}} the <b>near</b> <b>future</b> is important for adequate planning and provision of end-of-life care. GPs can {{play a key role}} in this. Aim: To explore the following questions: How long before death do GPs recognise patients likely to die in the <b>near</b> <b>future?</b> Which patient, illness, and care-related characteristics are related to such recognition? How does recognising death in the <b>near</b> <b>future,</b> before the last week of life, relate to care in during this period? Design and setting: One-year follow-back study via a surveillance GP network in the Netherlands. Method: Registration of demographic and care-related characteristics. Results: Of 252 non-sudden deaths, 70 % occurred in the home or care home and 30 % in hospital. GP recognition of death in the <b>near</b> <b>future</b> was absent in 30 %, and occurred prior to the last month in 15 %, within the last month in 19 %, and in the last week in 34 %. Logistic regression analyses showed cancer and low functional status were positively associated with death in the near future; cancer and discussing palliative care options were positively associated with recognising death in the <b>near</b> <b>future</b> before the last week of life. Recognising death in the <b>near</b> <b>future</b> before patients' last week of life was associated with fewer hospital deaths, more GP-patient contacts in the last week, more deaths in a preferred place, and more-frequent GP-patient discussions about specific topics in the last 7 days of life. Conclusion: Recognising death in the <b>near</b> <b>future</b> precedes several aspects of end-of-life care. The proportion in whom death in the <b>near</b> <b>future</b> is never recognised is large, suggesting GPs could be assisted in this process through training and implementation of care protocols that promote timely recognition of the dying phase. ©British Journal of General Practice...|$|R
25|$|U.S. {{civil and}} {{military}} intelligence had, amongst them, good information suggesting additional Japanese aggression {{throughout the summer}} and fall before the attack. At the time, no reports specifically indicated an attack against Pearl Harbor. Public press reports during summer and fall, including Hawaiian newspapers, contained extensive reports on the growing tension in the Pacific. Late in November, all Pacific commands, including both the Navy and Army in Hawaii, were separately and explicitly warned war with Japan was expected in the <b>very</b> <b>near</b> <b>future,</b> and it was preferred Japan make the first hostile act. It was felt war would most probably start with attacks in the Far East: the Philippines, Indochina, Thailand, or the Russian Far East; Pearl Harbor was never mentioned as a potential target. The warnings were not specific to any area, noting only that war with Japan was expected in the near future and all commands should act accordingly. Had any of these warnings produced an active alert status in Hawaii, the attack might have been resisted more effectively, and perhaps resulted in less death and damage. On the other hand, recall of men on shore leave to the ships in harbor might have led to still more being casualties from bombs and torpedoes, or trapped in capsized ships by shut watertight doors (as the attack alert status would have required), or killed (in their obsolete aircraft) by more experienced Japanese aviators. When the attack actually arrived, Pearl Harbor was effectively unprepared: anti-aircraft weapons not manned, most ammunition locked down, anti-submarine measures not implemented (e.g., no torpedo nets in the harbor), combat air patrol not flying, available scouting aircraft not in the air at first light, Air Corps aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip to reduce sabotage risks (not ready to fly at a moment's warning), and so on.|$|E
