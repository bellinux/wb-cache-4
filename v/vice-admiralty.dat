5|$|The untangling of his {{accounts}} {{dragged on}} until 1819, prolonged by his enemies at the Navy Office {{and his own}} fiscal incapacity. At length a balance of £220,000 was found against him, but by this time his career was hopelessly ruined. He left office as a groom of the bedchamber in 1815, but retained his <b>vice-admiralty</b> sinecures until his death. In 1824, he became heir presumptive to the Earldom of Clarendon but died in 1827 without inheriting it.|$|E

Trott had already sat in judgment on Bonnet's crew and sentenced most of them to hang. Bonnet was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand to testify against Bonnet in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence in the trial of Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against Bonnet himself. Bonnet pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a character witness in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced Bonnet to death.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} December 1666, Pepys had commented on Holmes's {{stubborn}} {{opposition to the}} laying-up of the fleet in expectation of peace. Holmes was alive to the danger of a Dutch assault - which duly came on 10 June 1667, when Michiel de Ruyter during the Raid on the Medway entered the Medway, burned {{a large part of}} the fleet in ordinary (i.e. laid up) at Chatham and hijacked Royal Charles. After that year's campaign had ended, Parliament's interest in naval administration intensified, much to Pepys's and Coventry's distress. Rupert and Albemarle, like most naval officers, especially of the Cavalier and gentleman sort, had long been unhappy with the off-hand treatment they received from the administrators. These, in turn, found the officers arrogant and unruly. Now the commanders-in-chief and their clients, Sir Frescheville Holles, Holmes and others, might strike back, especially after the Medway disaster. In addition, Holmes in the winter of 1666/1667 had revived the quarrel with Sir Jeremiah Smith (possibly even fighting a duel with him), which was only ended when the latter took Sir William Penn's place on the Navy Board (which again Holmes had hoped would be his) in December 1668. After peace was concluded, Holmes intensified his hold in the Isle of Wight by buying the governorship from Lord Colepeper. This put him in responsibility of the defences there (Sandown, Carisbrooke and Yarmouth Castles), but also gave him access to the very lucrative <b>vice-admiralty</b> of the Isle of Wight, Newport and Hampshire, with two-thirds of the value of all prizes taken there due to him. In addition, in October 1669, he was elected Member of Parliament for Winchester, generally supporting the Crown in Parliament.|$|E

[...] Another charge cited two attacks, one of which was the capture of a slave ship off Charles Town Bar, from which one of Howard's slaves was presumed to have come. [...] Howard was sent to await trial before a Court of <b>Vice-Admiralty,</b> on the charge of piracy, but Brand and his colleague, Captain Gordon (of [...] ) refused to serve with Holloway present. [...] Incensed, Holloway had no option but to stand down, and was replaced by the Attorney General of Virginia, John Clayton, whom Spotswood described as [...] "an honester man [...] ".

2500|$|In 1841, the Admiralty in England {{decreed that}} the chief justice should be the judge in admiralty. This changed the {{previous}} practice of directing appointing a person to be judge.

However, when Milford was appointed the Resident Judge at Moreton Bay (being the precursor of the Supreme Court of Queensland, Stephen offered to resign his commission as judge in <b>vice-admiralty.</b> [...] The British authorities declined that request and advised that if Stephen was to resign his admiralty commission, by necessity, he would have to resign his commission as chief justice of the Supreme Court.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst the British {{admiralty}} court had jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed upon the high seas, {{the jurisdiction of}} the court was rarely invoked. [...] The civil law was well suited to dealing with commercial transactions. [...] However, it could not cope adequately with criminal offenses. [...] The court needed to rely upon the old Roman civil law to establish any breaches. [...] Former Chief Justice Frederick Jordan noted that criminal cases often fell through because sailors weren’t available to give evidence (whether by malice or design). [...] A sentence of death could only not be imposed unless two witnesses could be produced. [...] To deal with this problem, the British Parliament passed the Piracy Act 1698 (UK). [...] This enabled the Crown to appoint seven commissioners to try offenses of piracy under that Act. [...] Whilst that latter court was often called a <b>vice-admiralty</b> court, Australian legal historian John Bennett has shown that that court {{should not be confused with}} the present court. [...] The latter court [...] was legally distinct as it was constituted under a separate letters patent dated 12 May 1787 as the Court of <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> and it was constituted by commissioners rather than a judge.|$|E

2500|$|In English {{admiralty}} law, piracy {{was classified}} as petit treason during the medieval period, and offenders were accordingly liable to be drawn and quartered on conviction. Piracy was redefined as a felony {{during the reign of}} Henry VIII. In either case, piracy cases were cognizable in the courts of the Lord High Admiral. English admiralty <b>vice-admiralty</b> judges emphasized that [...] "neither Faith nor Oath is to be kept" [...] with pirates; i.e. contracts with pirates and oaths sworn to them were not legally binding. Pirates were legally subject to summary execution by their captors if captured in battle. In practice, instances of summary justice and annulment of oaths and contracts involving pirates do not appear to have been common.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{authorities}} foresaw {{the need}} for a civil judicial system to be established when the colony was first established. [...] A court styled the “Court of Civil Jurisdiction” was established by the First Charter of Justice as well as a Court of <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> pursuant to letters patent from the High Admiralty in Great Britain. [...] The Governor of New South Wales would also in time authorise magistrates (the common name for justices of the peace in the colony at the time) to determine smaller debt claims that were taking up the time of these original civil courts. [...] Hilary Golder points to research that magistrates were in fact dealing with small debt claims as early 1789, one year after the commencement of the colony.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley Nutting {{makes the}} {{argument}} {{that it was the}} early Golden Age pirates raping and pillaging of several Muslim pilgrims in 1695 that was initially responsible for the flood of legislation in the early eighteenth century. [...] Following Henry Avery's capture of the mogul ship quote, the East India Company petitioned the Privy Council in 1696 to issue a proclamation of arrest. A reward of fifty pounds was offered for Avery's crew, while five-hundred pounds was offered for Avery himself. Those incidences lead to the Piracy Act of 1700. The legislation took two years to pass after repeated pressures from the East India Company and the Board of Trade. There was now authorization to set up <b>vice-admiralty</b> courts throughout the colonies with legal authority to carry out sentencing. The first notable pirate to be brought to trial with this new set of laws was Captain Kidd. Kidd was denied an adequate defense, as well as the ability to review documents he claimed would exonerate him. Ironically, he was acquitted of piracy, but convicted of murder. Regardless, he was executed and his body was hung in chains over the River Thames for years.|$|E
2500|$|The Vice Admiralty Court was a {{prerogative}} court {{established in}} the early 18th century in the colony of New South Wales, which {{was to become a}} state of Australia. [...] A vice admiralty court is in effect an admiralty court. [...] The word “vice” {{in the name of the}} court denoted that the court represented the Lord Admiral of the United Kingdom. [...] In English legal theory, the Lord Admiral, as vice-regal of the monarch, was the only person who had authority over matters relating to the sea. [...] The Lord Admiral would authorize others as his deputies or surrogates to act. [...] Generally, he would appoint a person as a judge to sit in the Court as his surrogate. [...] By appointing Vice-Admirals in the colonies, and by constituting courts as <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> Courts, the terminology recognized that the existence and superiority of the “mother” court in the United Kingdom. [...] Thus, the “vice” tag denoted that whilst it was a separate court, it was not equal to the “mother” court. [...] In the case of the New South Wales court, a right of appeal lay back to the British Admiralty Court, which further reinforced this superiority. [...] In all respects, the court was an Imperial court rather than a local Colonial court.|$|E
2500|$|In 1823, the Third Charter of Justice {{created a}} new Supreme Court of New South Wales. [...] That court was to be presided over by Chief Justice of New South Wales Francis Forbes. [...] However, the British {{authorities}} did not transfer the admiralty jurisdiction of the vice admiralty court to that new court. [...] Until 1911, this court and the new Supreme Court operated side by side. [...] In some cases, both courts had concurrent jurisdiction, such as over criminal offenses committed upon the high seas. [...] However, in practice, criminal cases were brought in the Supreme Court [...] probably {{because of the difficulty}} in finding seven commissioners to sit. [...] In practice, the senior judge of the Supreme Court was also appointed as a judge of the <b>vice-admiralty</b> court. [...] This could cause problems as when the judge was unavailable through leave or absence, there was a belief that no other person who could perform the role. For example, {{in the case of the}} Almorah, the Attorney General of New South Wales Saxe Bannister thought that there was no actual admiralty court as Forbes did not hold an actual commission from the United Kingdom as a judge in Admiralty. [...] Bannister advised that the case should be tried in Calcutta, India.|$|E
2500|$|England {{began to}} {{strongly}} turn against piracy {{at the turn}} of the 18th century, as it was increasingly damaging to the country's economic and commercial prospects in the region. The Piracy Act of 1698 for the [...] "more effectual suppression of Piracy" [...] made it easier to capture, try and convict pirates by lawfully enabling acts of piracy to be [...] "examined, inquired of, tried, heard and determined, and adjudged in any place at sea, or upon the land, in any of his Majesty's islands, plantations, colonies, dominions, forts, or factories." [...] This effectively enabled admirals to hold a court session to hear the trials of pirates in any place they deemed necessary, rather than requiring that the trial be held in England. Commissioners of these <b>vice-admiralty</b> courts were also vested with [...] "full power and authority" [...] to issue warrants, summon the necessary witnesses, and [...] "to do all thing necessary for the hearing and final determination of any case of piracy, robbery, or felony." [...] These new and faster trials provided no legal representation for the pirates; and ultimately led in this era to the execution of 600 pirates, which represented approximately 10 percent of the pirates active at the time in the Caribbean region. Being an accessory to piracy was also criminalised under the statute.|$|E
