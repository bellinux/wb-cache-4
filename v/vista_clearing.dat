50|$|The International Boundary Commission (Commission de la frontière {{international}}e) is {{an international}} organization responsible for surveying and mapping {{the boundary between the}} United States and Canada, maintaining boundary monuments and buoys, and keeping the three-meter-wide boundary <b>vista</b> <b>clear</b> of brush and vegetation, and deciding on applications for permission to build within the six-meter-wide (almost 20 feet) vista.|$|R

2500|$|The portage, 80 rods (0.25 miles, {{or about}} 400 m) long, crosses a low saddle between North Lake and South Lake.. It adjoins the {{boundary}} <b>vista,</b> a <b>cleared</b> strip [...] which marks the Canada–United States border between those lakes. South Lake {{is the source}} of the Arrow River, tributary to the Pigeon River, which flows east to Lake Superior, other Great Lakes, and the St. Lawrence River to the Atlantic Ocean. [...] North Lake is in the watershed of the Rainy River, which drains by way of the Winnipeg and Nelson Rivers to Hudson Bay.|$|R
50|$|The third {{historical}} site is the 2/3 {{replica of the}} lighthouse on Seal Island. The original was located on Seal Island some 20 miles at sea, west of Clark's Harbour on Capes Sable Island. Visitors love to {{climb to the top}} and view the <b>vistas</b> available on <b>clear</b> sunny days. This is a favourite for those maritime enthusiasts who love lighthouses.|$|R
50|$|Orange trail - 7 kmAn easily {{followed}} and relatively easily hiked trail between Hallormsstaður Forest and the farm Geirólfsstaðir {{in the next}} valley to the east. The trail {{is the same as}} the blue trail to begin with, then along the old horse trails under the cliffs above the forest and up onto the moors. The trail provides mountain <b>vistas</b> on a <b>clear</b> day.|$|R
6000|$|He took it full in {{the face}} that {{something}} had happened between--that he couldn't have noticed before (by which he meant on his original tour of all the rooms that evening) that such a barrier had exceptionally presented itself. He had indeed since that moment undergone an agitation so extraordinary {{that it might have}} muddled for him any earlier view; and he tried to convince himself that he might perhaps then have gone into the room and, inadvertently, automatically, on coming out, have drawn the door after him. The difficulty was that this exactly was what he never did; it was against his whole policy, as he might have said, the essence of which was to keep <b>vistas</b> <b>clear.</b> He had them from the first, as he was well aware, quite on the brain: the strange apparition, {{at the far end of}} one of them, of his baffled [...] "prey" [...] (which had become by so sharp an irony so little the term now to apply!) was the form of success his imagination had most cherished, projecting into it always a refinement of beauty. He had known fifty times the start of perception that had afterwards dropped; had fifty times gasped to himself. [...] "There!" [...] under some fond brief hallucination. The house, as the case stood, admirably lent itself; he might wonder at the taste, the native architecture of the particular time, which could rejoice so in the multiplication of doors--the opposite extreme to the modern, the actual almost complete proscription of them; but it had fairly contributed to provoke this obsession of the presence encountered telescopically, as he might say, focused and studied in diminishing perspective and as by a rest for the elbow.|$|R
50|$|The {{lakes in}} this region are remarkably beautiful. The snow-covered Andes form a {{constant}} backdrop to <b>vistas</b> of <b>clear</b> blue or even turquoise waters, as at Todos los Santos Lake. The rivers that descend from the Andes rush over volcanic rocks, forming numerous white-water sections and waterfalls. The vegetation, including many ferns in the shady areas, is a lush green. Some sections still consist of old-growth forests, and in all seasons, but especially {{in the spring and}} summer, there are plenty of wildflowers and flowering trees. The pastures in the northernmost section, around Osorno, are well suited for raising cattle; milk, cheese, and butter are important products of that area. All kinds of berries grow in the area, some of which are exported, and freshwater farming of various species of trout and salmon has developed, with cultivators taking advantage of the abundant supply of clear running water. The lumber industry is also important. A number of tourists, mainly Chileans and Argentines, visit the area during the summer.|$|R
6000|$|The nights as yet, we {{will not}} say {{disappointed}} us,--for to see new stars, like Canopus and Fomalhaut, shining in the far south, even to see Sirius, in his ever-changing blaze of red and blue, riding high in a December heaven, is interesting enough; but {{the brilliance of the}} stars is not, at least at this season, equal to that of a frosty sky in England. Nevertheless, {{to make up for the}} deficiency, the clouds were glorious; so glorious, that I longed again and again, as I did afterwards in the West Indies, that Mr. Ruskin were by my side, to see and to describe, as none but he can do. The evening skies are fit weeds for widowed Eos weeping over the dying Sun; thin, formless, rent--in carelessness, not in rage; and of all the hues of early autumn leaves, purple and brown, with green and primrose lakes of air between: but all hues weakened, mingled, chastened into loneliness, tenderness, regretfulness, through which still shines, in endless <b>vistas</b> of <b>clear</b> western light, the hope of the returning day. More and more faint, the pageant fades below towards the white haze of the horizon, where, in sharpest contrast, leaps and welters against it the black jagged sea; and richer and richer it glows upwards, till it cuts the azure overhead: until, only too soon-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Arnold Bax {{rented a}} villa in Bushy Park Road {{for a short}} time. He {{described}} the view in his autobiography:"from the back windows of the incongruously named [...] "Yeovil" [...] there was... a <b>clear</b> <b>vista</b> of parklike wooded country and beyond that of the complete ring of the untamed Dublin Mountains. On any clear day one's eye could wander along that amphitheatre of beloved slopes, over Niall Glundubh's cairn on Tibradden, past haunted Kilmashogue, down into the sylvan hollows of Glendhu, up again along a red-brown fringe of leafless trees to the sinister ruins of Kilikee brroding over Dublin's south-western suburbs - [...] "the Hellfire Club," [...] monumental to the arrogance and violence of the eighteenth-century Irish gentry - until finally one's gaze rested upon Seefin, a pearl-grey phantasm of a mountain, its summit gleaming maybe with the snowdrifts of last week's blizzard. And deep in those folded hills, thirty miles away, was hidden Glendalough of the Seven Churches, an enchanted place of holy gloom."Arnold Bax, Farewell My Youth ...|$|R
50|$|Although many lovely lakes can {{be found}} in the Andean and coastal regions of central Chile, the south (Sur de Chile) is {{definitely}} the country's most lacustrine area. Southern Chile stretches from below the Río Bío-Bío at about 37° south latitude to below Isla de Chiloé at about 43.4° south latitude. In this lake district of Chile, the valley between the Andes and the coastal range is closer to sea level, and the hundreds of rivers that descend from the Andes form lakes, some quite large, as they reach the lower elevations. They drain into the ocean through other rivers, some of which (principally the Calle-Calle River, which flows by the city of Valdivia) are the only ones in the whole country that are navigable for any stretch. The Central Valley's southernmost portion is submerged in the ocean and forms the Golfo de Ancud. Isla de Chiloé, with its rolling hills, is the last important elevation of the coastal range of mountains.The lakes in this region are remarkably beautiful. The snow-covered Andes form a constant backdrop to <b>vistas</b> of <b>clear</b> blue or even turquoise waters, as at Lago Todos los Santos.
