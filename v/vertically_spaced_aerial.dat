50|$|Figure 8 {{helps to}} compute the {{inclination}} degree of moiré optical lines {{as a function of}} the inclination of the revealing and the base layer lines. We draw the layer lines schematically without showing their true thicknesses. The bold lines of the diagram inclined by αb degrees are the base layer lines. The bold lines inclined by αr degrees are the revealing layer lines. The base layer lines are <b>vertically</b> <b>spaced</b> by a distance equal to pb, and the revealing layer lines are <b>vertically</b> <b>spaced</b> by a distance equal to pr. The distances Tb and Tr represent the true space between the base layer and revealing layer lines, correspondingly. The intersections of the lines of the base and the revealing layers (marked in the figure by two arrows) lie on a central axis of a light moiré band. The dashed line of Figure 8 corresponds to the axis of the light moiré band. The inclination degree of moiré lines is therefore the inclination αm of the dashed line.|$|R

We {{investigate}} the minimal and isoperimetric surface {{problems in a}} large class of sub-Riemannian manifolds, the so-called <b>Vertically</b> Rigid <b>spaces.</b> We construct an adapted connection for such spaces and, using the variational tools of Bryant, Griffiths and Grossman, derive succinct forms of the Euler-Lagrange equations for critical points for the associated variational problems. Using the Euler-Lagrange equations, we show that minimal and isoperimetric surfaces satisfy a constant horizontal mean curvature conditions away from characteristic points. Moreover, we use the formalism to construct a horizontal second fundamental form, II 0, for <b>vertically</b> rigid <b>spaces</b> and, as a first application, use II 0 to show that minimal surfaces cannot have points of horizontal positive curvature and, that minimal surfaces in Carnot groups cannot be locally horizontally geometrically convex.

As a first step to remedy this situation, we investigated the vertical structure of turbulence in the surf and swash zone using measurements collected under random shoaling and plunging waves on a steep (initially 1 : 15) field-scale sandy laboratory beach. Seaward of the swash zone, turbulence was measured with a vertical array of three Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters (ADVs), while in the swash zone two <b>vertically</b> <b>spaced</b> acoustic doppler velocimeter profilers (Vectrino profilers) were applied. The vertical turbulence structure evolves from bottom-dominated to approximately vertically uniform with an increase in the fraction of breaking waves to ~ 50 %. In the swash zone, the turbulence is predominantly bottom-induced during the backwash and shows a homogeneous turbulence profile during uprush. We further find that the instantaneous turbulence kinetic energy is phase-coupled with the short-wave orbital motion under the plunging breakers, with higher levels shortly after the reversal from offshore to onshore motion (i. e. wavefront) ...|$|R
