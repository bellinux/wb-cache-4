To add further traction to my investigation, I yoke "queer" to Desi.

40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to {{highlight}} the essence of <b>visual</b> <b>identification</b> and rebranding, as well as to discuss elements of corporate identity, which are subject to revitalization in the process of refreshing the image of a brand. In the first part the article the analysis of the term <b>visual</b> <b>identification</b> is conducted. In the analysis special attention is drawn to the role of <b>visual</b> <b>identification</b> in creating a coherent identity of an organization. In the subsequent chapters further components of corporate identity are presented in detail – starting with logotype, through business forms, advertisements, accompanying materials and Internet websites to signs on buildings. Moreover, corporate identity book as a collection of standards and guidelines for application of corporate identity rules is discussed. The deliberations are based on the study of literature.

40|$|The rapidity of time-constrained <b>visual</b> <b>identification</b> {{suggests}} a feedforward {{process in which}} neural activity is propagated {{through a number of}} cortical stages. The process is modelled by using a synfire chain, leading to a neural-network model which involves propagating activation waves through a sequence of layers. Theory and analysis of the model's behaviour, especially in the presence of noise, predict enhancement of wave propagation for a range of noise intensities. Simulation studies confirm this prediction. The results are discussed in terms of (spatio-temporal) stochastic resonance. It is concluded that feedforward processes such as time-constrained <b>visual</b> <b>identification</b> may benefit from moderate levels of noise...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The age-correlated {{gains and}} losses in <b>visual</b> <b>identification</b> under {{backward}} pattern masking were studied in {{a representative sample of}} 226 individuals ranging from 6 to 88 years of age. Participants identified masked symbols at leisure under high and low stimulus quality and at varying Stimulus Onset Asynchronies. Performance increased from childhood to early adulthood and then decreased, describing the common inverted U-shaped function. However, measures of general processing speed accounted for the gains in childhood and adolescence but not for losses in older age. This asymmetry between child development and aging is inconsistent with general-factor lifespan theories of cognitive development and suggests that specific mechanisms underlying <b>visual</b> <b>identification</b> during child development and aging are different...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe N 170 {{component}} of EEG evoked by visual words is {{an index of}} perceptual expertise for the visual word across different writing systems. In the present study, we investigated whether these N 170 markers for Chinese, a very complex script, could emerge quickly after short-term learning (∼ 100 min) in young Chinese children, and whether early writing experience can enhance the acquisition of these neural markers for expertise. Two groups of preschool children received <b>visual</b> <b>identification</b> and free writing training respectively. Short-term character training resulted in selective enhancement of the N 170 to characters, consistent with normal expert processing. <b>Visual</b> <b>identification</b> training resulted in increased N 170 amplitude to characters in the right hemisphere, and N 170 amplitude differences between characters and faces were decreased; whereas the amplitude difference between characters and tools increased. Writing training led to the disappearance of an initial amplitude difference between characters and faces in the right hemisphere. These results show that N 170 markers for visual expertise emerge rapidly in young children after word learning, independent {{of the type of}} script young children learn; and <b>visual</b> <b>identification</b> and writing produce different effects...|$|R
