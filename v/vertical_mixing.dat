In the open ocean (away from areas of continuous upwelling), this cycle of bloom, bust, then return to pre-bloom conditions typically occurs over an annual cycle, with diatoms only being prevalent during the spring and early summer. In some locations, however, an autumn bloom may occur, caused by the breakdown of summer stratification and the entrainment of nutrients while light levels are still sufficient for growth. Since <b>vertical</b> <b>mixing</b> is increasing, and light levels are falling as winter approaches, these blooms are smaller and shorter-lived than their spring equivalents.|$|E

In Argentina, vector control shifted from a vertical to a fully horizontal strategy based on community participation between 1992 and 2004. The effects of such strategy on Triatoma infestans, the main domestic vector, and on disease transmission have not been assessed. Methods and Findings: Based on retrospective (1993 – 2004) records from the Argentinean Ministry of Health for the Moreno Department, Northwestern Argentina, we performed a cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis and compared the observed CE of the fully horizontal vector control strategy with the expected CE for a <b>vertical</b> or a <b>mixed</b> (i. e., <b>vertical</b> attack phase followed by horizontal surveillance) strategy. Total direct costs (in 2004 US$) of the horizontal and mixed strategies were, respectively, 3. 3 and 1. 7 times lower than {{the costs of the}} vertical strategy, due to reductions in personnel costs. The estimated CE ratios for the <b>vertical,</b> <b>mixed</b> and horizontal strategies were US$ 132, US$ 82 and US$ 45 per averted human case, respectively.

The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities (of the order 50 meters per year). However, evaluation of the concentration depth-profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates. The physics behind this method is as follows: oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed 235U. Its decay product, 231Pa, gradually precipitates to the bottom, so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant. 231Pa decays to 227Ac; however, the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the 231Pa depth profile, but instead increases toward the sea bottom. This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional 227Ac from the sea bottom. Thus analysis of both 231Pa and 227Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior.Ac in deep ocean water |journal=Nature |volume=310 |pages=486–488 |date=1984 |doi=10.1038/310486a0 | issue=5977 | bibcode = 1984Natur.310..486N}} ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{is an important}} process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N2 from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria. Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years. Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. [...] Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the euphotic zone by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, <b>vertical</b> <b>mixing,</b> or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone. Ammonification or Mineralization is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. Nitrification can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate.

However, the fast-moving Somali Current reduces the residence time of the upwelled nutrient-rich water, thus limiting biological productivity in this region somewhat. A major part of this unutilized nutrient is transported to the southern Arabian Sea, supporting biological production there.

This and other oceanic {{responses}} to a TC have been the subjects of numerous studies (e.g., Shay 2010), and highly complex physical processes associated with typhoon-ocean interactions have recently been investigated in a large typhoon-ocean field experiment (‘Impact of Typhoons on the Ocean in the Pacific’) (D’Asaro et al. 2011; Pun et al. 2011). In the western North Pacific, TCs with maximum sustained wind speeds exceeding approximately 33  m s− 1 are called ‘typhoons,’ and the Japanese term taifu means a TC with a maximum sustained wind speed exceeding approximately 17  m s− 1.

40|$|Phytoplankton live almost {{exclusively}} in the sunlit waters of the euphotic zone. However, in addition to sunlight, phytoplankton require a regular supply of nutrients to grow. In the open ocean such nutrients are abundant in the dark waters below the euphotic zone. Hence, {{to a large extent}} it is the physical mechanisms driving the transfer of nutrient rich water into the euphotic zone which dictate patterns of phytoplankton growth. Using a combination of observation and high resolution computer modelling this thesis investigates whether shear associated with mesoscale features leads to locally enhanced turbulent mixing and a shear-enhanced nutrient supply. Measurements of turbulent diffusivity and nutrient concentrations have been made in a region containing an eddy dipole, a strong mesoscale feature, consisting of a cyclonic eddy and an anti-cyclonically rotating mode-water eddy. The effect of this strong mesoscale feature on <b>vertical</b> turbulent <b>mixing</b> is assessed by investigating whether variations in vertical shear associated with the mesoscale feature enhance the observed <b>vertical</b> turbulent <b>mixing.</b> Using these observations of turbulent diffusivity, augmented by further measurements from two other ocean regions, a new parametrization of shear-enhanced <b>vertical</b> turbulent <b>mixing</b> is developed. The new shear-enhanced mixing parametrization is implemented in a high-resolution computer model of a mode-water eddy. This model is then used to examine the effect of interactions between the eddy and the wind on vertical nutrient fluxes. The shear enhancement to nutrient supply by mesoscale circulation is found to be potentially of much greater significance than has previously been considered. Modelling suggests that when forced by high variability winds mode-water eddies appear to be capable of locally enhancing the vertical turbulent nutrient flux by up to an order of magnitude. The work in this thesis suggests that vertical turbulent flux may well be underestimated as a stimulus to new production. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
