There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it.

40|$|The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (2 ̆ 2 ERISA 2 ̆ 2), {{the federal}} law that regulates employer-sponsored benefit plans, has a rich history of judiciallycreated federal common law. This Article explores the theoretical, policy, statutory, and stare decisis grounds for the {{development}} of another area offederal common law under ERISA-the incorporation of respondeat superior liability principles to impose ERISA fiduciary liability (2 ̆ 2 <b>vicarious</b> fiduciary <b>liability</b> 2 ̆ 2) upon a corporation for the fiduciary activities of its employees or agents. The Article proposes that the federal courts should adopt a federal common law rule of <b>vicarious</b> fiduciary <b>liability</b> under ERISA based on the traditional scope of employment approach. Under such a rule, a corporate principal whose own internal employees or agents perform fiduciary functions during the course and within the scope of their employment or agency relationship would be strictly liable under ERISA for any breach of fiduciary duty by the employee or agent. <b>Vicarious</b> fiduciary <b>liability</b> should be limited, however, so that a nonfiduciary corporate principal would not be subject to damages claims under ERISA for the rogue fiduciary activities of its employees or agents, but would be subject to restitution as necessary to prevent unjust enrichment of the principal. A federal common law rule of <b>vicarious</b> fiduciary <b>liability</b> under ERISA is necessary for two reasons. First, a rule of <b>vicarious</b> fiduciary <b>liability</b> is essential to maintaining and enforcing ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s comprehensive system offiduciary regulation. Second, <b>vicarious</b> fiduciary <b>liability</b> is needed to prevent employer overreaching under the judicially-created settlor function defense to breach of fiduciary duty claims. Absent a federal common law rule of <b>vicarious</b> fiduciary <b>liability,</b> a corporate employer in its nonfiduciary capacity as the settlor of its ERISA plan, may design the documents that govern the employer 2 ̆ 7 s plan as a shield against fiduciary responsibility for the actions of the employer 2 ̆ 7 s own internal fiduciary employees. This misuse of nonfiduciary settlor powers, which is contrary to both the letter and the spirit of ERISA, would be prevented by a federal common law rule of <b>vicarious</b> fiduciary <b>liability...</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Vicarious</b> <b>liability</b> for theft {{has also}} been found due to poor {{selections}} of employees by an employer, as in Nahhas v Pier House Management. Here, the management company of a luxury block of flats employed a porter, who was an 'ex-professional thief', to manage their building. A tenant of the building entrusted him with her keys, and was subsequently robbed of expensive jewellery. The management company {{were found to have}} been negligent in hiring the porter, having not carried out sufficient checks on his background, address, or obtaining a written reference. It has been stated it is unlikely that as a general rule, where there are proper checks and systems to prevent such incidents, liability would be found; it is in the interests of society to allow rehabilitation of offenders.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{intentional}} torts, {{which tend}} to be premeditated, liability for assault has been found in several cases prior to Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd. Poland v Parr & Sons involved an employee who assaulted a boy, believing him to be attempting to steal his employer's goods. <b>Vicarious</b> <b>liability</b> was imposed based on the employee's implied authority to protect his master's goods. Liability was also found where a tram conductor - in his duties - pushed a passenger out a tram, after he had not paid his fare. However, assault involving personal vengeance and spite was generally not found to result in liability, as in Warren v Henlys Ltd. This represents a principal limitation of the previous position of liability: only where an act was in the course of employment could an employer be liable. Premeditation and personal motive would take an employee out of their course of employment, breaking liability. The establishment of the close connection test has produced different results in cases of intentional assault, as demonstrated in Mattis v Pollock. Here, a bouncer for a nightclub was involved in a dispute with a customer. He subsequently went home and returned with a knife, stabbing the customer, resulting in serious injuries. The employer was held liable, despite the bouncer's intent on revenge, due to the close connection of the tort to the bouncer's employment and duties. It was of particular importance that the bouncer was employed to act in an aggressive and tough manner.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, most actions alleging <b>vicarious</b> <b>liability</b> for {{intentional}} torts failed, {{primarily on}} the grounds that no employer employs an individual to be dishonest, or to commit crimes. This was the view taken with regard to most intentional torts, with several exceptions. Morris v CW Martin & Sons Ltd, for example establishes <b>vicarious</b> <b>liability</b> of thefts by an employee, where there is a non-delegable duty to keep the claimant's possessions safe. However, the scope of such liability was limited to torts committed in the course of employment, under the second limb of Salmond's course of employment test. This precluded recovery for torts committed while an employee was not involved in the furtherance of his employer's business. The importance vested in Salmond's test was not reconsidered until Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd, a case involving <b>vicarious</b> <b>liability</b> for sexual abuse. In following the ratio decidendi of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Bazley v Curry, the House of Lords established a newer test for finding liability in cases of intentional torts; where a tort committed by an employee is closely connected to their duties, their employer may be found liable. Although of undoubted greater use to claimants, the judicial latitude given to this test has been occasionally regarded as questionable. Lord Nicholls has stated that a [...] "lack of precision is inevitable given the infinite range of circumstances where the issue arises." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Vicarious</b> <b>liability</b> {{refers to}} the idea of an {{employer}} being liable for torts committed by their employees, generally for policy reasons, and to ensure that victims have a means of recovery. The word [...] "vicarious" [...] derives from the Latin for 'change' or 'alternation' and the old Latin for the doctrine is respondeat superior. To establish <b>vicarious</b> <b>liability,</b> the courts must find first that there exists a relationship of employee and employer. The torts of independent contractors generally do not impose <b>vicarious</b> <b>liability</b> on employers; however, Honeywill and Stein Ltd v Larkin Brothers Ltd demonstrates this principle does not apply where particularly hazardous activities are contracted for, or a non-delegable duty is owed. Secondly, the tort must have been committed 'in the course of employment'; or while an employee is going about the business of their employer. A preferred test of the courts for connecting torts to the course of employment was formulated by John William Salmond, which states that an employer will be held liable for either a wrongful act they have authorised, or a wrongful and unauthorised mode of an act that was authorised. Where in Limpus v London General Omnibus Company an omnibus driver chose to disobey strict instructions from his employer, to obstruct a rival company, they were still liable, as he was merely engaging in his duties in an unauthorised way. However, in the contrasting case of Beard v London General Omnibus Company, there was no liability where a conductor drove an omnibus negligently, as it was no part of his duties. Under the test, employers were generally not held liable for intentional torts of their employees. Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd established a newer test, stating that employers would be liable for torts which were closely connected to the duties of an employee.|$|E

40|$|In {{high-tech}} businesses {{ranging from}} Internet service providers to e-commerce websites and music stores like Apple iTunes, {{there is considerable}} potential for collecting personal information about customers, monitoring their usage habits, or even exerting control over their behavior- for example, restricting {{what can be done}} with a purchased song. A privacy ceiling is an effective limit to these privacy intrusions, created by the perceived or actual legal liability of possessing too much information or control. As we show in this paper, the risk is not simply that of customer backlash, but liability for a customer’s actions, owing to the ability to identify, report, or prevent them from taking those actions. In some cases high-tech businesses have been obligated to divulge their store of personal information or to police their customers at the demand of third parties; this unwanted result derives from the possession of too much information or control for the company’s own good.

Thereupon, the test for <b>vicarious</b> <b>liability</b> of fraud was whether it was within an employee's authority – either actual, or outwardly appearing – to carry out the fraudulent actions that he did.

Historically, it was held that most intentional wrongdoings were not in the course of ordinary employment, but recent case law suggests that where an action is closely connected with an employee's duties, an employer can be found vicariously liable.

40|$|In this Essay, Professor White {{argues that}} the Supreme Court finally has merged {{analysis}} of sexual harassment law with other claims of intentional discrimination. Professor White contends that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.

50|$|Nugent JA {{disagreed}} with the court a quo, which he said had erred in holding Chartaprops liable vicariously for the negligence of Advanced Planning. Liability, according to Nugent, could be found elsewhere, but {{it could not be}} on the basis of <b>vicarious</b> liability: “Where <b>liability</b> arises vicariously, it is because the defendant and the wrongdoer stand in a particular relationship to one another.” According to Nugent, the rules which applied in this case did not involve the role of independent contractor; the employer is not and ought not to be held responsible for the actions of an independent contractor. The defendant might be responsible for its own omission, its own failure to act, or to perform its own legal duties, taking reasonable steps as articulated in Kruger v Coetzee. Nugent applied the principle of non-delegability, based on English law: There was a duty on Chartaprops, as owner of the mall, to ensure that its visitors were reasonably safe. It could not shift this responsibility to the cleaning company. According to Nugent, therefore, liability rested on Chartaprops as the owner of the premises: “A person who invites the public to frequent a shopping mall will be expected by members of the public to have ensured that the floors of the premises are reasonably safe and they will expect to look to that person if they are not.” Chartaprops had failed, in Nugent’s view, in its duty to the public to ensure that its premises were safe. Nugent exonerated Advanced Planning {{on the grounds that it}} owed no such duty to the public; any omission on its part was therefore not actionable. This judgment, although progressive, is clearly wrong, according to Richman Mqeke, since it is based on non-delegability.|$|R
40|$|Chinese cadre {{responsibility}} {{systems are}} a core element of Chinese law and governance. These top-down personnel systems set concrete target goals linked to official salaries and career advancement. Judges and courts face annual targets for permissible numbers of mediated, reversed, and closed cases; Communist Party secretaries and government bureaus face similar targets for allowable numbers of protests, traffic accidents, and mine disasters. For many local Chinese officials, these targets {{have a much}} more direct impact on their behavior than do formal legal and regulatory norms. This Article argues that Chinese authorities are dependent on responsibility systems, particularly their use of strict, <b>vicarious,</b> and collective <b>liability</b> principles, as an institutional tool to address pervasive principal-agent problems they face in governing a large authoritarian bureaucracy. But excessive reliance on these methods to control local officials ironically fuels governance problems that Chinese central leaders seek to address. Central Chinese authorities do not want township officials colluding to falsify tax records or engaging in ill-conceived development projects that waste central funds. Nor do they want rural residents burning down government buildings or staging mass petitions to Beijing to protest the actions of local officials. But these are the direct results of cadre evaluation systems that Chinese authorities use to govern their local agents. Continued reliance on responsibility systems as a tool of governance raises significant conflicts with the legal reforms that Chinese authorities have pursued since 1978. And recent developments suggest that central Chinese authorities may be backing away from their efforts to govern China, and their local agents, through law and legal institutions. At least some leaders appear to favor an alternative strategy [...] strengthening the role of responsibility systems as a tool for monitoring local agents. This is a fundamental conflict over the core question of how to govern China. How it is resolved will have lasting implications for China 2 ̆ 7 s domestic evolution and stability...|$|R

On June 2, Doster suggested to the court that Powell was insane. Dr. Charles Nichols, superintendent of the Government Hospital for the Insane, testified as to his belief that Powell was insane, as did the two guards who watched over Powell. But despite additional examinations by a number of physicians, none of them found Powell insane. Many claimed he was stupid or slow-witted, but none found him mad. Doster made one last bid to save Powell's life. [...] He argued that Powell had not killed Lincoln, nor had he killed Seward, and thus his life should be spared. Doster ignored the conspiracy laws of the day (which incorporated the concept of <b>vicarious</b> <b>liability),</b> under which Powell was responsible for Lincoln's murder even if the original conspiracy had been to kidnap rather than kill and even if Booth had acted to kill without Powell's knowledge or consent.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{found that}} {{according}} to precedent, government officials could not {{be held liable for}} the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior and that because <b>vicarious</b> <b>liability</b> was inapplicable to Bivens and §1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution. To do so, the Court found, [...] "Where the claim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, our decisions make clear the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory purpose. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 540–541 (1993) (First Amendment); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 240 (1976) (Fifth Amendment). Under extant precedent purposeful discrimination requires more than “intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.” Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979). It instead involves a decisionmaker’s undertaking a course of action [...] "'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' [...] adverse effects upon an identifiable group." [...] Ibid. It follows that, to state a claim based on a violation of a clearly established right, respondent must plead sufficient factual matter to show that petitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral, investigative reason but for the purpose of discriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to prohibitions on discriminatory treatment, harassment and detriment {{in retaliation for}} asserting rights is prohibited. In Meritor Savings Bank v Vinson the Supreme Court unanimously held that a bank manager who coerced a woman employee into having sex with him 40 to 50 times, including rape on multiple occasions, had committed unlawful harassment {{within the meaning of}} 42 USC §2000e. If employees or managers create a [...] "hostile or offensive working environment", this counts as discrimination. In Harris v Forklift Systems, Inc the Court held that a [...] "hostile environment" [...] did not have to [...] "seriously affect employees’ psychological well-being" [...] to be unlawful. If the environment [...] "would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive" [...] this is enough. Standard principles of agency and vicariously liability apply, so an employer is responsible for the actions of its agents, But according to Faragher v City of Boca Raton an employing entity can avoid <b>vicarious</b> <b>liability</b> if it shows it (a) exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassment and (b) a plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of opportunities to stop it. In addition, an employing entity may not retaliate against an employee for asserting his or her rights under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. In University of Pennsylvania v Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Supreme Court held that a university was not entitled to refuse to give up peer review assessment documents in order for the EEOC to investigate the claim. Furthermore, in Robinson v Shell Oil Company the Supreme Court held that writing a negative job reference, after a plaintiff brought a race discrimination claim, was unlawful retaliation: employees were protected even if they had been fired. It has also been held that simply being reassigned to a slightly different job, operating forklifts, after making a sex discrimination complaint could amount to unlawful retaliation. This is all seen as necessary to make equal rights effective.|$|E
40|$|In Gregg v. Georgia, the Supreme Court {{held that}} the death penalty was {{constitutional}} so long as it provided a non-arbitrary statutory mechanism for determining who are the worst of the worst, and therefore, deserving of the death penalty. As a general matter, this process of narrowing the class of death eligible offenders is done through the codification of aggravating factors. If the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more aggravating factors exists, then a defendant convicted of murder is eligible for the ultimate sentence. There is, however, a critical, unanswered, and under-theorized issue raised by the use of aggravating factors to serve this constitutionally mandated filtering function. Can death eligibility be predicated on vicarious aggravating factor liability—is there <b>vicarious</b> death penalty <b>liability?</b> A pair of cases, collectively known as the Supreme Court’s Enmund/Tison doctrine, recognize that there is no per se bar on the imposition of the death penalty for non-killing accomplices. But these cases considered only felony murder liability and did not address the question of whether a non-killer can be rendered death eligible on the basis of vicariously imposed aggravating factors. Presently, many state statutes allow aggravating factors to be proven vicariously (or are silent on the question); under such a rule, the existence or absence of one or more aggravating factors will often bear little relation to the defendant’s individual culpability. Because a defendant can be made eligible for capital murder through his participation in the crime with others—he is liable for murder as an accomplice, under a theory of co-conspirator or Pinkerton liability, or felony murder—in many cases we can have little confidence that a statute’s aggravating factors are serving their constitutional function of rationally determining who will live and who will die. This article is the first to identify this constitutional problem and to provide a framework for resolving it. After parsing a variety of capital sentencing statutes we propose a framework for determining the legislative intent behind an aggravating factor and for ensuring a sufficient level of culpability before a non-killing defendant may be sentenced to death...|$|R
40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{standard for}} supervisory liability in Section 1983 cases {{has been a}} source of considerable disagreement among federal courts of appeals. In the absence of established Supreme Court authority on the subject, courts have rejected <b>vicarious</b> and negligence <b>liability</b> in favor of a higher culpability requirement, but they have not agreed on precisely what form this higher standard should take. In this article, the Author addresses the need for a uniform standard consistent with the statute 2 ̆ 7 s twin goals of compensating the victims of constitutional violations and deterring constitutional infractions. The author notes at the outset that lower courts have unjustifiably relied on Supreme Court opinions discussing state-of-mind requirements for particular constitutional violations and cases addressing municipal liability in Section 1983 suits in formulating the requirements for supervisory liability. She then identifies five factors considered by courts in determining whether supervisory liability should be imposed on the facts of particular cases: (1) the existence of prior similar incidents; (2) the supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s response to such incidents; (3) the supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s response to the specific incident involved in the suit; (4) the extent to which the supervisor caused the violation; and (5) the supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s awareness of the constitutional wrongdoing. Application of these factors has led to inconsistent results in similar cases, the author argues. She further contends that the courts in general have to readily ruled in favor of supervisory officials. As a substantive matter, the author asserts, the standard of supervisory liability should be a national one. In addition, the author advocates a meaningful standard of culpability, which she concludes is best satisfied by a negligence standard. Liability for supervisory negligence is consistent with Supreme Court precedent as well as Section 19832 ̆ 7 s causation requirement, and concerns about protecting blameless supervisors are already assuaged by the qualified immunity defense available to executive branch officials, which the author suggests should shield supervisors if a reasonable public official in their position would not have realized that the actions taken by their subordinates violated the Constitution. The author thus concludes that it makes sense to hold supervisory officials accountable for constitutional violations caused by their negligence in supervising, training, or disciplining their subordinates...|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} about the {{language}} used to decide when governments should {{be held responsible for}} constitutional torts. 2 ̆ 7 Debate about what is required of government officials, and what is required of government itself, is scarcely new. What is new, at least to American jurisprudence, is litigation against government units (rather than government officials) for constitutional injuries. 2 The extension of liability to institutional defendants introduces special problems for the language of responsibility. In a suit against an individual official it is easy to describe the wrong as the consequence of individual behavior that is inconsistent with community norms; the language of common-law tort, which refers explicitly to those norms, has seemed to provide a useful starting point for evaluating that behavior. 3 When the defendant is an institution, the language of tort provides no such ground because traditionally it has not been used to evaluate harms created by structures and contexts rather than by individuals. When discussions of institutional responsibility are couched only in terms borrowed from tort they are impoverished. The poverty of discussions cast in tort vocabulary can even be read to suggest that we simply have no norms for risk-creating behavior other than those applied to individuals. I begin with a discussion of the language of responsibility as it has been developed in tort for tracing the consequences of individual behavior. Suits against institutions have been assimilated to this language through the doctrines of <b>vicarious</b> and strict <b>liability.</b> In constitutional tort litigation, however, these doctrines are not available, and the problem of institutional responsibility must be faced directly. I then discuss a series of constitutional tort cases - those cases in which the Supreme Court has elaborated the conditions under which government liability will be imposed - in order to investigate this problem of language. In these cases the perspective adopted from tort encourages the Justices to convert the problem of institutional morality into one of individual morality; tort language leads them to look for individual choices and motives, for an actor or a 2 ̆ 2 mind 2 ̆ 2 that can be evaluated. In most of these cases the possibility of looking at an institution as a unit distinct from the separate individuals who compose it is not considered. For example, the Justices fail to see that injuries can be brought about quite inadvertently through the workings of institutional structures - through the massing or fragmentation of authority, or by the creation of a culture in which responses and a sense of responsibility are distorted. Finally, I point to a few cases in which the Supreme Court has, perhaps inadvertently, considered the institution as a whole in determining whether constitutional norms have been violated and liability is appropriate. One of these, Owen v. City of Independence, 4 like the cases discussed earlier, raises the issue of what is 2 ̆ 2 official policy or custom. 2 ̆ 2 The others, Parratt v. Taylor 5 and Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 6 involve due process. We shall see that the promise of the due process cases has not been fulfiled. The pull of the individual tort model has proved too strong, leading the Court to retreat from the structural analysis employed in Parratt...|$|R
