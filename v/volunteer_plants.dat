5000|$|There {{are various}} ways {{to manage the}} disease Uromyces viciae-fabae var. viciae-fabae, however because the spores of the fungus can travel long {{distances}} to infect a new crop prevention can be difficult. First, using clean seed to plant the beans is best {{to prevent the spread}} of the pathogen. Using contaminated seeds from plots where the disease was is a easy way to spread the disease to other locations. Secondly, spores that land on <b>volunteer</b> <b>plants,</b> which are plants that grow on their own from seeds floating by wind or birds, can be spread long distances by wind increasing the spread of the disease. These <b>volunteer</b> <b>plants</b> should be controlled early in the season often by the use of herbicides to kill the faba bean plant completely. Another way to control disease is to rotate crops; crops should be rotated about 500 meters from where the faba beans were last planted as a preventative measure. Since they are host specific if there are still spores present in that area they will not be able to infect the new crop planted. [...] Resistance is another control method. Resistance is the most desired means of rust control. Planting a variety that is resistant to rust is helpful in preventing disease. Foliar fungicides are another way of control; recommended fungicides need to be applied before severe symptoms are seen.|$|E
50|$|P. infestans survives {{poorly in}} nature {{apart from its}} plant hosts. Under most conditions, the hyphae and asexual sporangia can survive for only brief periods in plant debris or soil, and are {{generally}} killed off during frosts or very warm weather. The exceptions involve oospores, and hyphae present within tubers. The persistence of viable pathogen within tubers, {{such as those that}} are left in the ground after the previous year's harvest or left in cull piles is a major problem in disease management. In particular, <b>volunteer</b> <b>plants</b> sprouting from infected tubers are thought to be a major source of inoculum {{at the start of a}} growing season. This can have devastating effects by destroying entire crops.|$|E

Out of 772 plants belonging to 12 different families (Solanaceae, Amaranthaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Papaveraceae, Urticaceae, Convolvulaceae, Asteraceae, Polygonaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Brassicaceae, Portulacaceae, and Compositae), 337 {{were found to}} be infected by PVYN based on DAS-ELISA technique.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Genetic use {{restriction}} technologies (GURTs) {{were developed to}} preserve the intellectual property of genetically modified crops (GM) and ensure the return of investments made by industry to obtain technology delivered through seeds. The aims of this review are to discuss the GURTs and analyze their possible applications in integrated management of agricultural pests. There are two classes of GURTs: T-GURTs (trait-based GURTs), wherein the generated seed are viable, but the next generation does not express the trait of agronomic interest, and V-GURT (variety-based GURTs), in which plants produce non viable seeds. However, beyond the seed protection purpose, the GURTs could have also other application to solve agronomic problems. One {{of the most important}} is the use of GURTs as a tool to restrict gene flow of GM traits to relative weeds. In addition, it is proposed the use of this technology in integrated weed management by preventing the GMs seed germination, which produces <b>volunteer</b> <b>plants</b> that compete with the crop of interest. Also, these <b>volunteer</b> <b>plants</b> may serve as alternative hosts for insects and pathogens in between crop seasons. The GURTs could contribute to the control of undesirable agents in agricultural systems, reducing the use of pesticides and increasing crop yields...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of herbicides [MSMA+diuron], [paraquat+diuron], metsulfuron-methyl and 2, 4 -D in control of <b>volunteer</b> <b>plants</b> of Roundup Ready® soybean, cultivar BRS Valiosa RR® when applied at various stages of development. The experiment was set up in Rio Verde city, in agricultural year 2007 / 08, using the randomized complete block experimental design in factorial scheme 5 x 3 (herbicide x application times) with four replications. The herbicide treatments were: metsulfuron- methyl (3, 0 g ha- 1), 2, 4 -D (1340 g ha- 1), [MSMA+diuron] (1. 800 + 700 g ha- 1, respectively), [paraquat+diuron] (600 + 300 g ha- 1, respectively) and control without spraying of herbicide; the second factor was the spraying of herbicides on phenological stages (V 2, V 6 and R 2) of soybean plants. It was evaluated the percentage of controlling of volunteer soybean at 7, 14, 28 and 42 days after application (DAA) of herbicides, beyond the plant height and dry matter accumulation in shoots at 42 DAA. It was found that the herbicide treatments [MSMA+diuron] and 2, 4 -D provided greater control of <b>volunteer</b> <b>plants</b> of RR® soybean at stage V 2 and the 2, 4 -D with spraying at V 6.

Volunteer corn (Zea mays L.) is the result of corn kernels remaining in the field following harvest and is a competitive weed in a number of subsequent crops. With widespread adoption of glyphosate-resistant (Gly-R) corn, Gly-R volunteer corn has become a troublesome weed. Little is known about the interference and management of Gly-R volunteer corn in corn. The objectives of this research were to: a) determine the extent of kernels remaining in fields following harvest; b) identify the competitive effects of volunteer corn in corn at densities ranging from 0 to 8 plants m- 2; and c) describe the efficacy of glufosinate or imazethapyr + imazapyr to control Gly-R volunteer corn at two densities (1 and 4 plants m- 2) and three application heights (10, 20, and 40 cm) in glufosinate-resistant or imidazolinone-tolerant hybrids, respectively. Research was conducted during 2008, 2009, and 2010 at multiple locations throughout central and northeast Missouri. Harvest inefficiencies resulted in kernels remaining in the field at densities ranging from 62, 241 to 986, 552 kernels ha- 1. Volunteer corn was very competitive, reducing row corn leaf nitrogen, stalk diameter, and grain yield with as few as 0. 5 plants m- 2. Glufosinate applied at all heights, and imazethapyr + imazapyr applied at 10 and 20 cm reduced the impact of volunteer corn and prevented grain yield losses. Overall, harvest inefficiencies will inevitably result in kernel losses, which may result in up to 99 <b>volunteer</b> <b>plants</b> m- 2. Producers should minimize the impact of Gly-R volunteer corn by establishing a rotation system with glufosinate-resistant or imidazolinone-tolerant hybrids; other techniques may be needed to eliminate <b>volunteer</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|E
