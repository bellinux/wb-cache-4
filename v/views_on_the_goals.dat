Probation officers work closest with probationers and develop a unique understanding of what contributes to a probationer 2 ̆ 7 s success. The framework for this research is rooted in the idea that the officers experience conflicting goals of rehabilitation and law enforcement. Extensive interviews were conducted with probation officers in Federal and local probation to assess their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of probation, needs of probationers, and best practices. Hypotheses tested involve the importance of evidence-based practices, cognitive-behavioral therapies, and the use of risk and needs assessments. Findings indicate that officers downplay rehabilitation and successful practices in response to the conflicting goals that they face, such as ensuring public safety. In response to these findings, probation departments should focus on transferring what has been determined to contribute to success into everyday use of supervision...|$|E

We do so in the context of UTeachEngineering (UTE), a program supported in part by funding by the National Science Foundation and designed to develop a model approach to address the systematic challenges facing this work—from identifying learning goals, to certifying pre- and in-service teachers for engineering courses to developing a research-based high school engineering course. Given the systemic nature of the UTE approach, this model is positioned to serve as a starting point to further the conversation around two of the National Academy of Engineering Committee on Standards in K- 12 Engineering Education (2010) central recommendations for future work in this area: (1) Identification of core ideas in engineering, and (2) creation of guidelines for instructional materials. Toward that end, project faculty and staff were interviewed and/or surveyed about their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> and outcomes of engineering and engineering teacher education, as well as strategies design to reach these goals and the warrants for them.

40|$|The {{failure of}} key EU Member States {{to respect the}} {{provisions}} of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) a few years after its inception triggered a heated debate on how to reform the framework of fiscal policy coordination in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). This paper analyzes 101 reform proposals presented by professional academic and non-academic economists prior to March 2005, when the Council of the European Union adopted a revised version of the SGP. Roughly four different schools of thought concerning the reform of the SGP are identified. In line with the main findings of the political economy literature, all four schools of thought share the view that in the absence of specific rules fiscal policy would lead to excessive deficits and hence affect the conduct of the common monetary policy. However, beyond this common denominator, there is no consensus on how best to co-ordinate fiscal policy. We present several explanations for the multitude of proposals, the most important being the present lack of a consensus in the economics profession concerning the role of fiscal policy. Economists hold diverging <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals,</b> instruments, efficiency and institutions for fiscal policy-making. This state of affairs is {{in sharp contrast to the}} case of monetary policy. Also, the euro area is the first case where monetary policy-making is centralized while fiscal policy-making is decentralized to national governments. ...|$|E
40|$|Much {{research}} has been done within the field of Education on how to integrate Human Rights in education, both as a class subject and as a value system. Similarly, the research field of Education also contains many discussions of how “critical thinking” is taught and what its role in education is and should be. This thesis instead approaches the topic from “the other way round” so to speak, by using a “human rights lens” to explore ethical and political <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of education generally and the role of critical thinking in education particularly, as they appear within a particular educational context – Rwanda’s education system. The philosophy of education of utilitarianism and that of Martha Nussbaum’s Capability Approach are here compared and contrasted with each other and act as a theoretical framework for understanding the Rwandan education system as it appears through the reading of policy documents and through the experience of a selected group of Rwandan primary and secondary school students. The thesis argues that an ethically acceptable and stable philosophy of education should spring from a conception of human beings as ends and not means. Starting with such a conception of human beings, the goal of education becomes that of developing each individual’s capabilities to their fullest potential. Additionally, the thesis argues that the role of critical thinking in education should be regarded as central, as the capability for critical thinking enhances the flourishing of other human capabilities...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and discusses the views {{and attitudes of}} juvenile delinquents regarding the implications of genomics and neurobiology research findings for the prevention and treatment of antisocial behavior. Scientific developments in these disciplines {{are considered to be}} of increasing importance for understanding the causes and the course of antisocial behavior and related mental disorders. High expectations exist with regard to the development of more effective prevention and intervention. Whether this is a desirable development does not only depend on science, but also on the ethical and social implications of potential applications of current and future research findings. As this pilot study points out, juvenile delinquents themselves have rather mixed <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> and means of early identification, prevention and treatment. Some welcome the potential support and help that could arise from biologically informed preventive and therapeutic measures. Others, however, reject the very goals of prevention and treatment and express worries concerning the risk of labeling and stigmatization and the possibility of false positives. Furthermore, interventions could aim at equalizing people and taking away socially disapproved capacities they themselves value. Moreover, most juvenile delinquents are hardly convinced that their crime could have been caused by some features of their brain or that a mental disorder has played a role. Instead, they provide social explanations such as living in a deprived neighborhood or having antisocial friends. We suggest that the hopes and expectations as well as the concerns and worries of juvenile delinquents are relevant not only for genomics and neurobiology of antisocial behavior, but also for prevention and intervention measures informed by social scientific and psychological research. The range of patterns of thought of juvenile delinquents is of great heuristic value and may lead to subsequent research that could further enhance our understanding of these patterns.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study how {{individuals}} with alcohol and drug problems come to treatment – who is in treatment and who is not? It further studies the goal and role of treatment according to different groups – clients, staff and politicians. How can we understand clients’ experiences in a context? The main data is from the Women and men in Swedish alcohol and drug treatment-study, with {{a representative sample of}} clients as well as complementary data on the views of staff and the general population. The thesis comprises four related papers: (1) explores who is in treatment and who is not by analysing the client and the general population samples; (2) studies reasons for coming to treatment among clients by focussing on self-choice in relation to informal, formal, and legal social pressures to seek treatment; (3) investigates alcohol and drug related events among misusers and the role of these events in treatment entry, and in relation to level of marginalization of the clients; (4) analyses motives for and conflicts surrounding changes in the treatment system on an organizational level. The thesis reveals that clients in treatment are marginalized (regarding housing, work, family, etc.). At treatment entry, clients report self-choice as well as a range of pressures to seek treatment as reasons for coming. The events are influential in treatment seeking, especially events and pressures in relation to significant others. In addition, it is shown that changes in the treatment system are not only driven with the interests of the clients in mind. Professional struggles, economic cuts, and coincidences are of importance. It is shown that different actors have competing as well as compatible and matching <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of treatment. Finally, some notable changes in the treatment system are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Science teacher {{education}} {{is an essential}} component in the entire system of science education. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of appropriate theory to describe and explain the complex phenomena and problems involved in science teaching and {{teacher education}}, and to provide effective guidance for policy-makers and practitioners. However, a range of theoretical viewpoints concerning science education and teacher education in general have been articulated in recent years. The aim of this article is to summarize some of the main theoretical perspectives in this area, so that they can be referred to in practical works and future research studies on science teacher education. First, contemporary <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of science education and the principles of science teaching, assessment and teacher education have been articulated by a number of science educators and professional organizations worldwide (NRC, 2000; 2007). These theoretical viewpoints are based on a wealth of findings from research studies on students’ learning of science carried out in the past few decades. It was noted that learning with understand is the focus of the latest scientific studies on students learning, that is, cognitive processes involved in learning are the main research interests. Our new understanding of students’ learning indicated that students are active learners, their attention, memory, sense-making, problem solving, understanding and acquisition new knowledge are strongly influenced by their prior knowledge, skills, and conceptions. In addition, it was found that students’ inquiry skills and their understanding of basic science principles are closely related, and that meta-cognition plays an important role in science teaching and learning. The implications for science teacher education is that teacher education institutions are expected to provide opportunities for teachers to develop the knowledge, skills, and teaching approaches which will enable them to create better learning environments for their students. The importance of science teachers’ development of pedagogical content knowledge in school contexts is emphasized. Secondly, turning to literature on teacher education in general, theoretical perspectives on the purposes of teacher education, teachers’ professional qualities and teachers’ learning to teach are respectively discussed. Summarizing the analysis of Zeichner and Joyce, Doyle (1990) outlined five paradigms in teacher education programs, including teachers as good employees, junior professors, fully functioning persons, innovators, and reflective practitioners. Five conceptual orientations of teacher education programs are described by Feiman-Nemser (1990), including academic, practical, technological, personal, and critical/social. Doyle (1990) discussed teacher professional qualities in great length, by pointing out a sharp distinction between the professional-technical knowledge base emphasized by traditional competence-based teacher education program (informed by process-product research studies) and the kind of personal practical knowledge that teachers actively constructed within the social environment in school contexts. The former emphasizes direct instruction of generalized knowledge and skills in teaching, while the later emphasizes teachers’ roles in making personal meaning, insight, and creativity within a specific context. Doyle (1990) strongly suggested that successful teacher education program and research studies can be designed if one combines fruitfully the strengths of both knowledge types mentioned above. Korthagon (2004) and coworkers have done comprehensive research studies along the same line. In addition to point out that teachers change take place successively through a layered structure from environment, behavior, competencies, beliefs, identity, to mission (the innermost layer), they proposed that in learning to teach, mathematics teachers and possibly teachers in other fields as well, develop through a sequence of three stages, namely, gestalt formation, schematization, and theory building. In general, at the gestalt stage, teachers operate or react to classroom events unconsciously and unintentionally, using their prior knowledge, experiences under similar situations as reference frames. Schemas are relatively more systematic thoughts formed by teachers when they are asked or required to reflect on their decisions and teaching behaviors explicitly, or to discuss and compare them with other teachers. The stage of theory building takes place only when teachers are conscious that their schemas are getting more complicated and that they want to make the logic and reasons involved clear. Finally, the limitations of traditional technical-oriented teacher education programs are pointed out. For science teacher education practice and research, it is recommended that various theoretical perspectives are considered, taking into account different goals, contexts, participants and other resources. As for future research directions, it is suggested that the links between theory and practice be strengthened. For example, how to inform teachers so that they can make better use of research findings and theoretical knowledge in their classroom teaching, and how to formulate more practical research questions based on teachers’ practice in classroom contexts. Hopefully, this will eventually lead to the building of more useful teachers’ practical theories...|$|E

Intervenability aims for the empowerment of end-users by keeping their personal data and how it is processed by the software system under their control. Several surveys have pointed out that the lack of intervenability options is a central privacy concern of end-users. In this paper, we systematically assess <b>the</b> privacy <b>goal</b> of intervenability and set up {{a software}} requirements taxonomy that relates the identiﬁed intervenability requirements with a taxonomy of transparency requirements. Furthermore, we provide a tool-supported method to identify intervenability requirements from the functional requirements of a software system.

Our combined taxonomy of intervenability and transparency requirements gives a detailed <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> privacy <b>goal</b> of intervenability and its relation to transparency.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{evaluate}} the Human Development Index (HDI) as {{to contribute to}} recent political and social debates <b>on</b> development cooperation. <b>The</b> focus lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way development is usually approached. The HDI is a renown instrument to assess countries’ performance in terms of development. However, the flipside of high development is that it sometimes has inversely proportional effects on less developed countries. This is not reflected in the HDI, as the HDI only indicates countries’ level of income, longevity and knowledge The evaluation of the HDI {{is based on a}} comparison between Amartya Sen’s capability approach (the conceptual framework of the HDI) and Denis Goulet’s theory of authentic development. Sen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one hand stresses the need to expand peoples capabilities to choose a life they have reason to value. Goulet, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, argues that development should lead to life-sustenance, esteem and freedom for every man and of the whole humanity. Both theories are explored according to <b>the</b> reflected <b>views</b> <b>on</b> development, <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of development and <b>the</b> values <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> theories are based.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether {{the concept of}} desired outcome in community programs serving adults with psychiatric disorders was a unitary or multifaceted concept and whether, if multifaceted, subject stakeholder group membership or variables of sex, education, age or attitudes were related to subject preferences for types of outcome. ^ A literature review and focus groups were used to establish {{a broad range of}} potential outcomes and 47 subjects from six stakeholder groups (clients, family members, direct care staff, directors of programs serving clients with serious psychiatric disorders, DMH personnel who made service funding decisions, and taxpayers) sorted the 82 outcomes in order of their perceived importance. Subject responses were factor analyzed and a five factor solution was interpreted as indicating concerns for (1) increased client self determination, (2) risk reduction and stability, (3) provision for basic needs, (4) increasingly responsible and integrated community living, and (5) increased autonomy through skill development and symptom reduction. Stakeholder group membership was the only subject variable significantly correlated with subject differences in loading <b>on</b> <b>the</b> five identified factors.

40|$|Stereoscopic 3 D {{displays}} {{are able}} to provide an added sense of depth compared to traditional displays by sending slightly different images to each eye. Although stereoscopic displays can provide a more immersive viewing experience, existing methods have drawbacks that can detract from image quality and cause perceptual artifacts. In this thesis I investigate perceptual artifacts associated with displays, and propose novel techniques that can improve viewing experience compared to existing methods. Chapter 1 presents a broad introduction to {{the various types of}} artifacts that can occur in displays, including motion artifacts, depth distortion, flicker, and color breakup. In Chapter 2, I describe a novel display technique, "spatiotemporal interlacing," that combines spatial and temporal interlacing. I demonstrate using psychophysics that this method provides a better viewing experience than existing methods, and I present a computational model that confirms the psychophysical data. In Chapter 3, I present an investigation of perceptual artifacts on a high-frame-rate (240 Hz) temporally interlaced OLED display. The high frame rate of this display allows for several unique driving modes. I investigated the perceptual consequences of these driving modes, characterizing the display in terms of motion, depth distortion, flicker, spatial resolution, and luminance.

40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} how nurse leaders {{view and}} experience the opportunities offered {{by one of the}} largest global nursing organisations Sigma Theta Tau International (STTI). BACKGROUND: Worldwide, nursing leadership is challenged with addressing the complex issues impacting on care delivery. International nursing organisations are a means to bring together individuals to promote leadership and scholarship for nursing practice to promote patient safety and quality care. The newly established all-England Chapter of STTI is a recent addition to the society in terms of nurse leadership in Europe; and as such faces challenges as it establishes its identity and seeks to interpret the organisational vision: to advance world health through nursing leadership and scholarship. Moving forward, members <b>views</b> were sought <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of <b>the</b> chapter and how they may be enacted. DESIGN: In July 2013, all chapter members at that time had been nominated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of achievement in nurse leadership; all were invited to participate in an online survey. The online questionnaire contained a series of closed and open questions. RESULTS: Most respondents joined because they believed in the vision and networking opportunities STTI provides. Three themes were extracted from the data: the value of networking and communication, leadership and the development of culturally sensitive organisations and the need for shared scholarship for nursing practice. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate the growth of effective leadership at all levels of nursing could be harnessed through successful collaboration and keen support for robust connections between practice and education to promote quality care RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Whilst challenging, globalisation presents an opportunity for a nursing society such as STTI to work collaboratively to address health care issues. A nursing society which explores and resolves its own complex issues by actively promoting leadership and collaborative scholarship, reveals a potential to empower the profession to share our collective solutions towards enhancing clinical practice.

This forces components {{to operate in the}} boundary lubrication regime. In this lubrication regime, the normal load put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> components is no longer carried by the lubricant but rather by the interacting asperities, and by doing so solid-solid contact is inevitable. This increases the specific wear seen in these types of systems shortening the lifetime of components and increasing maintenance intervals. This decreases the operational times significantly. Therefore, it is of great importance to get a clear understanding of the concept of corrosive wear under these specific conditions. In this thesis three different aspects of wear are discussed namely: the transition from mild to severe wear, running-in and the steady state mild wear. The first is modeled using a thermal threshold originating from Blok’s hypothesis that the transition to adhesive wear is caused by transcending a predefined critical temperature. The model discussed in the current work is based on a numerical thermal model combined with an elastic-plastic contact solver, which are both using the DC-FFT algorithms combined with CGM iterative schemes. In this way the model is able to incorporate mild wear into the thermal and contact calculations while keeping the computational times within a reasonable range. The model is validated through an experimentally determined transition diagram. Running-in of surfaces is modeled using the hypothesis that an additive rich oil is able to protect the contacting elements from metal to metal contact therefore, the growth rate should be the same or greater than the layer removal rate. This hypothesis is combined with a wear model based on a maximum equivalent strain assumption. This states that for material to be removed both an equivalent plastic strain threshold should be met and that the volume including this strain should reach the surface. To be able to compute the plastic strain, a Semi-Analytical-Contact solver is developed based on a local friction model. The mild wear model is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dynamic chemical balance at the surface. Through mechanical removal the balance is disturbed and the system will restore the balance through chemical reactions between the base material and additives present in the oil. Since the chemical reaction layers are very thin compared to contact regions, it can be assumed that it has only a limited effect on contact conditions. Using this hypothesis, a model is presented to determine the removal rate of the chemical reaction layer and thus the intensity of corrosive wear. The validation of this model is done using model systems. This thesis is divided into two parts: the first part is a summary of theory presented in the appended papers presented in the second part. This way the reader is able to keep a clear <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> overall <b>goal</b> of <b>the</b> research by reading the first part while the details are discussed in the second part...|$|R
40|$|The {{features}} of prisons in old Poland, their role {{and the organization}} were changing along with <b>the</b> evolution of <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aims and <b>goals</b> of punishment {{in the criminal justice}} system. Quite different is the picture when punishment is to have the rehabilitation effect and another if the basic premise of penal policy is the principle of deterrence, and not to amend the morality of the criminals (that was the situation in Poland until the 18 th century). The imprisonment could be conducted in five different ways. The choice of prison was performer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of the type of crime committed, but was the condition of the convict was also of some importance. At as early as in the 12 – 13 th centuries there appeared prisons for people of lower states, to which burghers and peasants were sent. Initially, they acted as a preventive measure only. In the Middle Ages an upper tower, used mainly in relation to the nobility, was developed. It was an institution according to which the penance took place in decent, almost home-like, conditions. In the modern era, {{in the first half of}} the 16 th century, there appeared a lower tower, which was often not so much a place of imprisonment, but slow death. The 18 th century brought significant changes in the nature and function of prisons, which were associated with the incoming ideas of the Enlightenment to the Republic, according to which the penalty was meant to be a means of improvement and rehabilitation rather than retribution. Deposition in the tower, which was a place of repentance devoid of any factors of rehabilitation, was graduały replaced with sending the convicts to prison. Marshal prison should be noted since it stood for changes. It was a modern facility in which the sentenced were kept in very humanitarian as for those times conditions, and their moral advancement was of great interest so as to make sure they would not return <b>on</b> <b>the</b> criminal path. An important role played also the improvement houses and houses of forced labor, the essential aim of which was the improvement of prisoners’ morality and behaviour through work and prayer...|$|R

40|$|TM Jari Wihersaari käsittelee ammattikasvatustieteen väitöstutkimuksessaan kohtaamista ja sen rakentumista opettajuuden ydintapahtumana. Kohtaamisesta ja sen tarpeesta eri muodoissaan ja yhteiskunnan eri alueilla käydään keskustelua. Toisen ihmisen kokonaisvaltainen kohtaaminen liittyy sekä kasvatuksen maailmaan että muihin sellaisiin tieteenaloihin, joissa ihminen on keskeisessä asemassa. Tutkimus käsittelee kohtaamista opettajuuden maailmassa. Opettajuuteen kiinteästi liitetyn kohtaamis-käsitteen avaamattomuus johtuu osin siitä, että kasvatukseen muualta kuin kasvatuksen ytimestä tulevat tekijät johtavat asioita pois sen ytimestä. Opetus ja kasvatus nähdään toistaan erillisinä ja tämä painotus saa aikaan teknisen ja taloudellisen ajattelun liiallisen painotuksen. Tutkimuksen filosofinen lähestymistapa antaa kohtaamisesta ja dialogista käydylle keskustelulle käsitteellistä selkeyttä, jota tutkimuksessa tarvitaan yhteisen keskustelupohjan rakentamisessa. Tutkimuksessa selvitetään kohtaamisen ja dialogiin käsitteitä ja nostetaan esiin niihin liittyviä ongelmia ja lopuksi muodostetaan niistä kohtaamiseen liittyvä kokonaisnäkemys. Tutkimuksen mukaan dialogia voidaan pitää kohtaamisen edellytyksenä. Dialogin käyttö on voimakkaasti yleistynyt erityisesti kasvatustieteellisessä tutkimuksessa, mutta itse dialogista ei ole ollut selkiytynyttä käsitystä. Dialogista on etsitty ratkaisua kasvatuksellisen kohtaamisen ongelmaan, mutta sitä on käytetty myös ratkaisuna verkkopedagogiikan haasteisiin, yritysmaailman kehityskeskusteluihin sekä mentorointiin. Tutkimuksen mukaan dialogin ja kohtaamisen suhde riippuu siitä, mitä ymmärrämme dialogilla. Eri dialogisuusteoreetikoiden ja dialogisuusfilosofien dialogit soveltuvat eri tarkoituksiin. Dialogien erot liittyvät kohtaavien etäisyyteen, lukumäärään sekä kohtaamisen ontologiaan. Buberilaisen Minä-Sinä- kohtaamisen dialoginen malli vastaa parhaiten aidolle kohtaamiselle asetettuja vaatimuksia. Dialogi voidaan nähdä sekä kasvatuksen että opetuksen ytimenä, kun se ymmärretään siten, että kasvatussuhde luo edellytyksiä opettamisen onnistumiselle. Sen kautta voidaan tavoitella onnistuneesti kasvatuksen päämäärää. Kasvatus on keskeinen osa elämää ja ihmiseksi tulemista. Kohtaamisen ja dialogin päämäärä on niissä itsessään. Kun kohtaamiselle luo oikeat edellytykset, se voi toteutua omilla ehdoillaan. Dialogin opettelu ei ole tekniikan tai uusien didaktisten keinojen opettelua. Tutkimus osoittaa, että aitoon kohtaamiseen pyrkivää dialogia on mahdollista valmistella pohtimalla oman kasvatusajattelunsa perusteita ja sen lähtökohtia. Encounter- The {{essence of}} teachership? Studying an {{encounter}} is, despite its seemingly self evident nature, a topical subject. The gist {{of education and}} teaching is encountering each other, {{which is based on}} one´s own experience. In my thesis, I´m trying to find the experience of an encounter {{with the help of the}} best applicable method. I?m trying to get into the experience, to reveal what an encounter really is and what the essence of an encounter is. There was a need to find a point of view which could clarify an encounter and its structure. Teaching and education are joined together in an encounter in which it is a question of the educator and the one being educated being in an ontological relationship. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> basis of research, encountering can be regarded as a constitutive factor of being a teacher. The analysis of the concept of an encounter helps us to understand what the starting point of genuine communicative competence is. In the thesis, a teacher´s relationship to the world is examined from a dialogue philosophical point of view. The main questions of this thesis are: 1. What can be understood as a genuine encounter? 2. On what kind of dialogue can an encounter be constructed? In my thesis I implement the central principles of philosophical methodology and discuss fundamental problems in an encounter and the use and contents of the concepts related to it. I explain concepts related to the subject matter and raise problems connected to them and in the end I form an overall view relating to an encounter. Philosophical research gives clarity to the discussion of an encounter and a dialogue, which is needed in the thesis to build a common basis of discussion. Especially phenomenological philosophy has presented issues connected to encountering a human being. There is an on-going debate in different fields of society about encountering people and about its need in its different forms. To encounter another person comprehensively is connected to both the world of education and to other scientific fields where an individual is in a central position. The use of the concept of an encounter in abundance reflects its significance and the difficulties in defining it. The thesis deals with encounters between teachers and students. In this context, being a teacher has been defined from a psychological and collective viewpoint, not from the point of view of education. The development arising from education itself has to be looked into from the viewpoint of education. Only action <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of which teaching and education improves can be regarded as the development of education. It is a prerequisite in education for the educator to have a strong <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of education. <b>The</b> fact that the concept of an encounter closely related to being a teacher hasn´t been opened up, is partly due to the fact that the factors outside the essence of education lead us away from the essence. Teaching and education are seen separate from each other and consequently, there is too much emphasis on technical and economic thinking. To understand encounters between individuals, one has to have genuine understanding of humanity and its basic factors. I call the thinking arising from education the world of educating teachers to be teachers to differentiate it from the worlds of business life and globalization. I look into encountering and the fundamental problems in it from the viewpoint of education. There is an abundant use of a dialogue in the field of education and it hasn´t been analysed enough. The concept has had a range of different meanings, although those discussing don´t always identify it. In my thesis, I look into the use of a dialogue in research literature and in the views of different philosophers and theorists. The use of a dialogue has become more and more common especially in pedagogical research, but there hasn?t been a clear idea about the concept of a dialogue itself. A dialogue has been used to solve the problem of an educational encounter, but it has also been used as a solution to the challenges of net pedagogy, the development discussions of the business world and mentoring. According to research, the relationship between a dialogue and an encounter depends on what we understand by a dialogue. The dialogues of different dialogue theorists and dialogue philosophers apply to different purposes. The use of a dialogue in net pedagogy and in working life arises from different points of view and from different targets. The differences between dialogues have something to do with the distance between those who encounter each other and with the number of people encountering each other and with the ontology of an encounter. The dialogical model of a Buberian I ´ Thou -encounter best meets the requirements for a genuine encounter. The encounter in Buber´s dialogue is the ideal of a genuine encounter, to which one has to aspire but which cannot be controlled. In a dialogue genuine encountering just takes place, one can be open to it but it cannot be forced. A dialogue can be seen as the essence of education and teaching when it is understood in the way that it is the relationship between the educator and the student which makes successful teaching possible. Through it the objective of education can be successfully pursued. Education is a central part of life and a central part of becoming a human being. The objective of an encounter and a dialogue is in themselves. If you create the right conditions for an encounter, it can be realized on its own terms. Learning a dialogue is not the same as learning a new technique or new didactic means. This thesis shows that genuine encountering is possible to pursue by pondering the basis and starting points of one´s own pedagogical thinking...|$|R
