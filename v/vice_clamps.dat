40|$|Many {{experimental}} methods seek to minimize phonetic variation, hoping to spare linguistic information {{and eliminate the}} paralinguistic, the idiosyncratic and the ”merely ” expressive [3]. A conventional technique (phonetic <b>vice</b> <b>clamps)</b> {{is the use of}} a frame such as ”say X again ”, familiar from many studies. Typically, the underlying assumption is that utterance-to-utterance variability stems from th...|$|E
60|$|On a dark November {{morning when}} a blustering wind drove the rain {{against the windows}} Thomas Foster sat {{stripping}} the lock of a favourite gun in the room he called his study at Hazlehurst in Shropshire. The shelves on the handsome panelled walls contained a few works on agriculture, horse-breeding, and British natural history, but two racks were filled with guns and fishing rods and the table Foster was seated at had a <b>vice</b> <b>clamped</b> to its edge. He had once had a commodious gunroom, but had given it up, under pressure from his wife, who thought she could make a better use of it, since Hazlehurst was small and she had numerous guests, but the study was his private retreat. A hacksaw, a few files, a wire brush, {{and a bottle of}} Rangoon oil were spread out in front of him, the latter standing, for the sake of cleanliness, {{on the cover of the}} Field.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Parallel jaws {{are widely}} used in machine tools for <b>clamping.</b> <b>Vice</b> {{wrenches}} are necessary for loading and unloading workpieces. However, it is inconvenient to use current vice wrenches. In order to improve the flexibility and convenience of vice wrenches and improve the efficiency of mechanical <b>clamping,</b> a new-type <b>vice</b> wrench is designed. ...|$|R
50|$|The site in Dillingen/Danube {{was founded}} in 1953. The 1650 square meters productionhall was {{constructed}} in 2007 and contains two turning and milling machines, which are adapted to RÖHM’s special requirements. The machines enabled the processing of parts of up to four meters in diameter and 25 tons in weight. Due to a net weight of 108 tons the machine required a foundation of 180 tons of iron and steel. The Dillingen site mainly produces lathe chucks, machine <b>vices</b> and special <b>clamping</b> equipment for turning and milling machinery {{as well as for}} machining centres.|$|R
40|$|Horizontal {{band saw}} machine is an {{important}} machine tool in mechanical workshop. This paper is about Weight reduction of fix jaw of rear vice. Rear <b>vice</b> used for <b>clamping</b> work piece during cutting operation. It has two jaws Fix jaw and movable jaw. Movable jaw attached to hydraulic cylinder which applies force to hold work piece between these two jaw. Reduce weight of components help to minimize load on environmental resources. This efforts for reduction of weight by using topology optimization. fix jaws has been modeled using solid works First conducted analysis on existing jaws with calculating the forces acting on jaws {{in order to find}} out Max. Displacement and stress induced. These analyses were carried using Altair Hyperworks and solver used is optistuct. Again conducted topology optimization with applying manufacturing constrain like minimum member size and single type draw direction. Again prepare cad model based on topology result and carried analysis on optimized model. from the analyzed results, Displacement and stress are lower than existing model. From result it was found that current design is safe also save material and cost of component, Finally we reduced total weight by 12 % of current fix jaw model. Topology optimization analysis is carried out in Hyperworks which yielded in weight optimized...|$|R
