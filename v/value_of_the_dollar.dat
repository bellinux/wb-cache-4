5|$|Continuing {{his earlier}} battle with Stevens, Blaine {{led the fight}} in Congress for a strong dollar. After the {{issuance}} of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> stood at a low ebb. A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve {{the status quo and}} allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine called this idea a repudiation of the nation’s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his hard money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E
25|$|In the {{two decades}} that followed, its highest value {{relative}} to the US dollar was $0.881 in December 1988. The lowest ever <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> after it was floated was 47.75 US cents in April 2001. It returned to above 96 US cents in June 2008, and reached 98.49 later that year. Although the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> fell significantly from this high {{towards the end of}} 2008, it gradually recovered in 2009 to 94 US cents.|$|E
25|$|The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe {{responded to}} the dwindling <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> by {{repeatedly}} arranging the printing of further banknotes, often at great expense from overseas suppliers.|$|E
50|$|The Gogo is {{convertible}} with <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar,</b> {{based on}} <b>the</b> Consumer Price Index at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exchange. For example, in 2001, 1 Gogo cost $2.20 Canadian, which reflects <b>the</b> decline in <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> 2001, related to <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar</b> in 1980.|$|R
25|$|Inflation in <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar</b> {{has been}} fairly low since the 1990s. In 2007 <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar</b> rebounded, soaring 23% in value.|$|R
50|$|The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index (WSJ Dollar Index) is {{an index}} (or measure) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar</b> {{relative}} to 16 foreign currencies.|$|R
25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{speculated that}} the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> in 2011 was related to Europe's sovereign debt crisis, and Australia's strong ties with material importers in Asia and in particular China.|$|E
25|$|Amidst {{accelerating}} {{inflation in}} the United States, this unsustainable situation collapsed in May 1971, when West Germany {{was the first}} to withdraw support for the dollar and officially abandon the Bretton Woods accords, fueling a quick decline in the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b> Under the pressure from currency speculation, Switzerland declared secession in August with $50 million in gold purchases, and France followed suit at the rate of $191 million. This brought the US gold reserves to their lowest level since 1938.|$|E
25|$|Mexico’s stockmarket {{is closely}} linked to {{developments}} in the US. Thus, volatility in the New York and Nasdaq stock exchanges, as well as interest-rate changes and economic expectations in the US, can steer the performance of Mexican equities. This is both because of Mexico’s economic dependence on the US and the high volume of trading in Mexican equities through American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Currently, {{the decline in the}} <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> is making non-US markets, including Mexico's, more attractive.|$|E
50|$|Unlike many {{traditional}} barter exchanges, BizX pairs its currency to <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US <b>dollar,</b> ensuring that <b>the</b> BizX currency retains the strongest spending power possible.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar</b> was {{therefore}} no longer anchored to gold, and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve, however, {{continued to increase}} the money supply, resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar</b> in <b>the</b> 1970s. This was {{largely due to the}} prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked (the Phillips curve), and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign. Between 1965 and 1981, <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar</b> lost two thirds <b>of</b> its <b>value.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As a result, {{interest}} rates and inflation eventually came down along with <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar.</b> From 1991 to 2011 the inflation-targeting regime kept [...] "price gains fairly reliable." ...|$|R
25|$|The new Government {{was faced}} with an {{exchange}} rate crisis the day after it was elected. Speculators expected the change of government {{to result in a}} 20% devaluation of the New Zealand dollar, which led to the 1984 New Zealand constitutional crisis due to Muldoon's refusal to devalue, worsening the currency crisis further. As a result, the dollar was floated on 4 March 1985, allowing for the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> to change with the market. Prior to the dollar being floated, the dollar was pegged against a basket of currencies.|$|E
25|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{debate about whether}} central banks should target zero {{inflation}} (which would mean a constant value for the U.S. dollar over time) or low, stable inflation (which would mean a continuously but slowly declining <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> over time, {{as is the case}} now). Although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the U.S. dollar, others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control interest rates and stimulate the economy when needed.|$|E
25|$|Since 76.7% of Canada's exports {{go to the}} U.S., and 53.3% {{of imports}} into Canada come from the U.S. Canadians are {{interested}} in the value of their currency mainly against the U.S. dollar. Although domestic concerns arise when the dollar trades much lower than its U.S. counterpart, there is also concern among exporters when the dollar appreciates quickly. A rise in the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> increases the price of Canadian exports to the U.S. On the other hand, there are advantages to a rising dollar, in that it is cheaper for Canadian industries to purchase foreign material and businesses.|$|E
50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first {{challenges}} OPEC {{faced in}} the 1970s was the United States' unilaterally pulling out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bretton Woods Accord {{and taking the}} U.S. off the established Gold Exchange Standard in 1971. With that standard, only <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar</b> was pegged to <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> gold and all other currencies were pegged to <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar.</b> <b>The</b> change resulted in instability in world currencies and depreciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar,</b> {{as well as other}} currencies, and decreasing real revenues for OPEC whose producers still priced oil in dollars.|$|R
40|$|The central {{hypothesis}} to {{be tested}} is <b>the</b> relevance <b>of</b> gold in <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US <b>dollar</b> as an international reserve currency after 1971. In the first section <b>the</b> market <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US <b>dollar</b> is analysed by looking at new forms <b>of</b> <b>value</b> (financial derivative products), <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> as a safe haven, <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> a standard <b>of</b> <b>value</b> and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> SDRs in reforming the international monetary system. Based on dimensional analysis, the second section analyses the definition and meaning of a numéraire for international currency and the justification for a variable standard <b>of</b> <b>value</b> based on a commodity (gold). The second section is the theoretical foundation for the empirical and econometric analysis {{in the third and}} fourth sections. The third section is devoted to <b>the</b> specification <b>of</b> an econometric model and a graphical analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data. It is clear that an inverse relation exists between <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US <b>dollar</b> and <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> gold. <b>The</b> fourth section shows <b>the</b> estimations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different specifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model including linear regression and cointegration analysis. The most important econometric result is that the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of a significant link between <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> gold and <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US <b>dollar.</b> There is also a positive relationship between gold price and inflation. An inverse statistically significant relation between gold price and monetary policy is shown by applying a dynamic model of cointegration with lags...|$|R
50|$|Rosland’s {{primary product}} is gold and {{they argue that}} while <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US <b>dollar</b> drops, gold has long served as a hedge against {{inflation}} and has performed well in uncertain economic circumstances.|$|R
25|$|U.S. {{currency}} does, however, bear several anti-counterfeiting features. Two of {{the most}} critical anti-counterfeiting features of U.S. currency are the paper and the ink. The composition of the paper is 75 percent cotton and 25 percent linen. The ink and paper combine to create a distinct texture, particularly as the currency is circulated. The paper and the ink alone have no effect on the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> until post print. These characteristics can be hard to duplicate without the proper equipment and materials. Furthermore, recent redesigns of the $5, $10, $20, and $50 notes have added EURion constellation patterns which can be used by scanning software to recognize banknotes and refuse to scan them.|$|E
25|$|For foreign {{exchange}} purposes, the set $20.67 per ounce <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> was lifted, allowing the dollar to float freely in {{foreign exchange}} markets with no set value in gold. This was terminated after one year. Roosevelt attempted first to restabilize falling prices with the Agricultural Adjustment Act; however, {{this did not}} prove popular, so instead the next politically popular option was to devalue the dollar on foreign exchange markets. Under the Gold Reserve Act the value of gold was fixed at $35 per ounce, making the dollar more attractive for foreign buyers (and making foreign currencies more expensive for those holding dollars). This change led to more conversion of gold into dollars, allowing the U.S. to effectively corner the world gold market.|$|E
25|$|From 1 January 1876 onwards, the Mark {{became the}} only legal tender. The name Goldmark was created later to {{distinguish}} it from the Papiermark (papermark) which suffered a serious loss of value through hyperinflation following World War I (see inflation in the Weimar Republic). The goldmark was on a gold standard with 2790 Mark equal to 1 kilogram of pure gold (1 Mark = 358mg). From 1900 to 1933, the United States adhered to a gold standard as well, with the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> being fixed at a price of approximately one-twentieth ounce (troy weight) of gold (one troy ounce of gold was actually valued at US$20.67). The goldmark therefore had a value of approximately U.S. $0.25. The monetary hegemon {{of the time when}} the goldmark was in use, however, was the Pound Sterling, with £1 being valued at 20.43 goldmarks.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, President Carter {{appointed}} Paul Volcker Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve {{tightened the}} money supply and inflation was substantially lower in the 1980s, and hence <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar</b> stabilized.|$|R

50|$|In December 2014, {{commissioner}} Gary Bettman told {{teams that}} he projected {{the salary cap}} to increase to at least $73 million for the 2015-16 season, citing <b>the</b> fluctuating <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar.</b> <b>The</b> cap was ultimately set at $71.4 million.|$|R
25|$|The gold {{standard}} was suspended twice during World War I, once fully {{and then for}} foreign exchange. At {{the onset of the}} war, U.S. corporations had large debts payable to European entities, who began liquidating their debts in gold. With debts looming to Europe, the dollar to British pound exchange rate reached as high as $6.75, far above the (gold) parity of $4.8665. This caused large gold outflows until July 31, 1914, when the New York Stock Exchange closed and the {{gold standard}} was temporarily suspended. In order to defend the exchange <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar,</b> the US Treasury Department authorized state and nationally chartered banks to issue emergency currency under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act, and the newly created Federal Reserve organized a fund to assure debts to foreign creditors. These efforts were largely successful, and the Aldrich-Vreeland notes were retired starting in November and the gold standard was restored when the New York Stock Exchange re-opened in December 1914.|$|E
25|$|Mandatory {{spending}} {{is expected to}} continue increasing as a share of GDP. This {{is due in part to}} demographic trends, as the number of workers continues declining relative to those receiving benefits. For example, the number of workers per retiree was 5.1 in 1960; this declined to 3.0 in 2010 and is projected to decline to 2.2 by 2030. These programs are also affected by per-person costs, which are also expected to increase at a rate significantly higher than economic growth. This unfavorable combination of demographics and per-capita rate increases is expected to drive both Social Security and Medicare into large deficits during the 21st century. Unless these long-term fiscal imbalances are addressed by reforms to these programs, raising taxes or drastic cuts in discretionary programs, the federal government will at some point be unable to pay its obligations without significant risk to the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> (inflation). By one estimate, 70% of the growth in these entitlement expenses over the 2016-2046 period is due to healthcare.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1873, {{the silver}} dollar {{circulated}} {{in many parts}} of the world, with a value in relation to the British gold sovereign of roughly $1 = 4s 2d (21p approx). As a result of the decision of the German Empire to stop minting silver thaler coins in 1871, in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War, the worldwide price of silver began to fall. This resulted in the U.S. Coinage Act (1873) which put the United States onto a 'de facto' gold standard. Canada and Newfoundland were already on the gold standard, and the result was that the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> in North America increased in relation to silver dollars being used elsewhere, particularly Latin America and the Far East. By 1900, value of silver dollars had fallen to 50 percent of gold dollars. Following the abandonment of the gold standard by Canada in 1931, the Canadian dollar began to drift away from parity with the U.S. dollar. It returned to parity a few times, but since the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates that was agreed to in 1944, the Canadian dollar has been floating against the U.S. dollar. The silver dollars of Latin America and South East Asia began to diverge from each other as well during the course of the 20th century. The Straits dollar adopted a gold exchange standard in 1906 after it had been forced to rise in value against other silver dollars in the region. Hence, by 1935, when China and Hong Kong came off the silver standard, the Straits dollar was worth 2s 4d (11.5p approx) sterling, whereas the Hong Kong dollar was worth only 1s 3d sterling (6p approx).|$|E
50|$|There was {{considerable}} upheaval amongst Canadian franchises in the 1990s. In 1992, the NHL returned to Ottawa, beating out Hamilton for an expansion team. However, <b>the</b> declining <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar</b> at that time, coupled with rapidly escalating salaries, placed hardships on Canadian franchises. As a result, the Nordiques and Jets left Canada, becoming the Colorado Avalanche in 1995 and the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996 respectively. Fears persisted {{up to the}} 2004-05 NHL lockout that the Flames, Oilers, and Senators could follow suit. <b>The</b> financial fortunes <b>of</b> Canada's teams rebounded following the lockout: Canada's six franchises represented one-third of NHL revenues in 2006-07, primarily due to <b>the</b> surging <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar.</b>|$|R

50|$|Since {{the current}} CBA was {{approved}} after a later lockout in 2012-13, league revenues have stagnated {{due to a}} significant fall in <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar</b> against <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar.</b> <b>The</b> cap was $69 million for the 2014-15 season and will be $74 million for 2016-17.|$|R
500|$|Floyd Norris of The New York Times {{said the}} cause of the losses was rooted in the Plaza Accord that caused the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> to slide from 250 yen in 1984, to 121 yen by the end of 1987, heavily penalising Japanese exports. [...] "It turns out that it was an effort to make the company's [...] {{accurate}} ... It now appears the chairman reacted with righteous indignation.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, underemployment, inflation, {{and the rise}} in <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> all contributed to a third wave of {{emigration}} from the Dominican Republic. Today, emigration from the Dominican Republic remains high. In 2012 there were approximately 1.7 million people of Dominican descent in the U.S., counting both native- and foreign-born. There was also a growing Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico, with nearly 70,000 Dominicans living there [...] Although that number is slowly decreasing and immigration trends have reversed because of Puerto Rico's economic crisis as of 2016.|$|E
