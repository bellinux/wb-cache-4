60|$|I {{dare say}} many may be found, who have openly professed {{principles}} and opinions identical, in substance, {{with what has}} just been related here, who will be disposed to deny them, when they are thrown into their faces. There is nothing unusual in men's refusing to recognize their own children, when they are ashamed of the circumstances that brought them into being. But, {{in the course of}} this controversy, I have often heard arguments in discourse, and have often read them in the journals, as they have been put into the mouths of men in authority, and that, too, in their public communications, which, stripped of their <b>very</b> <b>thin</b> <b>coverings,</b> are pretty much on the level with those of Holmes and Tubbs. I am aware that no governor has, as yet; alluded to the hardships of the tenants, under the limited leases, but it would be idle to deny that the door has been opened to principles, or want of principles, that must sweep away all such property in the current of reckless popular clamor, unless the evil be soon arrested. I say evil, for it must prove a curse to any community to break down the securities of property, as it is held in what has hitherto been thought its most secure form, and, what is of still more importance in a moral point of view, all to appease the cravings of cupidity, as they are exhibited in the masses.|$|R
50|$|Another {{possibility}} is {{to extend the}} barline where a time change is to take place above the top instrument's line in a score and to write the time signature there, and there only, saving the ink and effort {{that would have been}} spent writing it in each instrument's staff. Henryk Górecki's Beatus Vir is an example of this. Alternatively, music in a large score sometimes has time signatures written as <b>very</b> long, <b>thin</b> numbers <b>covering</b> the whole height of the score rather than replicating it on each staff; this is an aid to the conductor, who can see signature changes more easily.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} discusses visualization {{techniques of}} articular cartilage for both {{quantitative and qualitative}} assessment. Articular cartilage is a <b>very</b> <b>thin</b> structure <b>covering</b> the endings of human bones. Thus, even slight changes in its thickness and inner structure may indicate an occurrence or progress of degeneration. The early detection of these factors is crucial for {{diagnosis and treatment of}} cartilage degeneration. Research to find treatments to stop or even reverse these degenerative changes is well in progress. Magnetic resonance imaging is currently the best and most used non-invasive technique for acquisition of soft tissue structures like articular cartilage. In this work we use two types of data: a high-resolution anatomical scan of the cartilage and a T 2 map, which is computed from a set of sequences with varying parameters. While the thickness of the data can be precisely assessed from the anatomical scan, the T 2 map offers information on the inner structures of the cartilage. Since the femoral cartilage is a curved thin-wall structure with a relatively small extent in one direction, {{it is very difficult to}} estimate its thickness from...|$|R
