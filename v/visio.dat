5|$|Since Microsoft's first {{acquisition}} in 1987, it {{has purchased}} {{an average of}} six companies a year. The company purchased more than ten companies a year between 2005 and 2008, and it acquired 18 firms in 2006, the most in a single year, including Onfolio, Lionhead Studios, Massive Incorporated, ProClarity, Winternals Software, and Colloquis. Microsoft has made nine acquisitions worth over one billion dollars: Skype (2011), aQuantive (2007), Fast Search & Transfer (2008), Navision (2002), <b>Visio</b> Corporation (2000), Yammer (2012), Nokia (2013), Mojang (2014) and LinkedIn (2016).|$|E
5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate <b>visio</b> by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture. Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: design strategist, strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.|$|E

25|$|Sixty {{copies of}} Heito's <b>Visio</b> Wettini survive today; the number {{suggests}} that the work was well received and comparatively more popular than Walahfrid's version, of which only seven copies survive. In the commentary to his 1974 English translation of Walahfrid's poem David Traill writes that the seven extant manuscripts are well preserved, with very few places in which reading becomes unclear. The relationship between these manuscripts, however, is uncertain, and {{has not yet been}} conclusively determined. In any case, none of them appear to be derived from any others, and generally fall into two main families: GD and ROM.|$|E
25|$|Wetti's visions are {{inscribed in}} the genre of dream literature, which was largely practised during the 9th century. These {{accounts}} of alleged visions or dreams follow a typical structure in which visionaries, after falling asleep, are led by angelic guides through other worlds, where they are made to witness sinners' punishments.The similarity among these visions probably arises from common cultural experiences, such as Gregory the Great's teaching that afterlife visions were {{for the benefit of}} the living, who should work to redeem their sins and eradicate the social structures in which sin was able to proliferate. The <b>Visio</b> Wettini gained wide acclaim and served as a foundation of Dante's Divine Comedy.|$|E
25|$|Wetti is {{best known}} for the visions of heaven and hell he had shortly before his death in about November 4, 824, which were {{recorded}} in Latin (<b>Visio</b> Wettini) by Heito, former abbot of Reichenau, in 824 and by Wetti's disciple Walahfrid Strabo in 827. Walahfrid's version, in verse, reveals far more about Wetti's visions than Heito's does, leveling more detailed accusations of greed and sexual misconduct against monks, government and church officials – cautiously edited or omitted by Heito – even acrostically naming Charlemagne when he appears in purgatory. An example of dream literature, the Vision of Wetti reflects Carolingian afterlife conceptions of punishment and salvation; it was widely read throughout contemporary monastic communities and is generally considered one of the influences on Dante's Divine Comedy.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the idea}} of purgatory {{as a process of}} {{cleansing}} thus dated back to early Christianity, the 12th century was the heyday of medieval otherworld-journey narratives such as the Irish <b>Visio</b> Tnugdali, and of pilgrims' tales about St. Patrick's Purgatory, a cavelike entrance to purgatory on a remote island in Ireland. The legend of St Patrick's Purgatory (Tractatus de Purgatorio Sancti Patricii) written in that century by Hugh of Saltry, also known as Henry of Sawtry, was [...] "part of a huge, repetitive contemporary genre of literature of which the most familiar today is Dante's"; another is the <b>Visio</b> Tnugdali. Other legends localized the entrance to Purgatory in places such as a cave on the volcanic Mount Etna in Sicily. Thus {{the idea of}} purgatory as a physical place became widespread on a popular level, and was defended also by some theologians.|$|E

2500|$|Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians is more {{generally}} agreed {{to refer to}} the astral planes; [...] "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows) such a one caught up to the third heaven..." [...] This statement gave rise to the <b>Visio</b> Pauli, a tract that offers a vision of heaven and hell, a forerunner of visions attributed to Adomnan and Tnugdalus as well as of Dante's Divine Comedy.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{differences}} between Heito's <b>Visio</b> Wettini and Walahfrid Strabo's 827 revision and transcription into verse. Whereas Heito deliberately dropped {{the names of}} the counts, priests and monks that the angel named as sinners, Walahfrid includes them, most importantly identifying Charlemagne as he suffers purgation. In so doing, Walahfrid obviously intended to answer Wetti's call which may otherwise have fallen on deaf ears, of identifying and condemning materialistic and sexual excesses in the Frankish political and religious hierarchies, something Heito, through omission and editing, was apparently unprepared to do. Beyond popularity, Walahfrid's poem helped to greatly advance his career, helping secure his place as tutor to Charles the Bald. Carol Zaleski explains that Walahfrid insisted that, [...] "far from seeking advancement, he was 'forced to break [...] and impelled, as if by a goad, to keep on writing.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Ring 1: Against Neighbors: In {{the first}} round of the seventh circle, the murderers, war-makers, plunderers, and tyrants are {{immersed}} in Phlegethon, a river of boiling blood and fire. Ciardi writes, [...] "as they wallowed in blood during their lives, so they are immersed in the boiling blood forever, each according to the degree of his guilt". The Centaurs, commanded by Chiron and Pholus, patrol the ring, shooting arrows into any sinners who emerge higher out of the boiling blood than each is allowed. The centaur Nessus guides the poets along Phlegethon and points out Alexander the Great, [...] "Dionysius" [...] (either Dionysius I or Dionysius II, or both; they were bloodthirsty, unpopular tyrants of Sicily), Ezzelino III da Romano (the cruelest of the Ghibelline tyrants), Obizzo d'Este, and Guy de Montfort. The river grows shallower until it reaches a ford, after which it comes full circle back to the deeper part where Dante and Virgil first approached it; immersed here are tyrants including Attila, King of the Huns (flagello in terra, [...] "scourge on earth", line 134), [...] "Pyrrhus" [...] (either the bloodthirsty son of Achilles or King Pyrrhus of Epirus), Sextus, Rinier da Corneto, and Rinier Pazzo. After bringing Dante and Virgil to the shallow ford, Nessus leaves them to return to his post. This passage may have been influenced by the early medieval <b>Visio</b> Karoli Grossi.|$|E
50|$|Along with Microsoft <b>Visio</b> 2002 Professional, Microsoft {{introduced}} <b>Visio</b> Enterprise Network Tools and <b>Visio</b> Network Center. <b>Visio</b> Enterprise Network Tools was an {{add-on product}} that enabled automated network and directory services diagramming. <b>Visio</b> Network Center was a subscription-based website where users could locate the latest network documentation content and exact-replica network equipment shapes from 500 leading manufacturers.
