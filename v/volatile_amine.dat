Production of volatile bases was generally highest in brining and lowest in mixed salting. The rate of TVB production increased with temperature and length of storage.

40|$|Despite recent {{evidence}} on {{an important role}} of <b>volatile</b> <b>amines</b> in the nucleation of particulate matter, very scarce information is available on their atmospheric abundance and source distribution. Previous measurements in animal housings had identified livestock husbandry as the main amine source, with trimethylamine (TMA) being the key component. This {{has led to the}} assumption that the agricultural sources for amines are similar as for ammonia, emitted throughout the cascade of animal excretion, storage and application in the field. In this study, we present the first micrometeorological flux measurements as well as dynamic enclosure experiments showing that the amine source strength from stored slurry is negligible, implying significant consequences for the global amine emission inventory. In the case of cattle, amine production is attributed to the animal's rumination activity and exhalation is suggested to be an important emission pathway, similar to the greenhouse gas methane.

No correlation was observed between histamine and TVB-N values except at 25 oC and assessment of TVB-N was not sufficient for estimating the degree of histamine-related health hazard.

40|$|Slurry {{surfacing}} contains chemicals such as emulsifier, break control additive, {{acids and}} bases {{as well as}} Portland cement or hydrated lime. At high concentrations some of these chemicals may pose a risk to the environment or to workers. The {{question is whether the}} low levels of chemicals emitted from the slurry process (fumes, run-off water) pose a significant hazard. Slurry emulsifiers are most often amine or polyamine derivatives. Emissions of <b>volatile</b> <b>amine</b> components from a microsurfacing project in Texas have been measured by a particularly sensitive analytical technique. The major component detected was ammonia at approximately 20 ppb (parts per billion), with minor amounts of alkylamines (0. 2 ppb). These levels represent less than 1 / 1000 th of the recommended exposure levels of ammonia and short chain amines. The conclusion is that workers are not exposed to dangerous levels of amines via the atmospheric route. Adsorption studies of a quaternary ammonium emulsifier from run-off water onto standard soils indicate that the emulsifier is strongly adsorbed and not desorbed on washing. The conclusion is that the mobility of the emulsifier in the soil environment is low- any emulsifier contained in run-off or wash-off water will remain close to the roadway...|$|E
40|$|The {{family of}} trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR) {{comprises}} 9 mammalian TAAR subtypes, with intact gene and pseudogene numbers differing considerably even between closely related species. To date the best characterized subtype is TAAR 1, which activates the G(s) protein/adenylyl cyclase pathway upon stimulation by trace amines and psychoactive substances like MDMA or LSD. Recently, chemosensory function involving recognition of volatile amines was proposed for murine TAAR 3, TAAR 4 and TAAR 5. Humans can smell volatile amines despite carrying {{open reading frame}} (ORF) disruptions in TAAR 3 and TAAR 4. Therefore, {{we set out to}} study the functional and structural evolution of these genes with a special focus on primates. Functional analyses showed that ligands activating the murine TAAR 3, TAAR 4 and TAAR 5 do not activate intact primate and mammalian orthologs, although they evolve under purifying selection and hence must be functional. We also find little evidence for positive selection that could explain the functional differences between mouse and other mammals. Our findings rather suggest that the previously identified <b>volatile</b> <b>amine</b> TAAR 3 - 5 agonists reflect the high agonist promiscuity of TAAR, and that the ligands driving purifying selection of these TAAR in mouse and other mammals still await discovery.

40|$|AbstractThere are {{two main}} routes for amine emission. The first one is {{connected}} to <b>volatile</b> <b>amine</b> emission. The second route is amine emission via aerosols. Recently, {{it has been observed}} that under certain conditions and at specific test locations significant aerosol formation and emission can occur. To distinguish between the two routes for amine emission, a novel methodology has been developed. This methodology is based on the separation of the aerosols from the vapour phase in a controlled isothermal modus. To be able to do this, the design of the probe and the sampling procedure should fit to the operational circumstances and is of crucial importance to guarantee isokinetic sampling. The separation of the aerosols is done via an impactor. Using an impactor, not only the total mass of aerosols can be determined, but also the size distribution. At the end of 2013 and at the beginning of 2014, two aerosol measurement campaigns were performed at CO 2 Technology Centre Mongstad, Norway. The measurements indicate that small amounts of aqueous aerosols with a broad aerosol size distribution are present in the flue gas stream from gas turbine operations. The presence of aqueous aerosols does not necessarily imply significant amine emission from the amine process. Analysis of the aqueous aerosols indicates low amine content present in the aerosol fractions, and it seems evident that amines present in the gaseous phase inside the absorber column have not been transferred to the aqueous aerosols and by such the total amine emissions are very low...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{transduction}} chemistry for {{the development}} of a polymer film-based optical sensor that responds reversibly to gas-phase amine species at sub-ppm levels is described. The sensor is based on the equilibrium of a indium(III) octaethylporphyrin hydroxide ion-bridged dimer species with corresponding monomeric porphyrins within a thin poly(vinyl chloride) film as a function of the level of <b>volatile</b> <b>amine</b> in the surrounding gas phase. The presence of amines causes the dimeric species to be converted to monomer via the ligation of the amine with the In(III) center of the porphyrin structure. This yields a significant change in the visible absorption spectrum of the film, with a decrease in the intensity of the Soret band corresponding to the dimer (lambdamax = 390 nm) and a concomitant increase in the Soret band for the monomer lambdamax = 406 - 408 nm). Response to different amines is based on their relative partition coefficient into the polymer film and their strength of axial ligation reactions, with a selectivity pattern of 1 -butylamine > 1 -propylamine > pyridine > triethylamine > ethylamine > methylamine > diethylamine > tert-butylamine > ammonia. It is further shown that a significant concentration of dimeric species within the polymer film can only be achieved if appropriate amounts of lipophilic anionic sites are also incorporated into the polymer in the form of a tetraphenylborate derivative and the resulting film is equilibrated briefly with water prior to gas-phase measurements. With optimized film compositions, 1 -butylamine can be detected in the gas phase to levels approaching 0. 1 ppm, while less lipophilic ammonia can be monitored down to 10 ppm, with fully reversible responses to each species. A simple mathematical model for the response of the amine sensor is presented and shown to predict the optical behavior observed. </span...|$|E
40|$|Although limited, the {{existing}} literature indicates the significant difference in sensory and quality parameters of wild and farmed fish samples of the same species. Post-mortem quality changes of sea bream and bogue samples stored in ice were investigated by sensory (raw and cooked), physical (pH, dielectric properties) and chemical (lipid oxidation, volatile amines, proximate composition) analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to study {{the relationships between the}} quality parameters during ost-mortem changes of farmed and wild sea bream and two “types” of bogues samples: samples aggregated around fi sh farm cages and natural control population. The PCA analyses showed distinct separation of wild and farmed/farm affected samples. The proportion of variance accounted for by the fi rst two principal components was 90. 63 in sea bream and 89. 35 % in bogue samples. Variations in storage time, sensory and chemical assessment were described by PC 1, whereas variations in catching ground and proximate composition by PC 2 in all investigated samples. Sensory evaluation, lipid oxidation index and <b>volatile</b> <b>amine</b> content of bogue samples showed high correlation with storage time; fat and moisture content, together with physical properties underwent the influence of the catching ground. Similar results were determined for sea bream, with exception for physical properties that showed higher correlation with the storage time in ice. Highest correlation with PC 1 (> 50 % of overall variance) were observed for sensory assessment (r> 0. 92) in both fish groups. Spoilage evolution over time given as the sum of all demerit points (quality index) showed higher correlation then any single parameters itself, indicating that the individual chemical and physical parameters could not replace the usage of sensory QIM scoring scheme in freshness assessment.

40|$|Aroma is {{a highly}} {{important}} aspect determining the quality of wine. Primary aromas are those belonging to and characteristic {{of the variety of}} grape used for the elaboration of the wine. The compounds originating from fermentation – the most abundant – are responsible for the fruity and/or flowery aromas of wine and are known as secondary aromas. Finally, the compounds giving rise to the tertiary aromas come from the oak wood during the ageing process in the cask and subsequent evolution in the bottle. To this regard, the presence of amines in wine in high concentrations, can produce a negative impact on the aroma of the product and, in some cases, detrimental health effects. Several factors influence the content of amines in wine, among them the yeast strain and the amino acid composition of the must. Among these amines, histamine is the most toxic and is known to cause headaches and low blood pressure. Tyramine and phenylethylamine can produce hypertension. Putrescine and cadaverine, although not toxic in themselves, intensify the adverse effects of the abovementioned amines because they interfere with the enzymes that metabolize them. Volatile amines do not have a toxic action on the human organism, but they can {{have a negative effect on}} wine aroma. Biogenic amines and phenylethylamine, which is a <b>volatile</b> <b>amine,</b> have their origin in the microbial decarboxylation of amino acids. Although the origin of volatile amines has not been fully studied, it is thought that they probably come from amination of non-nitrogen compounds such as aldehydes and ketones. These nitrogenated compounds are mainly formed during the alcoholic and malolactic fermentations of the wine, their importance lying in the negative effects on human health that can arise with their ingestion. These findings are important in that they warn the enologist not to drop their guard in the control of these post-malolactic fermentation compounds, especially if part of the wine production is to be exported. Histamine, tyramine and putrescine are the 3 biogenic amines who can develop in substantial amounts during and after malolactic fermentation (MLF).

40|$|Two novel {{regenerated}} {{solvent extraction}} processes are examined. The first process {{has the potential}} to reduce the energy costs inherent in the recovery of low-volatility carboxylic acids from dilute aqueous solutions. The second process has the potential for reducing the energy costs required for separate recovery of ammonia and acid gases (e. g. CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }S) from industrial sour waters. The recovery of carboxylic acids from dilute aqueous solution can be achieved by extraction with tertiary amines. An approach for regeneration and product recovery from such extracts is to back-extract the carboxylic acid with a water-soluble, volatile tertiary amine, such as trimethylamine. The resulting trimethylammonium carboxylate solution can be concentrated and thermally decomposed, yielding the product acid and the <b>volatile</b> <b>amine</b> for recycle. Experimental work was performed with lactic acid, succinic acid, and fumaric acid. Equilibrium data show near-stoichiometric recovery of the carboxylic acids from an organic solution of Alamine 336 into aqueous solutions of trimethylamine. For fumaric and succinic acids, partial evaporation of the aqueous back extract decomposes the carboxylate and yields the acid product in crystalline form. The decomposition of aqueous solutions of trimethylammonium lactates was not carried out to completion, due to the high water solubility of lactic acid and the tendency of the acid to self-associate. The separate recovery of ammonia and acid gases from sour waters can be achieved by combining steam-stripping of the acid gases with simultaneous removal of ammonia by extraction with a liquid cation exchanger. The use of di- 2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid as the liquid cation exchanger is explored in this work. Batch extraction experiments were carried out to measure the equilibrium distribution ratio of ammonia between an aqueous buffer solution and an organic solution of the phosphinic acid (0. 2 N) in Norpar 12. The concentration-based distribution ratios increase from 0. 11 to 0. 46 as the aqueous phase pH increases from 7. 18 to 8. 15.

40|$|Global {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, especially of CO 2, have been increasing tremendously {{over the past}} century. This is known to cause not only an increase of temperature, but also a change in our climate. Along with a shift to renewable sources of energy, Carbon Capture and Storage is necessary to mitigate climate change. Power plants are the largest point source of CO 2 emissions and therefore, capture of CO 2 from such sources is a must. Post Combustion CO 2 Capture (PCCC), and specifically absorption-desorption based technology is the preferred choice of technology for CO 2 capture from flue gases. It has been extensively used in {{the oil and gas}} industry for gas treatment. Its application for CO 2 capture from flue gases is not straightforward, mainly due to different flue gas composition and operating conditions. Other aspects such as solvent degradation, solvent emissions and corrosion become even more critical. In Chapter 1, the state-of-the-art in PCCC is explained with further details on the current knowledge and understanding of these aspects. In Chapter 2, the aspect of solvent ageing is studied over two test campaigns in a CO 2 capture pilot plant using 30 wt. % MEA. Solvent degradation occurs via thermal and oxidative routes, with the latter being more prominent. Ammonia is known to be a major oxidative degradation product, while the remaining degradation products are known to be corrosive. Therefore, solvent degradation is expected to have a significant impact on the corrosion in the plant and the resulting emissions of ammonia. The link between these three parameters was confirmed using online monitoring probes. Moreover, an autocatalytic behaviour was observed resulting in an rapid increase of the solvent metal content and ammonia emissions. The solvent iron content was above 500 mg/kg, while the ammonia emissions exceeded 150 mg/m 3 STP (STP; 0 °C and 101. 325 kPa). By correlating the process conditions to the underlying degradation and corrosion mechanisms, online monitoring tools can be used to assess and manage the lifetime of the solvent. Even if the state of the solvent is kept in check by reclaiming methods, there could be instances where ammonia emissions could increase. Therefore, it is necessary to have an end of pipe countermeasure for such emissions. Chapter 3 presents the results from a test using an acid wash scrubber for ammonia emissions in a pilot plant test campaign. Several parametric tests were conducted in order to test the efficiency of the acid wash. Moreover, the ammonia concentration in the gas inlet to the acid wash was increased artificially (~ 150 mg/m 3 STP). The acid wash scrubber reduced ammonia emission to very low levels, below 5 mg/m 3 STP and mostly below 1 mg/m 3 STP. Moreover, the MEA content was also reduced to mostly below 1 mg/m 3 STP. A comparison between a model made in Aspen Plus and the experimental results showed good agreement, with deviations only at pH above 5 to 6. Aerosol based emissions are known to be a concern in PCCC. In Chapter 4, the impact of flue gas particles such as soot and sulphuric acid aerosol droplets on solvent emissions was studied in a mobile CO 2 capture plant. These tests confirmed that solvent emissions can be in the order of grams per m 3 STP, which is several orders of magnitude higher than volatile emissions. The number concentration of these particles had a direct relation to the extent of emissions. Particle number concentrations in the range of 107 - 108 per cm 3 led to emissions of MEA in the range of 600 - 1200 mg/m 3 STP. In Chapter 5, further tests were performed on the same setup in order to assess the impact of operating conditions of the CO 2 capture plant on aerosol based emissions. Increasing the temperature of the lean solvent resulted in lowering of the aerosol based emissions. However, the total solvent emission increased as a result of increased volatile emissions. Aerosol based emissions were observed also for AMP-Pz as the capture solvent. The pH of the lean solvent was decreased by lowering the stripper temperature and thereby, changing the CO 2 loading of the solvent. This resulted in an increase in the aerosol based emissions as the activity of the amine increased in the solvent. As the CO 2 content in the flue gas was reduced from 12. 7 vol. % to 0. 7 vol. %, a maximum in the emissions was observed between 6 and 4 vol. %. When a mixture of a slow reacting <b>volatile</b> <b>amine,</b> AMP, with a fast reacting non-volatile, taurate, was used, no aerosol based emissions were observed. This led to the important conclusion that in reactive absorption, along with supersaturation and particle number concentration, the reactivity of the amine plays an important role in aerosol based emissions. A Brownian Demister Unit (BDU), consisting of multiple polypropylene fibre elements, can be potentially used as a countermeasure for aerosol based emissions. This was tested in a pilot plant campaign using MEA and is discussed in Chapter 6. The BDU reduced emissions from about 85 – 180 mg/m 3 STP to about 1 – 4 mg/m 3 STP. A water wash was found to be effective against vapour based emissions, while the BDU was effective against aerosol based emissions. A BDU is not effective against ammonia emissions, as they are present in the vapour form. From the measured nitrosamines, NDELA was found to be in the solvent in the order of 2000 ng/ml, while in the water wash it was ca. 1 ng/ml. Gas phase nitrosamine concentrations were in the range of tens of ng/m 3 STP. The BDU results in a significant additional pressure drop of ca. 50 mbar, for the configuration and type of BDU used here. This translated to an additional consumption of electricity by the blower in the range 26 – 52 %. A system containing three distinct phases, gas, liquid and aerosol droplets, are complex to understand and model. In Chapter 7, a methodology is presented with which such a complicated system can be modelled in commercially available software such as Aspen Plus. The mass and energy exchanges are split into two distinct interactions, gas-liquid and gas-aerosol. Aerosol droplets are considered to be as bulk liquid without any direct interaction with the solvent. The different parameters that were varied were the CO 2 concentration in the flue gas, temperature of the lean solvent and CO 2 loading of the lean solvent. The resulting trends were in good agreement with the experimental results presented in Chapter 5. The model did not predict a maximum in the emissions as the CO 2 content in the flue gas was varied. Although absorption desorption based process for CO 2 capture is well known, several operating issues needs to be addressed for its application in PCCC, as evident in this thesis. It is important to monitor the degradation of the solvent and deploy appropriate methods at the right time, to minimize its detrimental effect on the corrosion of the plant and avoid high emissions of ammonia. Aerosol based emissions in a PCCC process is a serious issue. The experimental results, proposed mechanism and modelling methodology will enable the design of appropriate counter-measures against aerosol based emissions. It is recommended to devise appropriate strategy and innovative solutions based on the understanding of the various operational aspects of absorption-desorption based PCCC as presented in this thesis. This will increase the confidence level in the technology and lead to its successful deployment for mitigating climate change in the short term.

40|$|Characterization of musts and {{wines from}} {{different}} Alentejo sub-regions, varieties and vintages {{was made in}} terms of amino acid and amine contents, by HPLC with fluorescence detection of OPA/FMOC derivatives. The evolution of <b>volatile</b> and biogenic <b>amines</b> was also studied throughout 10 microvinifications. No {{significant increase in the}} levels of total <b>volatile</b> <b>amines</b> was observed during alcoholic or spontaneous malolactic fermentation. While higher histamine levels were only found during the storage period, an increase in the concentration of tyramine was confirmed in red wines immediately after malolactic fermentation, which seems to be also the main origin of putrescine. It was noticed that grape variety, region of production, and vintage can influence free amino acid and amine contents of musts and wines, although alcoholic and malolactic fermentations can override that effect...|$|R
40|$|Draft to be {{reviewed}} by SeaFoodPlus experts (without English correction) <b>Volatile</b> <b>amines</b> are the characteristic molecules responsible for the fishy odour and flavour present in fish several days after the catch and they are commonly used as criteria for assessing the fish quality. The nature {{and the formation of}} the <b>volatile</b> <b>amines</b> are discussed. Ammonia is present in freshly caught fish, during chilled storage it is formed by endogenous and bacterial enzymes, it is a poor indicator of fish freshness and cannot be considered as an effective marker of fish spoilage. DMA is present at very low concentration in freshly caught, about 0. 2 mg/ 100 g, it is formed from TMAO, under TMAO-ase action, an endogenous enzyme which is mainly present in gadoids; DMA-N can be considered as an effective marker of fish freshness of many white fish and {{it can be used to}} monitor the quality of frozen-stored gadoid fish. In a very fresh fish the amount of TMA-N is low, ≤ 2 mg/ 100 g, it arises from the bacterial reduction of TMAO. TMA-N is an excellent indicator for the spoilage of gadoid fish, it is useful as a rapid means of objectively measuring the eating quality of many demersal fish specially on the medium-later phases of spoilage but it cannot be use...|$|R
40|$|Whole shoots of Phaseolus vulgaris L. {{and other}} species were exposed {{to a range of}} partial {{pressures}} of gaseous ammonia in air and the resulting fluxes were measured. Net uptake is linear with partial pressure in the range 5 to 50 nanobars and is zero at a finite partial pressure, termed the ammonia compensation point. Below the compensation point, ammonia (or possibly other <b>volatile</b> <b>amines)</b> is evolved by the leaves. The compensation points in several species are near the low partial pressures found in unpolluted air and approximate to the Km of glutamine synthetase in vitro. In P. vulgaris L., the compensation point increases with temperature...|$|R
50|$|Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), {{sometimes}} referred to as trace amine receptors (TAs or TARs), are a class of G protein-coupled receptors that were discovered in 2001. TAAR1, the first of six functional human TAARs, has gained considerable interest in academic and proprietary pharmaceutical research due to its unique role as the endogenous receptor for trace amines - which are trace metabolic derivatives of phenylalanine and tryptophan - and related psychostimulants, particularly amphetamine and methamphetamine. In 2004, it was shown that mammalian TAAR1 is also a receptor for thyronamines, which are decarboxylated and deiodinated metabolites of thyroid hormones. TAAR2-TAAR9 function as olfactory receptors for <b>volatile</b> <b>amines</b> in vertebrates.|$|R
5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of the composition of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from <b>volatile</b> <b>amines</b> and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.|$|R
40|$|Several {{conditions}} for the determinations of choline and trimethylamine were investigated previously to the radiation study, and a simplified reineckate method for the estimation of trimethylamine was established. In the radiation study, the dilute solutions (under 0. 7 %) of choline chloride were exposed to γ-radiation. It was found that choline chloride in aqueous solution is easily decomposed and produces {{a large amount of}} trimethylamine, while choline ion in alcoholic solution has a firm resistance to the radiation decomposition. In the irradiated aqueous solution of choline chloride, mono- and dimethylamine were identified as the <b>volatile</b> <b>amines</b> other than trimethylamine by the dinitrophenyl-procedure and paper chromatography. These amines were estimated quantitatively by a colorimetric method...|$|R

The end product of the nitrosation of aromatic primary amines is a diazonium salt; with primary alkyl amines a mixture of products 4 is obtained which can also contain small amounts of dialkyl nitrosamines. In all these cases the first and rate-limiting step is an electrophilic attack by the nitrosating agent (NO · Y) on the free electron pair of the amine nitrogen.
