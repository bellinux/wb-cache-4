5|$|There {{are various}} types of vesicles each with a {{different}} protein configuration. Most are formed from specific regions of membranes. When a <b>vesicle</b> buds off from a membrane it contains specific proteins on its cytosolic surface. Each membrane a <b>vesicle</b> travels to contains a marker on its cytosolic surface. This marker corresponds with the proteins on the <b>vesicle</b> traveling to the membrane. Once the <b>vesicle</b> finds the membrane, they fuse.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial <b>vesicle</b> will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated {{is very different from}} that in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and <b>vesicle</b> rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer. This asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and development of}} Taxol-like <b>vesicles</b> in callus cells of Kyaraboku (Taxus cuspidata var. nana.) were investigated using histochemical and quantitative methods. Many transparent <b>vesicles</b> revealed in the young and mature normal callus cells. The <b>vesicles</b> treated thoroughly with Taxol detection chemicals and immunoassay system. In case of Vanillin-sulfuric acid reagent, several big and small <b>vesicles</b> showed intense positive reaction and were stained brown and yellow ocher. The treatment of Dragendorff reagent showed brown color of <b>vesicles</b> with extreme positive reaction, whereas Anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent turned <b>vesicles</b> purple with positive reaction. In immunoassay system, almost <b>vesicles</b> in callus cells had positive reaction and were revealed yellow-green. Therefore, the <b>vesicles</b> were determined to include Taxol-like compounds. The <b>vesicles</b> were originated around the nucleus of young callus cells. While <b>vesicles</b> were more enlarged in mature callus cells and were located around bigger vacuoles.

5|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular <b>vesicle</b> called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another <b>vesicle</b> called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E
5|$|The virus enters cells by {{receptor}} mediated endocytosis {{and form}} a <b>vesicle</b> known as an endosome.

The {{recycling}} of synaptic <b>vesicles</b> in nerve terminals {{is thought to}} involve clathrin-coated <b>vesicles.</b> However, the properties of nerve terminal coated <b>vesicles</b> have not been characterized.

The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic <b>vesicle.</b> This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|Exocytosis in prokaryotes: Membrane {{vesicular}} exocytosis, {{popularly known}} as membrane <b>vesicle</b> trafficking, a Nobel prize-winning (year, 2013) process, is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of eukaryotic cells. This myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, {{popularly known as}} bacterial outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the secreting microbe e.g., in host cell invasion and microbe-environment interactions, in general.|$|E
5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a {{nerve impulse}} is carried down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse {{is transferred to}} the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic <b>vesicle</b> fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the origin and}} nature of <b>vesicles</b> found within multivesicular bodies (mvb), the cytochemical staining properties of mvb <b>vesicles</b> were {{compared with those of}} other cytoplasmic <b>vesicles,</b> i. e. those associated with the Golgi complex and endocytic <b>vesicles</b> found near the apical cell surface. Rat epididymal tissue was stained in unbuffered Os 0 4 for 40 - 48 hr, and the distribution of stain was compared to that of reaction products for acid phosphatase (AcPase) to mark lysosomal <b>vesicles,</b> or thiamine pyrophosphatase (TPPase) to mark certain Golgi <b>vesicles,</b> or infused with peroxidase (HRPase) to demonstrate endocytic <b>vesicles.</b> Mvb <b>vesicles</b> were stained only by Os 04; AcPase, TPPase, and HRPase reaction products stained the mvb matrix. OS 0 4 also stained certain <b>vesicles</b> along the convex surface of the Golgi complex. The findings suggest that mvb <b>vesicles</b> in epididymal epithelium are not lysosomes and are not involved in protein uptake. The majority of these <b>vesicles</b> have cytochemical reactions in common with <b>vesicles</b> located along the convex surface of the Golgi complex and may be derived therefrom.

5000|$|Pre-synaptic <b>vesicles</b> : <b>Vesicles</b> are {{the means}} of chemical-synaptic plasticity.

50|$|Neurons {{very often}} make both a {{conventional}} neurotransmitter (such as glutamate, GABA or dopamine) {{and one or}} more neuropeptides. Peptides are generally packaged in large dense-core <b>vesicles,</b> and the co-existing neurotransmitters in small synaptic <b>vesicles.</b> The large dense-core <b>vesicles</b> are often found {{in all parts of}} a neuron, including the soma, dendrites, axonal swellings (varicosities) and nerve endings, whereas the small synaptic <b>vesicles</b> are mainly found in clusters at presynaptic locations.Release of the large <b>vesicles</b> and the small <b>vesicles</b> is regulated differently.|$|R
5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} is {{a hypothesis}} {{that attempts to}} explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence {{suggests that it is}} expressed presynaptically as well. The hypothesis gets its name because normal synaptic transmission is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a retrograde (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter <b>vesicle</b> release.|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} only a few {{proteins}} synthesized during L-LTP are known. Regardless of their identities, it is thought that they contribute to the increase in dendritic spine number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression. The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP. Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of synaptotagmin and an increase in synaptic <b>vesicle</b> number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well. As mentioned previously, for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in presynaptic protein synthesis, there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell. This may occur via the synthesis of a retrograde messenger, discussed later.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of ash from eruptions of high-viscosity magmas (e.g., rhyolite, dacite, {{and some}} andesites) is mostly {{dependent on the}} shape of vesicles in the rising magma before disintegration. Vesicles are formed by the expansion of magmatic gas before the magma has solidified. Ash particles can have varying degrees of vesicularity and vesicular particles can have extremely high surface area to volume ratios. Concavities, troughs, and tubes observed on grain surfaces {{are the result of}} broken <b>vesicle</b> walls. Vitric ash particles from high-viscosity magma eruptions are typically angular, vesicular pumiceous fragments or thin vesicle-wall fragments while lithic fragments in volcanic ash are typically equant, or angular to subrounded. Lithic morphology in ash is generally controlled by the mechanical properties of the wall rock broken up by spalling or explosive expansion of gases in the magma as it reaches the surface.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To prepare {{polymeric}} <b>vesicles</b> and niosomes bearing glucose or transferrin ligands {{for drug}} targeting. METHODS: A glucose-palmitoyl glycol chitosan (PGC) conjugate was synthesised and glucose-PGC polymeric <b>vesicles</b> prepared by sonication of glucose-PGC/cholesterol. N-palmitoylglucosamine (NPG) was synthesised and NPG niosomes also prepared by sonication of NPG/ sorbitan monostearate/ cholesterol/ cholesteryl poly- 24 -oxyethylene ether. These 2 glucose <b>vesicles</b> were incubated with colloidal concanavalin A gold (Con-A gold), washed and visualised by {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM). Transferrin was also conjugated {{to the surface of}} PGC <b>vesicles</b> and the uptake of these <b>vesicles</b> investigated in the A 431 cell line (over expressing the transferrin receptor) by fluorescent activated cell sorter analysis. RESULTS: TEM imaging confirmed the presence of glucose units on the surface of PGC polymeric <b>vesicles</b> and NPG niosomes. Transferrin was coupled to PGC <b>vesicles</b> at a level of 0. 60 +/- 0. 18 g of transferrin per g polymer. The proportion of FITC-dextran positive A 431 cells was 42 % (FITC-dextran solution), 74 % (plain <b>vesicles)</b> and 90 % (transferrin <b>vesicles).</b> CONCLUSIONS: Glucose and transferrin bearing chitosan based <b>vesicles</b> and glucose niosomes have been prepared.

5|$|The nuclear {{membrane}} contains a lipid bilayer that encompass {{the contents of}} the nucleus. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a synthesis and transport organelle that branches into the cytoplasm in plant and animal cells. The Golgi apparatus is a series of multiple compartments where molecules are packaged for delivery to other cell components or for secretion from the cell. Vacuoles, which are found in both plant and animal cells (though much bigger in plant cells), are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of the cell as well as storing waste products. A <b>vesicle</b> is a relatively small, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances. The cell membrane is a protective barrier that regulates what enters and leaves the cell. There is also an organelle known as the Spitzenkörper that is only found in fungi, and is connected with hyphal tip growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the lipid bilayer in biology is to {{separate}} aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self,” {{it is difficult to}} even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier {{takes the form of a}} lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid <b>vesicle</b> with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids. The partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes). See Organelle.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that <b>vesicle</b> is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E
40|$|SummaryFast axonal {{transport}} (FAT) requires consistent energy {{over long}} distances {{to fuel the}} molecular motors that transport <b>vesicles.</b> We demonstrate that glycolysis provides ATP for the FAT of <b>vesicles.</b> Although inhibiting ATP production from mitochondria did not affect <b>vesicles</b> motility, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH reduced transport in cultured neurons and in Drosophila larvae. GAPDH localizes on <b>vesicles</b> via a huntingtin-dependent mechanism and is transported on fast-moving <b>vesicles</b> within axons. Purified motile <b>vesicles</b> showed GAPDH enzymatic activity and produced ATP. Finally, we show that vesicular GAPDH is necessary and sufficient to provide on-board energy for fast vesicular transport. Although detaching GAPDH from <b>vesicles</b> reduced transport, targeting GAPDH to <b>vesicles</b> was sufficient to promote FAT in GAPDH deficient neurons. This specifically localized glycolytic machinery may supply constant energy, independent of mitochondria, for the processive movement of <b>vesicles</b> over long distances in axons. PaperFlic...|$|R

The membrane <b>vesicles</b> showed bacteriolytic activities against different gram-positive and gram-negative host bacteria. Different killing potencies {{were obtained by}} membrane <b>vesicles</b> of different producing organisms against different recipient host strains. In most of membrane-vesicle-producing strains, the exposure to the β-lactam antibiotic cefotaxime and the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin induced the formation of cefotaxime membrane <b>vesicles</b> and gentamicin membrane <b>vesicles,</b> respectively, larger in size and with higher lytic activities against the susceptible host bacteria compared to those produced under normal growth conditions.

5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of particles (pyroclasts) with diameters <2 mm (particles >2 mm {{are classified as}} lapilli), and can be as fine as 1 μm. The overall grain size distribution of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions. Few {{attempts have been made}} to correlate the grain size characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced it, though some predictions can be made. Rhyolitic magmas generally produce finer grained material compared to basaltic magmas, due to the higher viscosity and therefore explosivity. The proportions of fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions, probably because <b>vesicle</b> size in the pre-eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas. There is good evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high proportions of fine ash by communition and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the summit crater.|$|E
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac.

A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal <b>vesicle,</b> which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus.
