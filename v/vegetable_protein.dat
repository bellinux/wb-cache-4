25|$|Proteins are {{composed}} of amino acids. Vegans obtain all their protein from plants, omnivores usually a third, and ovo-lacto vegetarians half. Sources of plant protein include legumes such as soy beans (consumed as tofu, tempeh, texturized <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein,</b> soy milk and edamame), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (the latter often eaten as hummus); grains such as quinoa (pronounced keenwa), brown rice, corn, barley, bulgur and wheat (the latter eaten as bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds.

Tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm, and extra firm for stews and stir-fries; to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts, and shakes. Soy is also eaten in the form of tempeh and texturized <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein</b> (TVP); also known as textured soy protein (TSP), the latter is often used in pasta sauces.|$|E

25|$|The {{kernel of}} the egusi-itoo seed is 44% oil, 30% protein, 10% carbohydrate, 4% ash and 3% fiber. The oil of this seed is 64.9% {{linoleic}} acid, 12.4% oleic acid, 11.8% stearic acid and 10.9% palmitic acid.

Notable minerals include phosphorus, as the largest mineral component, with potassium, magnesium, manganese, sulfur, calcium, iron and zinc to follow. The bulk of carbohydrates are starch and soluble sugars. Egusi-itoo is the perfect complement to the largely starch-rich grain diet of Africa, providing a high-protein and high-energy concentrate. The seed contains every important macro and micro-nutrient in quantities ideal for nutrition. The amino acid content of egusi-itoo proteins makes it a sufficient <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein.</b> This composition is ideal for sick and growing bodies, providing essential amino acids and calories.

25|$|Cucumeropsis mannii is {{a member}} of the Cucurbitaceae family. Vernacular names for this crop include egusi-itoo and white seed melon. This crop is often {{referred}} to as “the real egusi” given its long history in West Africa, dating back 4,000 years. This crop is primarily harvested for its large white seeds called egusi-itoo. The seeds are commonly processed into soups and oil products, and are also eaten individually as a snack. Benefits of Cucumeropsis mannii crops are many. The crop thrives in harsh climates and high yields are attainable in barren landscapes. Pests and disease are rarely a problem for farmers of this crop. Further benefits include increased soil quality through ground cover and suppression of weeds. This crop also holds significant nutritional value. Oil makes up 44% of the seed, where 30% is protein rich in essential amino acids. The seed is an excellent <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein,</b> and is ideal for battling nutritional debilitations. High in essential vitamins and minerals, egusi-itoo compliments the starch and grain diet of most Africans. Despite the crops obvious advantages, Cucumeropsis mannii remains an underutilized tool for nutritional intervention in Africa.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} has documented a negative association between maternal report of child food neophobia and reported frequency of consumption of fruit, vegetables, and meat. This study aimed to establish whether neophobia {{is associated with}} lower intake of these food types in naturalistic mealtime situations. Methods One hundred and nine parents of 4 – 5 year olds completed questionnaires which included a six-item version of the Child Food Neophobia Scale (CFNS). The children {{took part in a}} series of 3 test lunch meals at weekly intervals at school at which they were presented with: chicken, cheese, bread, cheese crackers, chocolate biscuits, grapes and tomatoes or carrot sticks. Food items served to each child were weighed before and after the meal to assess total intake of items in four categories: Fruit and <b>vegetables,</b> <b>Protein</b> foods, Starchy foods and Snack foods. Pearson Product Moment Correlations and independent t tests were performed to examine associations between scores on the CFNS and consumption during lunches. Results Neophobia was associated with lower consumption of fruit and <b>vegetables,</b> <b>protein</b> foods and total calories, but there was no association with intake of starch or snack foods. Conclusion These results support previous research that has suggested that neophobia impacts differentially on consumption of different food types. Specifically it appears that children who score highly on the CFNS eat less fruit, <b>vegetables</b> and <b>protein</b> foods than their less neophobic peers. Attempts to increase intake of fruit, <b>vegetables</b> and <b>protein</b> might usefully incorporate strategies known to reduce the neophobic response. </p...|$|R
