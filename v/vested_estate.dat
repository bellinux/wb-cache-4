50|$|A future {{interest}} is contingent where {{the person to}} whom or the event upon which it is limited to take effect in possession or become a <b>vested</b> <b>estate</b> is uncertain. Caine v Payne, 86 App DC 404, 182 F2d 246, 20 ALR2d 823. If the condition upon which a future interest depends is precedent, the {{interest is}} contingent; if the condition is subsequent, the interest is vested, subject to defeasance. Anno: 131 ALR 712.|$|E
50|$|For example, the {{testator}} leaves “my {{estate to}} my wife for her life, and on her death {{it is to be}} divided equally among our children or such of them as may then be alive.” On the testator’s death, the usufruct of the <b>estate</b> <b>vests</b> in the widow, and on her death the ownership of the <b>estate</b> <b>vests</b> in the surviving children, these being directly substituted for the original group which consisted of the surviving children and those who predeceased their mother.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rule has}} been {{recognized}} in some jurisdictions in the United States in Wedel v. American Elec. Power Service Corp. [...] Here the law favors the <b>vesting</b> of <b>estates</b> as early as possibility as {{the provisions of the}} rule are predicated upon [...] "public policy" [...] and thus [...] "constitute non-waivable, legal prohibitions, and in Australia through statute.|$|R
50|$|Danvers <b>vested</b> his <b>estate</b> with trustees, {{to shelter}} it; and was joint-elder of a Baptist {{congregation}} near Aldgate, London. In the late 1670s he supported Algernon Sidney {{in efforts to}} be elected a Member of Parliament. In December 1684 he published a seditious libel concerning {{the death of the}} Earl of Essex, and the government offered a reward for his apprehension.|$|R
50|$|A Saxon noble Alardus of Burgdorf is {{mentioned}} as a witness, when in 1218 Emperor Otto IV made his will at nearby Harzburg Castle. Alardus' ancestors had been <b>vested</b> with <b>estates</b> around the former Werla Kaiserpfalz in the 12th century and probably erected the castle where the Ecker River formed {{the border of the}} County of Wernigerode with the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.|$|R
25|$|On 20 June 1716, the Parliament of Ireland {{passed an}} act {{extinguishing}} the regalities and liberties {{of the county}} palatine of Tipperary; for <b>vesting</b> his <b>estate</b> in the crown and for giving a reward of £10,000 for his apprehension, should he attempt to land in Ireland. But the same parliament passed an act 24 June 1721, to enable his brother Charles Butler, 1st Earl of Arran, to purchase his estate, which he accordingly did.|$|R
50|$|If {{the estate}} of the fideicommissary heir or legatee is sequestrated, his or her {{contingent}} interest does not vest in the trustee; but if the interest becomes <b>vested</b> while the <b>estate</b> is under sequestration, it ipso facto passes to the trustee.|$|R
50|$|Once an {{interest}} has vested in the beneficiaries {{there can be}} no jus accrescendi, because if one of the beneficiaries dies his share <b>vests</b> in his <b>estate.</b> There is an obvious exception {{in the case of a}} usufruct; on the death of one of the usufructuaries, his interest accrues to the other usufructuaries.|$|R
25|$|To {{enable the}} trustee to do this, the Act {{provides}} {{that the effect}} of a sequestration order is to divest the insolvent of his <b>estate</b> and <b>vest</b> it in the Master, and thereafter the trustee, once he has been appointed. If a provisional trustee is appointed, the <b>estate</b> <b>vests</b> in him before vesting in the trustee.|$|R
50|$|Kartuzy was {{established}} about 1380 as a monastery for Carthusian monks descending from Prague in the Kingdom of Bohemia, after whom it received its name. The charterhouse was <b>vested</b> with large <b>estates</b> by the State of the Teutonic Order. According to the Second Peace of Thorn the area {{passed to the}} Polish Crown and it became part of Royal Prussia in 1466.|$|R
50|$|The first abbot, Ekkehard of Huysburg, a {{canon of}} Halberstadt Cathedral, was {{appointed}} on 24 December 1080 and ordained on 21 June 1081; he died three years later. The convent received extended manors by Bishop Burchard and from 1114 onwards was <b>vested</b> with further <b>estates</b> by Burchard's successor Bishop Reinhard. Beside the convent, the hermitage of nuns existed {{until the early}} 15th century.|$|R
50|$|Richard Graf von Belcredi {{was born}} on 12 February 1823, in Jimramov (Ingrowitz), in the Margraviate of Moravia, the {{youngest}} son of Count Eduard von Belcredi (1786-1838) and his wife Countess Maria von Fünfkirchen (1790-1860). The Belcredi noble family originally descended from Lombardy, {{where they had been}} <b>vested</b> with the <b>estates</b> of Montalto Pavese by the Sforza dukes of Milan. Count Richard's ancestors settled in Moravia from 1769 onwards.|$|R
2500|$|This <b>estate</b> <b>vests</b> {{in one or}} two {{trustees}} who {{are elected}} by the creditors, and whose appointment is confirmed by the Master of the High Court. The trustee acquires the dominium of the entire estate, but such ownership is merely a nuda proprietas. The trustee does not obtain any beneficial interest in the property. The trustee is, in a sense, the agent of the persons in fact beneficially interested in the estate: namely, ...|$|R
50|$|On 30 July 1060 he was consecrated {{bishop of}} the Archdiocese of Salzburg. He reorganized the tithes paid by the Carantanian peasants and the parish system in Carinthia, where he in 1072 {{dissolved}} the double monastery of Gurk Abbey, founded by Saint Hemma in 1043, and replaced it by the suffragan Diocese of Gurk. Gebhard also established Admont Abbey in 1074, <b>vested</b> with Hemma's <b>estates</b> in the Carinthian March of Styria. Besides this, he had the fortresses of Hohensalzburg, Hohenwerfen and Friesach built.|$|R
50|$|The Teutonic Knights {{were called}} to Koblenz by the Trier {{archbishop}} Theoderich von Wied in 1216 and <b>vested</b> with the <b>estates</b> around the Basilica of St. Castor located directly at the confluence of Mosel and Rhine. Serving mainly in nursing care, the knights soon after established a commandry (Deutschordenskommende) here, which became the administrative seat of the Koblenz bailiwick directly subordinate to the Grand Master. The premises centred around the Deutschherrenhaus building were erected from 1279 onwards and became known as Deutsches Eck.|$|R
5000|$|In Re James, Farwell J said, [...] "The {{defendant}} by {{her appointment}} {{as one of}} the administratrices has got the legal <b>estate</b> <b>vested</b> in her and she needs no assistance from equity to complete her title. Under these circumstances she cannot be compelled at the suit of persons claiming through the donor to surrender her property. It follows that in my judgment the plaintiff here must recognize the title of the defendant to the property and no steps should be taken to recover it from her." ...|$|R
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{following}} years the land moved many more times between heirs until <b>vesting</b> in the <b>estate</b> of Margaret Style (during the reign of Queen Anne) who in 1716 sold it to a Mr. Abraham Tilghman. A commissioner of the Royal Navy, and of the victualling office he died in 1729 and was interned {{in the southern part of}} the church, where there is a monument erected to his memory. The manor stayed in the Tilghman family for the latter part of the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|A {{fortress}} at {{the site}} was first mentioned about 1085/90, then held by ministeriales of the Bamberg prince-bishops who had received extended Carinthian estates {{from the hands of}} Emperor Henry II on the occasion of his coronation in 1014. To strengthen his episcopal authority, Bishop Otto of Bamberg had the castle slighted and established a Benedictine convent {{at the site}} in 1106. A first abbot appeared about 20 years later. Arnoldstein Abbey was <b>vested</b> with extended <b>estates</b> in the surrounding area, from 1176 the Carinthian dukes acted as secular Vogt protectors.|$|R
5000|$|Lascelles died in 1697 and {{was buried}} at Northallerton on 4 November 1697; {{none of his}} {{descendants}} sat in Parliament. He was a sitting MP and left his wife to approach Parliament for help in administering his estates. The House of Lords introduced, [...] "An Act for <b>vesting</b> the Real <b>Estate</b> late of Thomas Lassells Esquire deceased, in Trustees, to be sold, for the Payment of his Debts." [...] The Bill was passed on 25 March 1699, allowing his wife, Rebecca, to dispose of lands and houses in Ealing, Middlesex.|$|R
5000|$|The {{realisation}} {{of funds}} usually comes from two main sources: the bankrupt's assets and the bankrupt's wages. There are certain assets that are protected, {{referred to as}} [...] "protected assets". These include household furniture and appliances, {{tools of the trade}} and vehicles up to a certain value. All other assets of value will be sold. If a house or car is above a certain value, the bankrupt can buy the interest back from the estate {{in order to keep the}} asset. If the bankrupt does not do this, the interest <b>vests</b> in the <b>estate</b> and the trustee is able to take possession of the asset and sell it.|$|R
25|$|Property {{inherited}} by an insolvent {{during his}} insolvency falls into his insolvent estate, notwithstanding a contrary {{provision in the}} testator’s will. However, if an insolvent refuses to accept property bequeathed to him or an insurance benefit of {{which he has been}} nominated as a beneficiary, the property or benefit in question does not <b>vest</b> in his <b>estate.</b> The reason is that the insolvent merely has a competence or power to accept the bequest or nomination, and he acquires no right to the property or benefit until he has accepted. An insolvent may, thus, by repudiating a legacy, inheritance or insurance benefit, ensure that it passes to someone other than the trustee and the creditors of his insolvent estate.|$|R
50|$|The monastery {{was founded}} upon {{the death of}} King Henry the Fowler in 936 by the Saxon count Siegfried of Merseburg, brother of Margrave Gero the Great, and his second wife Guthia (Jutta) at their {{residence}} on the Bode river. Its first monks were sent by Volkmar I, abbot of Corvey, of which Gröningen was a priory. It was <b>vested</b> with extended <b>estates</b> in the Saxon Harzgau, which later {{became part of the}} Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt. After the last Catholic provost retired from office in 1542, the priory was dissolved {{in the course of the}} Protestant Reformation. The monks took the relics with them back to Corvey, the Gröningen lands were leased, and large parts of the monastery complex were demolished.|$|R
60|$|The {{abuse of}} the grants, as land became more valuable, induced a law, restricting the number of acres {{patented}} to any one person, at any one time, to a thousand. Our monarchical predecessors had the same facilities, {{and it may be}} added, the same propensities, to rendering a law a dead letter, as belongs to our republican selves. The patent on our table, being for a nominal hundred thousand acres, contains the names of one hundred different grantees, while three several parchment documents at its side, each signed by thirty-three of these very persons, <b>vest</b> the legal <b>estate</b> in the first named, for whose sole benefit the whole concession was made; the dates of the last instruments succeeding, by one or two days, that of the royal patent itself.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the raids}} {{still did not}} stop and {{moreover}} Godfrid entangled into a rebellion with his brother-in-law, the Lotharingian duke Hugh of Alsace. He was killed in 885 by the emperor's liensman Henry of Franconia, aided by the local count Gerolf, who in turn was <b>vested</b> with large <b>estates</b> on the southern Frisian coast, that later emerged as the County of Holland. The Viking rule in Frisia was terminated, nevertheless {{in view of the}} continuous threat, the local peasants were granted the Frisian freedom (Frisian: Fryske frijheid), which excluded them from the feudal customs in the Frankish Empire, with no suzerain above them than the Emperor himself. The Frisian representatives met in the Upstalsboom thing near present-day Aurich in East Frisia under the motto Eala Frya Fresena ("Stand up, free Frisians") to pass resolutions and to dispense justice.|$|R
50|$|Gascoyne {{was elected}} {{alderman}} of Vintry ward 20 June 1745, and sworn into office on 2 July. He served {{the office of}} sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1747-1748. In December 1748 he took a prominent part, {{at the head of}} the committee of city lands, in passing through the common council an act for the relief of the orphans of the City of London, whose <b>estates,</b> <b>vested</b> in the guardianship of the corporation, had greatly suffered through the exactions of the Civil War period and the illegal closing of the exchequer by Charles II. Gascoyne became Lord Mayor in 1752, and was the first chief magistrate who occupied the present Mansion House, the building of which had been commenced in 1739 on the site of Stocks Market. Owing to the change of style, the date of the mayoralty procession was this year altered from 29 October to 9 November.|$|R
50|$|In November 1468, Frederick {{proceeded}} to the Holy See, where on 1 January 1469 the first Grand Master Johann Siebenhirter received his investiture in the Lateran Basilica. On January 18, the Austrian Diocese of Vienna and the Diocese of Wiener Neustadt were established by papal bull. The Wiener Neustadt bishopric was even {{incorporated into the}} Order of Saint George in 1479; however, this union was overshadowed by ongoing quarrels between Grand Master and Bishop, mainly over the order of precedence, and the union was again dissolved in 1528.On 14 May 1469 Grand Master Siebenhirter ceremoniously entered Millstatt, where the Order was <b>vested</b> with the <b>estates</b> of the former Benedictine abbey. Emperor Frederick III himself had acted as the monastery's Vogt protector, but found its premises decayed and monastic life at a low point. His request to dissolve the convent was approved by Pope Paul II. The Order received further Carinthian estates at the strategically important Seeberg Saddle (Rechberg) and the Maria Wörth provostry, {{as well as the}} Styrian lordships of Pürgg in the Enns valley and Sankt Lorenzen im Mürztal. It temporarily held the former Sternberg comital estates, Landskron Castle (from 1511), the Bozen parish in Tyrol and additional possessions in Vienna and Lower Austria. When in 1479 the Order established its headquarters at Burg Wiener Neustadt, the patron of the Cathedral became Saint George. The proposed acquisition of Viktring Abbey, however, met fierce resistance from the Archbishop of Salzburg.|$|R
