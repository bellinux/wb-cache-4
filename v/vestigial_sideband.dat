25|$|The {{question}} of the relative technical merits of COFDM versus 8VSB for terrestrial digital television has been a subject of some controversy, especially between European and North American technologists and regulators. The United States has rejected several proposals to adopt the COFDM based DVB-T system for its digital television services, and has instead opted for 8VSB (<b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> modulation) operation.|$|E
25|$|The DVB-T {{standard}} {{is not used}} for terrestrial digital television in North America. Instead, the ATSC standard calls for 8VSB modulation, which has similar characteristics to the <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> modulation used for analog television. This provides considerably more immunity to interference, but is not immune— as DVB-T is— to multipath distortion and also does not provide for single-frequency network operation (which is in any case not relevant in the United States).|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of modern {{television}} receivers, no other technique was able to produce the precise bandpass characteristic needed for <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> reception, {{similar to that used}} in the NTSC system first approved by the U.S. in 1941. By the 1980s these had been replaced with precision electromechanical surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters. Fabricated by precision laser milling techniques, SAW filters are cheaper to produce, can be made to extremely close tolerances, and are very stable in operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcast}} or {{transport channel}} for TV {{in countries that}} use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the video signal has significant low-frequency content (average brightness) and has rectangular synchronising pulses. The engineering compromise is vestigial-sideband transmission. In <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband,</b> the full upper sideband of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the lower sideband is transmitted, along with a carrier. This effectively makes the system AM at low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies. The absence of the lower sideband components at high frequencies must be compensated for, and this {{is done by the}} RF and IF filters.|$|E
2500|$|Limitation of single-sideband {{modulation}} {{being used}} for voice signals and not available for video/TV signals leads to the usage of <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband.</b> A <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> (in radio communication) is a sideband that has been only partly cut off or suppressed. [...] Television broadcasts (in analog video formats) use this method if the video is transmitted in AM, due to the large bandwidth used. It may also be used in digital transmission, such as the ATSC standardized 8VSB. The Milgo 4400/48 modem (around 1967) used <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> and phase-shift keying to provide 4800bit/s transmission over a 1600Hz channel.|$|E
2500|$|The RF {{bandwidth}} of an AM transmission (refer to Figure 2, {{but only}} considering positive frequencies) is twice the bandwidth of the modulating (or [...] "baseband") signal, since {{the upper and}} lower sidebands around the carrier frequency each have a bandwidth as wide as the highest modulating frequency. Although the bandwidth of an AM signal is narrower than one using frequency modulation (FM), it is twice as wide as single-sideband techniques; it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient. Within a frequency band, only half as many transmissions (or [...] "channels") can thus be accommodated. For this reason analog television employs a variant of single-sideband (known as <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband,</b> somewhat of a compromise in terms of bandwidth) {{in order to reduce the}} required channel spacing.|$|E
2500|$|A simple example: A useful symbol {{duration}} TU = 1ms {{would require}} a sub-carrier spacing of [...] (or an integer multiple of that) for orthogonality. N = 1,000 sub-carriers {{would result in a}} total passband bandwidth of NΔf = 1MHz. For this symbol time, the required bandwidth in theory according to Nyquist is [...] (half of the achieved bandwidth required by our scheme), where R is the bit rate and where N = 1,000 samples per symbol by FFT. If a guard interval is applied (see below), Nyquist bandwidth requirement would be even lower. The FFT would result in N = 1,000 samples per symbol. If no guard interval was applied, this would result in a base band complex valued signal with a sample rate of 1MHz, which {{would require a}} baseband bandwidth of 0.5MHz according to Nyquist. However, the passband RF signal is produced by multiplying the baseband signal with a carrier waveform (i.e., double-sideband quadrature amplitude-modulation) resulting in a passband bandwidth of 1MHz. A single-side band (SSB) or <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> (VSB) modulation scheme would achieve almost half that bandwidth for the same symbol rate (i.e., twice as high spectral efficiency for the same symbol alphabet length). It is however more sensitive to multipath interference.|$|E

50|$|In specs, sometimes, other {{parameters}} such as <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> characteristics and gamma of display device are also given.|$|E
5000|$|... 16VSB is an {{abbreviation}} for 16-level <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> modulation, capable of transmitting four bits (24=16) at a time.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunications, 2VSB is an {{abbreviation}} for 2-level <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> modulation, a transmission method capable of transmitting one bit (21=2) at a time.|$|E
5000|$|... "Professional" [...] {{modulators}} such {{as those}} used in the CATV industry generally include <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> filtering which is generally absent on [...] "consumer" [...] grade modulators.|$|E
50|$|All System A {{transmitters}} used <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> transmission, {{with the}} single exception of Alexandra Palace in London, which closed down in 1957 when it was replaced by Crystal Palace.|$|E
5000|$|Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC) uses eight-level <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> (8VSB) for {{terrestrial}} broadcasting. This standard {{has been}} adopted by six countries: United States, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Dominican Republic and Honduras.|$|E
50|$|The now-defunct MovieBeam service used dNTSC {{technology}} by Dotcast {{to transmit}} 720p HDTV {{movies in the}} lower <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> of NTSC analog TV. The set-top box stored the movies to be viewed on demand for a fee. This was distributed through PBS's National Datacast.|$|E
5000|$|... 4VSB is an {{abbreviation}} for 4-level <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> modulation, {{a type of}} radio transmission capable of transmitting two bits of information (22=4) at a time. Other faster but less rugged forms include 8VSB and 16VSB. While 2VSB is more rugged, it is also slower.|$|E
50|$|Analog {{television}} {{sends the}} picture as AM {{and the sound}} as AM or FM, with the sound carrier a fixed frequency (4.5 MHz in the NTSC system) away from the video carrier. Analog television also uses a <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> on the video carrier to reduce the bandwidth required.|$|E
50|$|When {{used with}} <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> filtering, the total {{bandwidth}} of a 405-line TV channel is 5 MHz, {{significantly less than}} the 8 MHz required by the 625-line system I, which replaced it in Britain. Systems in other countries used anything between six and fourteen megahertz of bandwidth per channel.|$|E
50|$|Transmissions on 2182 kHz {{commonly}} use single-sideband modulation (SSB) (upper sideband only). However, {{amplitude modulation}} (AM) and some variants such as <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> {{are still in}} use, mainly by vessels with older equipment and by some coastal stations {{in an attempt to}} ensure compatibility with older and less sophisticated receivers.|$|E
50|$|Given all {{of these}} parameters, {{the result is a}} mostly-continuous analog signal which can be {{modulated}} onto a radio-frequency carrier and transmitted through an antenna. All analog television systems use <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> modulation, a form of amplitude modulation in which one sideband is partially removed. This reduces the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, enabling narrower channels to be used.|$|E
50|$|The channel {{frequencies}} chosen {{represent a}} compromise between allowing enough bandwidth for video (and hence satisfactory picture resolution), and allowing enough channels to be packed into the available frequency band. In practice a technique called <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> is used to reduce the channel spacing, which would be nearly twice the video bandwidth if pure AM was used.|$|E
5000|$|ISB is a {{compromise}} between double sideband (DSB) and single sideband (SSB) [...] - [...] the other is <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> (VSB). If the sidebands are out of phase with each other, then phase modulation (PM) of the carrier occurs. AM and PM together then create quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). ISB {{may or may not}} have the carrier suppressed.|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} of the relative technical merits of COFDM versus 8VSB for terrestrial digital television has been a subject of some controversy, especially between European and North American technologists and regulators. The United States has rejected several proposals to adopt the COFDM based DVB-T system for its digital television services, and has instead opted for 8VSB (<b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> modulation) operation.|$|E
50|$|Example 4: The 8VSB (8-level <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband)</b> {{modulation}} scheme {{used in the}} ATSC digital television standard gives N=3 bit/symbol or bpcu. Since it {{can be described as}} nearly single-side band, the modulation efficiency is close to 2N = 6 (bit/s)/Hz. In practice, ATSC transfers a gross bit rate of 32 Mbit/s over a 6 MHz wide channel, resulting in a modulation efficiency of 32/6 = 5.3 (bit/s)/Hz.|$|E
50|$|Modulating a TV signal with stereo {{sound is}} {{relatively}} complex; most low-cost home TV modulators produce a signal with monaural audio. Even some units that {{have two or}} more audio inputs simply combine {{the left and right}} audio channels into one mono audio signal. Some used on very early home computers had no sound capability at all. Most cheaper modulators (i.e. not intended for professional use) lack <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> filtering.|$|E
50|$|The DVB-T {{standard}} {{is not used}} for terrestrial digital television in North America. Instead, the ATSC standard calls for 8VSB modulation, which has similar characteristics to the <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> modulation used for analog television. This provides considerably more immunity to interference, but is not immune — as DVB-T is — to multipath distortion and also does not provide for single-frequency network operation (which is in any case not relevant in the United States).|$|E
50|$|In TV transmitters, both AF and VF {{modulate}} {{intermediate frequency}} (IF) carriers. (The frequency {{difference between the}} two carriers is 4.5 MHz in System M and 5.5 MHz in System B/G) Then the modulated IF signals are added either at the output of the vision modulator or at the output of the <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> stage. In both cases, the added signals are low level signals and no special combining circuitry is required.|$|E
50|$|If {{part of one}} {{sideband}} and all of {{the other}} remain, it is called <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband,</b> used mostly with television broadcasting, which would otherwise take up an unacceptable amount of bandwidth. Transmission in which only one sideband is transmitted is called single-sideband transmission or SSB. SSB is the predominant voice mode on shortwave radio other than shortwave broadcasting. Since the sidebands are mirror images, which sideband is used is a matter of convention.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of modern {{television}} receivers, no other technique was able to produce the precise bandpass characteristic needed for <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> reception, {{similar to that used}} in the NTSC system first approved by the U.S. in 1941.

Fabricated by precision laser milling techniques, SAW filters are cheaper to produce, can be made to extremely close tolerances, and are very stable in operation.|$|E
50|$|Vestigal {{sideband}} transmits {{the carrier}} and one complete side-band, but filters out the redundant side-band. It is {{a compromise between}} AM and SSB, allowing simple receivers to be used but requiring almost as much transmitter power as AM. One advantage is that only half the bandwidth of an AM signal is used. It {{can be heard in}} the transmission of certain radio time signal stations. <b>Vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> is used for over the air Television Broadcasts both analog and digital.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> {{modulation}} (VSB) is a modulation method which {{attempts to}} eliminate the spectral redundancy of pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) signals. Modulating a carrier by a real-valued data sequence results in a sum and a difference frequency, resulting in two symmetrical carrier side-bands. The symmetry means {{that one of the}} sidebands is redundant, so removing one sideband still allows for demodulation. As filters with zero transition bandwidth cannot be realized, the filtering implemented leaves a vestige of the redundant sideband, hence the name “VSB”.|$|E
5000|$|... 8VSB is an 8-level <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> modulation. In essence, it {{converts}} {{a binary}} stream into an octal representation by amplitude-shift keying a sinusoidal carrier {{to one of}} eight levels. 8VSB is capable of transmitting three bits (23=8) per symbol; in ATSC, each symbol includes two bits from the MPEG transport stream which are trellis modulated to produce a three-bit figure. The resulting signal is then band-pass filtered with a Nyquist filter to remove redundancies in the side lobes, and then shifted up to the broadcast frequency.|$|E
50|$|Enhancements {{have been}} made to the {{specification}} of System Is audio capabilities over the years. Starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s it became possible to add a digital signal carrying NICAM sound. This extension to audio capability has completely eaten the guard band between channels, indeed there would be a small amount of analogue-digital crosstalk between the NICAM signal of a transmitter on channel N and the <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> of a transmission on channel N+1. Good channel planning means that under normal situations no ill effects are seen or heard.|$|E
50|$|The RF {{parameters}} of the transmitted signal are almost {{the same as those}} for System B which is used on the 7.0 MHz wide channels of the VHF bands. The only difference to the RF spectrum of the signal is that the <b>vestigial</b> <b>sideband</b> is 500 kHz wider at 1.25 MHz. Due to this and the extra width of the channel allocations at UHF, the width of the guard band between the channels is 650 kHz (assuming the worst case which is when NICAM sound is in use).|$|E
