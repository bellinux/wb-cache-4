5|$|Cibber's poetical {{work was}} derided in his time, {{and has been}} remembered only for being poor. His {{importance}} in British theatre history rests on his {{being one of the}} first {{in a long line of}} actor-managers, on the interest of two of his comedies as documents of evolving early 18th-century taste and ideology, and on the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> autobiography as a historical source.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the war he}} was put {{in charge}} of {{analyzing}} technical advances at home and abroad and his enthusiasm for innovation earned him the nickname Armee Modernissimus ("the army modernization fanatic"). Model fought nearly all his battles in the northern and central parts of the Eastern Front; he was never tested on the steppes of southern Russia, where the open terrain would have made mobile warfare a more attractive proposition. Nevertheless, his defensive record indicated the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> approach. At Rzhev, Orel, in Galicia and in Estonia he stymied opponents who expected to overwhelm him, and as late as November 1944, he gave the U.S. 12th Army Group a bloody nose in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest.|$|E
5|$|Between 1822 and 1848 Bute {{played a}} central role in the {{creation}} of the Cardiff Docks. The idea was first put forward to Bute by one of his staff in 1822, who suggested that, with the right investment, Cardiff could be transformed into a major port for exporting coal and iron. The existing seaport, used by the Glamorganshire Canal, was small and inefficient. The new port would then deliver a direct return to Bute from shipping rates, improve the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields. Initially Bute opposed plans for docks put forward by the local ironmasters, but then changed his mind and pushed forward with his own scheme shortly afterward.|$|E

5|$|Druitt rented legal {{chambers}} at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple. In {{the late}} Victorian era only the wealthy could afford legal action, {{and only one}} in eight qualified barristers {{was able to make}} a living from the law. While some of Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish, others suppose that it provided him with a relatively substantial income {{on the basis of his}} costly lease of chambers and the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> estate at death. He is listed in the Law List of 1886 as active in the Western Circuit and Winchester Sessions, and for 1887 in the Western Circuit and Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton Assizes.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{continued}} his research into ways to produce corrosion resistant metals. While working on alloys {{for use in}} spark plugs, he created a metal he named stellite. Realizing the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> discovery, he patented his first version in 1907. The metal was very resistant to corrosion and had immediate application in tool making and numerous other implementations. He continued to experiment with it until 1910 when he published his findings in a paper to the International Congress of Applied Chemistry and the American Institute of Metals, where he held memberships. His final version was completed in 1912 and his patent issued on June 20.|$|E

Despite his wealth and {{extensive}} business travel, Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, {{when he bought}} a private jet. Since 2000, the nominal <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not {{the richest man in}} the world because he disliked the attention it brought. In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from 40billion to more than 82billion. Since October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.|$|E

5|$|Rolf Harris was {{a popular}} {{entertainer}} on British TV, and was the presenter of Rolf on Art, a BBC series on artists. He took two months to complete the portrait; two sittings were held at Buckingham Palace {{in the summer of}} 2005, filmed by the BBC; the rest of the painting was completed at Harris' own art studio. The portrait, measuring , is in oil of the Queen wearing a turquoise dress. After he completed the portrait Harris' reputation as an artist, and the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works increased, and he was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE).

5|$|The house {{became the}} seat of the Strachey family {{including}} John Strachey, the geologist, who inherited estates including Sutton Court from his father in 1674 at three years of age. He introduced a theory of rock formations known as Stratum, based on a pictorial cross-section of the geology under the estate and coal seams in nearby coal works of the Somerset Coalfield. He projected them according to their measured thicknesses and attitudes into unknown areas between the coal workings. The purpose was to enhance the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grant of a coal-lease on parts of his estate. This work was later developed by William Smith.|$|E
5|$|After {{they drive}} {{together}} and work naturally as a team, Speed begins {{to suspect that}} Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With {{the help of his}} family and Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers who have been bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family's company so that they could profit from Royalton's buyout. An angry Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead. Speed returns home, where Taejo's sister Horuko Togokahn gives him Taejo's automatic invitation to the Grand Prix, which Taejo had rejected. The Racer family bands together and builds the new Mach 6 in 32 hours.|$|E

5|$|Brundage {{engaged the}} French scholar René-Yvon Lefebvre d'Argencé, then {{teaching}} at the University of California, as full-time curator of his collection and advisor on acquisitions. The two men made a deal—no piece would be purchased unless both men agreed. They built a collection of jade which ranged from the neolithic period to the modern era; and hundreds of Chinese, Japanese and Korean bronzes, mostly Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The painter whom Brundage admired the most was Huizong, 12th-century Chinese emperor of the Song dynasty; the collector never was able to obtain any of his work. Brundage several times bought pieces smuggled out of their lands of origin to restore them there. When Brundage sold a piece, it was most likely because he no longer favored it artistically, rather than to realize a profit. In 1954, a financial statement prepared for Brundage listed the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> collection as more than $1million. In 1960, Robert Shaplen, in his article on Brundage for The New Yorker, noted that Brundage, during his travels as IOC president, always found time to visit art dealers, and stated that the collection was valued at $15million.|$|E
