40|$|As {{the number}} of festivals {{and the need to}} provide more {{satisfying}} customer experiences continue to grow, the challenges faced by festival managers have become more complicated than ever. This means that festival organisers are becoming progressively more reliant on their inter-organisational/delivery partners to sustain and improve their on-going operational activity. Supply Chain Management (SCM) provides a new dimension to a traditional perspective on the management of festivals, as collective co-operation can lead to the provision of superior value to customers. Through data collected from multiple semi-structured interviews with directors and employees at UK-based music events and festival suppliers, this chapter offers insights into how the effective and efficient management of SCM carries additional benefits to festival delivery. Firstly, it illustrates the complexity and multiplicity of supply chains in the festival industry and highlights the reliance on trust, customer <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> within the overall supply chain. Secondly, the chapter applies two models from the mainstream SCM literature, namely the Bullwhip Effect and the Kraljic’s Purchasing Portfolio Model, to reveal the complex interactions between individual organisations in the supply chain...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the test of}} a multi-value framework {{for the evaluation of}} energy producing solar shading on three cases of Swedish retrofitting projects. The evaluation framework was developed in collaboration between academics and industry partners in a transdisciplinary research project and considers: energy production, indoor environment and comfort, <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication,</b> aesthetics, design and process, and maintenance and repair. Results show that the model even though having few criteria gives a general and comprehensive feed-back about the outcomes, challenges and success of the projects. None of the projects scores high in all aspects,instead they exemplify different approaches to energy producing solar shading. All three have shading and low maintenance as important criteria for design. Furthermore, the availability of subsidies to add solar energy production to the shading has been decisive for choosing that solution. Case 1 has had energy production as an important driver and no architect was involved while in Case 3, being a listed building, aesthetics has been crucial. Case 2 shows a way forward with a good collaboration between the actors and a compromise between shading,energy production and aesthetics which respect the original design...|$|E

In most cases, the element of police accessibility was weakly, but directly and significantly related to the elements of fear for personal safety and neighbourhood activity. There is no evidence to support the contention that neighbourhood activity is directly related to fear for personal safety. No significant relationships were found in an aspatial sample which may indicate the presence of a/locational effect. Also, there were substantial differences in results between neighbourhood samples. These results can have significant implications for community policing theory and practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Low Earth Orbit (LEO) {{satellites}} {{are used}} for public networking and for scientific purposes. Communication via satellite begins when the satellite is positioned in its orbital position. Ground stations can communicate with LEO satellites only when the satellite is in their visibility region. The duration of the <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> the <b>communication</b> vary for each LEO satellite pass over the station, since LEO satellites move too fast over the Earth. The satellite coverage area {{is defined as a}} region of the Earth where the satellite is seen at a minimum predefined elevation angle. The satellite’s coverage area on the Earth depends on orbital parameters. The communication under low elevation angles can be hindered by natural barriers. For safe <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> for savings within a link budget, the coverage under too low elevation is not always provided. LEO satellites organized in constellations act as a convenient network solution for real time global coverage. Global coverage model is in fact the complementary networking process of individual satellite’s coverage. Satellite coverage strongly depends on elevation angle. To conclude about the coverage variation for low orbiting satellites at low elevation up to 10 º, the simulation for attitudes from 600 km to 1200 km is presented through this paper.

40|$|In {{the context}} of a general {{increase}} in tourism activity and in the number of trips, and given that the consumption preferences of tourists are changing rapidly, the need for information becomes urgent and there is a concomitant development of public and private organizations involved in providing the necessary information to tourists who reach {{for the first time a}} tourist destination. This category includes tourist information centers (TICs), tourism promotion associations and tourism clubs. Being intensively based on information, the activity of informative tourism organizations suffers multiple changes, often radical, proving to be a favorable environment for the implementation of new information technologies due to their role in terms of providing and sharing information. In this sense, Facebook has special implications, being considered one of the fastest and most effective tools of Social Media, especially regarding the distribution of information and the promotion of products and services.

This project compares internal, external and academic perspectives on total force manpower management to facilitate the development of a recommended Total Force Manpower Management construct. The research team identified five key needs from the internal interviews and developed a set of recommendations that, once implemented, will enable ONR to more strategically manage its total workforce. Key Need Recommendation ONR needs a centralized Total Force Manpower structure. Amend the ONR organization chart to create an Office of Manpower Management (OMM) reporting to the Talent Manager. ONR needs a current, reconciled total force database. Expand the data collected during the Zero Based Review to establish and maintain a Position Management Database (PMD) that can be reconciled with existing systems of record and feed the Intelligent Workbook. ONR needs a more strategic focus on Total Force Manpower. Expand the functions of the existing Talent Management Board (TMB) to provide policy guidance for total force manpower issues and coordinate with leadership to issue a Total Force Manpower Strategic Plan. ONR needs to maintain and improve the effective control elements of the current construct. Expand the Personnel Management Plan to include multi-year targets for all workforce types (total force). ONR needs to more formally leverage manpower expertise across the Command to ensure alignment, <b>visibility,</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication.</b> Establish a Position Management Board (PMB) to formalize the interactions between ONR’s total force subject matter experts and to provide a more defined review process for total force personnel decisions. The recommendations, summarized in Appendix A, propose alterations to ONR structures, processes, and data management tools. Implemented independently, any of the proposed recommendations can move ONR incrementally toward the desired end-state. Implemented together, these recommendations provide an integrated approach to manpower management that will allow the Command to more strategically align its human capital resources with the accomplishment of its mission...|$|E

The purpose of the master’s thesis is to study the energy efficiency of existing nondomestic buildings through a focus on the gap between expected and actual energy use and management and use. The aim is to contribute to close the gap between expected and actual energy use in existing non-domestic buildings, while providing knowledge of management and use of such buildings. The master’s thesis study Realfagbygget (university and college building) and Miljøbygget (office building) in a case study to examine how expected energy use is calculated, how energy use is measured and factors that impact energy use – especially in terms of management and use of the buildings. The two buildings was selected through a systematic selection method. There has been conducted interviews to support the case study. Both the case study and the interviews has been conducted in Trondheim. The gap between expected and actual energy use is presented for the two buildings with possible causes and solutions. There has been conducted a literature study to collect and form a foundation of relevant theory and literature. The literature study and the case study is analysed to answer a thesis question which is supported by three research questions. The master’s thesis shows that there is a gap between expected and actual energy use for the two existing nondomestic buildings in the case study. This is related to how the expected energy use is calculated, which is based on historical figures of actual energy use. Actual energy use is measured with energy monitoring devices which communicate the energy data to a building management system and a energy monitoring system. There are several impact factors that affect the actual energy use which is both related the facilities management of the buildings, the users, their user behavior and user patterns, but also other factors. There is presented several barriers against energy efficiency, but also approaches to energy efficiency such as energy management, monitoring, <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> across the organizations, among others. The gap, with related causes and solutions is based on this and is consistent with the conclusion. Since the impact on actual energy use depend on various factors that are associated with varying uncertainties to what extent the factors will affect each specific year, it can be concluded that there always will be some degree of uncertainty to the expected and actual energy use, that will result in some degree of gap...|$|E

Proučena je {{literatura}} o temi rada te je provedeno istraživanje o poslovanju i pružanju usluga 50 europskih nacionalnih knjižnica na mrežnim mjestima i u okruženju društvenih medija. Istražena je prisutnost usluga kojima se promiče nacionalna kulturna baština – digitalne zbirke, digitalne knjižnice, virtualne izložbe te prijevod mrežnog mjesta na engleski ili neki drugi jezik. Istraženo je i postojanje usluga na društvenim mrežama Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, TripAdvisor, Flickr, Google+ i LinkedIn te usluga društvenih medija kao što su RSS, blog, podcast, online obrazac i online razgovor, odnosno chat. Podrobno je analizirano poslovanje Nacionalne i sveučilišne knjižnice u Zagrebu u digitalnom okruženju. Metodom webometrije usporedilo se predstavljanje nacionalne kulturne baštine na mrežnom mjestu Knjižnice i na društvenim mrežama. Uporabom pomagala Alexa i SimilarWeb utvrđen je rang prometa mrežnih mjesta istraživanih knjižnica. Radom je potvrđeno kako je postojanje većeg broja istraživanih mrežnih usluga nacionalnih knjižnica povezano s boljim položajem na svjetskoj ljestvici mrežnih mjesta. Na temelju primjera dobre prakse poslovanja europskih nacionalnih knjižnica te spajanjem zaključaka istraživanja utvrđene su odlike poslovanja nacionalnih knjižnica u digitalnom okruženju koje sjedinjuju poslovanje na mrežnim mjestima i u okruženju društvenih medija, a ponajprije društvenih mreža. Pritom odabir usluga društvenih mreža ovisi o njihovim odlikama te odlikama vrste građe koja se želi promicati. Njima se može pridonijeti kvaliteti poslovanja knjižnica koja će se odraziti i na položaj njihova mrežnog mjesta na svjetskoj ljestvici. Osim toga, takvim će se načinom poslovanja moći pridonijeti komuniciranju, vidljivosti i odjeku nacionalne kulturne baštine u javnosti te njezinoj održivosti, a on će se moći primijeniti u svim baštinskim ustanovama u kojima se čuva građa koja se smatra nacionalnom kulturnom baštinom. The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral thesis}} {{is to examine the}} role of a national library as a heritage institution that is responsible for presenting national cultural heritage kept in its holdings in the time of well-developed web and ICT technologies. The theme of this doctoral thesis was studied in depth in the available literature and research was conducted concerning the operation and provision of services in 50 European national libraries, with special focus on the activities of the National and University Library in Zagreb in the digital environment. The examples of the best management practice in European national libraries, then the determined benchmarks confirming the quality, and the ranking of the website of a national library, {{as well as on the}} author’s assessment of the conclusions resulting from the research, will be used as a basis to define the features of the best management practice for national libraries that could be used to contribute to the promotion of national cultural heritage in the digital environment. Applying this practice in a national library can contribute to <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication,</b> as well as the sustainability of the national cultural heritage not only in national libraries, but also in other heritage institutions preserving the materials comprising national cultural heritage. Research conducted for the purposes of this thesis includes 50 European national libraries, based on their membership in the web service of the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL), also known as The European Library (TEL). Out of the libraries included in the research, the activities of the National and University Library in Zagreb in the digital environment were given special consideration. It has been noted in the literature that the role of national libraries in presenting cultural heritage has become indispensable. Its role of the guardian and proponent of the national cultural heritage, has been established as one of its most important roles in the new digital age. Moreover, in the last two decades, libraries worldwide and national libraries in particular, have become active in the digital environment, launching their websites and web portals. By developing their websites and digitising their holdings, national libraries promoted cultural heritage resources on their websites in different ways, including digital collections, digital libraries, virtual exhibitions, and other similar services. However, over time it became obvious that not all national libraries have responded to the needs and challenges of the modern era with equal success, i. e. they have not been equally successful in their activities in the digital environment, including the method of presenting cultural heritage in their holdings. Using the content analysis method, this thesis will first focus on and establish the online presence of European national libraries, i. e. identify their official websites. In this process it was established that all European national libraries covered by the research are present on the Internet, meaning they have official websites. In addition, part of the research of the websites of 50 European national libraries included an analysis of whether they offered the services promoting national cultural heritage, where these services include digital libraries and virtual exhibitions, and, finally, whether the websites of European national libraries subject of research were translated into English or some other language used in the country of the national library included in the research. It was established that almost all, i. e. 94 per cent of European national libraries have either digital holdings or a digital library, while only 6 per cent of the libraries subject of research have none of these services, meaning that at least digital collections, as well as digital libraries, have become an essential content of the websites of the European national libraries. It was then established that, compared to the libraries which do not have them, a greater part of the analysed libraries do pay attention to creating virtual exhibitions, i. e. 58 per cent of libraries have virtual exhibitions on their websites, while 42 per cent of analysed libraries do not offer virtual exhibitions. It should be underlined that among virtual exhibitions there are significant differences in quality, visual solutions, and functionality. An analysis of the language used on the libraries’ websites, which can to a considerable extent also be used to disseminate the available contents about a national library, containing the descriptions of the collections, virtual exhibitions or digital libraries as part of the service of The European Library, or the European digital library Europeana, showed that a significant percentage of libraries, i. e. 82 per cent have their websites translated into the English language, while only 18 per cent of the libraries subject of research do not have an English translation. Moreover, the analysis of the translation of the contents of European national libraries into some other languages used in the country of a national library showed that only 18 per cent of libraries have their websites translated into more than one language. From the examined literature it is evident that national libraries have accepted the new possibilities and management models. These are dynamic 2 nd generation web services, also known as social media services or Web 2. 0. For the purposes of further research the aim was to establish how many European national libraries used more advanced possibilities for online activities. The intention was to establish which services in this digital age, alongside the obligatory websites and portals of national libraries that are mostly static in character, have been accepted and are put to use. In addition, the aim was to establish which ones of the analysed services, modelled on the libraries that are the most active, should be incorporated in the online activities of national libraries. Therefore, on the sample of 50 European national libraries present on the web, and by examining their online contents, 14 social media services were analysed, 9 of which are social networking services: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, TripAdvisor, Flickr, Google+ and LinkedIn, and 5 services which can be categorised as social media services according to their features, that include: RSS, blog, podcast, online forms on the libraries’ websites, such as an online form Ask the Librarian or an online form Contact etc., and online chat. The aim was to establish the number or percentage of the social media services and social networks that are used by the analysed national libraries, as well as the popularity of the analysed services among libraries. Furthermore, the intention was to analyse how many of the examined social media services and social networks are used by the respective European national library, thus facilitating identification, on the one hand, of the libraries which can be considered to be the leaders in the use of the 2 nd generation web services, i. e. Web 2. 0, and on the other, of those libraries that have failed to recognise the possibilities offered by these services. The intention was to focus particularly on establishing the status of the National and University Library in Zagreb, on a scale ranked from best to worst libraries. The research has confirmed that a number of European national libraries have risen to the challenge and recognised the possibilities created by the social media for online activity, primarily on social networking sites. The majority of European national libraries use the social network Facebook, and according to the use of other analysed services this social network is followed by: online forms, YouTube, Twitter, TripAdvisor, the RSS channel, blog, LinkedIn, Instagram, Flickr, Google+, online chat, and podcast, while the fewest libraries use Pinterest. In the case of social networks, the research has demonstrated that the majority of analysed European national libraries are present on Facebook, followed by, according to the frequency of use, YouTube, Twitter, TripAdvisor, LinkedIn, Instagram, Flickr, Google+ and Pinterest. The results show that the greatest number of analysed libraries provide 8 services, meaning 57 per cent of the total number of 14 analysed social media services. The majority of analysed European national libraries are present on only three social networks, i. e. 33 per cent of the total number of social networking sites, which confirms that European national libraries do not use a great number of social networking services for their activities. European national libraries that stand out by providing 10 or more social media services, i. e. 71 per cent or more of the total number of analysed services are: the National Library of Ireland, the Royal Library – National Library of the Netherlands, the National Széchényi Library (Hungary), the National Library of France, the National Library of Scotland, and the British Library, and can therefore be considered leaders in providing social media services. For the national libraries with only one social media service, it was found that it was either activity on Facebook or the interactive form on the library’s website. European national libraries distinguished by providing more services on the social networks, i. e. 78 per cent or more than the total number of the analysed services include the Royal Library – National Library of the Netherlands, the National Library of France, the National Library of Scotland, the National Széchényi Library (Hungary), and the British Library. Only one of the analysed European national libraries is not present on any social network. It is noticeable that libraries with the greatest number of services on the social networking sites correspond to the national libraries that provide the greatest number of social media services. It was established that the National and University Library in Zagreb provides 8 services, or 57 per cent of the analysed social media services. Different tools can be used to measure and evaluate the quality and popularity of any existing website in the world, such as Alexa and SimilarWeb, which are well-known in literature in the field of information and communication sciences, as tools for analysing libraries’ websites traffic statistics. The aim of this thesis was to establish the ranking of the 50 analysed European national libraries, out of the total number of global websites, according to the Alexa and SimilarWeb performance benchmarks. These tools were then used to establish the ranking of each European national library’s website on 12 March 2016, i. e. to register the assigned standing of the analysed European national libraries in the overall global ranking of websites that are monitored with Alexa and SimilarWeb. This method was used to establish the ranking of the analysed libraries according to their website’s performance. Even though these are different tools, the intention was to establish whether there are any similarities in the ranking of the websites of the analysed libraries according to their respective benchmarks. Special attention was paid to the ranking of the website of the National and University Library in Zagreb, which was then juxtaposed with other analysed European national libraries with similarly ranked websites. Since the ranking of a website should be perceived as inversely proportional, after having conducted the research it was established that the smallest world ranking number, meaning the best ranking of a website according to Alexa, is held by: the Swiss National Library, the National Library of France, the National and University Library of Slovenia, the British Library, and the Central National Library in Rome. The National and University Library in Zagreb is ranked in 25 th place. The best website standing of the libraries included in the research according to Alexa is held by the: National Library of France, the British Library, the National Széchényi Library (Hungary), the National Library of Scotland, and the National Library of Norway. In the global rankings of their websites, these libraries hold a relatively similar position range, as established with the previously mentioned Alexa. Furthermore, it was established that among listed libraries, the libraries previously ranked among the best using Alexa, again appear as the best using SimilarWeb. According SimilarWeb, the National and University Library in Zagreb ranks in the 25 th place. Compared to the global rankings of the websites of European national libraries analysed previously using Alexa, it holds the same position on the global websites ranking. The comparison of the data on the global ranking of the websites of European national libraries according to the tools for measuring the traffic statistics and website quality Alexa and SimilarWeb, demonstrates that both tools show an almost identical standing of European national libraries on the global ranking chart of their websites, out of the total number of websites they monitor. The aim was to use the assigned positions in the world ranking of the websites of European national libraries covered by research, that were obtained using Alexa and SimilarWeb, and correlate them with the 14 analysed social media services and online services promoting national cultural heritage offered on the websites of European national libraries. The research has confirmed that European national libraries that provide fewer social media services have poorer presence on the social networking sites, or provide fewer services promoting national cultural heritage, such as digital collections, digital libraries and virtual exhibitions, and the translation of their website into English or some other languages. According to both tools for monitoring network traffic, Alexa and SimilarWeb, their websites’ global ranking is considerably below par, while the libraries that provide a greater number of the analysed services have a better position on the global ranking list. In other words, the global ranking of European national libraries’ websites is better for the websites providing more services, which improves their position on the overall ranking chart of all global websites. For the purpose of examining the correlation between the online activity of national libraries and social networking services they provide, and for the purpose of drawing the conclusions about the quality of their operation from another perspective, Quintly online social media analytics tool was used to establish the number of followers of the respective national library on the social networks. The research has shown that national libraries with a very small total number of followers on the analysed social networking sites have a lower ranked website, while the libraries with a large total number of followers on the analysed social networks hold a better position on the global websites ranking list. Furthermore, the aim of the thesis was to pay special attention to monitoring and analysing online activities of the National and University Library in Zagreb. The monitored parameters include its presence and activity over time, from the static to active online services. Using the internal and external webometrics tools such as Google Analytics, Facebook Insights, as well as other tools to measure the activities on social networks, an assessment was made of the online services provided by the National and University Library in Zagreb that can contribute to the promotion and impact of national cultural heritage in different ways. The focus of attention was primarily on following the posts concerning the materials from the holdings of the National Library, including different types of resources such as written, art, music, cartographic, and other types of materials. In addition, posts about the heritage digitisation projects, Croatian, European or global, and posts about virtual exhibitions, etc. were monitored. Special attention was paid to the activities of the National and University Library in Zagreb in the digital environment and the contribution of the social media services, primarily the social networks, in communicating the information about its mission, services, and particularly the materials and contents that comprise national cultural heritage. By comparing the static and dynamic online services, including the services for promoting national cultural heritage, which the National and University Library in Zagreb provided over time, conclusions have been drawn about the possibilities of having a greater impact of cultural heritage in the digital environment. It was established that considerable differences exist in the impact or readership of certain posts that belongs to cultural heritage on the portal of the National and University Library in Zagreb compared to social networking sites and accounts – the number of visits and reach of the same posts on the Library’s website is significantly lower than on the social networks, primarily on Facebook. For example, the impact of features posted on Facebook, compared to static publications on the Library’s website, in terms of readership and visibility, is almost seventyfold higher. Apart from Facebook, it was established that the possibilities for disseminating the content in general, including cultural heritage resources, due to the dynamic character of social networks, is quicker and more efficient on other social networking sites, and their impact is by far greater. The reason for this is that news directly reaches the users of a social network who follow the activities of the National and University Library in Zagreb on this social networking site, unlike the contents on the Library’s portal, which the users have to find by themselves – whether by searching, by chance or regularly following the website, which requires more efforts from the user than a social network. The necessity of connecting the static websites and web portals of national libraries with the dynamic services they provide on the social networking sites has to be emphasised. The end goal of this thesis was to consolidate the conclusions drawn from all conducted analyses, and based on them formulate guidelines and propose some properties of the management practice for a national library as a heritage institution in the digital environment, which should and which can contribute to the process of communicating and having a greater impact of different types of materials a library preserves in its holdings – written, art, music, cartographic, and other types of materials that comprise the national cultural heritage. All research conducted for the purposes of this thesis demonstrates that apart from presenting materials and contents constituting national heritage on the websites of national...|$|E

Ground stations {{can communicate with}} LEO (Low Earth Orbiting) satellites only when the satellite is in their visibility region. The ground station’s ideal horizon plane {{is in fact the}} visibility region under 0 o of elevation angle. Because of natural barriers or too high buildings in urban areas, practical (visible) horizon plane differs from the ideal one. The duration of the <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> so the <b>communication</b> duration varies for each LEO satellite pass at the ground station, since LEO satellites move too fast over the Earth. The range between the ground station and the LEO satellite depends on maximal elevation of satellite’s path above the ground station. The dimension of the horizon plane depends on satellite’s orbital attitude. The range variations between the ground station and the satellite, and then ground station horizon plane simulation for low Earth orbiting satellites as a function of orbital attitude is presented. The range impact and horizon plane variations on communication duration between the ground station and LEO satellites are given...|$|R

The 16 day EOS periodicity may be shown with the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS) {{and the entire}} 16 day period should be simulated for representative link statistics. We desire many attributes of the downlink, however, and a faster orbital determination method is desirable. We use the method of osculating elements for speed and accuracy in simulating the EOS orbit. The accuracy of the method of osculating elements is demonstrated by closely reproducing the observed 16 day Landsat periodicity. An autocorrelation function method is used to show the correlation spike at 16 days. The entire 16 day record of passes over McMurdo Sound is then used to generate statistics for innage time, outage time, elevation angle, antenna angle rates, and propagation loss. The levation angle probability density function is compared with 1967 analytic approximation which {{has been used for}} medium to high altitude satellites. One practical result of this comparison is seen to be the rare occurrence of zenith passes. The new result is functionally different than the earlier result, with a heavy emphasis on low elevation angles. EOS is one of a large class of sun synchronous satellites which may be downlinked to McMurdo Sound. We examine delay statistics for an entire group of sun synchronous satellites ranging from 400 km to 1000 km altitude.

The robots can detect target point t as soon as it enters their <b>visibility</b> region <b>and</b> have <b>communication</b> peripherals to send messages to each other. Our aim is to minimize the length of the path passed by the robots. We propose an online algorithm for robots such that they move in the workspace and find the target.

Also, we prove that this ratio is tight...|$|R
40|$|To support {{software}} development globalisation, organisations are increasingly implementing virtual team strategies. However, these teams {{have to work}} {{within the confines of the}} factors which distance introduces, thus not always allowing effective coordination, <b>visibility,</b> <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> cooperation to take place. The successful implementation and management of such teams must be done differently to those at single-site locations. To establish what factors significantly affect the implementation of virtual teams, the authors carried out qualitative research in two organisations in Ireland. Results from this research demonstrate that many factors are reality for those involved in global software development. In this paper we present five of these factors and discuss the impact these had on the virtual teams. These five are: use of communication tools, project management, process engineering, technical ability and knowledge transfer and motivational issues. If these are not explicitly addressed by management it can lead to serious problems...|$|R
