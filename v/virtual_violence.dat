Some scientists have attempted to use functional magnetic resonance imaging to study this hypothesis.

Some scholars argue that the effect on the frontal lobe may be similar to the deactivation seen in disruptive behavior disorders.

40|$|The present chapter pursues the {{question}} if <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> is morally problematic behavior. <b>Virtual</b> <b>violence</b> {{is defined as}} any user behavior intended to do harm to perceived social agents who apparently try to avoid the harm-doing. The chapter reviews existing literature that suggests that users hurt themselves if they get en-gaged in <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> and that users may also do harm other users if they direct their violent acts against their avatars. Recent research is reviewed that further suggests that users may intuitively perceive virtual agents as social beings. They may thus intend to do harm to other social beings (instead of objects) when con-ducting <b>virtual</b> <b>violence.</b> The chapter also tackles (and denies) the idea that auto-nomous virtual agents are living entities that may suffer from <b>virtual</b> <b>violence.</b> In light of the reviewed evidence, <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> is considered morally problematic behavior.

For those who partake in this electronic world, damaging behaviors akin to those found in the real world have emerged. Yet, we know little about the extent of these behaviors in the context of romantic relationships, especially from a gender or cultural standpoint. Research on dating violence generally indicates that women experience in-person victimization at higher rates than men, although some research has called this into question.

Meta-analytic reviews reveal a small but noticeable association between playing vio-lent video games and aggressive reactions. However, evidence for causal associa-tions is still rare. In a novel, event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study, 13 male research participants were observed playing a latest-generation vio-lent video game. Each participant’s game play was recorded and content analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis. Onscreen activities were coded as either “passive/dead, no interactions”; “active/safe, no imminent danger/no violent interactions”; “active/po-tential danger occurs, violent interactions expected”; “active/under attack, some vio-lent interactions”; and “active/fighting and killing, many violent interactions. ” Previ-ous studies in neuroscience on aggressive thoughts and behaviors suggested that <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> would suppress affective areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala subsequent to activity variations at cognitive areas of the ACC.

40|$|Understanding the {{enjoyment}} of (violent) digital games is a complicated topic, with various social and psychological processes at its foundation. A recurrent theme throughout various conceptualizations is that players experience more enjoyment when they feel more present in the virtual world, for instance through high audiovisual quality or through similarities with the real world. Recently, studies from a moral psychology perspective have suggested a reverse argumentation: increased realism limits game enjoyment, as it becomes more difficult to remove moral objections towards in-game violence when it is perceived as ‘more real’. This study explores how a multidimensional conceptualization of perceived game realism can reconcile these seemingly contradictory perspectives. Based on Ribbens et al. (2016) we distinguish six dimensions of perceived game realism: simulation realism, freedom of choice, social realism, character involvement, audiovisual pervasiveness, and authenticity. In relation to the theoretical perspectives above, we hypothesize that: ‘Perceptual pervasiveness’ and ‘freedom of choice’ will positively relate to enjoyment of <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> (H 1 & H 2), whereas ‘social realism’ will negatively relate to enjoyment of <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> (H 3). Furthermore, we question whether the dimensions of character involvement, simulational realism, and authenticity will relate positively or negatively to enjoyment of <b>virtual</b> <b>violence.</b> With data gathered among 240 players in an online survey, analyzed through stepwise regression, perceptual pervasiveness and authenticity are positively and significantly related to game enjoyment, while the other four dimensions were not. This study clarifies a number of aspects on a theoretical level, and contributes towards the integration of fragmented results produced by research on {{the enjoyment}} of <b>virtual</b> <b>violence.</b> Based on this study we advocate to further investigate the multidimensional approach of perceived realism. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|While {{there are}} great {{benefits}} of the internet for learners there are also risks, such as cyberbullying, {{that need to be}} managed writes Gerry White on DERN. The use of digital technologies is increasing among the population, especially use of the internet via mobile technologies (mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, ultrabooks), including by students of all ages, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The advantages of the internet and increased capacities for communication and collaboration are inestimable.   Some of the benefits to education have been well documented in research reviews on DERN. However, even though the internet enables great benefits for learners, there are also risks, such as cyberbullying, that need to be managed. As stated in the foreword to <b>Virtual</b> <b>Violence</b> II: Progress and Challenges in the Fight against Cyberbullying, ‘Cyberbullying is a particularly damaging form of bullying and it is impossible to underestimate how destructive it can be. It erodes self-esteem and confidence, relationships with family and friends suffer, and harmful or risky behaviours come to be seen as ways of coping with pain. Bullied children are at higher risk of depression, achieving below their potential in school and dropping out of education altogether 2 ̆ 7 (p. 4). Cyberbullying is a considerable risk for learners.

40|$|Playing {{video games}} {{has become one}} of the most popular leisure {{activities}} among 14 youth (Smith, 2006). Violent video games, particularly first-person-shooters like 15 Half-Life II or Doom 3, are among the best-selling video games. Male adolescents are 16 especially prone to play violent video games (Hartmann & Klimmt, 2006; Jansz, 2005). 17 Violent games have been criticized and praised both in society and in science. Critics’ 18 biggest concern is that violent games could make their user more aggressive. Indeed, 19 abundant research finds evidence that playing violent games increases short-term 20 aggressive cognitions, feelings, and behavioral intentions (Anderson, 2004). Users 21 easily perceive computer-mediated characters as social beings (Scholl & Tremoulet, 22 2005). Accordingly, research finds that aggressive video game play stimulates the 23 same brain activity as real-life aggression does (Weber, Ritterfeld, & Mathiak, 2006). 24 With this in mind, it seems immoral to play violent games, as the <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> 25 appears to have serious consequences (Elton, 2000). Those who enjoy playing violent 26 video games, however, often say that they feel no wrong committing <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> 27 (Ladas, 2002). Rather, they highlight their enjoyment from playing violent games 28 (Jansz, 2005). 29 Little past research has tried to examine both sides of the debate together, 30 determining the circumstances under which <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> produces enjoyment 31 rather than moral distress and distaste.

40|$|Abstract: Modern {{video games}} {{represent}} highly advanced virtual reality simulations and often contain <b>virtual</b> <b>violence.</b> In {{a significant amount}} of young males, playing video games is a quotidian activity, making it an almost natural behavior. Recordings of brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during gameplay may reflect neuronal correlates of real-life behavior. We recorded 13 experienced gamers (18 – 26 years; average 14 hrs/week playing) while playing a violent first-person shooter game (a violent computer game played in self-perspective) by means of distortion and dephasing reduced fMRI (3 T; single-shot triple-echo echo-planar imaging [EPI]). Content analysis of the video and sound with 100 ms time resolution achieved relevant behavioral variables. These variables explained significant signal variance across large distributed networks. Occurrence of violent scenes revealed significant neuronal correlates in an event-related design. Activation of dorsal and deactivation of rostral anterior cingulate and amygdala characterized the mid-frontal pattern related to <b>virtual</b> <b>violence.</b> Statistics and effect sizes can be considered large at these areas. Optimized imaging strategies allowed for single-subject and for single-trial analysis with good image quality at basal brain structures. We propose that virtual environments can be used to study neuronal processes involved in semi-naturalistic behavior as determined by content analysis. Importantly, the activation pattern reflects brain-environment interactions rather than stimulus responses as observed in classical experimental designs. We relate our findings to the general discussion on social effects of playing first-person shooter games. Hum Brain Map...|$|E

With online {{interaction}} and gaming now {{a fact of}} daily life for a great many people, violence against women in computer games and in virtual (online) environments is becoming a pressing issue for both legal and ethical reasons. This paper summarises two kinds of “virtual ” violence. 1 The first, which can be called “video game ” violence, occurs in one-player games (such as Grand Theft Auto) where the player is interacting solely with computer-generated objects. In contrast, “virtual environments ” (like Second Life) involve player interaction with other users, usually represented graphically by avatars. The two different contexts provoke different concerns and anxieties in relation to questions of violence generally, and sexualised violence against women in particular. The first type (video game violence) prompts questions about the effects on the player and on society: will <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> will lead to “actual ” violence; does it de-sensitise the player to violence; does it result in (or reflect) a generalised increase in sexualised hostility towards women? In virtual environments, the concern is with the impact upon the victim; is it abusive or harmful when an avatar is assaulted? Video game violence It is indisputable that many video games depict extreme violence and highly sexualised images of women (Hayes, 2007; Ivory, 2006).

40|$|Product Description In recent years, digital {{games have}} evolved into an {{entertainment}} form that is extensively debated and investigated. Particularly the moral issues surrounding this new medium are marked with high priority {{on the agenda}} of academic and political institutions. To date, morality in digital games is being studied in several disciplines, including the humanities, social sciences, psychology, moral philosophy and human-computer studies. Findings remain fragmented and are hardly shared on an interdisciplinary level. In this book we explore the wide range of moral issues that apply to digital game play from a multidisciplinary perspective. The book features contributions from scholars who evaluate the debate on violent games from a cultural, philosophical and theological point of view. From the perspective of media psychology, the attraction of <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> is examined, in addition to the cognitive processes underlying amoral gaming activities, such as taboo violation and cheating. Case studies include analyses of survival horror games and World War II games, and focus on specific titles, such as Fallout 3, Heavy Rain, Grand Theft Auto IV and America’s Army. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This UK report {{finds that}} 28 % of 11 -to- 16 -year-olds have been {{deliberately}} targeted, threatened or humiliated {{by an individual}} or group {{through the use of}} mobile phones or the internet. The latest findings from Beatbullying reveal that 28 % of 11 -to- 16 -year-olds have been deliberately targeted, threatened or humiliated by an individual or group through the use of mobile phones or the internet. For over a quarter of these, this experience was ongoing, meaning that the individual was continuously targeted for bullying by the same person or group over a sustained period of time. This suggests that one-in- 13 secondary-aged school children have experienced persistent and intentional cyberbullying. Given that there are approximately 4, 377, 780 secondary-aged children in the UK (Office for National Statistics (ONS), 2011), these figures can be projected to suggest that 350, 222 children may have suffered persistent and insidious bullying inflicted via technology. These findings closely mirror Beatbullying’s first <b>Virtual</b> <b>Violence</b> study delivered in November 2009 (Cross, Richardson, Douglas & von Kaenel-Flatt, 2009), and give us significant insight into the nature of this form of bullying in the UK. Of those young people who reported being persistently cyberbullied, just under a quarter (23 %) said that it lasted {{for a year or more}} and two-in-five (40 %) said that it lasted for months or weeks. Over a quarter (26 %) said that the bullying happened more than 10 times, over a tenth (14 %) between six and 10 times, and a third (29 %) between three and five times. The findings also present an interesting insight into where the bullying originates. For those ‘persistently cyberbullied’, a quarter (26 %) said that the bullying first happened online, but 44 % said that it started offline (that is, the person was first targeted face-to-face and the bullying then continued online). While this indicates that ‘persistent cyberbullying’ still tends to originate offline and then follows the victim online, there is a notable decrease in how often this is occurring when compared to the original <b>Virtual</b> <b>Violence</b> study carried out in 2009 – which found two-thirds (62 %) of those who were ‘persistently cyberbullied’ were first bullied offline. Indeed, within the total sample of those who had experienced cyberbullying, only two-in-five (20 %) said that their experience was an extension of offline bullying, with a quarter (27 %) saying that the bullying they had experienced had started online. Therefore, this would indicate that bullying is becoming an increasingly more common phenomenon that starts online, paving the way for more relentless attacks.   Source: Commissioned by Nominet Trust In Association with the National Association for Head Teachers (NAHT) Beatbullying is a registered charity based in the UK.

40|$|Research on {{the effects}} of video game play has mainly been {{focusing}} on topics such as agression, violence and hostility. This is undoubtedly related to the countless social and political debates that have been held on the harmful impact of this new medium. From a social-psychological point of view, researchers have frequently observed that, up to 15 minutes after having played a game of action, one is more excited or aroused than in the case one had not played that game. Concerning the long-term effects, research has not yet been able to produce consistent conclusions. Limited support has already been found for the 'desensitisation theory', positing that, because one is exposed to large amounts of <b>virtual</b> <b>violence,</b> one is less likely to be affected by real-life violence. In addition some authors have argued that, because one repeatedly practices acting violently during game play, one is actually taught to act violently in real life. Other authors contradict this finding, and point to the fact that, during game play, one learns to behave pro-socially. The main goal of this dissertation was to build upon a number of questions that have not yet been consistently answered in existing research. We decided to focus on the long-term effects of video game play. We did not restrict ourselves to violence-related questions, but we also studied whether adolescents acquire knowledge about every day life during video game play, or whether video game play has an impact on the attitudes adolescents have towards othe people.

40|$|Violent video games, in {{particular}} shooting games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, are a favourite pass {{time for a}} growing group of adolescents and (young) adults. Because of their violent nature, these games are subject to strong social criticism. Especially when severe acts of violence are committed  {{as was the case}} with the crimes of Anders Breivik or the school shootings in the United States of America  violent video games are often at the centre of criticism. Following the increased societal fear about the impact of <b>virtual</b> <b>violence,</b> the relationship between violent video games and attitudinal and behavioural changes has become a topic of academic interest. One recurrent point of discussion within this type of research concerns the specific role of the user in an interactive medium such as digital games. Although most video game effects research to date has attributed a strong theoretical importance to the interactive nature of game play, thetrend to empirically examine and incorporate player activity in video game effects research is recent. With this doctoral dissertation, we aim to contribute to this research tradition by examining aspects of the player-game relationship and incorporating these aspects in research on the relationship between exposure to <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> and desensitization to violence. In Part I of this dissertation, the medium-specificrelationship between a game and a player is discussed, as well as the extent to which this relationship has been accounted for in existing video game effects research. Using insights from literary theory, filmtheory, game studies, and game design, we conceptualize the player-gamerelationship as a process of negotiation that takes place at two levels. On the one hand, players need to interpret the message, just as is the case for traditional media. On the other hand, players actively contribute to the meaning of a game by providing the game system with input based upon their own preferences and dispositions. As a result, video games consist of dynamic models from which meaning is created through interaction with players. In line with the abovementioned conceptualization of game play, research on the relationship between exposure to violent video games and aggression-related outcomes has been criticized for paying too little attention to player activity. In this doctoral dissertation, we identify three domains of investigation related to the player-game relationship that are relevant from a media effects studies point of view: configuration, involvement, and perceptions. In addition, we discuss alternative theoretical frameworks in which the emphasis is on personality characteristics and environmental strains as causes of aggression. In Part II of this dissertation, we present our own contribution to understanding, conceptualizing, and operationalizing the player-game relationship. We focus our attention on playing styles and perceived game realism, two subjects that have, both from a conceptual and operational point of view, only sporadically been accounted for in previous research but nonetheless bear strong relevance to video game effects research. First, we address the claim that avideo game cannot be described in terms of one single, consistent text,but should be investigated as a virtual space of possibilities, enabling players to construct an individual trajectory. By means of qualitative diaries, video commentary models, and focus group interviews wemap the various ways in which young male adults interact with, shape, and experience the content of shooting games. The results of this study confirm the theoretical observation that players construe a personal playing style, even while engaging with the same title. Consequently, players may ascribe different qualities to the acts of violence they perform. Based upon the data, we identify several concepts (e. g. strategic involvement, narrative justification, pace, ) that may impact the relationship between exposure to <b>virtual</b> <b>violence</b> and aggression-related outcomes. In addition to an examination of the variousways in which players construe their playing style, we address the claim that players perceptions of the reality that is presented in a game cannot be understood in terms of representational judgements only, but that players also think about video games as dynamic, rule-based systems when judging a game. More specifically, we incorporated the medium-specific characteristics of game play in the explication of perceived game realism. By means of a series of quantitative surveys, we identify five dimensions of perceived game realism: simulational realism, freedom, (character) involvement, social realism, and perceptual pervasiveness. This five-factor solution strengthens the theoretical framework presented in Part I of this dissertation by confirming that, besides the audio-visual characteristics, the characteristics that relate to player activity are constructive of a games overall reality impression. In Part III of this dissertation, we examine whether the player-game relationship, and more specific playing styles and perceived realism, can be used to better understand the relationship between exposure toshooting games and desensitization to violence. Because several researchers have emphasized that the influence of violent media should not be discussed in isolation of other risk, protective, or buffering factors, we also take into account personality characteristics and environmental factors. Results from a cross-sectional survey (N = 1846 adolescent boys) indicate that concepts related to the way in which players experience and process violent content, as well as personality and environmental factors, are better predictors of desensitization to violence than mere exposure to violent video game content. The results support a multifactorial approach to understanding aggression. Specifically with regard to video game effects research, we believe it is fruitful to shift focus from mere exposure to violent video game content to the intensity of the game play experience in order to arrive at a proper understanding of why and how video games may affect individuals. status: publishe...|$|E
