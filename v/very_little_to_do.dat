On 1 May, he embarked for Europe to join the New Zealand Division. However, during transit his transport ship was unexpectedly diverted to Egypt. For two months, his contingent was based at the training camp of the Australian Imperial Force at Tel-el-Kebir but had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with only a few hours of training each day. The 12th Reinforcement left in July for Sling Camp in England, where it underwent more intense training.|$|E

When the Whig ministry of Lord Melbourne was dismissed by the King, The Times newspaper blamed the Queen's influence, though {{she seems to have}} had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. Influenced by her similarly reactionary brother-in-law, the Duke of Cumberland, she did write to the King against reform of the Church of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|However, some {{computational}} {{problems are}} easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources. For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The non-deterministic Turing machine has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that non-deterministic time {{is a very important}} resource in analyzing computational problems.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{emptiness}} {{as lack of}} inherent existence has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with what the Buddha himself said about emptiness. His teachings on emptiness — {{as reported in the}} earliest Buddhist texts, the Pali Canon — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues of pleasure and pain. To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause.|$|E

A PC version was proposed for 1995, but the plan was abandoned when the series finished. The latter game was an RPG similar to the Dungeon Master and Eye Of The Beholder games which, whilst well received at the time, had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the TV series besides the fantasy setting.|$|E

25|$|Of all the {{classical}} philosophers, however, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are generally {{considered the most}} important and influential. Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal of him is accurate. Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato's early socratic dialogues. Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato's portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato's own opinions who has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the historical figure of the same name. The debate over the extent to which Plato's portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates's ideas is known as the Socratic problem.|$|E

Oprah Winfrey's book club selection in 2001 of The Corrections led to a much publicized feud with the talk show host. In recent years, Franzen has become recognized for his opinions on everything from social networking services such as Twitter ("the ultimate irresponsible medium") {{and the proliferation of}} e-books ("just not permanent enough") to the disintegration of Europe ("The people making the decisions in Europe are bankers.

Before this appointment was made, the Protectorate had been steadily {{on the way to}} independence. The capital city of the Protectorate was relocated from South Africa's Mafikeng to the Protectorate's Gaborone in February 1965. A month later self-rule was granted to the Protectorate. Norman-Walker was the last Commissioner of the Protectorate and was there to prepare for the independence, though he had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in his short tenure.

25|$|In 1963 Benoit Mandelbrot {{analyzed}} the variations of cotton prices on a time series starting in 1900. There were two important findings. First, price movements had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with a normal}} distribution in which {{the bulk of the}} observations lies close to the mean (68% of the data are within one standard deviation). Instead, the data showed a great frequency of extreme variations. Second, price variations followed patterns that were indifferent to scale: the curve described by price changes for a single day was similar to a month’s curve. Surprisingly, these patterns of self-similarity were present during the entire period 1900-1960, a violent epoch that had seen a Great Depression and two world wars. Mandelbrot used his fractal theory to explain the presence of extreme events in Wall Street. In 2004 he published his book on the “misbehavior” of financial markets - The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward. The basic idea that relates fractals to financial markets is that the probability of experiencing extreme fluctuations (like the ones triggered by herd behavior) is greater than what conventional wisdom wants us to believe. This of course delivers a more accurate vision of risk in the world of finance. The central objective in financial markets is to maximize income for a given level of risk. Standard models for this are {{based on the premise that}} the probability of extreme variations of asset prices is very low.|$|E

In Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai and , films that failed to garner praise, Mukerji played the love interests of Abhishek Bachchan and Anil Kapoor respectively. In a review for the latter, Sarita Tanwar wrote that [...] " [...] has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> except being part of some magnificently picturised songs".|$|E

Vidya's role {{was that of the}} sexually manipulative Krishna Verma. Vidya described her character as [...] "an epitome of grey" [...] and a departure from the conventional portrayal of women in cinema. In preparation for her part, she undertook professional training to speak in the local Uttar Pradesh-dialect. The feature as well as her performance received critical acclaim. Anupama Chopra of NDTV stated, [...] "Vidya Balan's smoldering looks scorch the screen even as her eyes hint at tragedy. She proves that she is miles ahead of the cookie cutter Barbie dolls that clutter Bollywood and that sensuality has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with showing skin." [...] Her work in the film earned Vidya a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, a second consecutive Best Actress award at Screen and a nomination for Best Actress at Filmfare.|$|E

However, Springfield Elementary School stays open regardless of the storm, even though every other local school closes. Only some students, including the classmates of Bart and Lisa, show up while Skinner and Willie are the only faculty members at the school that day. To pass the time, Skinner plays his professed favourite film, a very low-budget, long-running, 1938 holiday film called The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was, which Lisa notices has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Christmas. By the time the movie is finally over, it is already {{the end of the school}} day, and Skinner lets the kids go home--however, Skinner and the students quickly realize that over the course of the day, the snow has piled up tremendously, leaving them and Groundskeeper Willie trapped inside the school, much to the horror of the kids.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN was {{critical}} of both Shannon and her relationship with Boone before the plane crash, commenting [...] "Shannon's ability to 'sort-of' understand French and Boone's lifeguard training have had little impact and as characters they bring very little to the table. There are also too many more intriguing storylines and characters around them that deserve attention." [...] On their relationship he added, [...] "except for the final act, when they finally succumb to their lust for one another ... There's nothing exciting here or anything that will ultimately be built upon in the Lost universe." [...] In a later review, for the episode following Boone's death, he commented [...] " [...] were both left with <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this season. Especially Shannon, whose high point of usefulness was deciphering Rousseau's documents for Sayid. Well, Maggie Grace is {{given an opportunity to}} shine and she does an acceptable job as the distraught sibling who is now looking for someone to blame for Boone's death. We finally get to see some real depth to Shannon's character and her quest for vengeance is believable."

500|$|Neighborhood Centers Inc. {{began work}} in the Gulfton and Sharpstown areas around 30 years before 2011. In 1998 Neighborhood Centers opened El Puente (The Bridge), a privately {{operated}} community center {{on the grounds of}} the Napoleon Square Apartments, a complex which had a predominantly Spanish-speaking population. El Puente is located in three apartment units that had been converted into office space and play areas. Two of the apartment units are connected to each other. The center's goal is to provide community support to replace the community support that the immigrants had previously received in Latin America. As of 1999, ten different agencies provided services at El Puente and 135 families signed up to receive the services. As of 1999, at the center, the Houston Public Library provided literacy classes, Houston Community College provided English classes, the Houston Independent School District provided preschool services for three- and four-year-olds, the University of Houston Graduate College of Social Work arranged assessments for graduate students studying social work, and the Sisters of Charity's Southwest Clinic provided prenatal and preventative medical services. In 2003 the Chrysalis Dance Company provided dance sessions at El Puente, used to teach English to mothers and children. Maricela Grun, the coordinator of the complex, said in 1999 that the center was needed because children had few activities available. She said that [...] "The children have <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> They're just confined to their apartments." ...|$|E
