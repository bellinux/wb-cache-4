Well, we ought to have thought of that before we applied occidental education; we applied that, and a measure of occidental machinery must follow. Legislative Councils once called into existence, then it was inevitable that you would have gradually, in Lord Salisbury's own phrase, to popularise them, so as to bring them into harmony with the dominant sentiments of the people in India. The Bill of 1892 admittedly contained the elective principle, and our Bill to-day extends that principle. The noble Lord (Viscount Cross) will remember the Bill of 1892, of which he had charge in the House of Commons.

Your Committee, on the supposed rules here alluded to, has been prevented (as of right) from examining a witness of importance in the case, and one on whose supposed knowledge of his most hidden transactions the prisoner had himself, in all stages of this business, as the House well knows, endeavored to raise presumptions in favor of his cause. Indeed, it was his principal, if not only justification, as to the intention, in many different acts of corruption charged upon him. The witness to whom we allude is Mr. Larkins. This witness came from India after your Committee had closed the evidence of this House in chief, and could not be produced before the time of the reply. Your Committee was not suffered to examine him,--not, as they could find, on objections to the particular question as improper, but upon some or other of the general grounds (as they believe) on which Mr. Hastings resisted any evidence from him. The party, after having resisted his production, on the next sitting day admitted him, and by consent he was examined. Your Committee entered a protest on the minutes in favor of their right. Your Committee contended, and do contend, that, by the Law of Parliament, whilst the trial lasts, they have full right to call new evidence, as the circumstances may afford and the posture of the cause may demand it.|$|E

It was not surprising that he was driven from his native realm, for he possessed none of those high qualities of mind which fit men to conquer or to govern. Like all other weak-minded tyrants, he substituted cruelty for wisdom and energy in his attempts to subjugate his foes. As soon as he was married to Emma, for instance, feeling elated and strong at the great accession of power which he imagined he had obtained by this alliance, he planned a general massacre of the Danes, and executed it on a given day, by means of private orders, sent secretly throughout the kingdom. Vast numbers of the Danes were destroyed; and so great was the hatred of the two races for each other, that they who had these bloody orders to obey executed them with a savage cruelty that was absolutely horrible. In one instance they buried women to the waist, and then set dogs upon them, to tear their naked flesh until they died in agony. It would be best, in narrating history, to suppress such horrid details as these, were it not that in a land like this, where so much depends upon the influence of every individual in determining whether the questions and discussions which are from time to time arising, and are hereafter to arise, shall be settled peacefully, or by a resort to violence and civil war, it is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should all know what civil war is, and to what horrible atrocities it inevitably leads.|$|E

In addition, effect-based bioassays can help identify the causes of impairment of ecosystems and derive mitigation options [21]. However, targeted chemical surveillance, as used to assess the chemical status of water bodies {{in the context of the}} EU-WFD, only allows to monitor the concentration of priority substances.

40|$|Abstract: Our {{main goal}} with this {{dissertation}} {{is to create}} a solid base on balanced and unbalanced graphs, as well as threshold functions of random graphs for future reference. We begin by performing an in depth study on balanced and unbalanced graphs as well as the two variations strictly balanced and strongly balanced as these graphs occur quite frequently in the literature of Random Graph Theory. Our purpose is to define each of these graphs and then to prove a few <b>important</b> results <b>that</b> will be used later on in the dissertation and for future reference. A <b>very</b> <b>important</b> result <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will prove here is that any graph has a balanced extension, and then we take this result even further by determining the least number of vertices and edges that are required to form a balanced extension. Thereafter we define and study threshold functions of random graphs. We begin by determining when a threshold function will exist and whether this function is unique. A step by step approach is given for the two methods of determining a threshold function, namely the First and Second Moment Method and the Grading Method, and then the first method is illustrated for both uniform random graphs and binomial random graphs. The relationship between the threshold functions of the uniform random graphs and those of the binomial random graphs are also discussed, followed by a comparison between threshold function values and extremal values [...] .

30|$|In the {{biological}} application, pH is a <b>very</b> <b>important</b> factor <b>that</b> <b>we</b> firstly take into consideration. Herein, {{the influence of}} pH values over the PL of the RNase A@C-dot clusters is indicated in Figure  2 d. The fact that pH values could affect the PL intensity has been seen in quite a few studies [10, 21, 32, 35]. Generally, PL intensity reaches its maximum at a certain pH values, 4.5 [35] or 7 [21]. At the same time, a slight redshift in the emission peak was identified {{with the increase of}} pH value [35]. Interestingly, the pH value played a unique role upon the PL of RNase A@C-dots. There was a noticeable redshift in the emission peak when the pH went from 2.98 to 11.36. However, the PL intensity decreases continuously as pH values increase. Specifically, the C-dots lost about 25 % of its PL intensity when the pH increases from 2.98 to 7.32 and retain only 40 % of its intensity when the pH value comes to 11.36. <b>We</b> speculate <b>that</b> at the lower pH condition, the RNase A coating on the surface of C-dots keeps a high activity and the RNase A-modified C-dots remain monodispersed in the water solution. Although the underlying origin is still vague, the fact that the C-dots keep its PL intensity at a relatively high level, going through the pH value from very acidic to neutral, shows promising advantages in biological applications.|$|R

It is the most northern network of those three. It consists of four points in a shape of a rectangular with only one diagonal. The network has been, including this year, measured six times. Horizontal and vertical angles and slope distances are measured in the network. The basis for displacement determination is the first measurement, with which all subsequent measurements performed in selected time intervals are compared. In addition to precise measurements, the stability of the measurement points is also <b>very</b> <b>important</b> so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can determine even the smallest displacements with the highest probability. The result of processing the measurements are definite coordinates of points. From the differences of the coordinates the horizontal displacements in the y and x axes direction are defined and with adding both vectors we can obtain the entire displacement. The displacement of points can be detected with sufficient certainty only when the displacements are significantly higher than the accuracy of estimated displacements. The accuracy of displacement depends on the accuracy of determining the position of points in the first series of measurements and the accuracy of determining the position of point in the ongoing series of measurements.
