5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of <b>vertices)</b> always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree <b>vertices.</b> The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of <b>vertices</b> of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd <b>vertices</b> is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E
5|$|A graph {{is formed}} by a {{collection}} of <b>vertices</b> and edges, where the <b>vertices</b> are structureless objects that are connected in pairs by edges. In {{the case of a}} directed graph, each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex.|$|E
5|$|A k-coloring, {{for some}} integer k, is an {{assignment}} {{of one of}} k colors to each vertex of a graph G such that the endpoints of each edge get different colors. The k-colorings of G correspond exactly to homomorphisms from G to the complete graph K'k. Indeed, the <b>vertices</b> of K'k correspond to the k colors, and two colors are adjacent as <b>vertices</b> of K'k if {{and if they are}} different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to K'k if and only if it maps adjacent <b>vertices</b> of G to different colors (i.e., it is a k-coloring). In particular, G is k-colorable if and only if it is K'k-colorable.|$|E

5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving <b>vertices</b> {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the <b>vertices</b> and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of the degrees of the <b>vertices</b> of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of the faces of the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E
5|$|General homomorphisms {{can also}} {{be thought of as}} a kind of coloring: if the <b>vertices</b> of a fixed graph H are the {{available}} colors and edges of H describe which colors are compatible, then an H-coloring of G is an assignment of colors to <b>vertices</b> of G such that adjacent <b>vertices</b> get compatible colors.|$|E
5|$|In an undirected graph, a widest path may {{be found}} as the path between the two <b>vertices</b> in the maximum {{spanning}} tree of the graph, and a minimax path {{may be found}} as the path between the two <b>vertices</b> in the minimum spanning tree.|$|E

5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of graph theory, a graph homomorphism is a mapping between two graphs that respects their structure. More concretely, it {{is a function}} between the vertex sets of two graphs that maps adjacent <b>vertices</b> to adjacent <b>vertices.</b>|$|E
5|$|Topological sorting is the {{algorithmic}} {{problem of}} finding a topological ordering of a given DAG. It can be solved in linear time. Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting builds the vertex ordering directly. It maintains a list of <b>vertices</b> that have no incoming edges from other <b>vertices</b> that have not already {{been included in the}} partially constructed topological ordering; initially this list consists of the <b>vertices</b> with no incoming edges at all. Then, it repeatedly adds one vertex from this list {{to the end of the}} partially constructed topological ordering, and checks whether its neighbors should be added to the list. The algorithm terminates when all <b>vertices</b> have been processed in this way. Alternatively, a topological ordering may be constructed by reversing a postorder numbering of a depth-first search graph traversal.|$|E
5|$|Two <b>vertices</b> in a {{directed}} graph {{are said to}} be strongly connected to each other if there is a directed path {{from one to the other}} and vice versa. This is an equivalence relation, and the <b>vertices</b> of the graph may be partitioned into strongly connected components, subsets within which every two <b>vertices</b> are strongly connected. There are several efficient linear time algorithms for finding the strongly connected components of a graph, based on depth first search: Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm each perform a single depth first search. Kosaraju's algorithm performs two depth first searches, but is very simple.|$|E

5|$|If all edge weights of an {{undirected graph}} are positive, then the minimax {{distances}} between pairs of points (the maximum edge weights of minimax paths) form an ultrametric; conversely every finite ultrametric space comes from minimax distances in this way. A data structure constructed from the {{minimum spanning tree}} allows the minimax distance between any pair of <b>vertices</b> to be queried in constant time per query, using lowest common ancestor queries in a Cartesian tree. The root of the Cartesian tree represents the heaviest minimum spanning tree edge, {{and the children of}} the root are Cartesian trees recursively constructed from the subtrees of the minimum spanning tree formed by removing the heaviest edge. The leaves of the Cartesian tree represent the <b>vertices</b> of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two <b>vertices</b> equals the weight of the Cartesian tree node that is their lowest common ancestor. Once the minimum spanning tree edges have been sorted, this Cartesian tree can be constructed in linear time.|$|E

5|$|In graph theory, a {{bipartite graph}} is a graph whose <b>vertices</b> are {{split into two}} colors, such that {{neighboring}} <b>vertices</b> have different colors. If a connected graph has no odd cycles, then a bipartition can be constructed by choosing a base vertex v and coloring every vertex black or white, depending on whether its distance from v is even or odd. Since the distance between v and itself is 0, and 0 is even, the base vertex is colored differently from its neighbors, which lie {{at a distance of}} 1.|$|E
