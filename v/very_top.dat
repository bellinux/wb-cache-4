The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, {{and the fact that it}} is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|On 2 September 1918 on {{the west}} bank of the River Jordan, Palestine, when his {{squadron}} was charging a strong enemy position, Ressaidar Badlu Singh realised that heavy casualties were being inflicted from a small hill occupied by machine-guns and 200 infantry. Without any hesitation he collected six other ranks and with entire disregard of danger he charged and captured the position. He was mortally wounded on the <b>very</b> <b>top</b> of the hill when capturing one of the machine-guns single handed, but all the guns and infantry had surrendered to him before he died.|$|E
5|$|The cycle repeats at a {{frequency}} relative to {{how long it}} takes a wave to travel to the first open hole and back twice (i.e. four times the length of the pipe). For example: when all the holes bar the <b>very</b> <b>top</b> one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' key is pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.|$|E

He will only grant their wishes if they kill the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East, Evillene (Mabel King), the Wicked Witch of the West, who runs a sweatshop in the underground sewers of Oz. Before they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out the Flying Monkeys (a motorcycle gang) to kidnap them.|$|E

A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington. In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the <b>very</b> <b>top</b> in the majority of polls. Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2. George Washington; and 3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, are occasionally reversed.|$|E
5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them at the <b>very</b> <b>top</b> of the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter.|$|E
5|$|The early 2000s {{were seen}} as a time of {{transition}} in tennis, with older players retiring and a few players breaking through at the <b>very</b> <b>top</b> of the game. Roger Federer had first played on the ATP Tour aged 17 in 1998, finishing his first full ATP season the following year before finishing 2002 ranked sixth in the world, his first year-end ranking in the top 8. His breakthrough came in 2003 when {{he won his first}} Grand Slam tournament, and finished the year as world number 2 behind Andy Roddick. The following two years, he almost completely dominated, winning five of eight majors and losing just ten matches in 2004 and 2005. Between Wimbledon in 2005 and the US Open in 2007, Federer captured 8 of 10 majors with a staggering record of 67â€“2 in those tournaments.|$|E

5|$|As of 2006, the Ecuadoran flag still shares some {{similarity}} {{with the}} flags of Colombia and Venezuela. All three flags use the yellow, {{blue and red}} tricolor, but {{that is where the}} similarities end. In a decree passed in Colombia in 1934, the ratio of the stripes were set at 2:1:1 and the flag ratio was set at 2:3, similar to the present Ecuador flag. However, the coat of arms is only changed {{in the middle of the}} flag when it is used by government officials or by military forces. For Venezuela, the basic design was to have all three strips even vertically, unlike those of Colombia and Ecuador. Since 1863, Venezuela decided to change their flag with white stars instead of a coat of arms. A coat of arms was not added to the national flag 1954, then changed again in 2006 to add another star and alter the coat of arms. The position of the coat of arms on the Venezuelan flag also differs from Ecuador and Colombia by placing the arms at the <b>very</b> <b>top</b> hoist (left) side of the flag instead of in the center.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus lambei and L. magnicristatus, {{from the}} Dinosaur Park Formation, {{were members of}} a diverse and {{well-documented}} fauna of prehistoric animals that included such well-known dinosaurs as the horned Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Chasmosaurus, fellow duckbills Prosaurolophus, Gryposaurus, Corythosaurus, and Parasaurolophus, tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus, and armored Edmontonia and Euoplocephalus. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms. The anatomically similar L. lambei, L. magnicristatus, and Corythosaurus were separated by time within the formation, based on stratigraphy. Corythosaurus fossils are known from the lower two-thirds of the Formation, L. lambei fossils {{are present in the}} upper third, and L. magnicristatus remains are rare and present only at the <b>very</b> <b>top,</b> where the marine influence was greater.|$|E

5|$|Little {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} and most successful practitioners of market manipulation, making his fortune by leveraging both short sales and short sellers. In the former, he would sell stocks to other traders under contract to purchase it at a later date, betting that the market value would go down in the future and he could pocket the difference (trade rules have changed, and short selling is more complicated than this today). In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver, corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector, up-ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks. Hardworking, highly ambitious, and with his eyes set on the <b>very</b> <b>top</b> from the very beginning, Little commonly spent twelve hours a day working on such maneuvers in his office and a further six during the evening engaged in currency speculation.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at Pinewood Studios at its 007 Stage in the UK, as well as Weissensee in Austria. The pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed on the Rock of Gibraltar and although the sequence shows a hijacked Land Rover careering down various sections of road for several minutes before bursting through a wall towards the sea, the location mostly used the same short stretch of road at the <b>very</b> <b>top</b> of the Rock, shot from numerous different angles. The beach defences seen {{at the foot of}} the Rock in the initial shot were also added solely for the film, to an otherwise non-military area. The action involving the Land Rover switched from Gibraltar to Beachy Head in the UK for the shot showing the vehicle actually getting airborne. Trial runs of the stunt with the Land Rover, during which Bond escapes by parachute from the tumbling vehicle, were filmed in the Mojave Desert, although the final cut of the film uses a shot achieved using a dummy. Other locations included Germany, the United States, and Italy, while the desert scenes were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco. The conclusion of the film {{was shot at}} the SchÃ¶nbrunn Palace, Vienna and Elveden Hall, Suffolk.|$|E
