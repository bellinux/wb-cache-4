In addition, annual diameter growth at breast height was recorded since 1998 with permanent diameter tapes which were equipped with Vernier scales for circumferential recording with 1  mm resolution (UMS, Germany).

40|$|Formal {{solutions}} of {{the static}} equilibrium equations for {{the form of}} the outer surface of a pendent liquid drop are studied. An approach is adopted in which only the one-parameter family determined by <b>vertex</b> <b>height</b> (u sub 0) need be described. Attention is restricted to rotationally symmetric configurations, and all symmetric solutions are characterized for the case where the Lagrange parameter lambda is equal to zero. It is shown that for any u sub 0 the function u(r; u sub 0) can be extended as a parametric solution of a system of equations for all arc lengths, yielding a curve without limit sets or double points, and that the resulting capillary rotation surface spreads out indefinitely away from the axis r = 0. The asymptotic form of the surface in the case of large absolute values of u sub 0 is characterized quantitatively, along with the global structure of all such surfaces...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the ASEP and the stochastic six vertex model started with step initial data. After a long time, $T$, {{it is known}} that the one-point height function fluctuations for these systems are of order $T^{ 1 / 3 }$. We prove the KPZ prediction of $T^{ 2 / 3 }$ scaling in space. Namely, we prove tightness (and Brownian absolute continuity of all subsequential limits) as $T$ goes to infinity of the height function with spatial coordinate scaled by $T^{ 2 / 3 }$ and fluctuations scaled by $T^{ 1 / 3 }$. The starting point for proving these results is a connection discovered recently by Borodin-Bufetov-Wheeler between the stochastic six <b>vertex</b> <b>height</b> function and the Hall-Littlewood process (a certain measure on plane partitions). Interpreting this process as a line ensemble with a Gibbsian resampling invariance, we show that the one-point tightness of the top curve can be propagated to the tightness of the entire curve.

40|$|Architectural {{design is}} leading {{us in the}} {{direction}} of structures with free and irregular forms. As a consequence of this the connection between the design’s intent and its fabrication represents a challenge when creating a support structure that is geometrically viable and which needs to possess certain aesthetic, fabricational, thermal and strength requirements. To ensure the contacts of the edges of the neighboring insulation panels along their thicknesses, the edges must be cut at different angles, which causes differences in the <b>vertex</b> <b>heights</b> and, furthermore, differences in the positions of the inner metal sheets of the insulation panels. The main goal of the presented research is the development of a post-optimization procedure, by which the minimum joint-height differences will be achieved for all the joints, taking into account all the free-form surfaces of the individual architectural design. To compensate for the residual height differences the use of spacers of different thicknesses is proposed. The paper considers the global minimization of the joint-height differences for a sample free-form architectural design that is meshed with a quad-dominant mesh...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} direct method for {{incrementally}} estimat-ing a regular-grid ground surface map from stereo image sequences captured by nearly front-looking stereo cameras, taking illumination changes on all images into considera-tion. At each frame, we simultaneously estimate a camera motion and <b>vertex</b> <b>heights</b> {{of the regular}} mesh, composed of piecewise triangular patches, drawn on a level plane in the ground coordinate system, by minimizing a cost repre-senting the differences of the photometrically transformed pixel values in homography-related projective triangular patches over three image pairs in a two-frame stereo im-age sequence. The data term is formulated by the Inverse Compositional trick for high computational efficiency. The main difficulty of the problem formulation lies in the insta-bility of the height estimation for the vertices distant from the cameras. We first develop a stereo ground surface re-construction method where the stability is effectively im-proved by the combinational use of three complementary techniques, {{the use of a}} smoothness term, update constraint term, and a hierarchical meshing approach. Then we ex-tend the stereo method for incremental ground surface map generation. The validity of the proposed method is demon-strated through experiments using real images. 1...|$|R
40|$|Adinkras and arithmetical graphs have {{divergent}} origins. In {{the spirit}} of Feynman diagrams, adinkras encode representations of supersymmetry algebras as graphs with additional structures. Arithmetical graphs, on the other hand, arise in algebraic geometry, and give an arithmetical structure to a graph. In this thesis, we will interpret adinkras as arithmetical graphs and see what can be learned. Our work consists of three main strands. First, we investigate arithmetical structures on the underlying graph of an adinkra in the specific case where the underlying graph is a hypercube. We classify all such arithmetical structures and compute some of the corresponding volumes and linear ranks. Second, we {{consider the case of}} a reduced arithmetical graph structure on the hypercube and explore the wealth of relationships that exist between its linear rank and several notions of genus that appear in the literature on graph theory and adinkras. Third, we study modifications of the definition of an arithmetical graph that incorporate some of the properties of an adinkra, such as the <b>vertex</b> <b>height</b> assignment or the edge dashing. To this end, we introduce the directed arithmetical graph and the dashed arithmetical graph. We then explore properties of these modifications in an attempt to see if our definitions make sense, answering questions such as whether the volume is still an integer and whether there are still only finitely many arithmetical structures on a given graph...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} a {{smartphone app}} (TRESTIMA(TM)) for forest sample plot measurements. The app interprets imagery {{collected from the}} sample plots using the camera in the smartphone and then estimates forest inventory attributes, including species-specific basal areas (G) {{as well as the}} diameter (D-gM) and height (H-gM) of basal area median trees. The estimates from the smartphone app were compared to forest inventory attributes derived from tree-wise measurements using calipers and a <b>Vertex</b> <b>height</b> measurement device. The data consist of 2169 measured trees from 25 sample plots (32 m x 32 m), dominated by Scots pine and Norway spruce from southern Finland. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) in the basal area varied from 19. 7 % to 29. 3 % and the biases from 11. 4 % to 18. 4 % depending on the number of images per sample plot and image shooting location. D-gM measurement bias varied from - 1. 4 % to 3. 1 % and RMSE from 5. 2 % to 11. 6 % depending on the tree species. Respectively, H-gM bias varied from 5. 0 % to 8. 3 % and RMSE 10. 0 % to 13. 6 %. In general, four images captured {{toward the center of the}} plot provided more accurate results than four images captured away from the plot center. Increasing the number of captured images per plot to the analyses yielded only marginal improvement to the results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Arachidonic acid (AA) is a {{fatty acid}} that is impor-tant for visual and brain {{development}} and is commonly added as a functional food ingredient to commercial infant formulas worldwide. However, {{few studies have}} examined whether AA supplementation during neonatal life has an effect on neuronal abnormalities. In the present study, the effect of dietary AA supplementation in dams during gestation and lactation was investigated by examining N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) -induced cerebellar hypoplasia in young Lewis rats. Dams were fed a 2. 0 % AA diet or a basal diet (< 0. 01 % AA). At birth (postnatal day 0), male and female pups received a single intraperitoneal injection of 35 mg/kg MNU or vehicle. Brain weights were measured and a morphological analysis of macroscopic and histological specimens was conducted after 7, 14, 21, 28 and 60 days. Irrespective of whether the rats had been fed an AA diet, the brain weights of the MNU-treated rats, particularly the weights of the cerebellum, were decreased compared with those of the MNU-untreated rats from the 14 th day following the MNU injection. Macroscopic reductions in the cerebellar length and/or width and histologically observed reductions in cerebellar <b>vertex</b> <b>height</b> and/or cortex width were also detected in the MNU-treated rats, irrespective of whether the rats had been fed with AA. Histopathologically, the MNU-treated rats (irrespective of AA supplementation) exhibited disorganization of the cerebellar cortex and disar-rangement of the cortical layers (loss and/or disturbance of the molecular, Purkinje and granular cell layers). There {{were no significant differences in}} any parameters among the MNU-treated rats, irrespective of whether the rats had been fed an AA diet. In conclusion, an AA-rich diet for dams during gestation and lactation did not modify MNU-induced cerebellar hypoplasia in their offspring...|$|E

Since automotive sensors should have a selftest, small heating resistors have been placed between the pixels, made out of poly-silicon. An ASIC for signal conditioning, which was developed by the FhG Dresden (IMS 2), has been built in the use TO 5 -package (hybrid), comprising a multiplexer, an amplifier, a temperature sensor and control unit. Heimann has produced some samples and delivered them to Bosch. As customers demanded a storage temperature of maximal 125 C, the planned PE-Fresnel-lens has {{to be replaced by a}} crystal lens. A cost-effective solution would be a micromachined, refractive Silicon lens. The technology to produce small lenses with a diameter up to 0. 5 mm on a Si-wafer already exists at Bosch. The process has to be developed for bigger diameters and <b>vertex</b> <b>heights.</b> Now diameters up to 5 mm and heights till 400 #mu#m are feasible. The normally used Si-window of the detector can be replaced by the lens. The start of the production of the system will be in 1999. (orig.)

50|$|The <b>height</b> of a <b>vertex</b> in a rooted tree is {{the length}} of the longest {{downward}} path to a leaf from that <b>vertex.</b> The <b>height</b> of the tree is the height of the root. The depth of a vertex is {{the length of}} the path to its root (root path). This is commonly needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, AVL trees in particular. The root has depth zero, leaves have height zero, and a tree with only a single vertex (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no vertices, if such are allowed) has depth and height −1.|$|R

The visualization of graph pyramids facilitates studies about their structure, such as their <b>vertex</b> distribution or <b>height</b> in relation of a specific input image. Thus, a researcher can debug algorithms and ask for statistical information. Furthermore, it improves the better understanding of contraction processes or the role of vertex and edge attributes.

40|$|The {{labor force}} of the younger men in Japan has been {{centered}} in urban regions for these several years. Consequently in the rural regions, {{the role of the}} older people there is becoming important more and more, and their labor force should be re-evaluated in the present time. Thus, these investigations were made on some physiological functions of the forty years and older aged people in an agricultural distirct. Standing height, body weight, chest circumference, sitting <b>vertex</b> <b>height,</b> back muscular power and vital capacity of aging people have a tendency to decrease with age and those in male have larger values than those in female. Especially in back muscular power the declining rate of men is more remarkable than that of women. In arm circumference there is no great difference between right and left, between sexes and among the four age groups. Comparing the present data in the rural population to the Japanese average value, the former was neither taller nor heavier, smaller in muscularity, skeletal development or fatness. Hand grip pressure decreases with age in both men and women and has difference between right and left, and sexes. This tendency is in accordance with the report of SCHWARZ 11) et al. The mean systolic blood pressure rises with age until 79 years but mean diastolic blood pressures do scarcely vary or slightly decrease. This fact is similar to the report of LASSER 18) and MASTER with 80, 000 normal subjects. F. E. V. 1. 0 % has no difference between sexes, and, in male, it decreases with age. All the values are in the range 70 - 80 %. NAKAMURA 21) TAKIJIMA state in their report that F. E. V. 1. 0 % shows decreasing tendency with age and the normal value is over 70 %. Hearing deficiency in high pitched tone increases remarkably with age, and the visual acuity of aging people is as follows...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{algorithm}} decomposes the tree {{into a number of}} disjoint paths. In the second stage of the algorithm, each path is extended and therefore the resulting paths will not be mutually exclusive. In the {{first stage of}} the algorithm, each path is associated with an array of size h' [...] We extend this path by adding the h' [...] immediate ancestors {{at the top of the}} path in the same array. This will extend each array twice its original size at most which will result in 2n total number of nodes in all the ladders. Notice that the number of ladders is not changed and each node's ladder remains the same. Although a node v can be listed in multiple paths now but its ladder is the one that was associated to v in the first stage of the algorithm. These two stages can be processes in O(n) but the query time is not constant yet. Consider a level ancestor query on a node u of height h. By travelling to the top of u's ladder, a <b>vertex</b> of <b>height</b> at least 2h will be reached. Observe that all the nodes have a height of at least 1 and therefore after doing this i times, we reach a node of height at least 2i and therefore we need to do this at most log n times. This gives us a query time of O(log n).|$|R
