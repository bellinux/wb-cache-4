40|$|Agroforestry {{systems and}} tree cover on {{agricultural}} land make {{an important contribution}} to climate change mitigation, but are not systematically accounted for in either global carbon budgets or national carbon accounting. This paper assesses the role of trees on agricultural land and their significance for carbon sequestration at a global level, along with recent change trends. Remote sensing data show that in 2010, 43 % of all agricultural land globally had at least 10 % tree cover and that this has increased by 2 % over the previous ten years. Combining geographically and bioclimatically stratified Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 default estimates of carbon storage with this tree cover analysis, we estimated 45. 3 [*]PgC on agricultural land globally, with trees contributing > 75 %. Between 2000 and 2010 tree cover increased by 3. 7 %, resulting in an increase of > 2 [*]PgC (or 4. 6 %) of biomass carbon. On average, globally, biomass carbon increased from 20. 4 to 21. 4 [*]tC ha− 1. Regional and country-level <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> and trends were mapped and tabulated globally, and for all countries. Brazil, Indonesia, China and India had the largest increases in biomass carbon stored on agricultural land, while Argentina, Myanmar, and Sierra Leone had the largest decreases. Peer Revie...|$|E
40|$|In the Indo-Pacific region, rivers are {{inhabited}} by amphidromous gobies. They are often {{subjected to a}} heavy fishing pressure, highlighting the urgent need to acquire knowledge on their biology for management purposes. This study investigated the reproductive strategy of Sicyopterus lagocephalus, a widespread amphidromous goby, in two rivers of La Réunion Island. Histological observations of ovarian samples and oocyte-size frequency distributions revealed that females had a group-synchronous ovarian follicle development (i. e., two cohorts of oocytes were distinguished simultaneously in ovaries). Females laid an entire clutch in a unique event (from 14, 304 to 232, 475 eggs) and then another batch of oocytes was recruited, showing that the annual fecundity is indeterminate. Ovarian growth was isometric at all oocyte development stages showing that the gonadosomatic index (GSI) is a good proxy of reproductive condition. The main reproductive season of S. lagocephalus spanned from early February to May with a narrower range upstream and a wider one downstream. Reproduction activity is mainly restricted by water temperatures in upstream areas, whereas it is likely influenced by female body condition and competition in downstream areas. The variability of reproductive traits leads to size structure <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> of spawning females throughout the yea...|$|E

Seasonal <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> and production rates of heterotrophic bacteria and phototrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton and nanoflagellates was investigated in the upper 50 m of the highlatitude Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, during six field campaigns between March and December 2006. Heterotrophic bacteria, picoplankton and nanoflagellates contributed to ecosystem structure and function in all seasons. Activity within the microbial food web peaked during spring bloom in April, parallel to low abundances of mesozooplankton. In the nutrient-limited post-bloom scenario, an efficient microbial loop, fuelled by dissolved organic carbon from abundant mesozooplankton feeding on phytoplankton and protozooplankton, facilitated maximum integrated primary production rates. A tight microbial food web consisting of heterotrophic bacteria and phototrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton and nanoflagellates was found in the stratified water masses encountered in July and September. Microbial stocks and rates were low but persistent under winter conditions. Seasonal comparisons of microbial biomass and production revealed that structure and function of the microbial food web were fundamentally different during the spring bloom when compared with other seasons. While the microbial food web was in a regenerative mode most of the time, during the spring bloom, a microbial transfer mode represented a trophic link for organic carbon in time and space.

40|$|Abstract. Size {{and book}} to market ratio are both highly {{correlated}} with the average returns of common stocks. Fama and French (1993) argue that these effects are proxies for factors of risk. In this study, we try to test the three factor model of Fama and French and the Capital Asset Pricing Model on French Stock Market.

Our {{results show that the}} three factor model explains better the common <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> returns than the capital asset pricing model. Moreover, both the CAPM and the three factor model do a good job in explaining the cross section of stock returns.

However, only the value-weight market portfolio can explain the cross-section <b>in</b> the <b>stock</b> returns.
