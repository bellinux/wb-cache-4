5|$|While {{employing}} anekāntavāda, the 17th century Jain scholar Yasovijaya {{stated that}} it is not anābhigrahika (indiscriminate attachment to all <b>views</b> <b>as</b> being true), which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism. In Jain belief, anekāntavāda transcends the various traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism.|$|E

5|$|For {{her role}} in the film Sophie's Choice (1982), Streep spoke both English and German with a Polish accent, as well as Polish itself. In The Iron Lady, she {{reproduced}} the vocal style of Margaret Thatcher from the time before Thatcher became Britain's Prime Minister, and after she had taken elocution lessons to change her pitch, pronunciation, and delivery. Streep has commented that using accents as part of her acting is a technique she <b>views</b> <b>as</b> an obvious requirement in her portrayal of a character.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing <b>views</b> <b>as</b> {{to whether}} the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that {{the position of the}} police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Rutherford {{published}} a systematic reinterpretation {{of the book}} of Revelation. Many of the symbols recorded in the book were applied to events following 1918, specifically to Watch Tower conventions held in the years 1922 through 1928. These reinterpretations reflected both a wholesale rejection of his own earlier <b>views</b> <b>as</b> well as the historicist interpretations of Pastor Russell.|$|E

5|$|In January 1950, Douglas opened {{campaign}} headquarters in Los Angeles and San Francisco, which {{was seen as}} a signal that she was serious about contesting Downey's seat and would not withdraw from the race. Downey challenged Douglas to a series of debates; Douglas, who was not a good debater, declined. The two candidates traded charges via press and radio, with Downey describing Douglas's <b>views</b> <b>as</b> extremist.|$|E
5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she <b>views</b> <b>as</b> the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux.|$|E
5|$|New Thought and Christian Science {{differed}} in that Eddy saw her <b>views</b> <b>as</b> {{a unique and}} final revelation. Eddy's idea of malicious animal magnetism marked another distinction (that people can be harmed by the bad thoughts of others), introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or materia medica, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.|$|E

2500|$|A central {{element in}} the Christology {{presented}} in the Acts of the Apostles is the affirmation of {{the belief that the}} death of Jesus by crucifixion happened [...] "with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan".

5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on religion is misguided, and that faith in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he <b>views</b> <b>as</b> the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism. The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E
5|$|Produced on {{a budget}} of 120 million, Anbe Sivam takes on several themes, {{including}} communism, atheism, and altruism, and depicts Kamal's <b>views</b> <b>as</b> a humanist. The film was released on 15 January 2003 to positive reviews from critics, but it underperformed at the box office. However, it is now regarded as a classic and a cult film in Tamil cinema.|$|E

50|$|Bourgueticrinida, the sea lilies, has {{traditionally}} been <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> an order of Articulata and a sister taxon to Comatulida. A study published in 2011 suggested {{that it should be}} renamed Bourgueticrinina and <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a suborder of Comatulida.|$|R

5|$|While {{waiting for}} the Convention to {{formally}} begin, James Madison sketched out his initial draft, which {{became known as the}} Virginia Plan and reflected his <b>views</b> <b>as</b> a strong nationalist. By the time the rest of the Virginia delegation arrived, most of the Pennsylvania delegation had arrived as well. They agreed on Madison's plan, and formed what came to be the predominant coalition. By the time the Convention started, the only blueprints that had been assembled were Madison's Virginia Plan, and Charles Pinckney's plan. As Pinckney didn't have a coalition behind his plan, Madison's plan was the starting point for deliberations.|$|E
5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the environment that his friends are exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them. The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb and Fricker were out walking. Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are able to share in a common view on life. The poem describes Coleridge's loneliness and solitude throughout, yet he is glad that his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which he <b>views</b> <b>as</b> merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern <b>views</b> <b>as</b> to {{who won the}} battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the battle as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence and desire to capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland as a very costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E
50|$|Federation Council is <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a {{more formal}} chamber of the Federal Assembly. Because of its federalist design, {{as well as its}} voting {{franchise}} strictly limited to provincial elites, the Council is <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> less volatile to radical changes.|$|R
