5000|$|Most modern {{antivirus}} programs {{try to find}} virus-patterns inside ordinary {{programs by}} scanning them for so-called virus signatures.

50|$|Rabies {{was once}} {{rare in the}} United States outside the Southern states, but {{raccoons}} in the mid-Atlantic and northeast United States have been suffering from a rabies epidemic since the 1970s, that is now moving westwards into Ohio. Most westward expansion has been prevented via the action of Oral Rabies Vaccination (ORV) programs. The particular <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> has been identified in the southeastern United States raccoon population since the 1950s, and {{is believed to have}} traveled to the northeast as the result of infected raccoons being among those caught and transported from the southeast to the northeast by human hunters attempting to replenish the declining northeast raccoon population. As a result, urban residents of these areas have become more wary of the large but normally unseen urban raccoon population. Whether as a result of increased vigilance or only the common human avoidance reaction to any other animal not normally seen, such as a raccoon, there has only been one documented human rabies case {{as a result of this}} variant. This does not include, however, the greatly increasing rate of prophylactic rabies treatments in cases of possible exposure, which numbered fewer than one hundred humans annually in the state of New York before 1990, for instance, but rose to approximately ten thousand annually between 1990 and 1995. At approximately $1,500 per course of treatment, this represents a considerable public health expenditure. Raccoons do constitute approximately 50% of the approximately eight thousand documented non-human rabies cases in the United States. Domestic animals constitute only 8% of rabies cases, but are increasing at a rapid rate.|$|E

40|$|The largest {{documented}} {{outbreak of}} Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease {{occurred in the}} Indian Ocean islands and India during 2004 – 2007.

40|$|Taura {{syndrome}} (TS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating diseases affecting the shrimp farming industry worldwide. The causative virus, Taura syndrome virus (TSV), has been identified. My work is centred on the development of monoclonal antibodies against TSV. I have also characterized a novel <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> from Venezuela and evaluated the effect of hyperthermia on TSV infection. This work has resulted in 3 manuscripts, which constitute the core of this dissertation. The taxonomy throughout this dissertation is done according to Holthuis (1980). The first manuscript describes the production of a monoclonal antibody reacting with the Belize strain of TSV. The antibody, MAb 2 C 4, exhibits good sensitivity and specificity for TSV in immunohistochemistry (IHC) and dot blot immunoassay. MAb 2 C 4 reacted with the TSV-HI 94, TSV-SI 98 and TSV-BZ 02 variants, but not with the TSV-VE 05 and TSV-TH 05 variants. This antibody adds and improves tools to those available for TSV diagnosis. Chapter three describes a relatively novel variant of TSV from Venezuela, which was characterized by our laboratory. By genetic sequencing, this new isolate exhibits a 94 % similarity with TSV-HI 94. IHC, dot blot immunoassay and bioassays were also performed. While processed samples reacted only weakly with the TSV monoclonal antibody MAb 1 A 1, the virus in its native state reacted strongly with the antibody. In bioassays, TSV-VE 05 presented mortality comparable to TSV-HI 94 in Penaeus vannamei. These data confirm the presence of TSV in Venezuela and that a new <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> was responsible for the outbreak of TS. In chapter four, the behavior of TSV infection under hyperthermic conditions was examined. I compared the susceptibility of Kona stock P. vannamei to the infection by two variants of TSV under hyperthermic conditions (32 oC). Shrimp, infected with TSV-HI 94, were resistant to infection at high temperature. However, under the same hyperthermic conditions, the challenged shrimp were fully susceptible to the infection by TSV-BZ 02. This susceptibility to TSV-BZ 02 at higher temperatures was independent both of the route of infection and of the salinity of water.

Because of this difference in {{the resistance of the}} papilloma cells {{of domestic}} rabbits in vivo and the virus of cottontail rabbit papillomas in vitro, it has been concluded that the x-rays cause papillomas to regress by affecting the cells, not the virus (2, 3).

40|$|BACKGROUND: We cannot {{predict when}} an {{influenza}} pandemic will occur or which <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> will cause it. Little information is currently {{available on the}} ability of laboratories to detect and subtype influenza viruses including the avian influenza viruses. OBJECTIVES: To assess the ability of laboratories to detect and subtype influenza viruses. STUDY DESIGN: In 2006 QCMD distributed an External Quality Assessment panel for the molecular detection and haemagglutinin subtyping of influenza viruses to 87 laboratories in 34 countries Worldwide, which were given 6 weeks to return results. These data were analysed to assess laboratory performance. RESULTS: Influenza virus positive panel samples were correctly identified by 35 - 98 % of laboratories. The correct haemagglutinin subtype was reported by 32 - 87 % of laboratories that detected the virus: incorrect subtyping results included the reporting of avian influenza viruses as human strains and vice versa. Twelve laboratories reported false positives with some avian influenza viruses reported. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that improvements are needed in the molecular detection of influenza viruses and influenza virus A haemagglutinin subtyping. Only rapid and accurate identification of circulating pandemic influenza virus will ensure that the maximum time is available for intervention. (aut. ref. ...|$|E

A new <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> E 1 -A 226 V caused a large outbreak in the Indian Ocean islands and India from 2004 – 2007.

The viral agent causing the two outbreaks was inferred {{to be the new}} E 1 -A 226 V variant and Yangjiang CHIKV might be introduced from Dongguan. To confirm the hypothesis and determine the origin of CHIKV causing the outbreaks, we described Yangjiang outbreak in this study, and the molecular characterization of CHIKV from Yangjiang and Dongguang outbreaks were analyzed. Results: 27 clinical cases of CHIK fever were reported in outbreak in Yangjiang region.
