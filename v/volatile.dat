40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that <b>volatiles</b> emitted by herbivore-damaged plants can cause responses in downwind undamaged neighboring plants, {{such as the}} attraction of carnivorous enemies of herbivores. One of the open questions is whether this involves an active (production of <b>volatiles)</b> or passive (adsorption of <b>volatiles)</b> response of the uninfested downwind plant. This issue is addressed in the present study. Uninfested lima bean leaves that were exposed to <b>volatiles</b> from conspecific leaves infested with the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, emitted very similar blends of <b>volatiles</b> to those emitted from infested leaves themselves. Treating leaves with a protein-synthesis inhibitor prior to infesting them with spider mites completely suppressed the production of herbivore-induced <b>volatiles</b> in the infested leaves. Conversely, inhibitor treatment to uninfested leaves prior to exposure to <b>volatiles</b> from infested leaves {{did not affect the}} emission of <b>volatiles</b> from the exposed, uninfested leaves. This evidence supports the hypothesis that response of the exposed downwind plant is passive. T. urticae-infested leaves that had been previously exposed to <b>volatiles</b> from infested leaves emitted more herbivore-induced <b>volatiles</b> than T. urticae-infested leaves previously exposed to <b>volatiles</b> from uninfested leaves. The former leaves were also more attractive to the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, than the latter. This shows that previous exposure of plants to <b>volatiles</b> from herbivore-infested neighbors results in a stronger response of plants in terms of predator attraction when herbivores damage the plant. This supports the hypothesis that the downwind uninfested plant is actively involved. Both adsorption and production of <b>volatiles</b> can mediate the attraction of carnivorous mites to plants that have been exposed to <b>volatiles</b> from infested neighbors...|$|R

5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a <b>volatile</b> tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more <b>volatile</b> than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>volatiles</b> related to feeding {{activity}} of nonprey caterpillars, Spodoptera exigua, on the olfactory {{response of the}} predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis was examined in a Y-tube olfactometer. At a low caterpillar density (20 caterpillars on 10 Lima bean leaves), the predators were significantly more attracted to <b>volatiles</b> from infested leaves on which the caterpillars and their products were present or from infested leaves from which the caterpillars and their products had been removed when compared to <b>volatiles</b> from uninfested leaves. The predators, however, significantly avoided odors from 20 caterpillars and their products (mainly feces) removed from bean leaves. In contrast, at a higher caterpillar density (100 caterpillars on 10 Lima bean leaves), the predators avoided <b>volatiles</b> from caterpillar-infested bean leaves. <b>Volatiles</b> from infested leaves from which the caterpillars and their products had been removed were not preferred over <b>volatiles</b> from uninfested leaves. <b>Volatiles</b> from feces collected from 100 caterpillars were strongly avoided by the predators, while {{the behavior of the}} predatory mites was not affected by <b>volatiles</b> from 100 caterpillars removed from a plant. The data show that carnivorous arthropods may avoid nonprofitable herbivores. This avoidance seems to result from an interference of <b>volatiles</b> from herbivore products with the attraction to herbivore- induced plant <b>volatiles...</b>|$|R
