In diagnostic imaging, heavy metals such as cobalt or tungsten {{make up the}} anode materials found in x-ray tubes. In electron microscopy, heavy metals such as lead, gold, palladium, platinum, or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by staining, negative staining, or <b>vacuum</b> <b>deposition.</b> In nuclear science, nuclei of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce superheavy elements; heavy metals are also employed as spallation targets {{for the production of}} neutrons or radioisotopes such as astatine (using lead, bismuth, thorium, or uranium in the latter case).|$|E

25|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>deposition</b> {{is not a}} {{suitable}} method for forming thin films of polymers. However, polymers can be processed in solution, and spin coating is a common method of depositing thin polymer films. This method is more suited to forming large-area films than thermal evaporation. No vacuum is required, and the emissive materials can also be applied on the substrate by a technique derived from commercial inkjet printing. However, as the application of subsequent layers tends to dissolve those already present, formation of multilayer structures is difficult with these methods.

Glow- and arc {{discharges}} are compared {{with each other}} as well as vacuum- and arc discharges under ambient conditions. The processes taking place around the cathode spots are described in detail. The main industrial applications of the <b>vacuum</b> arc <b>deposition</b> method are the prepn. and growth of thin films of hard materials, like TiN, TiC, Ti(C,N), Ti(Al,N), and CrNx. The different exptl. setups are depicted, and the process conditions {{are related to the}} microstructure of the coatings. It is distinguished between <b>vacuum</b> arc <b>deposition</b> with a pulsed high-current arc and <b>vacuum</b> arc <b>deposition</b> using particle filters. Lamellar filters are applied as well as plasma filters in a curved magnetic field. Furthermore, the laser arc technol. is mentioned. Finally, the <b>vacuum</b> arc <b>deposition</b> is juxtaposed to magnetron sputtering...|$|R
50|$|When {{deposition}} {{occurs at}} a high temperature or involves corrosive gases, a specially designed deposition chamber is used; it is isolated from the microscope, and the beam is introduced into it through a micrometre-sized orifice.

25|$|Some {{of these}} techniques, such as ninhydrin, {{diazafluorenone}} and <b>vacuum</b> metal <b>deposition,</b> show great sensitivity {{and are used}} operationally. Some fingerprint reagents are specific, for example ninhydrin or diazafluorenone reacting with amino acids. Others such as ethyl cyanoacrylate polymerisation, work apparently by water-based catalysis and polymer growth. <b>Vacuum</b> metal <b>deposition</b> using gold and zinc {{has been shown to}} be non-specific, but can detect fat layers as thin as one molecule.|$|R

25|$|The {{production}} of small molecule devices and displays usually involves thermal evaporation in a vacuum. This makes {{the production process}} more expensive and of limited use for large-area devices, than other processing techniques. However, contrary to polymer-based devices, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>deposition</b> process enables the formation of well controlled, homogeneous films, {{and the construction of}} very complex multi-layer structures. This high flexibility in layer design, enabling distinct charge transport and charge blocking layers to be formed, is the main reason for the high efficiencies of the small molecule OLEDs.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} ways of achieving the nanoscale Pt on carbon powder, {{which is currently}} the best option, are through <b>vacuum</b> <b>deposition,</b> sputtering, and electrodeposition. The platinum particles are deposited onto carbon paper that is permeated with PTFE. However, there is an optimal thinness to this catalyst layer, which limits the lower cost limit. Below 4nm, Pt will form islands on the paper, limiting its activity. Above this thickness, the Pt will coat the carbon and be an effective catalyst. To further complicate things, Nafion cannot be infiltrated beyond 10um, so using more Pt than this is an unnecessary expense. Thus the amount {{and shape of the}} catalyst is limited by the constraints of other materials.|$|E

25|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>deposition</b> {{began with}} {{the study of the}} {{sputtering}} phenomenon during the 1920s and 1930s, which was a common problem in lighting in which metal ejected from the electrodes coated the glass, blocking output. However, turning sputtering into a reliable method of coating a mirror did not occur until the invention of semiconductors in the 1970s. Evaporation coating was pioneered by John Strong in 1912. Aluminum was a desirable material for mirrors, but was too dangerous to apply with electroplating. Strong used evaporation coating to make the first aluminum telescope mirrors in the 1930s. The first dielectric mirror was created in 1937 by Auwarter using evaporated rhodium, while the first metallic mirror to be enhanced with a dielectric coating of silicon dioxide was created by Hass the same year. In 1939 at the Schott Glass company, Walter Geffcken invented the first dielectric mirrors to use multilayer coatings (stacks).|$|E
2500|$|Thin film {{resistors}} {{are made}} by sputtering (a method of <b>vacuum</b> <b>deposition)</b> the resistive material onto an insulating substrate. [...] The film is then etched {{in a similar manner}} to the old (subtractive) process for making printed circuit boards; that is, the surface is coated with a photo-sensitive material, then covered by a pattern film, irradiated with ultraviolet light, and then the exposed photo-sensitive coating is developed, and underlying thin film is etched away.|$|E

The deposition method was not yet known, and the proposals by Noyce included <b>vacuum</b> <b>deposition</b> of aluminium through a mask and deposition of a continuous layer, followed by photolithography and etching off the excess metal. According to Saxena, the patent by Noyce, with all its drawbacks, accurately reflects the fundamentals of the modern IC technologies.|$|E
40|$|Films of the {{molecular}} nanomagnet Mn 12 ac with thicknesses spanning the nm to mm range have been deposited using a customised <b>vacuum</b> spray <b>deposition</b> technique.

The authors have studied the influence of the ion energy on the elastic modulus determined by an ultrasonic method, and have measured the optical gap for films with the highest sp{sup 3 } content they have obtained so far with this deposition technique.

2500|$|In some applications, {{generally}} {{those that}} are cost-sensitive or that require great durability, mirrors are made from a single, bulk material such as polished metal. For technical applications such as laser mirrors, the reflective coating is typically applied by <b>vacuum</b> <b>deposition</b> on the front surface of the substrate. This eliminates refraction and double reflections, also called [...] "ghost reflections" [...] (a weak reflection {{from the surface of}} the glass, and a stronger one from the reflecting metal), and reduces absorption of light by the mirror. Technical mirrors may use a silver, aluminium, or gold coating (the latter typically for infrared mirrors), and achieve reflectivities of 90–95% when new. A protective transparent overcoat may be applied to prevent oxidation of the reflective layer. Applications requiring higher reflectivity or greater durability, where wide bandwidth is not essential, use dielectric coatings, which can achieve reflectivities as high as 99.999% over a narrow range of wavelengths.|$|E

The organic thin films were sandwiched between an electron-injection electrode (Al or In) and a hole-injection electrode (Au, Indium-Tin-Oxide, CuI, or poly(3 -methylthiophene) film).

By use of this electrode, the threshold voltage for emission markedly lowered.

As a result, the practical realized heat transfer coefficient (HTC) was increased from 50 W/m 2 K for common cooling drums up to 1000 W/m 2 K. The demonstrated heat transfer coefficients describe a distinctive performance increase compared to known state of the art.

50|$|Another type of coating called parylene {{is applied}} with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>deposition</b> process versus a spray or needle application. The parylene is applied at the {{molecular}} level by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>deposition</b> process at ambient temperature. Film coatings from 0.100 to 76 μm can be easily applied in a single operation. The advantage of parylene coatings is that they cover hidden surfaces and other areas where spray and needle application are not possible. Coating thickness is very uniform, even on irregular surfaces. The three main disadvantages are that (i) any desired contact points such as battery contacts or connectors must be carefully covered with an air-tight mask to prevent the parylene from coating the contacts, (ii) it is a batch process and does not lend itself to high volume processing, and (iii) the cost per PCB can be highly prohibitive due to the capital investment costs and the cost per batch.|$|E
