500|$|The {{return of}} {{refugees}} has been hampered by several obstacles. These include property ownership and accommodation, as Croat refugees settled in vacated homes, and Croatian war-time legislation that stripped the refugees once living in government-owned housing of their tenancy rights. The legislation was abolished following the war, and alternative accommodation is offered to returnees. 6,538 housing units were allocated by November 2010. Another obstacle is the difficulty for refugees to obtain residency status or Croatian citizenship. Applicable legislation has been relaxed since, and by November 2010, Croatia allowed the validation of identity documents {{issued by the}} RSK. Even though Croatia declared a general amnesty, refugees fear legal prosecution, as the amnesty does not pertain to war crimes. [...] The final obstacle to the return of refugees {{is the lack of}} <b>vocational</b> <b>opportunities</b> due to the poor economic situation in Croatia.|$|E
500|$|Language and {{literacy}} have far reaching effects as they facilitate self-expression and social interaction {{in a variety}} of settings. Furthermore, literacy fosters independence by providing access to educational and <b>vocational</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Children whose disabilities require AAC often experience developmental delays in language skills such as vocabulary knowledge, length of sentences, syntax, and impaired pragmatic skills. These delays may be {{due in part to the}} fact that expressive language is limited by more than the children's own language knowledge. Unlike speaking children, children who use AAC do not always have access to their AAC system, and don't select the content available on the device. These external characteristics may impact language learning opportunities. Most children in this category do not achieve literacy skills beyond that of a typically developing 7–8 year old. [...] Cognitive, language and learning delays contribute to difficulty with literacy development, but environmental factors also play a role. The most literate AAC users often report having access to abundant reading and writing material at home as well as in school during childhood. Studies have shown that many children who use AAC have literacy experiences that are reduced quality, quantity, and opportunity at home and at school as compared to children without disabilities. Research suggests that with explicit reading instruction, AAC users can develop good literacy skills.|$|E

5000|$|The {{economic}} recovery {{experienced by the}} state of Georgia in the 1950s brought with it a more diversified array of <b>vocational</b> <b>opportunity</b> to the region. This diversity created a healthy demand for workers with a liberal arts education as well as workers with various technical skill sets. [...] Gainesville State College, established on March 11, 1964, was intended to satisfy this demand. It was first a community college formally known as Gainesville Junior College. In the fall of 1966 classes officially began at Gainesville Junior College; 419 students were enrolled in the school during its first semester. For the first year of its existence the college did not have its own campus. Instead it held classes at the Gainesville Civic Center and the First Baptists Church of Gainesville. In 1967, through a $2 million bond issue, Hall County and the city of Gainesville constructed facilities for the school at what is now its present location near I-85 on the outskirts of Oakwood.|$|R
