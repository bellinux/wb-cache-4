5|$|In 1890, Goebel was a {{delegate}} to Kentucky's fourth constitutional convention, which produced the current Kentucky Constitution. Despite the high honor of being chosen as {{a delegate}}, Goebel showed {{little interest in}} participating {{in the process of}} creating a new constitution. The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure the inclusion of the Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular <b>vote.</b> <b>This</b> would effectively protect the Commission from ever being unilaterally dismantled by the General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Menem ran for Governor of La Rioja in August 2007, but was defeated. He {{finished}} {{in third place}} with about 22% of the <b>vote.</b> <b>This</b> {{was viewed as a}} catastrophic defeat, signaling the end of his political dominance in La Rioja. It {{was the first time in}} 30 years that Menem had lost an election. Following this defeat in his home province, he withdrew his candidacy for president. At the end of 2009 he announced that he intended to run for the presidency again in the 2011 elections. but ran for a new term as senator instead.|$|E
5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} what {{evidence}} the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg, decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative <b>vote.</b> <b>This</b> might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.|$|E

5|$|Derek da Cunha has {{proposed}} that the law of large numbers favours the GRC system. According to the theory, {{the large number of}} voters from GRC wards generally, though not necessarily always, reflects the popular <b>vote.</b> <b>This</b> was evident at the 2006 elections, at which the PAP garnered an average of 67.04% of the votes in a contested GRC, while the average was 61.67% for a SMC ward. The national average for the 2006 elections was 66.6%. Similar trends can be seen from previous elections. In fact, the percentage difference in the PAP votes between SMCs and GRCs grew from 3% in 1991, and remained stable at around 5% in the 1997, 2001 and 2006 elections. This may be attributable to the enlargement of the size of GRCs in 1997 which gave greater effect to the law of large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{millions}} of returning soldiers were still {{not entitled to}} <b>vote.</b> <b>This</b> posed another dilemma for politicians since they could {{be seen to be}} withholding the vote from the very men who had just fought to preserve the British democratic political system. The Representation of the People Act 1918 attempted to solve the problem, enfranchising all adult males {{as long as they were}} over 21 years old and were resident householders. It also gave the vote to women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. The enfranchisement of this latter group was accepted as recognition of the contribution made by women defence workers, though the actual feelings of members of parliament (MPs) at the time is questioned. In the same year the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 allowed women over 21 to stand as MPs.|$|E
5|$|The party gained over 7% in four constituencies. Much media {{attention}} {{was focused on}} the seat of Putney, where Goldsmith had stood as the Referendum candidate against incumbent Conservative MP David Mellor; Goldsmith secured 3.5% of the local vote and the seat was won by the Labour candidate. Although it failed to win any seats, the party exhibited the strongest performance of a minor party in recent UK political history. Support had been strongest in the south and east of England, in particular in areas with high elderly populations and high rates of agricultural employment. Support for the party was considerably weaker in Inner London, Northern England, and Scotland; it secured only 1.1% of the Scottish <b>vote.</b> <b>This</b> may have reflected greater pro-EU sentiment in Scotland or a perception that the Referendum Party's Euroscepticism was a form of English nationalism rather than British nationalism. The Referendum Party had proved more electorally successful than its Eurosceptic rival, UKIP, which averaged 1.2% of the vote in the 194 constituencies that it contested.|$|E
