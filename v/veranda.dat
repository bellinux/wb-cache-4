50|$|The {{house was}} {{inspired}} by Fowler's book, and {{is a good example}} of his theories put into practice. Features which are directly linked to his ideas, apart from the octagonal plan, are the central spiral staircase, symmetrical arrangement of rooms with interconnecting doors, the <b>verandas</b> running all round the building, and the flat roof surmounted by a cupola. In accordance with Fowler's theories, the detailing is relatively plain for the period. Openings are simply framed by moldings. The covered <b>verandas</b> lack excess detail, having modest turned balustrade spindles and supporting posts. The decorative effect of the house comes from the basic design features: the octagonal shape and the external <b>verandas.</b>|$|R

The acreage attached to the house Stowe purchased could produce an income of $2,000 a month ($ in 2009). Stowe wrote to author George Eliot to update her {{on the progress of}} improvements to the house in Mandarin, putting up wallpaper, improving plaster, and building a <b>veranda</b> that wrapped around the structure. She took pains not to disturb a giant oak and instead built the <b>veranda</b> around the tree. The house could accommodate as many as 17 family members and friends.|$|E

5|$|Another wooden palace, Tranovola ("Silver House"), {{was under}} {{construction}} {{at the same}} time as Bevato and is considered by historians to represent the first true hybrid of Creole and traditional Merina aristocratic architecture. Its innovations included a roof of wood shingles, a second storey, the addition of a <b>veranda,</b> glass windows, multiple interior rooms (as opposed to a single open interior space) and the use of curved shapes as design elements. Historic sources offer conflicting accounts of these two buildings. Some maintain that Bevato was relocated and remodelled to become Tranovola, while others maintain the buildings were separate but debate which of the two houses was the first two-storey building in the Rova (still other sources award this innovation to Marivolanitra). The design of Radama's tomb likewise embodies the hybrid style that was to influence and inspire not only the majority of the buildings built at the Rova in the 19th century, but ultimately architecture throughout the entire highland region of Madagascar‚Äîparticularly in its use of equidistant pillars supporting the overhanging roof to create a <b>veranda.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Historically, Gwambygine Homestead {{is linked}} {{inextricably}} to the permanent Pool, Gwambygine Pool, in the Avon River that runs past the property {{at the eastern}} side of the Homestead.

The <b>verandas</b> provided shelter and protection, and a means of access to the rooms that formed the amenity of the homestead, sitting room, bedrooms, kitchen, storerooms, farm office, and so on. Gwambygine, with its high-pitched roof and shady <b>verandas,</b> conforms to the early pattern for rural Western Australian houses. It also shows the extensions carried out to provide additional accommodation for increased family needs and improved amenity over the life of the building.|$|R
