60|$|But {{there are}} other judges who think I ought not to have {{translated}} Chaucer into English, out of a quite contrary notion. They suppose {{there is a certain}} veneration due to his old language, and that it is little less than profanation and sacrilege to alter it. They are farther of opinion, that somewhat of his good sense will suffer in this transfusion, and much of the beauty of his thoughts will infallibly be lost, which appear with more grace in their old habit. Of this opinion was that excellent person whom I mentioned, the late Earl of Leicester, who valued Chaucer as much as Mr Cowley despised him. My lord dissuaded me from this attempt (for I was thinking of it some years before his death), and his authority prevailed so far with me, as to defer my undertaking while he lived, in deference to him; yet my reason was not convinced with what he urged against it. If the first end of a writer be to be understood, then, as his language grows obsolete, his thoughts must grow obscure: multa renascentur quæ nunc cecidere, cadentque, quæ nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si <b>volet</b> usus, quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi. When an ancient word for its sound and significancy deserves to be revived, I have that reasonable veneration for antiquity to restore it. All beyond this is superstition. Words are not like landmarks, so sacred as never to be removed; customs are changed, and even statutes are silently repealed, when the reason ceases for which they were enacted. As for {{the other part of the}} argument, that his thoughts will lose their original beauty by the innovation of words; in the first place, not only their beauty, but their being is lost, where they are no longer understood, which is the present case. I grant that something must be lost in all transfusion, that is, in all translations; but the sense will remain, which would otherwise be lost, or at least be maimed, when it is scarce intelligible, and that but to a few. How few are there who can read Chaucer, so as to understand him perfectly! And if imperfectly, then with less profit and no pleasure. 'Tis not for the use of some old Saxon friends that I have taken these pains with him: let them neglect my version, because they have no need of it. I made it for their sakes who understand sense and poetry as well as they, when that poetry and sense is put into words which they understand. I will go further, and dare to add, that what beauties I lose in some places, I give to others which had them not originally; but in this I may be partial to myself; let the reader judge, and I submit to his decision. Yet I think I have just occasion to complain of them, who, because they understand Chaucer, would deprive the greater part of their countrymen of the same advantage, and hoard him up, as misers do their grandam, gold, only to look on it themselves, and hinder others from making use of it. In sum, I seriously protest that no man ever had, or can have, a greater veneration for Chaucer than myself. I have translated some part of his works, only that I might perpetuate his memory, or at least refresh it, amongst my countrymen. If I have altered him anywhere for the better, I must at the same time acknowledge that I could have done nothing without him: Facile est inventis addere is no great commendation, and I am not so vain to think I have deserved a greater. I will conclude what I have to say of him singly, with this one remark: a lady of my acquaintance, who keeps a kind of correspondence with some authors of the fair sex in France, has been informed by them that Mademoiselle de Scudery, who is as old as Sibyl, and inspired like her by the same god of poetry, is at this time translating Chaucer into modern French; from which I gather that he has been formerly translated into the old Provençal, (for how she should come to understand old English I know not). But the matter of fact being true, it makes me think that there is something in it like fatality; that, after certain periods of time, the fame and memory of great wits should be renewed, as Chaucer is both in France and England. If this be wholly chance, 'tis extraordinary, and I dare not call it more for fear of being taxed with superstition.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of a research on the experience of immigration from Muslim women of Lebanese origin in Brazil, and on the assimilation of this immigration across three generations. In one family, that meant across four generations, which has greatly enriched the study. I have started this research wondering how women of Lebanese origin, Truzzi, (2002), find their place as a Muslim, Osman, 1998; Gattaz, (2001), immigrant Ciprut (2007), in Brazil, being members of a minority community in a city and a country where the national religion is Christian, not the same as theirs, and how they have lived there the painful experience of immigration. How to know without going there, not daring plunge into the reality of this culture so unknown to us, Brazilians who inhabit this land home for these people, Brazil, this country of extraordinary cultural diversity, where all coexist quite well, despite the differences that each entity brings with itself, with its history and hope. We can, indeed, think that everyone should succeed to rebuild himself in this new life and he should continue his own life by becoming a partner with the others, Brazilians and foreigns, and even helping himself to build Brazil his new home, from which he enjoys the sun and the joy of living. Obviously, we must not forget the social, socioeconomic and sociopolitical problems proper to Brazil, which tries to escape for a while. No doubt, the path is still long, arduous and certainly not at all easy to get to reduce social injustice and to offer people a decent life, meeting their basic needs. Even though the reality is there, always present under the sky of 200 million Brazilian people, perseverance in the effort to find a more dignified life is imbued with hope and stimulates positively to always build projects for the future. The goal of the research is to examine the influence of psychosocial factors that played during the immigration and to see how was the process of assimilation and acculturation for Muslim women from the first generation. It is also about approaching the way how identity has been constructed or reconstructed in persons of the first generation, but also in those of following generations, i. e. observing how transmission occurs, Cyrulnik (2007), from one generation to another, Doise (1999). My view is focused on what may promote links between the cultural richness that these women, Waniez and Brustlein (2001), bring with them when they arrive at Brazil and the Brazilian reality to which they face: the culture of this host country and the particular context of the relationships they forge inside and with this community in Brazil. Also, my attention is turned secondly to the intergenerational relationships over three or four generations, and especially to what is transmitted between mothers and daughters, that is to say, the relationship established between them, but also between grandmothers and granddaughters. I wish to go further and to find out what is the effect of exile on the feminine reality and between generations, Brackelaire (1995). In this these I will show the most remarkable aspects of the research. The first part includes the methodological issues in identifying the most significant features of the approach. The second part browses the main conclusions arising from the "corpus" with the elements that have emerged as the most obvious to guide analysis. Partant d’une recherche réalisée en 2006, à Foz do Iguaçu, (dans l’état du Paraná-Brésil), cet article a pour objectif de présenter les résultats de l’enquête réalisée auprès de vingt femmes musulmanes, d’origine libanaise, immigrantes, sur trois générations (même quatre, dans un cas de la même famille) de mères et filles.

Ces <b>volets</b> visent montrer comment se passe la transmission culturelle d’une génération à l’autre et comment la dernière génération a assimilé le croisement entre les deux cultures : arabe et brésilienne. La recherche éclaire aussi la question importante à savoir : comment ces jeunes filles arrivent à gérer ce conflit socioculturel avec elles-mêmes, avec leurs familles et avec la communauté brésilienne. Celle-ci c’est une question que permet d’ouvrir de nouvelles réflexions et recherches. (PSY 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLocal {{norms and}} {{practices}} about perception {{and management of}} agrobiodiversity {{are seen as a}} biologic cum cultural heritage. How can they be articulated with Brazilian recent juridical norms on biodiversity and traditional knowledge? In this paper, we develop a methodological approach for interdisciplinary study of agrobiodiversity in multiple scales (domestic unit, village, region). We offer some results of its application on the mid-Rio Negro region, in a pluriethnic context. The agricultural system is based on slash and burn pratices in a low density area. Three study areas were chosen : two of them are forest villages and one is an urban area (7, 000 inhabitants).). Agricultural diversity was studied with 4, 5 and 9 families respectively The results show a broad agrobiodiversity (243 cultivated plants and 73 varieties of manioc for 18 families). Under current conditions, this diversity is maintained in the urban area as well. We stress the different plant collections managed by each woman agriculturalist. Such high diversity is linked to an extremely active and wide circulation of plants between spaces and people in different scales. Resources were socially and geographically mapped, and they showed a flux that extends 500 km up as well as 500 km down river. However, most of these exhanges take place in the village and its vicinity and are associated with kinship. In town, the flux is determined by neighborhood and economic factors rather than by family links. In both cases, plant circulation takes place outside of agricultural development institutions, markets and economic relations. They belong to a larger system of exchange in which phytogenetic resources are not individually owned. Furthermore, agricultural diversity is related to a very rich handicraft culture and to a complex food system. Finally, we argue that legal tools currently being built in Brazil around phytogenetic resources are not conducive to the preservation and valorisation of an agricultural system which produces diversity such as the one we describe the mid-Rio Negro region. As things stand now, registering that system as cultural heritage could provide a better acknowledgement of its worth, give it visibility and ensure its conservation. La question posée est d'identifier comment les normes et pratiques locales de perception et gestion de l'agrobiodiversité s'articulent aux instruments juridiques de conservation et valorisation de la biodiversité et savoirs associés récemment mis en place au Brésil. L'article comprend deux <b>volets,</b> une proposition méthodologique pour une approche interdisciplinaire de l'agrobiodiversité et l'application de cette approche à la région du moyen Rio Negro. Les résultats portent sur l'amplitude de la diversité agricole, le rôle fondamental de la circulation des variétés et espèces cultivées dans le maintien d'une diversité élevée, sa dimension culturelle et régionale. En conclusion, nous mettons en regard la construction patrimoniale de l'agrobiodiversité avec les différents instruments de conservation discutés aujourd'hui au Brésil...|$|R

40|$|On November the 14 th 1974, Jack Cornaz died in Lausanne, {{the town}} {{where he was born}} in 1886. This study traces the unusual career of this {{architect}} – a singular figure in the field of Swiss-French architecture of the twentieth century – whose name, from the 1920 s, is associated {{with a wide range of}} neo-classical buildings on the shores of Lake Geneva, and analyses its context. Labelled both marginal and a dissident – depending on the standpoint of the critic – Cornaz's production is presented for the first time, through minute exploration of his unpublished archives, extensive information gathered in the course of interviews with numerous protagonists, both near and far, of the "cornazian scene", and comprehensive lateral research. Diversified in terms of quantity, and yet so uniform in terms of typology and program, his production appears consistent enough to express in itself the themes and motives which permit an understanding of both the variety of its expressions and in the unity of its intentions. The analysis of some of its nodal points – types of clients, production under influences, relevance of the old, problematic relationship to the tradition – provides an opportunity to grapple with broader architectural issues, some including ontological dimension : notion of imitation, bound to a style, relations between the architect and his patronage, autobiographical nature of his relation to the object, properties of the settlement [...] . Though considered as a passéiste architect, Cornaz – at least at the start of his career – appreciated a form of modernity, understood as a progressive development of classical and regional types into a new language, which did not reject or betray the heritage of the past. In this respect, his work may be considered as representative of one of those traditionalist tendencies taken into account by the history of architecture over the last two decades. Based on the analytical cataloguing of the architect's archives deposited in the ACM (Archives of Modern Construction, Lausanne), the method applied in this study is a cross-disciplinary approach combining historical research with the principles of anthropological investigation. It is also based upon the interlocking of two propositions : it is a historical inquiry analysing sources as well as an epistemological reflection about cognitive procedures at work in the material in question. Adept at disciplinary nomadism and in mimetic fit with her object, the author applies a "patchwork" method. She is convinced that the effect of contiguity and accumulation is meaningful in itself, and that the interest of this matching of quotations, which leads to admittance for the need of the gaps and interplay of the elements, resides in its unsteadiness, like in a mosaic. The book consists of two closely connected <b>volets.</b> Chapters are thematic in the first one, these theoretical essays are completed with monographs of twenty of J.

40|$|International audienceSpain faces a quick {{development}} of a very extensive high-speed rail network since 1992. It now reaches more than 2. 500 km. This network was set together with numerous projects of new stations both in big and intermediate cities throughout the whole country. As {{it was decided to}} create a brandnew network according to the European norms and gauge, the enlargement and adaptation of stations was made necessary. High-speed was conceived as a symbol of modernity and as a way to improve the rank of the served cities both in Spain and Europe. The Mediterranean Corridor has a particular status in this network. It is a long term project that includes freight and passenger European gauge high-quality of service lines along the Mediterranean. One of the sections of this project is the implementation of a coastal high-speed line, which would be the very first great axis that would not go through Madrid. It would connect Barcelona and Valencia together, {{as well as a number}} of intermediate cities such as Alicante, Tarragona and Castellón. It would also make possible a direct connection of these cities to the rest of Europe. In this context, the end of line situation of the littoral cities would be transformed into a nodal situation interconnecting the radial main network to a powerful peripheral axis. The main cities (Barcelona and Valencia) take advantage of this status modification in order to promote particularly ambitious underground station projects which are associated to important urban renewal operations (urban green lines, housing, business districts…). They therefore try to improvetheir image and metropolitan status. The intermediate cities try to reach a place in the high-speed network by getting a new high-speed station, no matter if the line is radial or axial. Nevertheless, they take the Mediterranean Corridor project as an argument. Opposite, in the negotiation process between the cities and the government to define the stops on the high-speed lines, the stations may be used as a way of settling the cities in the radial-shape network and of delaying the achievement of the Mediterranean axis. The station projects show at the same time the cities’ metropolitan aim, the strong competition between the great littoral cities themselves, and also the sharp political tension between the Mediterranean regions and Madrid as the national capital. Thus, the debate on the high-speed stations is one of the topics crystallising a geopolitical question. Consequently, the metropolitan aims associated to the new high-speed stations receive an additional dimension: the stations become political objects and they therefore exceed their function of communication exchangers. The case study of the Mediterranean corridor high-speed stations is particularly interesting because it mixes urban planning stakes to local politics and to national geopolitics. Le développement rapide d’un réseau à grande vitesse très étendu en Espagne s’est accompagné de nombreux projets de gares nouvelles dans les villes grandes ou moyennes de tout le pays. Le corridor méditerranéen a un statut particulier dans le réseau. L’un des <b>volets</b> du projet est la mise en place d’une ligne à grande vitesse littorale qui serait le premier grand axe ne passant pas par Madrid. De ce fait, les villes littorales verraient leur statut de terminus ferroviaire se transformer en situation nodale d’interconnexion. Elles prennent appui sur ce changement de statut pour promouvoir des projets de gares particulièrement ambitieux, associés à d’importantes opérations de rénovation urbaine, dans une logique d’amélioration de leur image et de métropolisation. Ces projets traduisent à la fois une ambition métropolitaine, une rivalité entre les grandes villes littorales elles-mêmes, ainsi qu’une tension d’ordre politique entre le littoral méditerranéen et Madrid comme capitale nationale. Dès lors, les ambitions métropolitaines associées aux gares à grande vitesse prennent une dimension supplémentaire en faisant de ces gares des objets politiques dont la fonction dépasse largement celle d’échangeurs de communication...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe post-classical Arabic {{category}} of 'inshâ' (“performative utterance”) occupies a central position in several traditional fields of Islamic culture, thereby {{serving as a}} link between them. However, The Encyclopaedia of Islam mentions it in neither of its two editions. The term is not even translated or rather is not well translated in a key text like the Muqaddima of Ibn Khaldûn. It is assimilated instead to its subcategory talab (“jussive utterance”). We must go {{back as far as}} Silvestre de Sacy (1758 – 1838) to understand the reasons for this silence, or rather this semi-silence. As an advocate of General Grammar, he saw the opposition between 'inshâ' and 'ikhbâr (“assertion”) in terms of the ‘modes' (in the sense of ‘forms or ways of thinking'). This interpretation may also have been influenced by the work of Ibn al-Hâjib, who sees the opposition which gave rise to the classification of utterances according to the cate¬gories of khabar (“affirmation”) and 'inshâ' (wathever is not affirmation), in terms of a two-fold difference: that of the assertive as opposed to the performative use of a given sentence, on the one hand, and, that of the imperative as opposed to the performative, that is of the ‘expression' of the t'alab as opposed to its ‘representation', on the other hand. By concentrating on a single facet of the problem, Silvestre de Sacy misses the legal origin of the category as well as its conceptual originality. Likewise, Massignon (1883 – 1962) mentions only the reduction of the 'inshâ' to a 'ikhbâr ‘ammâ fî l-bâtin (“the assertion of one's inner thoughts”) and the 'ikhbâr to a 'ikhbâr ‘ammâ fî l-khârij (“the assertion of what is in the outside world”) which corresponds to a difference in referential worlds. The moral of all this is that personal and contemporary theories of historians of linguistics, as well as the personal authority of one specialist or another can be the best or the worst of things. Nonetheless, if Arabists had paid more attention to this pluridisciplinary category, they might have played a leading role in writing the history of linguistics. To the extent that the end of history is the transcendence of that history, they might even have foreseen the emergeance of the ‘enunciation' movement, which permeates the Arabic linguistic tradition. La catégorie arabe postclassique de 'inshâ' (“performatif”) joue un rôle central dans plusieurs disciplines traditionnelles en islam, qu'elle met ainsi en relation. Pourtant, l'Encyclopédie de l'Islam en ses deux éditions ne la mentionne pas. Et dans un texte-phare comme la Muqaddima de Ibn Khaldûn, le terme ou bien n'est pas traduit ou bien est mal traduit, étant assimilé à sa subdivison talab (“jussion”). Pour comprendre ce silence ou ce demi-silence, il faut remonter à Silvestre de Sacy (1758 – 1838) : tenant de la grammaire générale, il relit l'opposition 'inshâ' vs 'ikhbâr (“assertion”) à travers celle des ‘modes' (comme “formes ou manières de notre pensée”) que fait celle-ci. Cette lecture a néanmoins pu être influencée par l'œuvre de Ibn al-Hâjib, où cette opposition, dont est issue la classification des énoncés en khabar (“affirmation”) et 'inshâ' (tout ce qui n'est pas affirmation), articule une double différence: celle des emplois assertif et performatif d'une même phrase, mais aussi celle de l'impératif et du performatif correspondant comme ‘expression' et ‘représentation' de la demande. En ne retenant qu'un des deux <b>volets,</b> Silvestre de Sacy manque l'origine juridique et l'originalité conceptuelle de la catégorie. De même Massignon (1883 – 1962) ne retient que la réduction du 'inshâ' à un 'ikhbâr ‘ammâ fî l-bâtin (“assertion sur ce qui est dans le for intérieur”) vs 'ikhbâr = 'ikhbâr ‘ammâ fî l-khârij (“assertion sur ce qui est dans la réalité extérieure”), qui articule une différence entre mondes référés. Moralité: les théories personnelles ou contemporaines de l'historien de la linguistique, ainsi que l'‘autorité' de tel ou tel savant, peuvent être la meilleure ou la pire des choses. Reste que si les arabisants avaient prêté davantage d'attention à cette catégorie pluridisciplinaire et à son cheminement transdisciplinaire, ils auraient pu jouer un rôle de pionniers en matière d'histoire de la linguistique et dans la mesure où la fin de toute histoire est de dépasser cette histoire même anticiper sur l'émergence du phénomène de l'‘énonciation', omniprésent dans la tradition linguistique arabe...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{destructive}} earthquakes repeatedly {{showed that}} site effects can drastically exacerbate damage. Improving the way such local hazard modifications are {{accounted for in}} earthquake risk mitigation policies is therefore a major concern, balanced however by tight economical constraints, which emphasize the need for inexpensive, though reliable methods. Noise measurements, an original geophysical method using ambient natural and anthropic vibrations, correspond to this need. The goal of this thesis is to develop and validate physically sound methodologies based on seismic noise allowing to account for site effects in a regulatory context, and combining simplicity, robustness and reliability. The idea is, in a first stage, to couple information from H/V measurements (resonance frequency f 0) and array measurements (shear waves velocity, at least at shallow depth) to characterize the site conditions, and, in a second stage, to empirically develop statistical correlations between such limited site information and amplification functions, {{on the basis of}} the largest available high quality data set, i. e., the Japanese Kik-net data. This thesis is therefore divided into two main sections dedicated, respectively, to each of these two steps. The 1 st section is mainly targeted at proposing a field and processing protocol for the combined utilization of methods based on seismic noise. A series of investigations on synthetic and real data allows to identify the key factors controlling the reliability of estimates of the resonance frequency f 0 and the mean S-waves velocity of the top z meters, Vsz (with z varying from 5 to 30 meters according to site conditions and array aperture). The proposed protocol is then intended to warrant – as much as possible – a good control of these key factors. The goal of the 2 nd section is to develop a simple method for proposing a site-specific spectrum {{on the basis of the}} regional hazard and the site conditions characterized by f 0 and Vsz. A subset of the Kik-net strong motion data is first selected, corresponding to nearly 500 sites with reliable P and S waves velocity profiles down to an average depth far larger than 50 m, and more than 4000 pairs of surface and down-hole seismic recordings. For each site, the site conditions can be characterized by reliable estimates of f 0 and Vsz, and the borehole amplification function is estimated with spectral ratio between surface and down-hole recordings. Considering the large variability of depths and velocities for the borehole sensors, these "raw" functions are then normalized with respect to a carefully chosen "standard" reference rock, and corrected from depth effects, in order to approximate amplification function with respect to outcropping, standard rock. A statistical analysis then allows toderive empirical relationships between these normalized and corrected empirical amplification functions, and site conditions described by f 0 and Vsz parameters. These amplification functions lead to significantly improved ground motion estimates compared to present earthquake regulations (such as EC 8) : our results could be readily applied in microzonation studies, and could as well pave the way for the next generation of building codes, with new site classifications and associated amplification functions. Le constat récurrent de dégâts sismiques fortement influencés par les effets de site attire l'attention sur la nécessité d'améliorer les outils permettant leur estimation a priori. Les contraintes budgétaires font cependant du développement de méthodes peu onéreuses un objectif crucial. Les mesures de bruit de fond, méthode géophysique utilisant les vibrations ambiantes, correspondent à ce type de besoin. Le but de cette thèse est de développer et de valider des méthodologies opérationnelles utilisant le bruit de fond pour une prise en compte robuste et satisfaisante des effets de site dans un contexte réglementaire. Cette thèse comprend deux <b>volets</b> principaux : - Tout d'abord le développement d'un protocole sur les méthodes utilisant le bruit de fond, dans le but de qualifier la détermination sur un site de la fréquence fondamentale f 0 (mesures "H/V") et de la vitesse moyenne des ondes de cisaillement sur les z 1 ers mètres Vsz (mesures en réseau); - Puis l'établissement d'une fonction empirique décrivant l'amplification d'un site en fonction des deux seuls paramètres f 0 et Vsz. Cette étude est effectuée à partir des données japonaises Kik-net: les paramètres f 0 et Vsz ont pu être estimés de façon fiables pour près de 500 sites, de même que leur fonction d'amplification entre les enregistrements en surface et en profondeur. Après correction de l'effet de profondeur et normalisation pour se ramener à une fonction d'amplification par rapport à un rocher affleurant "standard", une analyse statistique permet alors de définir la fonction cherchée, qui s'avère sensiblement meilleure que les coefficients de site proposés dans les règlementations actuelles type EC 8...|$|R

Noise measurements, an original geophysical method using ambient natural and anthropic vibrations, correspond to this need. The goal of this thesis is to develop and validate physically sound methodologies based on seismic noise allowing to account for site effects in a regulatory context, and combining simplicity, robustness and reliability. The idea is, in a first stage, to couple information from H/V measurements (resonance frequency f 0) and array measurements (shear waves velocity, at least at shallow depth) to characterize the site conditions, and, in a second stage, to empirically develop statistical correlations between such limited site information and amplification functions, {{on the basis of}} the largest available high quality data set, i. e., the Japanese Kik-net data. This thesis is therefore divided into two main sections dedicated, respectively, to each of these two steps. The 1 st section is mainly targeted at proposing a field and processing protocol for the combined utilization of methods based on seismic noise. A series of investigations on synthetic and real data allows to identify the key factors controlling the reliability of estimates of the resonance frequency f 0 and the mean S-waves velocity of the top z meters, Vsz (with z varying from 5 to 30 meters according to site conditions and array aperture). The proposed protocol is then intended to warrant as much as possible a good control of these key factors. The goal of the 2 nd section is to develop a simple method for proposing a site-specific spectrum {{on the basis of the}} regional hazard and the site conditions characterized by f 0 and Vsz. A subset of the Kik-net strong motion data is first selected, corresponding to nearly 500 sites with reliable P and S waves velocity profiles down to an average depth far larger than 50 m, and more than 4000 pairs of surface and down-hole seismic recordings. For each site, the site conditions can be characterized by reliable estimates of f 0 and Vsz, and the borehole amplification function is estimated with spectral ratio between surface and down-hole recordings. Considering the large variability of depths and velocities for the borehole sensors, these "raw" functions are then normalized with respect to a carefully chosen "standard" reference rock, and corrected from depth effects, in order to approximate amplification function with respect to outcropping, standard rock. A statistical analysis then allows toderive empirical relationships between these normalized and corrected empirical amplification functions, and site conditions described by f 0 and Vsz parameters. These amplification functions lead to significantly improved ground motion estimates compared to present earthquake regulations (such as EC 8) : our results could be readily applied in microzonation studies, and could as well pave the way for the next generation of building codes, with new site classifications and associated amplification functions.

40|$|De nombreuses méthodes régionales ont été développées pour améliorer l'estimation de la {{distribution}} des débits de crues en des sites où l'on dispose de peu d'information ou même d'aucune information. Cet article présente une synthèse de modèles hydrologiques utilisés en France et au Québec (Canada), à l'occasion d'un séminaire relatif aux " méthodes d'estimation régionale en hydrologie " tenu à Lyon en mai 1997. Les modèles français sont fortement liés à une technique d'extrapolation de la distribution des crues, la méthode du Gradex, qui repose sur l'exploitation probabiliste conjointe des séries hydrométriques et pluviométriques. Ceci explique les deux principaux <b>volets</b> d'études régionales pratiquées en France : les travaux liés à la régionalisation des pluies et ceux liés à la régionalisation des débits. Les modèles québecois comprennent généralement deux étapes : la définition et la détermination de régions hydrologiquement homogènes, puis l'estimation régionale, par le transfert à l'intérieur d'une même région de l'information des sites jaugés à un site non-jaugé ou partiellement jaugé pour lequel on ne dispose pas d'information suffisante. Après avoir donné un aperçu des méthodes pratiquées dans les deux pays, une discussion dégage les caractéristiques principales et les complémentarités des différentes approches et met en évidence l'intérêt de développer une collaboration plus étroite pour mieux tenir compte des particularités et des complémentarités des méthodes développées de part et d'autre. Une des pistes évoquées consiste à combiner l'information régionale pluviométrique (approche française) et hydrométrique (approche québécoise). Design flood estimates at ungauged {{sites or}} at gauged sites with short records {{can be obtained}} through regionalization techniques. Various methods have been employed {{in different parts of}} the world for the regional analysis of extreme hydrological events. These regionalization approaches make different assumptions and hypotheses concerning the hydrological phenomena being modeled, rely on various types of continuous and non-continuous data, and often fall under completely different theories. A research seminar dealing with " regional estimation methods in hydrology " took place in Lyon during the month of May 1997, and brought together various researchers and practitioners mainly from France and the Province of Quebec (Canada). The present paper is based on the conferences and discussions that took place during this seminar and aims to review, classify, comparatively evaluate, and potentially propose improvements to the most prominent regionalization techniques utilized in France and Quebec. The specific objectives of this paper are :· to review the main regional hydrologic models that have been proposed and commonly used during the last three decades;· to classify the literature into different groups according to the origin of the method, its specific objective, and the technique it adopts; · to present a comprehensive evaluation of the characteristics of the methods, and to point out the hypotheses, data requirements, strengths and weaknesses of each particular one; and · to investigate and identify potential improvements to the reviewed methods, by combining and extending the various approaches and integrating their particular strengths. Regionalization approaches adopted in France include the Gradex method which represents a simplified rainfall-runoff model which provides estimates of flood magnitudes of given probabilities and is based on rainfall data which often cover longer periods and are more reliable than flow data (Guillot and Duband, 1967; CFGB, 1994). It is based on the hypotheses that beyond a given rainfall threshold (known as the pivot point), all water is transformed into runoff, and that a rainfall event of a given duration generates runoff for the same length of time. These hypotheses are equivalent to assuming that, beyond the pivot point, the rainfall-runoff relationship is linear and that the precipitation and runoff probability curves are parallel on a Gumbel plot. In Quebec (and generally in North America), regional flood frequency analysis involves usually two steps : delineation of homogeneous regions, and regional estimation. In the first step, the focus is on identifying and regrouping sites which seem sufficiently homogeneous or sufficiently similar to the target ungauged site to provide a basis for information transfer. The second step of the analysis consists in inferring flood information (such as quantiles) at the target site using data from the stations identified in the first step of the analysis. Two types of " homogeneous " regions can be proposed : fixed set regions (geographically contiguous or non-contiguous) and neighborhood type of regions. The second type includes the methods of canonical correlation analysis and of the regions of influence. Regional estimation can be accomplished using one of two main approaches : index flood or quantile regression methods. The results of this work indicate that the philosophies of regionalization and the methods utilized in France and Quebec are complementary to each other and are based on different needs and outlooks. While the approaches followed in France are characterized by strong conceptual and geographic aspects with an emphasis on the utilization of information related to other phenomena (such as precipitations), the approaches adopted in Quebec rely on the strength of their statistical and stochastic components and usually condense the spatial and temporal information to a realistic functional form. This dissimilarity in the approaches being followed on either side may be originated by the distinct topographic and climatic characteristics of each region (France and Quebec) and by the differences in basin sizes and hydrometeorologic network densities. The conclusions of the seminar point to the large potential of improvements in regional estimation methods, which may result from an enhanced exchange between scientists from both sides : indeed, there is much to gain from learning about the dissimilarities between the various approaches, comparing their performances, and devising new methods that combine their individual strengths. Hence, the Gradex method for example could benefit from an increased utilization of regional flood information, while flood regionalization methods utilized in Quebec could gain much from the formalization of the use of rainfall information and from the integration of an improved modeling of physical hydrologic phenomena. This should result in the enhancement of the efficiency of regional estimation methods and their ability to handle various practical conditions. It is hoped that this research will contribute towards closing the gap between French and Quebec literature, and more generally between the European and the North American hydrological schools of thought, by narrowing the large literature that is available, by providing the necessary cross-evaluation of regional flood analysis models, and by providing comprehensive propositions for improved approaches for regional hydrologic modeling...|$|R

30|$|Among {{the studies}} {{addressing}} the issue of regulation of learning within groups, a proliferation of terms regarding metacognitive and regulatory processes is present: shared regulation (<b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 a), socially shared regulation and socially shared metacognitive regulation (<b>Volet</b> 2001; Khosa and <b>Volet</b> 2014; Iiskala et al. 2011; <b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b; De Backer et al. 2015); socially shared metacognition (Iiskala et al. 2004); and social regulation (Rogat and Linnenbrink-Garcia 2011). Social regulation can range from other-regulation to socially shared regulation. The term other-regulation is applied to situations in which a ‘momentary unequal situation’ arises (<b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b): one student temporarily predominates the group’s interactions and takes the guiding role in the joint activity, in a directive or facilitative way (Vauras et al. 2003; <b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b; Rogat and Adams-Wiggins 2014; Khosa and <b>Volet</b> 2013, 2014; Schoor et al. 2015; Rogat and Adams-Wiggins 2015). The term socially shared regulation—it has been used interchangeably with the term socially shared metacognition, although the latter is more focused on the regulation of cognition—refers to those ‘individuals’ metacognitive processes that operate as a genuine social entity, aimed at a single objective, that is, the fully shared goal of the activity’ (Iiskala 2011, p. 379). In other words, it regards all the social processes that groups use to regulate their joint work on a task (<b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b), independently of the level {{and the quality of}} the regulated object.|$|E

When this approach fails, the need for alternative pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies emerges. These have been investigated even less systematically than the aforementioned compounds, and are often used, sometimes in succession, in cases of extreme refractoriness (Robakis & Hirsch, 2006). Several possibilities are reviewed here. In view of the marked heterogeneity of reported information, etiologies, ages, and comedications, it is extremely difficult to evaluate a given method, not to say to compare different strategies among them. Pharmacologic Approaches Isoflurane and desflurane may complete the armamentarium of anesthetics,' and should be employed in a ''close'' environment, in order to prevent intoxication of treating personnel. c-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor potentiation represents the putative mechanism of action. In an earlier report, isoflurane was used for up to 55 h in nine patients, controlling seizures in all; mortality was, however, 67 % (Kofke et al., 1989). More recently, the use of these inhalational anesthetics was described in seven subjects with RSE, for up to 26 days, with an endtidal concentration of 1. 2 - 5 %. All patients required vasopressors, and paralytic ileus occurred in three; outcome was fatal in three patients (43 %) (Mirsattari et al., 2004). Ketamine, known as an emergency anesthetic because of its favorable hemodynamic profile, is an N-methyl-daspartate (NMDA) antagonist; the interest for its use in RSE derives from animal works showing loss of GABAA efficacy and maintained NMDA sensitivity in prolonged status epilepticus (Mazarati & Wasterlain, 1999). However, to avoid possible neurotoxicity, it appears safer to combine ketamine with GABAergic compounds (Jevtovic-Todorovic et al., 2001; Ubogu et al., 2003), also because of a likely synergistic effect (Martin & Kapur, 2008). There are few reported cases in humans, describing progressive dosages up to 7. 5 mg/kg/h for several days (Sheth & Gidal, 1998; Quigg et al., 2002; Pruss & Holtkamp, 2008), with moderate outcomes. Paraldehyde acts through a yet-unidentified mechanism, and appears to be relatively safe in terms of cardiovascular tolerability (Ramsay, 1989; Thulasimani & Ramaswamy, 2002), but because of the risk of crystal formation and its reactivity with plastic, it should be used only as fresh prepared solution in glass devices (Beyenburg et al., 2000). There are virtually no recent reports regarding its use in adults RSE, whereas rectal paraldehyde in children with status epilepticus resistant to benzodiazepines seems less efficacious than intravenous phenytoin (Chin et al., 2008). Etomidate is another anesthetic agent for which the exact mechanism of action is also unknown, which is also relatively favorable regarding cardiovascular side effects, and may be used for rapid sedation. Its use in RSE was reported in eight subjects (Yeoman et al., 1989). After a bolus of 0. 3 mg/kg, a drip of up to 7. 2 mg/kg/h for up to 12 days was administered, with hypotension occurring in five patients; two patients died. A reversible inhibition of cortisol synthesis represents an important concern, limiting its widespread use and implying a careful hormonal substitution during treatment (Beyenburg et al., 2000). Several nonsedating approaches have been reported. The use of lidocaine in RSE, a class Ib antiarrhythmic agent modulating sodium channels, was reviewed in 1997 (Walker & Slovis, 1997). Initial boluses up to 5 mg/kg and perfusions of up to 6 mg/kg/h have been mentioned; somewhat surprisingly, at times lidocaine seemed to be successful in controlling seizures in patients who were refractory to phenytoin. The aforementioned dosages should not be overshot, in order to keep lidocaine levels under 5 mg/L and avoid seizure induction (Hamano et al., 2006). A recent pediatric retrospective survey on 57 RSE episodes (37 patients) described a response in 36 %, and no major adverse events; mortality was not given (Hamano et al., 2006 Verapamil, a calcium-channel blocker, also inhibits P-glycoprotein, a multidrug transporter that may diminish AED availability in the brain (Potschka et al., 2002). Few case reports on its use in humans are available; this medication nevertheless appears relatively safe (under cardiac monitoring) up to dosages of 360 mg/day (Iannetti et al., 2005). Magnesium, a widely used agent for seizures elicited by eclampsia, has also been anecdotally reported in RSE (Fisher et al., 1988; Robakis & Hirsch, 2006), but with scarce results even at serum levels of 14 mm. The rationale may be found in the physiologic blockage of NMDA channels by magnesium ions (Hope & Blumenfeld, 2005). Ketogenic diet has been prescribed for decades, mostly in children, to control refractory seizures. Its use in RSE as ''ultima ratio'' has been occasionally described: three of six children (Francois et al., 2003) and one adult (Bodenant et al., 2008) were responders. This approach displays its effect subacutely over several days to a few weeks. Because ''malignant RSE'' seems at times to be the consequence of immunologic processes (Holtkamp et al., 2005), a course of immunomodulatory treatment is often advocated in this setting, {{even in the absence of}} definite autoimmune etiologies (Robakis & Hirsch, 2006); steroids, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), plasma exchanges, or intravenous immunoglobulins may be used alone or in sequential combination. Nonpharmacologic Approaches These strategies are described somewhat less frequently than pharmacologic approaches. Acute implantation of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been reported in RSE (Winston et al., 2001; Patwardhan et al., 2005; De Herdt et al., 2009). Stimulation was usually initiated in the operation room, and intensity progressively adapted over a few days up to 1. 25 mA (with various regimens regarding the other parameters), allowing a subacute seizure control; one transitory episode of bradycardia/asystole has been described (De Herdt et al., 2009). Of course, pending identification of a definite seizure focus, resective surgery may also be considered in selected cases (Lhatoo & Alexopoulos, 2007). Low-frequency (0. 5 Hz) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at 90 % of the resting motor threshold has been reported to be successful for about 2 months in a patient with epilepsia partialis continua, but with a weaning effect afterward, implying the need for a repetitive use (Misawa et al., 2005). More recently, TMS was applied in a combination of a short ''priming'' high frequency (up to 100 Hz) and longer runs of low-frequency stimulations (1 Hz) at 90 - 100 % of the motor threshold in seven other patients with simple-partial status, with mixed results (Rotenberg et al., 2009). Paradoxically at first glance, electroconvulsive treatment may be found in cases of extremely resistant RSE. A recent case report illustrates its use in an adult patient with convulsive status, with three sessions (three convulsions each) carried out over 3 days, resulting in a moderate recovery; the mechanism is believed to be related to modification of the synaptic release of neurotransmitters (Cline & Roos, 2007). Therapeutic hypothermia, which is increasingly used in postanoxic patients (Oddo et al., 2008), has been the object of a recent case series in RSE (Corry et al., 2008). Reduction of energy demand, excitatory neurotransmission, and neuroprotective effects may account for the putative mechanism of action. Four adult patients in RSE were cooled to 31 _- 34 _C with an endovascular system for up to 90 h, and then passively rewarmed over 2 - 50 h. Seizures were controlled in two patients, one of whom died; also one of the other two patients in whom seizures continued subsequently deceased. Possible side effects are related to acid-base and electrolyte disturbances, and coagulation dysfunction including thrombosis, infectious risks, cardiac arrhythmia, and paralytic ileus (Corry et al., 2008; Cereda et al., 2009). Finally, anecdotic evidence suggests that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) -air exchange may induce some transitory benefit in RSE (Kohrmann et al., 2006); although this approach was already in use in the middle of the twentieth century, the mechanism is unknown. Acknowledgment A wide spectrum of pharmacologic (sedating and nonsedating) and nonpharmacologic (surgical, or involving electrical stimulation) regimens might be applied to attempt RSE control. Their use should be considered only after refractoriness to AED or anesthetics displaying a higher level of evidence. Although it seems unlikely that these uncommon and scarcely studied strategies will influence the RSE outcome in a decisive way, some may be interesting in particular settings. However, because the main prognostic determinant in status epilepticus appears to be related to the underlying etiology rather than to the treatment approach (Rossetti et al., 2005, 2008), the safety issue should always represent a paramount concern for the prescribing physician. Conclusion The author confirms that he has read the Journal's position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirms that this paper is consistent with those guidelines...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWriting, speaking, documenting: {{normative}} {{issues and}} located {{practices in the}} procedures for public debate This paper provides an insight into the forms of politic mediation in participatory procedures that link online discussion's devices and face-to-face's devices. Both consist of assemblies of heterogeneous and sequenced formats (blog, forum, e-participatory assembly, etc.). The devices happen to standardize production of the debate and the debate-reflecting traces (Bonaccorsi, Julliard, 2010). We will use two empirical examples discussed {{in the context of}} a collaborative research (The formats of expression by citizens in local procedures for consultation, Concertation, Decision, Environment 2 Program funded by the Ministry of Ecology, Energy and Sustainable Development and Territorial Development) considering that within these procedures, devices and formats materialize various conceptions of public debate (Monnoyer-Smith, 2009; Street, Wright, 2007). We examine at first the European project Ideal-EU, in which, in 2008, Tuscany, Catalonia and PoitouCharentes organized a Participatory Electronic Assembly (APE) on Climate Change and developed a participatory website (www. idealdebate. eu). This project was part of the "eParticipation 2007 " program and was funded by the European Commission (DG Information Society) as. We examine at second the conciliation procedure set up by a special Commission for Public Debate (CPDP) in 2009 to determine the transformation of the waste treatment center in Ivry-Paris XIII. This consultation also organized the terms of face-to-face debates (meetings) and online debates ([URL] In both cases, the participatory web site seemed to occupy a specific place. The call for proposals of the European program stressed the need, for the funded actors, to make a website as part of deliberative procedures, while the proposition of various modes of expression - including a blog - was, according to the CPDP, an indispensable guarantee for the proper conduct of the debate. From an ethno-semiotic approach, we discuss the various mechanisms put in place in these procedures as evidence of a definition of participation produced by the stakeholders. This definition is first negotiated and discussed in the set design, technical or editorial, which are of course also constrained by economic factors or calendar. The computer media, in particular, are characterized by their indexical value. On the first hand, the technical and editorial choices mobilize images (the imaginery of network, the imaginery of participation, and so on.). On the other hand, it promotes activities - writing, reading, validating, measuring, classifying - and "sets up a dense network of writing" (Aim, Jeanneret, 2007). For their part, public meetings and APE are instrumented, framed and scripted. We study the stakes of these techno-semiotic devices by focusing on how they "norm" and regulate the action by offering models of speaking and reading to produce, to shape and to archive the debate (facilitators, summaries, and reports for example) (Aldrin, Hube, 2011). In other words, we analyze public speaking of participants, in the web sites as well as in public meeting and at the EPA, as "allowed speaking": the device, online or face to face, establishes the rules (Flon, Jeanneret, 2010). But the device is also produced by the actions it makes possible - even if they have not been envisaged in its project. We analyze the discursive and symbolic dimensions of these devices in questioning the forms of participation produced. This is not to assess a difference between the aims (that of the institution, that of the participants) or to measure the effectiveness of the format of expression. We observe the linguistic and semiotic signs to understand how the definitions of participation produced by the stakeholders are interpreted by participants. In this, the proposed approach differs from that adopted by our colleagues : they compared modes of justification of the actors in their speeches (Wojcik, Talpin, 2009) or the quality of online discussions and face-to-face (MonnoyerSmith, Wojcik, 2011) to assess the "ideal" conditions of involving. Our approaches completement each other. The "participation" we observed is defined at the junction of its interpretations by the participants in the procedure which are, at some point, the conditions of possibilities for public debate. Our methodology to study this issue adds semiotic analysis to ethnographic investigation (interviews and observations) : we see the modalities of debates (participatory websites, public meetings) as places of public speaking, more or less nested according to the procedures. The participants and their speech circulate between the different places. We wish to avoid two aporias. The first would be to focus only on the discursive exchanges, which is to think that the formats of deliberation are naturals and "non semiotizated" (Doury, Marcoccia, 2007). The second would be to consider these devices as "formatting" places and to ignore the possibility that individuals can produce something different than what the devices propose. Our Communication will be structured in three parts: First, we propose a global characterization of the two participatory procedures by highlighting the "intersemioticity" involved in the devices that articulate face-to-face interaction and on line communication: two modalities which have heterogeneous semiotic statutes. Secondly, this characterization allows us to detail finely models and standards: what are the forms of speaking which are suggested, indicated by the different formats? Finally, we question how participants interpret the proposed arrangements and "cope with" models and standards of enunciation. We pay particular attention to the traces of their paths in the devices. We describe the circulation of their speech into different formats and in over time, reflecting a tactical use of modes of expression available in the devicesCette communication propose un éclairage sur les formes de médiation du politique à l'œuvre dans les procédures participatives articulant des dispositifs de débat en ligne et en face-à-face. Ces dispositifs sont constitués par des assemblages de formats hétérogènes et séquencés (blog, forum, assemblée participative électronique, etc.) et engagent ainsi une véritable normalisation des modalités de production et d'inscription du débat (Bonaccorsi, Julliard, 2010). Nous nous appuierons sur deux exemples empiriques analysés dans le cadre d'une recherche collective (Les formats d'expression citoyenne dans les procédures locales de concertation, Programme Concertation, Décision, Environnement 2, Ministère de l'écologie, de l'énergie et du développement durable et de l'aménagement du territoire) selon le postulat qu'au sein de ces procédures, les dispositifs de prise de parole supportent et matérialisent des conceptions du débat public (Monnoyer-Smith, 2009; Street, Wright, 2007). Le premier terrain d'étude porte sur le projet européen Ideal-Eu, dans le cadre duquel, en 2008, les Régions Toscane, Catalogne et Poitou-Charentes ont organisé une Assemblée Participative Électronique (APE) sur le changement climatique, et conçu un site web participatif (www. idealdebate. eu). Ce projet s'inscrivait dans le cadre de l'appel à projets du programme " eParticipation 2007 " et était financé par la Direction générale Information Society de la Commission européenne. Le second terrain d'étude porte sur la procédure de concertation mise en place par une Commission particulière du débat public (CPDP) en 2009 pour statuer sur la transformation du Centre de traitement des déchets d'Ivry-Paris XIII. Cette concertation articule également des modalités d'échanges en face-à-face (réunions publiques) et en ligne ([URL] Dans l'un et l'autre cas, le site web participatif semble devoir occuper une place spécifique : l'appel à projets du programme européen insistait sur la nécessité pour les acteurs financés de réaliser un site web dans le cadre de procédures délibératives; tandis que la mise à disposition de modalités d'expression variées - incluant un blog - constituait, selon la CPDP, une garantie sine qua non du bon déroulement du débat. À partir d'une approche ethno-sémiologique, nous abordons les différents dispositifs mis en place dans le cadre de ces procédures comme les traces d'une définition de la participation produite/engagée par les acteurs du projet. Cette définition est d'abord négociée et discutée dans les choix scénographiques, techniques ou éditoriaux, qui sont bien entendu également contraints par des facteurs économiques ou calendaires. Les médias informatisés, notamment, se caractérisent par leur valeur indexicale. D'une part, les choix techniques et éditoriaux mobilisent des imaginaires (celui du réseau, du participatif, etc.) qui sont supposés pouvoir particulièrement bien trouver une traduction concrète grâce à la technique, en cela, le Web, en tant que support, signale un registre à la communication. D'autre part, il favorise des activités - écrire, lire, valider, évaluer, classer - et " configure un tissu dense d'écriture " (Aïm, Jeanneret, 2007). De leur côté, réunions publiques et APE sont instrumentées, cadrées et scénarisées. Nous prenons donc la mesure des enjeux techno-sémiotiques de ces dispositifs en nous intéressant à la manière dont ils norment et régulent l'action en proposant des modèles de prise de parole et de lecture pour produire, mettre en forme et archiver le débat (animateurs, synthèses, rapports, etc.) (Aldrin, Hubé, 2011). En d'autres termes, nous analysons les interventions des participants dans les sites web, en réunion publique ou lors de l'APE comme des prises de parole autorisées : le dispositif, en ligne ou en face à face, institue (Flon, Jeanneret, 2010). Mais le dispositif est également produit par les actions qu'il rend possibles sans qu'elles n'aient été envisagées dans son projet. Nous analysons la dimension discursive et symbolique de ces dispositifs en nous interrogeant sur les formes de participation produites. Il ne s'agit pas d'évaluer un écart entre des finalités (celle de l'institution, celle des participants), ni de mesurer l'efficacité du format d'expression : nous observons là des interprétations du projet d'un dispositif de prise de parole à partir des marques langagières et sémiotique. En cela, l'approche proposée diffère de celle adoptée par nos collègues qui comparent les modes de justification des acteurs dans leurs discours (Wojcik, Talpin, 2009) ou la qualité des débats en ligne et en face-à-face (Monnoyer-Smith, Wojcik, 2011) pour évaluer les conditions de réalisation d'une délibération " idéale " dans chacun de ces dispositifs et dans leur articulation, et la complète. L'observable " participation " est défini selon nous à la jonction des interprétations du projet, où se jouent, à un moment donné, les conditions de possibilités d'un débat citoyen. Ceci est analysé selon une entrée méthodologique qui articule analyse sémiologique et enquête ethnographique (entretiens et observations) : nous abordons les dispositifs (sites web participatifs, réunions publiques) comme des lieux de prise de parole, plus ou moins imbriqués selon les procédures, et entre lesquels les participants et leurs discours circulent. Nous souhaitons ainsi éviter deux apories. La première serait de ne traiter des dispositifs qu'à partir de l'analyse discursive des échanges réalisés, ce qui revient à penser comme naturels et non sémiotisés les formats de la délibération (Doury, Marcoccia, 2007). La seconde serait de considérer ces dispositifs comme des lieux " formatant " et d'ignorer la possibilité que les individus peuvent produire quelque chose d'autre que le projet des dispositifs. La communication sera structurée en trois <b>volets</b> : Dans un premier temps, nous proposons une caractérisation globale des deux procédures de participation étudiées en mettant en relief l'intersémioticité en jeu dans les dispositifs qui imbriquent interactions en face à face et communication scripturale c'est-à-dire des statuts sémiotiques hétérogènes. Dans un deuxième temps, cette caractérisation nous permet de détailler finement les modèles et les normes en jeu - quelles formes de prise de parole sont suggérées, indiquées par les différents formats, à quels outillages conceptuels renvoient-ils ? Dans un troisième temps, nous questionnons la manière dont les participants interprètent le projet des dispositifs et " font avec " ces modèles et ces normes énonciatives. Nous relevons notamment les traces de leurs trajectoires au sein des dispositifs et décrivons la circulation de leurs discours dans les différents formats et dans le temps, témoignant d'un usage tactique des modalités d'expression mises à leur disposition...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} how underground or alternative cultural activities, {{which we call}} off, could work for urban development much as mainstream cultures, or in, do. We propose that underground cultural activities {{are an important part}} of the cultural landscape of a city and, in this way, could be considered an important actor of urban development. As many authors have shown, culture is nowadays a key element of urban development. First, in the major urban redevelopment projects of the last two decades, there was often a cultural facility flagship, a museum or convention center for example. It is especially true in the case of waterfront or industrial wasteland redevelopments. Second, the artists are often pioneers in the gentrification process. The presence of artists has become meaningful for a neighborhood and has increased the real estate value of a place. Third, cultural and artistic activities are very important factors in building a positive image of a city. It markets the city as an innovative and creative place, two fundamental qualities essential to success in the global inter-city competition. Indeed, it is argued that a strong and dynamic cultural framework provides many leisure opportunities for inhabitants and tourists. Cultural activities are therefore increasingly becoming a marketing strategy to attract firms and people to visit or to settle down in a particular city; and cultural tourism is an engine for urban tourism. And finally, many predict that cultural activities are going to be one of the most important economical activities in the city, both by creating direct value and employment and by developing the tourist industry. But, most of these authors considered mainstream cultures. Our purpose is to demonstrate how underground cultures could also work with these topics. By underground or alternative culture, we mean all kinds of cultural activities that are not subsidized and that have no commercial value. But, because they are a part of the ‘art world' and should not be considered as separate from the mainstream cultural world, we prefer to use another semantic scheme in our thesis. We are using the concept of ‘in culture / off culture'(which is used to explain what is happening in the major art festivals). The in is organized and planned, while the off is spontaneous and opportunist; the off is free of commercial, academic or trend constraints, so it is a creative and innovative space; the in draws from the off new ideas and new talents; the off needs the in to build its legitimacy; and, little by little, the off becomes the real festival: the place to show and to be, the real engine of the festival which attracts more people and more artists until a new off of the off appears [...] . In much the same way, in our study {{we consider}} underground cultures as “off culture”, and mainstream culture as “in culture”. Our research is focused on the artistic squats as an example and a syncretism of off culture. Indeed, they can be considered both as the space of the off culture and as the off spaces of culture. This is one of the original features of this research: using artistic squats as a comprehensive key to analyze and understand urban changes. For this reason, we needed to develop an original methodology. We propose to implement three different kinds of methodological research, each focusing on one of the topics already detailed and all based on artistic squats issues. These works will focus on the Parisian case, but also on other European and global metropolis, such as San Francisco, New York, Toronto, Berlin, London, [...] . by our personal experiences or by bibliographic review. Concerning economical issues, we will most likely not implement empirical research, but it undoubtedly would be of some interest to do a bibliographically based comparison with the theory of innovation and creativity. On the other hand, a literature review has been done on the changes in cultural practices and taste and on sociology of art and artists. We will also consider, as a background theoretical framework, ‘reflexive modernity', ‘aesthetic reflexivity' and ‘hypertext society' theories as well as ‘networks society' and ‘global cities' theories and ‘creative city' and ‘innovative society' theories in our study. Our three research focuses are the following: - Could off cultures be flagships for urban development? According to many authors, one of the key elements for a successful urban redevelopment project is a cultural flagship. We suggest that this flagship could be an off cultural flagship. Off culture spaces are as meaningful as in culture spaces. We argue that urban planners use off places as a flagship in urban redevelopment strategies. So, how could planners integrate these off spaces in urban projects? We study three urban projects, based on interviews and officials materials analyzes. We are considering a case where planners finally decided to integrate a off space in the urban redevelopment project (Les Frigos in the ZAC Paris-Rive Gauche). The second case (La Chapelle-Stalingrad regeneration project) shows how off culture are used as a tool for planning, by cleaning and securing a decaying area. Off artists become planners' pathfinder. They are symbolic shifter from decay to glamour. Then, the real planning project could start. Moreover, this example puts into relief the role of inhabitants organizations in the cultural-led regeneration planning. Indeed, it seems that culture is the unique acceptable feature for urban projects. What does this culture-oriented claim mean? For whose sake are cultural amenities created? The third project is the Newtown cultural precinct that has been created in Johannesburg (South Africa). In this quite unique urban, social, economic and political context, can culture play a similar role? What are the objectives of such an undertaking? Does this project correspond to the lifestyles and behaviours of the inhabitants? As it is shown with the Parisian example, this kind of urban planning practices are more related to a settlement policy than to a cultural one. - Are off spaces places of gentrification? Following many authors, we are interested in the aesthetic and consumerist explanations of gentrification processes. We propose that off cultures play a role in the gentrification process, and expect that they work by giving a trendy image to a neighborhood, as a creative and bohemian place. So, off cultures could be a meaningful pathfinder of gentrification. To prove our purpose, we implement a methodology based on real estate agents interview. We consider real estate agents as good informers about the evolution of real estate markets and neighborhood social changes. They could help us to understand neighborhood and market changes, to explore the potential for gentrification, and to clarify the role of artists and then of off artists and places in gentrification. To do so, we interview several agents in different neighborhoods, all of them located near artistic squats. At the same time, we realize a statistic analysis of real estate market trends. Nevertheless, the results of the researches are mixed. Local real estate agents use artists as a communication tool. They argue that artists and even off artists create a pleasant atmosphere in the neighbourhood, that could attract other populations. But, real estate statistics do not provide convincing results. The only certainty we can propose is that in general, property prices are not influenced by artistic squats. - Is the off an element of the ‘tourist gaze'? We argue that off cultural spaces could be tourist places by corresponding to the ‘tourist gaze' expectations. Therefore, we do not analyze the tourist (and then economic) impact of off places, but show that off places are important tourist attractions. To do so, we analyze how tourist guidebooks present a city. Indeed, guidebooks writers give meaning to a place by choosing specific places or things to see, and then by interpreting them for the tourists and sometimes by judging them. In this way, tourist guidebooks could be considered as meaningful pathfinder. Based on a comparison between Paris and Berlin, the analysis of several guidebooks shows main differences between the two cities' tourist image. In the Paris case, artistic squats and other off scenes are almost never described in guidebooks. Off is not a part of the city's experience. On the other hand, according to guidebooks, a tourist in Berlin should not avoid visiting one of the many off places. Off is definitely a local attraction. Moreover, off is the Berlin's taste. As we have showed, our PhD is quite ambitious. But it must be considered not as an exhaustive exercise but as an understanding of contemporary urban society proposal. This study help us to understand how off cultures are a part of the city imaginary, and so, how they give meaning to the city. But we also expect that our concept could be used by other scholars or planners for example to understand how urbanity occurs, how a place becomes trendy, or to put into relief relationships between in and off in other sphere. We expect to deliver some comprehensive keys for urban planners such as contemporary gazers. Dans cette thèse, nous montrons dans quelle mesure les pratiques culturelles alternatives, que nous appelons off, participent au développement des grandes métropoles, tout comme cela a été démontré avec la culture institutionnelle, que nous appelons in. Il est couramment admis que la culture est un élément qualifiant dans la concurrence inter-urbaine et est essentielle à la construction de l'image d'une métropole. En effet, la diversité et la qualité de l'offre culturelle et artistique sont des atouts pour attirer des entreprises de pointes dont les cadres sont friands et grands consommateurs de services culturels. D'autre part, l'événementiel culturel est un moteur du tourisme urbain, principalement axé autour du tourisme culturel. Enfin, la culture et l'industrie culturelle représentent aujourd'hui un secteur économique en pleine expansion, et jouent un rôle important dans le développement des grandes métropoles comme Paris, New York, Los Angeles et San Francisco [...] . En terme de développement urbain, ces phénomènes peuvent se manifester de plusieurs manières : • Les lieux culturels sont programmés dans les projets urbains : dans de nombreux programmes de requalification de friches urbaines, de nouveaux équipements culturels et de loisirs ont été aménagés, devenant les portes-drapeaux de la regénération urbaine; • les artistes sont souvent des pionniers de la gentrification. A la recherche de locaux spacieux, peu onéreux et centraux, ils s'installent dans des quartiers dévalorisés, industriels ou populaires; et peu à peu, par leur présence, revalorisent symboliquement le quartier, où de nouvelles populations, attirées par la proximité des artistes, viennent s'installer, entraînant une hausse des prix de l'immobilier. Cela a souvent pour conséquence de chasser les populations les plus pauvres dont les artistes eux-mêmes, incapables de payer les nouveaux loyers; • les espaces d'expression de la culture (musées, galeries, théâtres, patrimoine bâti [...] .) sont les lieux visités par les touristes, devenant les symboles de la ville, reconnus internationalement. Ces observations portent sur ce que l'on peut considérer comme étant la culture institutionnelle, que nous appelons in. Pour notre part, nous proposons que les pratiques culturelles alternatives ou off participent elles-aussi et de manière similaire au développement urbain. Leur présence est révélatrice de la créativité et du dynamisme d'une métropole. Elle est porteuse d'une image positive pour la ville car c'est par la pluralité et la diversité des scènes et des pratiques artistiques que la culture devient un élément de la métropolisation. Nous parlons de culture in et de culture off par analogie aux grands festivals où se côtoient le in et le off. Le in y est programmé et le off opportuniste et spontané; le in s'enrichit par l'existence du off où, par une plus grande liberté, peuvent se produire les innovations; le off a besoin du in pour justifier son existence, trouver une légitimité. Et peu à peu, le off prend le dessus sur le in, attire plus de spectateurs, devient le moteur populaire du festival. Ainsi, dans cette thèse, nous postulons que la culture off joue un rôle dans le développement urbain par complémentarité avec la culture in. Pour cela, nous concentrons nos analyses autour des lieux culturels off (comme par exemple les squats d'artistes) pour montrer en quoi ils contribuent à l'attractivité d'un espace métropolitain. En effet, les lieux off sont l'inscription physique dans l'espace urbain de pratiques artistiques off. Ici, ils ne sont pas l'objet de l'étude, mais le fil conducteur, l'analyseur permettant une compréhension nouvelle des évolutions urbaines contemporaines. Dans cette optique, il s'agit de construire une méthodologie adaptée et novatrice en reprenant les trois grands marqueurs du développement urbain que nous avons présentés précédemment. Ainsi, trois axes et méthodes de recherche sont mis en œuvre : • La régénération urbaine. Comment les lieux culturels off sont-ils intégrés à des projets urbains ? Comment deviennent-ils des constituants d'un nouveau quartier ? Comment les aménageurs conçoivent-ils cette intégration ? Nous nous intéressons particulièrement aux discours produits par les différents acteurs impliqués pour justifier, expliquer et valoriser la présence de lieux off dans des projets d'aménagements (par exemple, l'intégration des Frigos dans la ZAC Paris-Rive gauche). • La gentrification. Dans quelle mesure des lieux off (comme les squats d'artistes) participent-ils à la revalorisation symbolique d'un quartier ? Pour cela, avons réalisé une analyse de données statistiques sur le marché immobilier parisien et des enquêtes auprès d'agents immobiliers afin de comprendre la perception, par des acteurs centraux du marché immobilier, de la présence d'artistes dans un quartier. • Le tourisme urbain. Les squats d'artistes et d'autres éléments de la culture off sont-ils des lieux touristiques ? Participent-ils à l'image touristique des villes ? Pour mettre en évidence cela, nous étudions la construction de l'image touristique des villes à travers une analyse sémiotique de différents guides touristiques. En effet, le guide touristique constitue en soi un corpus intéressant, quoique négligé, pour analyser l'image construite d'un lieu. Il ne reflète pas la réalité du lieu, mais construit et est construit par l'imaginaire porté par ce lieu. Au travers ces trois <b>volets,</b> cette recherche montre comment et dans quelle mesure un lieu off, peut participer au développement urbain. La coexistence des cultures in et off est essentielle à l'effervescence créative d'une métropole, à la fois révélatrice et symbole du dynamisme métropolitain...|$|R
3000|$|How {{frequently}} monitoring or planning issues (Rogat and Linnenbrink-Garcia 2011) can {{be noticed}} in high-level content and low-level content co-regulation episodes (<b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 a); [...]...|$|E
30|$|The {{construct}} of regulation is of primary {{importance in the}} discussion of social dynamics and relationality. It has been used to explain ‘individual and social processes of adaptation, engagement, participation, learning and development’ (<b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b, p. 216).|$|E
30|$|When {{adopting}} a social perspective, {{the concept of}} co-regulation must be proposed and specified. It is a multiple process in collaborative contexts where cognitive, motivational, and emotional aspects of regulation coexist (Salonen et al. 2005; <b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 a, b). These authors suggest {{the existence of a}} continuum from individual regulation within groups to co-regulation as a group dynamic: the regulatory process may occur anywhere ‘between situations where one individual temporarily leads by providing information or taking an informal instructional role’ and ‘co-regulatory metacognitive activity that involves several group members’ (<b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b, p. 130). From a sociocultural point of view (Greeno 2006; Hickey 2003; McCaslin 2004), co-regulation refers to the process by which social context supports or scaffolds individual participation and learning. From a socio-cognitive perspective (Salonen et al. 2005; Vauras et al. 2003; <b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b), it concerns how groups of individuals as multiple self-regulating agents socially regulate each other’s learning. In the recent literature, Schoor et al. (2015) suggest using the term co-regulation to refer to a ‘non-equal relationship with the purpose to scaffold for the appropriation of self-regulation, but not for cooperative and collaborative learning among peers where peer has a predominant role all the time’ (p. 110).|$|E
30|$|In short, {{the present}} paper {{contributes}} to enlarge the body of studies on co-regulation of learning to the specificity of the VET format. Up to now, studies on this issue had been conducted in elementary schools or in higher education (<b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b; Iiskala et al. 2004, 2011; Rogat and Linnenbrink-Garcia 2011; Rogat and Adams-Wiggins 2014; Khosa and <b>Volet</b> 2013). On the one hand, the present study confirms for the VET context at least two observations made in the previous studies in other contexts: the relevance of cognitive processes such as planning and monitoring in regulatory processes (Rogat and Linnenbrink-Garcia 2011; Rogat and Adams-Wiggins 2014) {{and the role of}} tentativeness of explanation and questions in initiating or maintaining high-level content co-regulation episodes (<b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b). On the other hand, despite our hypothesis, we found no significant influence of socioemotional factors on the regulation processes despite some positive correlations. Further research with other activities, other professions and more groups involved would allow a deeper analysis of this topic. Promoting collaborative problem-solving activities in initial VET programs can support not only the development of collaborative skills, so essential in professional daily life but they also contribute {{to improve the quality of}} apprentices’ learning.|$|E
30|$|The {{current study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the co-regulation of learning in small-group contexts, where collaborative cognitive activities based on group problem-solving cases are foreseen. It contributes to extend to the VET context, prior research focussing on social regulation episodes (Järvelä and Järvenojä 2011; Vauras et al. 2003; <b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 a) and analysing the relationship between regulation and interaction variables. Combining the use of two frameworks (<b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b; Rogat and Linnenbrink-Garcia 2011) to analyse group functioning in authentic settings allows for a more thorough {{understanding of how the}} quality of regulation processes can be shaped by the socioemotional aspects necessarily at play when humans interact in (as close as possible to) natural conditions. Several interesting observations can be {{made on the basis of}} our data and in line with the research questions which guided the study.|$|E
30|$|In {{line with}} this trend, the present {{exploratory}} study investigates {{the process of}} regulation of learning {{in the context of}} collaborative group activities aiming at the development of specific professional skills. In particular, we explore under which conditions collaborative learning activities can support interactions in content processing (<b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b). To this aim, we considered the level and quality of content processing and the quality of interaction functioning of the groups from a socioemotional perspective (Rogat and Linnenbrink-Garcia 2011). The present study is nested in the under-researched field of Initial Vocational Education and Training (VET) and is focused on adolescents working in professional situations, while other scholars have focused on university students (<b>Volet</b> et al. 2009 b; Khosa and <b>Volet</b> 2014) or pupils at school (Rogat and Linnenbrink-Garcia 2011). Being embedded both at the company—where the learners work as apprentices—and at school—where they are expected to enhance their theoretical knowledge—represents a rich and inspiring challenge to reinforce their collaborative strengths in both learning locations. Thus, the processes of regulation of learning assume a challenging role in such a VET context: it represents a foundation in the collaborative locations in which the apprentices are embedded. Collaboration skills are central in VET (Lee et al. 2015); being able to work with others and to learn with and from others is inescapable, whether in an office, in a plant or in the kitchen of a restaurant. Chefs, for instance, despite being often under stress and time pressure need to co-regulate each member’s contribution, to ultimately ensure the group’s performance.|$|E
