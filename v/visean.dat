5|$|By the <b>Visean</b> (mid-Carboniferous) stage, {{the early}} {{tetrapods}} had radiated into {{at least three}} or four main branches. Recognizable basal-group tetrapods {{are representative of the}} temnospondyls (e.g. Eryops) lepospondyls (e.g. Diplocaulus), anthracosaurs, which were the relatives and ancestors of the Amniota, and possibly the baphetids, which are thought to be related to temnospondyls and whose status as a main branch is yet unresolved. Depending on which authorities one follows, modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) are most probably derived from either temnospondyls or lepospondyls (or possibly both, although this is now a minority position).|$|E
25|$|Early Carboniferous saw the {{radiation}} {{of the family}} Loxommatidae, a mysterious group {{that may have been}} the ancestors or sister taxon of the higher groups. By the <b>Visean</b> age of mid-Carboniferous times the labyrinthodonts had radiated into at least three main branches. Recognizable groups are representative of the temnospondyls, lepospondyls and reptile-like amphibians, the latter which were the relatives and ancestors of the Amniota.|$|E
500|$|The most basal {{group of}} temnospondyls is the {{superfamily}} Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous [...] genus Edops {{and the family}} Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the <b>Viséan</b> stage of the Early Carboniferous. Recent analyses place Dendrerpetontidae outside Edopoidea in a more derived position. Other primitive temnospondyls include Capetus and Iberospondylus. Saharastega and Nigerpeton, both described in 2005 from Niger, are also primitive yet come from the Late Permian. They are almost 40 million years younger than other basal temnospondyls, implying a long ghost lineage of species that are not yet known in the fossil record.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Visean,</b> <b>Viséan</b> or Visian is an {{age in the}} ICS {{geologic}} timescale or a {{stage in}} the stratigraphic column. It is {{the second stage of}} the Mississippian, the lower subsystem of the Carboniferous. The <b>Visean</b> lasted from [...] to [...] Ma. It follows the Tournaisian age/stage and is followed by the Serpukhovian age/stage.|$|E
50|$|The series {{starts in}} the Lower <b>Viséan</b> with shaly to sandy sediments, {{followed}} by greywackes, conglomerates and carbonates in the Middle <b>Viséan</b> (the Tournaisian is generally missing in the Massif Central, exceptions being some scattered occurrences in the Morvan). Very important are the transgressing Tufs anthracifères in the Upper <b>Viséan</b> (dated between 335 and 330 MA BP). They consist of pyroclastic tuffs with rhyolitic or dacitic composition, cover a large area and reach large thicknesses. The name is derived from occasional interbedded anthracite layers that indicate a paralic environment near a shallow sea.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Visean</b> {{stage was}} {{introduced}} by Belgian geologist André Dumont in 1832. Dumont called this stage after the city of Visé in the Belgian province of Liège. Before being used as an international stage, the <b>Visean</b> stage {{was part of the}} (West) European regional geologic time scale, in which it followed the Tournaisian stage and is followed by the Namurian stage. In the North American regional scale, the <b>Visean</b> stage correlates with the upper Osagean, the Meramecian and lower Chesterian stages. In the Chinese regional time scale, it correlates with the lower and middle Tatangian series.|$|E
