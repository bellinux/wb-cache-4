25|$|AMC also {{produced}} a one-off Sportabout for Gucci's personal use. The car was {{powered by a}} 5-litre V8 engine and had a three-speed automatic transmission. The interior featured leather was door panels, cargo area {{as well as the}} front and rear centre arm rests. The doors and custom-designed bucket seats received red and green striped inserts. The instrument panel was given a centrally located, pull-out writing desk, graced with a scribbler and a sterling silver bamboo pen. A map {{light at the end of}} a flexible arm extended from the right side of the desk, the left carried a <b>vanity</b> <b>mirror,</b> also on a flex stem. The back of the front seats popped open. The one on the passenger's side served as a snack table or provided a flat surface for playing games. The compartment behind the driver concealed a miniature liquor cabinet, complete with four sterling silver tumbles and two decanters—all decorated with red and green enamel stripes.|$|E
25|$|VAM {{originally}} intended the Rally SST to include as standard equipment only the same accessories as the 1981 Rally GT and the optional equipment {{list of the}} 1981 Rally AMX except for its own share of exclusive and not available accessories. However, the same story as the 1980 Rally GT repeated itself for the 1981 Rally SST. The need to stress differences between not just the three-version Rally line but also the new Spirit-based Lerma model forced VAM to act any way it could. Once again, the company's sales department determined that virtually all Rally SST units included all optional convenience accessories available in the Rally line from the factory. The final list of equipment for the Rally SST consisted of a tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, electric antenna, full light group including reading dome light, AM-FM stereo radio, quartz clock, center console with compartment and armrest with rear ashtray, lighted <b>vanity</b> <b>mirror,</b> side armrest safety reflectors, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, leather wrapped sports steering wheel, inside hood release, air conditioning, parcel shelf, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, dual remote-controlled mirrors, reclining bucket seats, retractable seatbelts, and removable trunk cover.|$|E

2500|$|The {{interior}} was very well-appointed for this size of car, reflecting a determination {{not to let}} the car compete on price in the volume end of the small car market (already by now contested by the Citroën Ami). [...] The Panhard 24 {{was one of the first}} cars to offer optional seat belts. [...] The front seat backs were adjustable for rake and the seats were also – unusually at this time – adjustable for height. [...] The passenger's sun visor included a <b>vanity</b> <b>mirror</b> with its own light and the steering wheel was adjustable. [...] The car also boasted an unusually elaborate heater.|$|E
2500|$|For the 2007 model year, the RTX trim {{package was}} {{introduced}} in the U.S. market as a unique tow-ready version of the Ridgeline. [...] Also the RTL trim package was modified making the moonroof and XM Satellite Radio options standard equipment with that trim and its two-tone leather upholstery was redone with new monotone leather. [...] Honda also added a driver-side illuminated <b>vanity</b> <b>mirror</b> to all trim levels. [...] Lastly, Honda swapped three of its exterior colors for slightly different shades of the same base colors while adding [...] "Nimbus Gray Metallic" [...] to the color palette, as well as [...] "Taffeta White" [...] for the Canadian market.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1960, a five-door {{station wagon}} was added (WP310). The P310 was {{powered by the}} 1.2L Nissan E engine. A smaller-engine version (simply called [...] "310") was powered by the 1.0L Nissan C engine. The P311 and P312 (powered by the 60hp 1.2L Nissan E-1 engine) also had smaller-engined {{versions}} ("311" [...] and [...] "312") that were powered by the 45hp 1.0L Nissan C-1 engine. The 310 and 311 were equipped with a 3-speed manual transmission (fully synchronized for the 311 and 312). The station wagon was also available for the 311 and 312. The 312 was also available in a deluxe version (DP312). A trim model called the [...] "Fancy Deluxe" [...] (model code DP312-L) was marketed for the female driver; it featured a pale yellow exterior, pale yellow/grey interior, high heel shoe holder under the dash, a <b>vanity</b> <b>mirror</b> {{on the back of}} the driver's side sun visor, a turn signal relay that played music, curtains, automatic clutch, and bigger mirrors. By February 1961, a 1.2L overhead-valve engine (codenamed E-1) became an option on a higher-trim DX model.|$|E
50|$|Other {{options include}} furniture-quality service trays with <b>vanity</b> <b>mirrors</b> and fold down lights, and a {{remote-controlled}} rear-seat entertainment {{system in the}} front row headrests.|$|R

2500|$|The 1980 VAM Americans {{incorporated}} all changes {{designed by}} AMC for the Concord that included C-pillar {{windows on the}} ECD, opera windows on the GFS, full-length tail lights, a standard flexible seven-blade fan in all engines, [...] speedometer. For the first time, the cars came with a VAM-designed grille made of aluminum. The American ECD came with the [...] six as standard equipment, meaning that all high-trim VAM Americans were powered by the largest six engine from this point ahead. The American GFS switched to column-shifted transmission control (retaining the individual seat configuration) and the American DL wagon was available {{for the first time}} with simulated wood bodyside trim. A lighted <b>vanity</b> <b>mirror</b> was now standard equipment for the three top end models. All three base models included the heater as standard equipment regardless of transmission type, as well as high back front seats with adjustable headrests. All models featured a locking gas cap and high trim models had safety reflectors fixed onto the door armrests. The high trim 1980 models were the first VAM cars ever to be available with intermittent wipers, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, electric antenna, and an AM/FM stereo radio (instead of the previous monaural units).|$|E
2500|$|The Rally GT and the Rally SST did not {{disappear}} completely this year; {{this can be}} described that they were downgraded from being trim levels to optional packages that were offered by several VAM dealerships. A Rally SST equivalent was created including most of the still available optional items including automatic transmission, air conditioning, rear wiper and washer, reading dome light, intermittent wipers, lighted <b>vanity</b> <b>mirror</b> on passenger's side sunvisor, and built-in side armrest safety reflectors. The only option that were virtually separate at all times were the new tape player, electric antenna and mirror controls. This set of components was called [...] "paquete de lujo" [...] by VAM's dealerships and the units carrying it had no particular name or designation. On {{the other side of}} the coin, there was a second optional package for Rally AMXs with manual transmission that included all mechanical components of the Rally GT 4.6 / X engine (302 degree camshaft, headers, Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor, counterweight-modified high-acceleration Prestolite electronic distributor and 3.31:1 rear gears) except for the ported head. Unlike the luxury package, units equipped with the performance one did get a special name that was either Rally ZX or Rally TX, depending on the dealership that sold the unit.|$|E
2500|$|... 1978 was the Corvette's twenty fifth anniversary, and all 78's {{featured}} silver anniversary {{nose and}} fuel door emblems. A new fastback rear window {{was the most}} dramatic and noticeable styling change, giving the ten-year-old C3 Corvette body style a fresh lease on life. The fixed-glass fastback benefited both aerodynamics and increased the usable luggage space behind the seats while improving rearward visibility in the bargain. A shade was installed that could be pulled forward to cover the rear compartment to protect cargo and carpet against the unrelenting sun. The tachometer and speedometer were redesigned to match the new “aircraft styled” center console and gauge cluster first seen the previous year. Redesigned interior door panels were also new {{as well as an}} actual glove box was added in front of the passenger seat, replacing the map pockets of previous years. Available options now included power door locks, a power antenna, dual rear speakers and a CB radio. The optional convenience group, introduced the previous year, now included intermittent (delay) wipers, floor mats, and the passenger side <b>vanity</b> <b>mirror</b> was an upgraded illuminated unit. The base L-48 engine generated Those destined for California or high altitude areas produced [...] Gone was the chrome-plated ignition shielding over the distributor, replaced with a metal-lined black plastic unit. The single-snorkel air intake used since 1976 was changed to a dual-snorkel set-up on L-82 equipped cars helping to boost that output to [...] L-82 engines were also now fitted with an aluminum intake manifold which saved 24pounds compared to the cast iron unit of previous years. The Corvette converted to metric tires with the P225/70R15 as standard. Wider P255/60R15 tires were available as an option and required fender trimming from the factory for clearance. The fuel tank capacity increased from 17 gal to 24 gal on all cars. To make room for the larger tank, a smaller (P195/80D15) space saver spare tire was utilized.|$|E

50|$|A sunroof {{package was}} optional, {{featuring}} power sliding glass sunroof with tilt feature, and dual illuminated visor <b>vanity</b> <b>mirrors.</b> An Audio package, featuring a 340-watt Rockford Fosgate 6-CD audio system, with eight speakers (two subwoofers, four mid-range woofers, and two tweeters) was also available.|$|R
50|$|For 1996, {{the climate}} {{controls}} were again redesigned; while Cartier Designer Editions featured genuine wood trim {{on the dashboard}} and door panels. In 1997, few changes were made: the rear center armrest added a pair of cup holders, while Cartier models gained rear-seat <b>vanity</b> <b>mirrors</b> mounted in the headliner.|$|R
2500|$|The {{greatest}} novelty for 1981 was {{the introduction}} of a third trim level within the VAM's Rally line, the company's first high-end luxury sporty model called Rally SST. This version carried the same mechanicals as the Rally AMX except that it came equipped from the factory with the three-speed automatic transmission. Appearance wise, the car carried bright trim on the rocker panels, wheel lips, drip rails, B-pillar molding plus door and side glass bases. The moldings for the windshield and rear glass were also bright instead of blacked out while both bumpers were chromed. The lower portions of the sides, doors and front fenders carried wide moldings with a horizontal six-stripe pattern. The in-house five-spoke wheels held AMC's [...] "Noryl" [...] wheel cover design. Finally, chromed squared mirrors with inside controls were fitted to the doors. The Rally SST is the closest VAM counterpart to the AMC Spirits in terms of appearance and the Mexican equivalent of the US AMC Spirit Limited model. To reduce the sportiness and enforce the luxury appointments of the line, a fender-mounted electric antenna was made standard equipment so the AMX's sporty roof-mounted diagonal design would not be present. For this same reason, the rear spoiler was not available. Among its unique characteristics, the Rally SST included side armrest safety reflectors and sun visor lighted <b>vanity</b> <b>mirror</b> from the factory, which were unavailable in the AMXs and GTs. The interior of the Rally SST was the same as the one of the GTs and AMXs with the only exceptions of the center console having an open compartment in place of the auxiliary gauges and the quartz electric digital clock instead of both tachometer types. Despite the luxury focus, the sporty aspects were retained {{in the form of the}} individual reclining Recaro-type bucket seats, center console with armrest and rear ashtray, floor-mounted transmission, leather-wrapped sports steering wheel and the full suspension package with rear sway bar.|$|E
2500|$|The 1982 {{recession}} in Mexico weakened {{the economy and}} hit the automotive market and industry, with VAM being no exception. The dire situation, coupled with a government decree banning the importation of automotive accessories took its toll in both standard and optional equipment of all car lines and marques sold in Mexico. All high-trim Americans for 1982 were no longer available with power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, tilt steering column, quartz digital clock, and rear defroster. Items that were standard for 1981 such as the remote controls for the door mirrors, the intermittent wipers, the reading dome light, and <b>vanity</b> <b>mirror</b> were put on the option list. The rest of the equipment was virtually unchanged from 1981. Despite this, {{there was a new}} optional accessory for the year, an AM/FM/stereo tape player radio. All three high-trim editions featured a new VAM-designed luxurious grille with a rectangular pattern, while the three base models used AMC's square-pattern design borrowed from U.S. market Eagle models. The GFS, ECD and DL models also got a set of plain VAM-designed bumper end caps with a chrome molding on the top side edge. Along with these, AMC's Eagle nerfing strip design was also used in both bumpers. The headlight bezels changed to blacked out units in their internal sections keeping the chromed surrounding areas. All-new aluminum road wheels also replaced the previously-imported Noryl wheel covers. A unique version of the year was the American ECD, which featured a lengthened and squared rear roofline with smaller and more rectangular C-pillar windows that had a small [...] "ECD" [...] sand-blasted logo. Other changes were black rear side window surrounds for the American DL wagon that were originally created by AMC for the Eagle models, while the American GFS had plain side window panels. Both versions of the three base models were the same as in 1981 except for the grille design, new door panels, and the absence of the quartz clock in the automatic cars.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the turmoil}} of 1982, Renault de México took over VAM from the Mexican {{government}} in February 1983. As with AMC, Renault was most interested in the Jeep line, VAM's production facilities, and its established dealer network. As soon as the agreement was finalized, Renault ordered the termination of VAM's passenger car line so it would not compete with its own products. VAM's 1983 models existed mainly to use up the highest possible amount of existing inventories as well as fulfilling previous agreements with sourcing companies. The American line for 1983 soldiered on in a very limited form. The American GFS and American ECD models were virtually not produced for the final year. Both sedan models existed as the base manual and semi-equipped automatics units. Cars with manual transmissions had a parcel shelf as standard equipment while the units with automatic transmission featured aluminum road wheels, the same door panels and seat designs as the previous GFS and ECD models along with their respective door armrest safety reflectors. The two-door automatic models had a reclining mechanism for their front seats. Regardless of the transmission, standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, and dual remote mirrors. The American DL station wagon model was virtually the only high-trim American model to be available. For 1983, the base automatic and the basic DL were merged into a single version alongside the equipped DL and the base manual, creating three versions for the year unlike the four {{of the last two}} years. The mid-range version had the same equipment as the sedan models with automatic transmission of the year, it was also called [...] "American DL" [...] and carried the same woodgrain panels and moldings that were never seen in the base automatics of the previous two years. The differences between the mid-range DL and the top-of-the-line DL are the presence of the AM/FM stereo radio, reading dome light, lighted <b>vanity</b> <b>mirror,</b> intermittent wipers and air conditioning in the latter model. The only optional accessories available were the AM/FM stereo tape player radio, remote-controlled door mirrors and electric antenna. Only the top-of-the-line DL carried the [...] I6 while the rest had the [...] Cars equipped with air conditioning included the larger 282 engine. Leftover 1983 VAM Americans were sold as 1984 models.|$|E

50|$|Other {{features}} such as a moonroof, <b>vanity</b> <b>mirrors,</b> cruise control and a rear wiper were eliminated to save weight. Air conditioning was an option.
