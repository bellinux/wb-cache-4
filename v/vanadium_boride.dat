40|$|<b>Vanadium</b> <b>boride</b> (VB 2) {{coatings}} {{have been}} less concerned, although they have advantages of super hardness as well as self-lubrication. In this study, VB 2 coatings were deposited by pulsed DC magnetron sputtering, {{and the effect of}} deposition parameters on the microstructure, mechanical and tribological properties of coatings were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nano- and micro-indentation, and ball-on-disk tribometer. Under the growth condition with high adatom mobility, the coatings exhibited complete (001) orientation and dense texture. A nanocomposite structure that nanocolumns were separated by a secondary phase was especially observed in the coating deposited at 773 K. Both hardness and intrinsic stress of the coatings were improved substantially by increasing the substrate bias or the pulse frequency. The coating deposited at- 30 V and 250 kHz, had the hardness of similar to 43. 6 GPa and the compressive stress of similar to 2. 0 GPa. Under the load of 2 N, the friction coefficients were similar to 0. 7 against Al 2 O 3 counterpart, and the wear rates were in the range of 7 x 10 (- 16) - 8 x 10 (- 16) m(3) /N m. Under the load of 5 N, the coatings with low intrinsic stress showed better wear resistance, with the wear rate of 10 (- 16) m(3) /N m. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Due to its {{excellent}} thermophysical properties, tungsten {{has been}} used as structural materials for divertor components of fusion reactors. With the development of technology, the helium cooled high performance divertor requires the high reliable joining between tungsten and ferritic martensitic high chromium steel. However, the difference of thermal expansion coefficients between tungsten and steel causes high thermally residual stresses, which will yield failure of the joint. Therefore, the preparation of the joint between tungsten and steel is a key issue for divertor application. A brazing process, using rapidly solidified Ni-based foil-type filler and a vanadium slice as intermediate materials, was developed to investigate the joining of tungsten and steel for divertor components, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the joint were also studied. The elements and phases compositions in the boning regions were analyzed by electron probe microanalysis and X-ray diffraction. Micro-hardness distribution and tensile strength of joint were measured by nano-indenter and mechanical testing machine, respectively. The results indicated that the integral bonding was achieved at the bonding regions of the brazed joint. The typical microstructure of the joint was consisted of W/V and V/steel brazed seams separated by a V slice. The hard and brittle vanadium borides with 25 GPa hardness were produced at the W/V and V/steel brazed seams. The as-bonded W/steel joint with tensile strength of 143 MPa was obtained, and specimens appeared a brittle fracture mode and fractured in the brittle <b>vanadium</b> <b>boride</b> layers during tensile testing...|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructure}} and {{the mechanical}} behavior of two modified boron-containing tool steels were investigated at {{low and high}} temperatures. Both steels were processed by powder metallurgy methods, involving gas atomization and hot isostatic pressing at 180 MPa for 2 h at 900, 1000 and 1100 °C. The microstructure of the consolidated tool steels consist of a ferrite matrix and carboboride M 23 (C,B) 6 particles. The 1 wt. %C- 1 wt. %B tool steel contains, in addition, small particles of vanadium carbide and <b>vanadium</b> <b>boride.</b> An ultimate tensile strength of 300 MPa at 700 °C was obtained in the 1 wt. %C- 1 wt. %B tool steel. At testing temperatures in the austenitic phase, a stress exponent of about 5 was obtained and the activation energy for creep {{was related to the}} activation energy for iron self-diffusion in austenite. This suggests that slip creep is the controlling deformation mechanism in the 1 wt. %C- 1 wt. %B tool steel tested in this temperature range. At testing temperatures in the ferritic phase the creep rate was slower than that predicted by the slip creep equation. This was attributed to the presence of fine second phase particles. On the other hand, the 1. 5 wt. %C- 0. 5 wt. %B tool steel showed an ultimate tensile strength somewhat lower than 300 MPa at 700 °C. At testing temperatures in the austenitic phase, a stress exponent of about 2 was obtained and the activation energy for creep was related to the activation energy for iron self-diffusion in austenite. This suggests that grain boundary sliding is the controlling deformation mechanism in the 1. 5 wt. %C- 0. 5 wt. %B tool steel tested in this temperature range. A contribution from slip creep exists at testing temperatures in the ferritic phase. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{believe that}} {{development}} of {{wear resistant coating}} compositions basedon W Bis an important task aimed at improvement of durability of working parts of 2 2 machines. X-ray analysis of coating composition W B – FeCr – FeV {{is presented in the}} 2 2 article. The results of chemical and X-ray analyses of the coating composition comprisingW B – FeCr – 10 % FeV demonstrate that, when the weld metal formed, W Bpartially 2 5 2 5 dissociates to form <b>borides,</b> <b>vanadium,</b> iron, and chromium. High iron content in thesolid solution causes reduction of its hardness and wear resistance. A 20 % increase in the tungsten boride content leads to formation of elongated grains in the matrix of ironborides, <b>vanadium</b> and chromium <b>borides.</b> A composition containing 4 % of W Bhas a 2 5 fine-grained structure, and it is characterized by the absence of FeB in the weld metal,and its absence means lower brittleness. In the metal, carbon borides are formed to assure its high hardness. In the matrix, a significant amount of vanadium and chromium is dissolved to help improve its hardness. The study shows that the composition containing 40 % of W Bhas a fine-grained structure, and it is characterized by the absence of FeB 2 5 in the weld metal. Therefore, the coating layer demonstrates the highest resistance toabrasion. Исследована структура наплавленного металла на основе W B.

40|$|Purpose. Development of multi-alloyed filler for {{abrasive}} wear-resistant composites. Methodology. The {{methods of}} microstructural, X-ray and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses {{were used to}} achieve research purpose. Micro-mechanical properties of structural constituents and abrasive wear-resistance of composites were determined. Findings. The complete dissolution of chromium and <b>vanadium</b> in the <b>borides</b> of Fe 2 В and FeВ that are initial structural constituents of Fe–В–С peritectic alloys has been established. These elements primarily dissolve in iron monoboride. Dissolution of molybdenum and niobium is not practically observed. As a result the phases of Мо 2 В, Мо 2 (В,С) or NbВ 2 {{can be seen in}} the structure. Alloying with chromium and vanadium increases compression strength and crack resistance coefficient, but that with molybdenum and niobium enhances total microhardness and hardness of the alloys. Structure formation of the interfaces between the filler and the binder of the composites based on МNМts 20 - 20 binder is governed by dissolution and diffusion processes when multi-alloyed (Fe–В–С) alloy is applied as filler of the composites. The phase and the structural composition of contact interaction zones can be explained by re-crystallization of the filler surface layers after dissolution caused by contact with the molten binder. Consequently the macroheterogeneous structure of the composites is free of defects and strong adhesion between the filler and the binder is assured. Contact interaction intensity can be controlled by the choice of temperature- and-time infiltration regimes. Originality. The peculiarities in the formation of structure and properties of Fe 2 В- and FeВ-based solid solutions observed in the structure of the Fe–В–С peritectic alloys were investigated that allowed us to recommend composition of multicomponent alloy to be applied as filler of (Cu–Ni–Mn) -matrix macroheterogeneous composites. Practical value. Owing to multiple alloying of the filler based on Fe–В–С peritectic alloy with chromium, vanadium, molybdenum and niobium the abrasive wear resistance of composite coatings can be compared with that of tungsten-containing coatings, which ensures saving of expensive and deficient materials...|$|R
