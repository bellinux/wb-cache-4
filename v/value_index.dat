Therefore, over-reactions might capture by measuring earnings surprise vary with past return levels. In this paper, we propose a new index for an effective investment strategy to capture the return-reversal effect using both Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Inverted DEA in order to consider the above characteristics of the market. Our investment strategy using the new index exhibits better performance than the naive return-reversal strategy that only uses past returns or earnings surprise. In addition, the correlations between our new index and commonly used <b>value</b> <b>indices</b> are insignificant, and the <b>value</b> <b>indices</b> cannot represent the over-valued (under-valued) situations perfectly.
