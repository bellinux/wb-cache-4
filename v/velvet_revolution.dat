5|$|By 26 August a new Czechoslovak {{representative}} {{requested the}} whole issue {{be removed from the}} Security Council's agenda. Shirley Temple Black visited Prague in August 1968 to prepare for becoming the US Ambassador for a free Czechoslovakia. However, after the 21 August invasion she became part of a U.S. Embassy-organized convoy of vehicles that evacuated U.S. citizens from the country. In August 1989, she returned to Prague as U.S. Ambassador, three months before the <b>Velvet</b> <b>Revolution</b> that ended 41 years of Communist rule.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>Velvet</b> <b>Revolution,</b> an {{amendment}} act No. 49/1990 Coll. was adopted. Under the new law, any person older than 18, with clean criminal record, {{physically and mentally}} sound that did not pose threat of misuse of the firearm could have license issued. License may have been issued for purpose of hunting, sport shooting, exercise of profession and in special cases also for protection. Newly, denial of license could be challenged in court.|$|E
5|$|The gun {{law in the}} Czech Republic {{is quite}} liberal. It is mostly caused {{by the fact that}} after the fall of {{communist}} regime people wanted to regain their rights {{to keep and bear arms}} and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the <b>Velvet</b> <b>Revolution</b> are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|No one {{can prove}} {{conclusively}} {{that he was}} a primary cause of the end of communism. However, the major figures on all sides—not just Lech Wałęsa, the Polish Solidarity leader, but also Solidarity's arch-opponent, General Wojciech Jaruzelski; not just the former American president George Bush Senior but also the former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev—now agree that he was. I would argue the historical case in three steps: without the Polish Pope, no Solidarity revolution in Poland in 1980; without Solidarity, no dramatic change in Soviet policy towards eastern Europe under Gorbachev; without that change, no <b>velvet</b> <b>revolutions</b> in 1989.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The French Revolution {{has ceased}} to be the {{paradigm}} case of progressive social revolution. Historians increasingly argue that {{the heart of the}} revolutionary experience was the Terror and that the Terror prefigured 20 th-century totalitarianism. This article contests that view and argues that totali-tarianism is too blunt a category to distinguish between varying experiences of revolution and further questions if revolutionary outcomes are ideologically determined. It argues that by widening the set of revolutions to include 17 th and 18 th century cases, as well as the <b>velvet</b> <b>revolutions</b> of the 1990 s, we can reinterpret the French Revolution as a characteristic case of democratic tran-sition with particular features...|$|R

In Eastern and Central Europe, courts are now defining the powers of new regimes committed {{to the rule of law}}. One of the most difficult issues faced by these courts is how to maintain a commitment to the rule of law while serving the principles of substantive justice. In an attempt to reconcile these competing interests, courts have, in effect, continued 2 ̆ 2 revolutions 2 ̆ 2 within the framework of the law...|$|R
5|$|Poles {{formed the}} largest ethnic group in Cieszyn Silesia in the 19th century, {{but at the}} {{beginning}} of the 20th century the Czech population grew. The Czechs and Poles collaborated on resisting Germanization movements, but this collaboration ceased after World War I. In 1920 the region of Zaolzie was incorporated into Czechoslovakia after the Polish–Czechoslovak War. Since then the Polish population demographically decreased. In 1938 it was annexed by Poland in the context of the Munich Agreement and in 1939 by Nazi Germany. The region was then given back to Czechoslovakia after World War II. Polish organizations were re-created, but were banned by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. After the <b>Velvet</b> <b>Revolution</b> Polish organizations were re-created again and Zaolzie had adopted bilingual signs.|$|E
5|$|The Prague Spring is {{featured}} in several works of literature. Milan Kundera set his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being during the Prague Spring. It follows {{the repercussions of}} increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population. A film version was released in 1988. The Liberators, by Viktor Suvorov, is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, {{from the point of}} view of a Soviet tank commander. Rock 'n' Roll, a play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright Tom Stoppard, references the Prague Spring, as well as the 1989 <b>Velvet</b> <b>Revolution.</b> Heda Margolius Kovály also ends her memoir Under a Cruel Star with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion, and her reflections upon these events.|$|E
5|$|From 1972 to 1976, Remek {{studied at}} the Gagarin Air Force Academy. Upon his return to Czechoslovakia in 1976, he was {{promoted}} to captain and appointed deputy commander of his fighter regiment, after which Remek went back to Russia to train for the Soviet-led space program. Following his return from space in March 1978, Remek spent time in the Czechoslovak People's Army (ČSLA) staff as the deputy director of the Flight Research Institute in Prague. In 1986, Remek became the deputy commander of a flight division based in Čáslav. In 1988 he graduated from Voroshilov-Staff Academy of Soviet Air Force and was appointed to his highest command, as deputy of the 2nd Air Defense Division stationed in Moravia. Following the <b>Velvet</b> <b>Revolution</b> in 1989, Remek was relegated to a role as Director of the Museum for Aviation and Astronautics in Prague. Following his retirement from the air force in 1995, Remek represented Czech firm CZ Strakonice and joint venture CZ–Turbo-GAZ in Moscow.|$|E
40|$|The {{series of}} <b>Velvet</b> <b>revolutions</b> in 1989, which {{brought about the}} {{collapse}} of communism in Europe, seem to have vindicated those political theorists and activists who believed in the possibility of non-violent power. The relative success of the 1989 revolutions has validated a new paradigm of revolutionary change {{based on the assumption that}} radical changes were attainable through moderate means. Yet the legacy of these non-violent revolutions also points towards the limits of political strategies fundamentally opposed to violence. The article shows that the key architects of non-violent revolutions in 1989 were well aware of the contingent nature of all political actions, and were thus willing to take risks in their pursuit of freedom. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|However, {{some simple}} and {{powerful}} theoretical knowledge does exist; here one has just {{to mention the}} discussions on methodological individualism and collectivism, on open and closed societies, and {{last but not least}} Hayek's ideas on spontaneous order which delivers an appropriate explanation for the radical behavioral adaptations which have taken place in the states of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), leading to a dramatical institutional change. Because the citizen of CEE put more trust into freedom and market system than into paternalism and central planning, perhaps mainly determined by the better performance of the market economies to satisfy material preferences, the peaceful or <b>velvet</b> <b>revolutions</b> took place. The overstated hopes on democracy and market economy have made the hardships of the big bang bearable at least in {{the first phase of the}} transition process. Disillusions and sobering in the next phases have changed behavioral patterns as well as the sequencing of institutional change and reforms, but up to now not endangered the overall development...|$|R
40|$|Although Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Caucasus and Central Asia {{share the}} common {{experience}} of {{the demise of the}} Warsaw Pact and the fall of the former Soviet Union, the political situation in those countries today is markedly diverse. 20 years {{after the fall of the}} Berlin wall and the iron curtain, most states in Central and Eastern Europe are considered consolidated democracies and the states of ex-Yugoslavia, albeit to a different extent, have also made significant progress towards democracy in the wake of the civil wars of the 1990 s. Moreover, the orange and <b>velvet</b> <b>revolutions</b> in Ukraine and Georgia have been considered a model for further democratization in post-Soviet states. Many of the aforementioned “success stories” are linked to factors such as the socializing role of the European Union and NATO. Furthermore, the Council of Europe and the OSCE have engaged in improving the human rights situation in all former Communist countries and attempted to create flexible mechanisms for assuring political stability.

5|$|Given that {{firearms}} possession {{was banned}} during German Nazi occupation and then allowed {{only to those}} deemed loyal during the Communist regime, {{the right to be}} armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal firearms following the <b>Velvet</b> <b>Revolution,</b> this led to fast rise in legal firearms ownership in the country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E licenses). The police recorded a tripling of average monthly applications for firearms licenses by the end of 2015 compared to the beginning of that year.|$|E
5|$|The reforms, {{especially}} the decentralization of administrative authority, were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent {{half a million}} Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. New York Times cites reports of 650,000 men equipped with the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue. A large wave of emigration swept the nation. A spirited non-violent resistance was mounted throughout the country, involving attempted fraternization, painting over and turning street signs (on one occasion an entire invasion force from Poland was routed {{back out of the}} country after a day's wandering), defiance of various curfews, etc. While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country the resistance held out for eight months, and was only circumvented by diplomatic stratagems (see below). There were sporadic acts of violence and several suicides by self-immolation (such as that of Jan Palach), but there was no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained Soviet-controlled until 1989, when the <b>Velvet</b> <b>Revolution</b> ended pro-Soviet rule peacefully, undoubtedly drawing upon the successes of the non-violent resistance twenty years earlier. The resistance also became an iconic example of civilian-based defense, which, along with unarmed civilian peacekeeping constitute the two ways that nonviolence can be and occasionally has been applied directly to military or paramilitary threats.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Velvet</b> <b>Revolutions</b> of 1989 {{accelerated}} the European project both in its intensity and scope.

The high point of soft-power Europe may have been reached in May 2004, when ten new countries were admitted as full EU members. Later that year, Ukraine experienced its Orange revolution, which promised Ukrainians a return to Europe, emulating in form and objectives the success of their Central European neighbours. While the Ukrainian revolution of 2004 lost its way, it attracted the most unlikely followers. In response to the threat of democratic ideals infecting Russia, Vladimir Putin and his ideologues engineered a veritable ‘velvet counter-revolution’. The spectre of a Moscow Maidan was to be kept at bay by state-sponsored public mobilisation, which gave rise to a nationalist project with distinctly imperial dimensions.

40|$|Session: Geopolitics – how the Eastern {{enlargement}} changed {{power relations}} in Europe and the worldThe <b>Velvet</b> <b>Revolutions</b> of 1989 accelerated the European project both in its intensity and scope. Almost the entire continent {{was to be}} united in its pursuit of liberty {{and the rule of}} law. The high point of soft-power Europe may have been reached in May 2004, when ten new countries – eight of them emerging from communist rule – were admitted as full EU members. Later that year, Ukraine experienced its Orange revolution, which promised Ukrainians a return to Europe, emulating in form and objectives the success of their Central European neighbours. While the Ukrainian revolution of 2004 lost its way, it attracted the most unlikely followers. In response to the threat of democratic ideals infecting Russia, Vladimir Putin and his ideologues engineered a veritable ‘velvet counter-revolution’. The spectre of a Moscow Maidan was to be kept at bay by state-sponsored public mobilisation, which gave rise to a nationalist project with distinctly imperial dimensions. Echoing this logic, a ‘preventive counter-revolution’ (Horvath 2013) culminated in the ‘velvet occupation’ of Crimea in 2014. Fake public mobilisation of Russian citizens (i. e. the rise of youth organisation Nashi) presaged the fake war in Ukraine. This marks the end of the ‘soft power Europe’ paradigm. When faced with the imperialist ambitions of Putin’s Russia, the EU appears impotent. This constellation is exceedingly dangerous. While scholars in the West continue to praise Europe as a ‘quiet’ superpower (Moravcsik 2010), Russian scholars and opinion-makers are scornful, celebrating instead ‘the decline of Gayropa’ (Riabov & Riabova 2014).
