40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} of the hand to tool-induced vibrations {{is associated with the}} occurrence of debilitating conditions such as vibration white finger. The primary aim of this work is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the effects of different aspects of exposure to finger transmitted vibration (FTV) related to operators using hand-held vibrating tools. To achieve this, firstly, a new method for measuring finger transmitted vibration was developed and assessed, including a tool vibration test rig and measurement protocol. The effect on FTV measurement of using a small accelerometer attached to the back of the finger was investigated using 2 D finite element modelling. Comparisons were also made using a laser vibrometer. Analysis showed that the new test rig is capable of measuring FTV at frequencies ranging from 10 to 400 Hz, under different grip force levels, and that adding a small accelerometer mass (0. 3 grams) did not significantly affect measurements. A human participant study then carried out using the new rig. Various characteristic measurements were collected in tandem, including anthropometry, skin characterisation and behaviour under loading to investigate the effect of different factors on FTV. The results showed that FTV varied among individuals and the key finding was that exposure to vibration has a significant effect on finger temperature even for a short period of testing. Anti-vibration (AV) glove materials were investigated using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and tested using human participants. The results showed that the mechanical properties of AV materials change under real world industrial conditions such as excitation frequencies and temperature. Finally, a new artificial test-bed was developed to replicate the transmitted vibration of the index finger. Studies were conducted on a range of 5 test-beds, to allow comparison with the human measurements, including indentation, vibration transmissibility and FE modelling. FE modelling showed that the distribution of dynamic strain was found to be highest in the vasculature region of the finger, indicating that this could be one of the contributing factors of VWF. One of the finger test-bed was selected as best replicating the mechanical properties of the real finger. The artificial test-bed provided better consistency than human participants, for testing parameters, such as grip force, and can be used in future for testing AV gloves with no need for human subjects. ii Further investigations are suggested to be made to enhance the limitations of this project, including material analysis, testing protocol and finite element modelling.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a self-administered scale based on the special {{features}} of smartphone. The reliability and validity of the Smartphone Addiction Inventory (SPAI) was demonstrated. METHODS: A total of 283 participants were recruited from Dec. 2012 to Jul. 2013 to complete a set of questionnaires, including a 26 -item SPAI modified from the Chinese Internet Addiction Scale and phantom <b>vibration</b> and ringing <b>syndrome</b> questionnaire. There were 260 males and 23 females, with ages 22. 9 ± 2. 0 years. Exploratory factor analysis, internal-consistency test, test-retest, and correlation analysis were conducted to verify the reliability and validity of the SPAI. Correlations between each subscale and phantom vibration and ringing were also explored. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis yielded four factors: compulsive behavior, functional impairment, withdrawal and tolerance. Test-retest reliabilities (intraclass correlations  = 0. 74 - 0. 91) and internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0. 94) were all satisfactory. The four subscales had moderate to high correlations (0. 56 - 0. 78), but had no or very low correlation to phantom vibration/ringing syndrome. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the SPAI is a valid and reliable, self-administered screening tool to investigate smartphone addiction.

Patients and methods: One hundred and fifty-eight patients with at least moderately severe primary restless legs syndrome (a score of 15 or greater on the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group rating scale) were enrolled at five investigational sites, between April 20, 2009 and February 12, 2010. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} treatment with a vibrating pad or control (sound-producing or light-emitting sham pad). Patients and investigators were blinded to pad assignment type (treatment pad or sham pad). Efficacy was measured as a change in score from baseline to week 4, on the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Problems Index II, the Johns Hopkins Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life summary scale, and the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group rating scale. Clinicians were asked {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the pad assignment and to guess whether treatment or sham therapy had been assigned. Adverse events related to vibrating pad assignment were tabulated. Results: The Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Problems Index II scores improved significantly more for patients receiving a vibrating pad over those receiving a sham pad (P ≤ 0. 02) even when corrected for multiplicity (P ≤ 0. 04). Clinician evaluation favored patients assigned vibrating pads, and neither patients nor clinicians accurately guessed which pad was assigned. No significant difference in adverse event rates was observed between the vibrating and sham pad groups. Sound and light sham pads performed comparably with respect to safety and efficacy.

50|$|Because workers {{maintain}} the same posture over long work days and often several years, even natural postures like standing {{can lead to}} MSDs like low back pain, but postures which are less natural like twisting or tension in the upper body are typically contributors {{to the development of}} MSDs because of the unnatural biomechanical load of these postures. There is evidence that posture contributes to MSDs of the neck, shoulder, and back. Repeated motion is another risk factor for MSDs of occupational origin because workers can perform the same movements repeatedly {{over long periods of time}} (e.g. typing leading to carpal tunnel syndrome), which can wear on the joints and muscles involved in the motion in question. Workers doing repetitive motions at a high pace of work with little recovery time and workers with little to no control over the timing of motions (e.g. workers on assembly lines) are also prone to MSDs due to the motion of their work. Force needed to perform actions on the job can also be associated with higher MSD risk in workers, because movements which require more force can fatigue muscles quicker which can lead to injury and/or pain. Additionally, exposure to vibration (as in truck drivers or construction workers, for example) and extreme hot or cold temperatures can affect a worker's ability to judge force and strength, which can lead to development of MSDs. Vibration exposure is also associated with hand-arm <b>vibration</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which has symptoms of lack of blood circulation to the fingers, nerve compression, tingling, and/or numbness.|$|E

The harmful effect of these frequencies is discussed with regards to Hand-Arm <b>Vibration</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> a disease stemming from repeated contact with vibrating objects. Hand-Arm <b>Vibration</b> <b>Syndrome</b> is found to be a pervasive issue among physical laborers who use vibrating machinery. A sample set of construction tools is analyzed and compared with the modeled resonance frequencies of the arm. Considering the resonance frequencies of the arm is significant for tools manufacturers. Research on the frequencies at which tools function may be overly dangerous to workers who are required to handle such tools frequently...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this pilot {{study was to examine}} {{differences}} in gene expressions by cDNA microarray analysis of hand-arm <b>vibration</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HAVS) patients. Vein blood samples were collected and total RNA was extracted. All blood samples were obtained in the morning in one visit after a standard light breakfast. We performed microarray analysis with the labeled cDNA prepared by reverse transcription from RNA samples, using the Human CHIP version 1 (DNA Chip Research Inc, Yokohama, Japan). There are 2, 976 genes on the chip, and these genes were selected from a cDNA library prepared with human peripheral white blood cells (WBC). Different gene levels between the HAVS patients and controls, and between groups of HAVS with different levels of symptoms, were indicated by the randomized variance model. The most up-regulated genes were analyzed for their possible functions and association with the occurrence of HAVS. From the results of this pilot study, although the results were obtained a limited number of subjects, it would appear that cDNA microarray analysis of HAVS patients has potential as a new objective method of HAVS diagnosis. Further research is needed to examine the gene expression with increased numbers of patients at different stages of HAVS.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} neurological {{symptoms in}} the <b>vibration</b> <b>syndrome,</b> 55 patients with vascular and neurological symptoms {{in the hand}} who {{had been exposed to}} vibration were examined. Their exposure to vibration was estimated and neurological vascular symptoms were evaluated according to symptom scales. Temperature thresholds were measured on the right thenar eminence and on the distal volar aspect of the second and third fingers held together on both sides. Vibration thresholds were measured dorsally on the second and fifth metacarpal bones and on the second and fifth fingers proximal to the nail roots. Subjects with advanced neurological symptoms had higher temperature and vibration thresholds than subjects with less advanced symptoms. No such relation was found between vascular symptoms and the outcome of sensory testing. Thus neurological but not vascular symptoms are reflected by the outcome of quantitative sensory testing. In subjects with advanced neurological symptoms the tests gave a high proportion of abnormal results, indicating that these tests may be used for the diagnosis of <b>vibration</b> <b>syndrome</b> on an individual basis. Patients with advanced vascular and neurological symptoms had higher exposure dose scores than patients with less advanced symptoms, indicating a dose response relation between vibration "dose" and neurological and vascular symptoms...|$|E
