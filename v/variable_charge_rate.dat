40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s and early 1990 s, {{it was widely}} {{reported}} that the United States faced a solid waste crisis. Existing landfills were reaching capacity or being shut down because of more stringent regulations while waste volumes were continuing to rise. At the time, several market-oriented policy analysts advocated the adoption of <b>variable</b> <b>rate</b> <b>charges</b> for mixed refuse in conjunction with curbside pick-up of recyclables (without charge) {{as a means of}} reducing waste volumes and diverting recyclable material to more valuable uses. During {{the course of the past}} decade, such policies have been adopted widely throughout the United States - approximately 20 percent of the U. S. population now face <b>variable</b> <b>rate</b> <b>charges</b> for mixed refuse collection. Even more have curbside collection of recyclable materials. This article collects and reviews empirical studies evaluating the effects of variable rate pricing. It finds that these policies have been quite effective as a means of boosting diversion rates beyond the levels that can be achieved through curbside collection of recyclables alone. The overall cost-benefit analysis of such programs is modestly favorable. Since many states and communities have committed to achieving specified waste diversion targets, variable rate policies have been a cost effective policy tool. The experience with variable rate policies represents a promising example of non-coercive, information-oriented government intervention. With a relatively small budget and no authority to impose household solid waste policy on local governments, EPA has been remarkably successful at developing and diffusing effective solid waste management policies. The economic theory underlying variable rate pricing has proven, after some tinkering at the implementation stage, to be quite workable in practice. In fact, the practical realities of implementing charges have shown that theoretical perfection in terms of getting the prices right is less important in the grand scheme than keeping the transaction costs manageable. Looking forward, variable rate pricing can be expected to become even more economically advantageous as recycling markets continue to mature, landfill tipping fees rise, and improved technologies for curbside collection, monitoring, billing, and measuring waste develop...|$|R

They have developed under intensive weathering in subtropical and tropical regions or from volcanic ash parent material. The term “variable charge” is used to describe organic and inorganic soil constituents with reactive surface groups whose charge varies with pH, and ionic concentration and composition of the soil solution. The <b>variable</b> <b>charge</b> is developed on the surface groups as a result of adsorption or desorption of solid-like ions that are constituents of the solid phase, i. e., H+, and the adsorption or desorption of solid-unlike ions that are not constituents of the solid phase. <b>Variable</b> <b>charge</b> soils are heterogeneous charge systems. Variations in relative proportions and chemical composition of the major mineral soil constituents of highly weathered soils and volcanic ash soils influence the surface reactivity, which is the key factor controlling nutrient availability. The coexistence and interactions of soil particles and colloids with net opposite surface charges confer interesting properties with complex attributes with respect to physical and chemical behavior, compared to homogeneously charged soil systems of temperate regions. In this entry, the mineralogy, chemistry and management of <b>variable</b> <b>charge</b> soils are reviewed and discussed, focusing on the chemistry of these fascinating soil systems.

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the {{economic}} regulation of the for-hire trucking industry in Ontario (Truck Transportation Act, 1988) have provided a new opportunity to investigate the associated impacts of deregulation or regulatory reform. Two main areas of concern are the overall <b>charge</b> <b>rate</b> levels for trucking service and the <b>charge</b> <b>rate</b> levels for shipments involving small remote communities. To investigate these areas of concern, the makeup of shipment revenues {{before and after the}} initiation of regulatory reform is analyzed.

The results of the multivariate analysis indicate that the overall <b>charge</b> <b>rate</b> levels have not declined in the majority of industry sectors examined.

Photocopy. xiv, 187 leaves, bound ill., maps 29 cmVariable charge clay {{soils are}} widely {{distributed}} in the intertropical region. They primarily consist of Andisols, Oxisols, and low activity clay Alfisols and Ultisols. The last three groups of soils are collectively called <b>variable</b> <b>charge,</b> low activity clay soils. Due to insufficient knowledge of these soils, and inadequate analytical methods to study, classify and interpret them, <b>variable</b> <b>charge,</b> low activity clay soils have not been used as efficiently as the permanent charge, high activity clay soils of the temperate region. Several International Committees have been established to revise the Soil Taxonomy {{and make it more}} accurate for making and interpreting soil survey for the tropics. Although {{progress has been made in}} improving Soil Taxonomy for making soil surveys, the improvement for interpreting soils for specific uses has lagged behind. The National Soils Handbook used by the Soil Conservation Service contains the procedures for translating soil information for the soil user. These procedures are mainly based on experience with temperate climate soils of the continental United States. For this reason problems arise when the same procedures are used on tropical soils. The current procedures for estimating soil properties from other properties and their use in soil interpretation for engineering and agricultural uses are tested on the soils of the Benchmark Soils Project. It was recognized that the current procedures for estimating soil properties and rating soils are not suited for <b>variable</b> <b>charge,</b> low activity clay soils, and Andisols with <b>variable</b> <b>charge,</b> short-range order clays. The latter represents a unique group of soils which must be treated and interpreted differently. In order to retain simplicity and accuracy in the estimation procedure, it was necessary to stratify soils according to the activity of their clays as expressed by the relationship: % clay = CEC/Ac = PI/Ap, where CEC is cation exchange capacity, PI is plasticity index, Ac and Ap are chemical and physical clay activity, respectively. Soil data from the International Soil Classification Workshop Tour Guide from Sudan, Chili and Ecuador, and data from soil survey reports from Indonesia were used to develop the equations for estimating soil bulk density, available water capacity, liquid limit, plasticity index, coefficient of linear extensibility and hydraulic conductivity. Due to limited data, only three categories of soils were taken into account. They were (1) Andisols with <b>variable</b> <b>charge,</b> short-range order clay, (2) soils with <b>variable</b> <b>charge,</b> low activity clays and (3) soils with permanent charge, high activity clays.
