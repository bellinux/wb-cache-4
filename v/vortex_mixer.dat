50|$|A <b>vortex</b> <b>mixer,</b> or vortexer, is {{a simple}} device used {{commonly}} in laboratories to mix small vials of liquid. It consists of an electric motor with the drive shaft oriented vertically and attached to a cupped rubber piece mounted slightly off-center.

When a test tube or other appropriate container is pressed into the rubber cup (or touched to its edge) the motion is transmitted to the liquid inside and a vortex is created. Most vortex mixers are designed with 2 or 4-plate formats, have variable speed settings ranging from 100 to 3,200 rpm, and can be set to run continuously, or to run only when downward pressure {{is applied to the}} rubber piece.|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} This work {{concerns the}} characterization of turbulent flow underlying mixing {{in the presence of}} streamwise vorticity. An experimental test section made of a cylindrical tube equipped with seven rows of streamwise vortex generators was designed and constructed for this study. Each row is composed of four vortex generators fixed symmetrically on the tube wall. This new type of mixer, called a high-efficiency <b>vortex</b> (HEV) <b>mixer,</b> generates coherent structures in the form of longitudinal counter-rotating vortices. The resulting flow enhances radial mass transfer and thus facilitates particle dispersion and mixing. The energy cost of this mixer used as an emulsifier has been evaluated as up to a thousand times less than that of other static mixers for a given interface area generation (Lemenand et al. [1] and [2]). The aim of this work is to study experimentally and numerically the turbulence structure and mixing properties of the flow composed of streamwise vortices superimposed on a turbulent flow, in particular the more energetic structures present in the base flow. Experiments were carried out in the test section in a flow loop by measuring instantaneous velocities by laser Doppler anemometry. Numerical simulations of the velocity distribution and turbulence field inside the flow were conducted for various turbulence models using a computational fluid dynamic CFD package. Attention is focused on the evolution and distribution of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation as the underlying mechanism for turbulent mixing. Mean and turbulent quantities are compared with experimental results. Both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations show a vortex zone behind each tab that could explain the efficiency of the HEV mixer.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{between two}} concurrent immiscible liquid flows {{is of great}} interest for improving the characteristic time, compactness, and energy cost of cooling and heating processes. A high-efficiency <b>vortex</b> (HEV) static <b>mixer</b> is investigated as a direct-contact heat exchanger (DCE). This new type of mixer generates coherent large-scale structures, enhancing momentum and heat transfer in the bulk flow and thus providing favorable conditions for phase dispersion and quick temperature homogenization in the mean phase. Experiments involved injection of a mineral oil into a continuous flow of water; the two fluids are immiscible. The inlet water temperature ranged from 11 to 13 °C, the inlet oil temperature ranged from 40 to 48 °C, and the Reynolds number varied between 7500 and 15000. This DCE produces an in situ dispersion of the oil phase in the continuous water phase with no external energy input, and thus is energetically more efficient than other DCEs for an identical emulsion production.

40|$|Flow {{can change}} {{the rate at which}} solutes adsorb on {{surfaces}} by changing mass transfer to the surface. but moreover. flow can induce changes in the conformation of macromolecules in solution by providing Sufficient stresses to perturb the segmental distribution function. However, there are few studies where the effect of flow on macromolecules has been shown to after the structure of macromolecules adsorbed on surfaces. We have studied how the local energy dissipation alters the adsorption of gelatin onto polystyrene nanoparticles (r = 85 nm). The change {{in the nature of the}} adsorbed layer is manifest in the change in the ability of the nanoparticles to resist aggregation. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to assess conformational changes in gelatin, and dynamic light scattering was used to assess the colloid stability. Experiments were conducted in a <b>vortex</b> jet <b>mixer</b> where energy density and mixing times have been quantified; mixing of the gelatin and unstable nanoparticles occurs on the order of milliseconds. The adsorption of the gelatin provides steric stabilization to the nanoparticles. We found that the stability of the gelatin-adsorbed nanoparticles increased with increasing mixing velocities: when the mixing velocities were changed from 0. 9 to 550 m/s, the radius of the nanoclusters (aggregates) formed 12 h after the mixing decreased from 2620 to 600 nm. Increasing temperature also gave rise to similar trends in the stability behavior with increasing temperature, leading to increasing colloid stability. Linear flow birefringence studies also suggested that the velocity fields in the mixer are sufficiently strong to produce conformational changes in the gelatin. These results suggest that the enemy dissipation produced by mixing can activate conformational changes in gelatin to alter its adsorption on the surfaces of nanoparticles. Understanding how Such conformational changes in gelatin can be driven by local fluid mechanics and how these changes are related to the adsorption behavior of gelatin is very important both industrially and scientifically. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{hybrid rocket}} is still sparsely {{employed}} within major space or defense projects {{due to their}} relatively poor combustion efficiency and low fuel grain regression rate. Although hybrid rockets can claim advantages in safety, environmental and performance aspects against established solid and liquid propellant systems, the boundary layer combustion process and the diffusion based mixing within a hybrid rocket grain port leaves the core flow unmixed and limits the system performance. One principle used to enhance the mixing of gaseous flows is to induce streamwise vorticity. The counter-rotating <b>vortex</b> pair (CVP) <b>mixer</b> utilizes this principle and introduces two vortices into a confined flow, generating a stirring motion in order to transport near wall media towards the core and vice versa. Recent studies investigated the velocity field introduced by this type of swirler.

40|$|Throughout the US, large {{quantities}} of chlorine are produced and transported by rail. In the past, train accidents led to deadly accidental releases {{and the need for}} mass evacuation. However, moving people unnecessarily may cause pandemonium or danger to health for sensitive members of the public. In these past cases, the models used for evacuation distances did not accurately predict the impact of the chlorine release, but these models did {{not take into account the}} reactivity of chlorine. Because chlorine is a highly reactive gas, it is absorbed into the surrounding environment which reduced the amount of chlorine in the air thereby reducing the impact of an accidental release. In this context, the Controlled Environment Reactivity Test (CERT) program was created to determine the extent of the absorption of chlorine with the environment. The Chemical Hazard Research Center (CHRC) at the University of Arkansas is active member of the program. Its facility is used to conduct low wind speed dispersion modeling for various hazardous gases. For the CERT Program, the aim is to create a test chamber designed to provide chemical reactivity (deposition) data for direct use in atmospheric dispersion models. This particular project aimed at designing and constructing a test chamber to provide gas mixtures in preparation for the CERT Tests. Preliminary tests were conducted to validate the set-up. The chamber is made of plywood and clear polycarbonate, powered by a small 2 hp fan used to push the air through the chamber to the room. Based on previous work, High Efficiency <b>Vortex</b> (HEV) <b>mixer</b> design has been adapted to mix test gas with inlet air. The HEV mixer is placed directly after the fan and uses two sets of inline baffles to produce turbulent mixing. The testing included the delivery of the gas (fog) to the chamber, the determination of the optimal setup for all experiments, and the preliminary videos. An optimal height for the inlet nozzle of five inches was determined and the similarity between the fog speed and the air speed on the lowest fog and fan setting has been proven. Finally, the preliminary videos of the chamber flow clearly show a large scale vortical structure which is convected along the length of the test section. This undesirable structure is caused by the fan. A flow straightener could be used to reduce or eliminate this phenomenon...|$|R

Studies are carried out on three different configurations: in the first, the tabs are aligned and inclined {{in the direction of}} flow (the reference geometry for a high-efficiency <b>vortex</b> (HEV) static <b>mixer),</b> in the second, a periodic 45 ° tangential rotation is applied to the tab arrays with respect to one another, and in the third the reference geometry is used in the direction opposite to the flow direction (reversed direction).

Macro-mixing entails the dispersive capacity of the flow at the heat exchanger–reactor scale, and is generally measured by the residence time distribution (RTD). At the intermediate scale, meso-mixing is governed by the turbulent fluctuations; this process of turbulent mixing can be characterized by the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE). Micro-mixing is characterized by the local rate of turbulence energy dissipation and is related to the progress of fast chemical reactions and selectivity.

Propolis has a complex chemical composition and biological properties, such as antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor. Purpose: This research aimed to reveal anti-glucan effects of propolis ethanol extract generated from honey bee, Apis mellifera spp on Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria. Method: Before antiglucan test was conducted, glucan-formation test was performed on Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria using SDSpage. Meanwhile, anti-glucan adhesion test on Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria was carried by culturing the bacteria at 37 ºC temperature in a jar with 10 % CO 2.

Result: The ethanol extract of propolis with a concentration of 1. 56 % was the lowest concentration inhibiting the attachment of glucan to Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria. Conclusion: The ethanol extract of propolis with a concentration of 1. 56 % can be used as an anti-glucan material for Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria...|$|R
40|$|In August 1999, a {{workshop}} {{was held at}} Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to discuss the effects of crust ingestion on mixer pump performance in Hanford Waste Tank 241 -SY- 101. The main purpose of the workshop was to evaluate the potential for crust ingestion to degrade mixing and/or damage the mixer pump. The need for a previously determined 12 -inch separation between {{the top of the}} mixer pump inlet and the crust base was evaluated. Participants included a representative from the pump manufacturer, an internationally known expert in centrifugal pump theory, Hanford scientists and engineers, and operational specialists representing relevant fields of expertise. The workshop focused on developing an understanding of the pump design, addressing the physics of entrainment of solids and gases into the pump, and assessing the effects of solids and gases on pump performance. The major conclusions are summarized as follows: (1) Entrainment of a moderate amount of solids or gas from the crust should not damage the pump or reduce its lifetime, though mixing effectiveness will be somewhat reduced. (2) Air binding should not damage the pump. Vibrations due to ingestion of gas, solids, and objects potentially could cause radial loads that might reduce the lifetime of bearings and seals. However, significant damage would require extreme conditions not associated with the small bubbles, fine solids, and chunks of relatively weak material typical of the crust. (3) The inlet duct extension opening, 235 inches from the tank bottom, should be considered the pump inlet, not the small gap at 262 inches. (4) A suction vortex exists at the inlet of all pumps. The characteristics of the inlet suction <b>vortex</b> in the <b>mixer</b> pump are very hard to predict, but its effects likely extend upward several feet. Because of this, the current 12 -inch limit should be replaced with criteria based on actual monitored pump performance. The most obvious criterion (in addition to current operational constraints) is to monitor discharge pressure and cease pump operation if it falls below a predetermined amount. (5) There are no critically necessary tests to prove pump operability or performance before initiating the transfer and back-dilution sequence...|$|R
