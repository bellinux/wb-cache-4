40|$|Lack of a {{sufficiently}} complete {{knowledge about the}} composition of the modern world system <b>of</b> <b>societies</b> — especially about its subsystems — {{is one of the key}} problems of modeling of the modern world system <b>of</b> <b>societies.</b> Different criteria <b>of</b> discrimination of the main subsystems of the modern world system <b>of</b> <b>societies</b> from the macrosociological approach are analyzed in the issue. It is suggested to combine the two approaches to the division of the modern world system <b>of</b> <b>societies</b> into subsystems: (1) by the criterion of self-guidance and (2) by the criterion of specificity of functions of self-reproduction of the system. The systemic-functional substance of the processes of regulation and self-regulation <b>of</b> <b>society</b> as totality are considered. The phenomenon of self-guidance and the definition of the concept <b>of</b> <b>society</b> as self-guided social system are enucleated. It is demonstrated that as the result of decomposition of the modern world system <b>of</b> <b>societies</b> by the criterion of self-guidance certain as sociations <b>of</b> <b>societies</b> are discriminated as its first-order subsystems and individual societies are discriminated as its elements. And by decomposition of the modern world system <b>of</b> <b>societies</b> by the function criterion of the system self-reproduction we discriminate seven first-order functional subsystems, each consisting of specific second-order functional subsystems, each of which is divided into specific functional elements. It is also demonstrated, that the components of the modern world system <b>of</b> <b>societies,</b> discriminated by the criterion of self-guidance and by the function criterion of the system self-reproduction, are related in the following manner: any functional element of the modern world system <b>of</b> <b>societies</b> is a component <b>of</b> a certain <b>society...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} ethnic {{structure}} <b>of</b> <b>society</b> per se have been first singled out the “charger” of concepts {{of national and}} ethnic structures <b>of</b> <b>society</b> {{only at the end}} of 90 th of ХХth century. Theoretical clearing up of the problem is complicated by unsettled state of concept-category apparatus, namely identifying of concepts of ethnic structure and ethnic composition <b>of</b> <b>society,</b> interpretation the nation as an ethnic phenomenon and so on. The ethnic structure <b>of</b> <b>society</b> is one <b>of</b> types (substructures) of its social structure. Consequently, the reasonable solution <b>of</b> <b>society</b> ethnic structuring ques tions is to be carried out on methodological principles of social structuring in general. The author uses as a basis Anthony Giddens’ determination which assumes the social structure <b>of</b> <b>society</b> as a gnosiological construct. However, the author underlines, that this structure is not merely a product of consciousness, but is the phenomenon based on relations communications between elements of empirically fixed ontological reality, that is the social structure <b>of</b> <b>society.</b> Therefore determination <b>of</b> the social structure notion must represent its pluralistic essence and the distinction between social struc ture and composition <b>of</b> <b>society.</b> On these principles, the analysis of ethnic structure <b>of</b> <b>society</b> should be deepened up to the level of its substructures, including ethnic structure. Particularly, one can select its mere components brought into correlation with tasks of political nation building...|$|R
