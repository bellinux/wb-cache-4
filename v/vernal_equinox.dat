5|$|This adds a {{periodic}} component {{to the position}} of the equinoxes; the positions of the celestial equator and (<b>vernal)</b> <b>equinox</b> with fully updated precession and nutation are called the true equator and equinox; the positions without nutation are the mean equator and equinox.|$|E

5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox,</b> the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox,</b> the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E
5|$|The Bahá'í {{calendar}} {{is based}} upon the calendar established by the Báb. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five intercalary days, to make a full solar year. The Bahá'í New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called Naw Rúz, and occurs on the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox,</b> near 21 March, {{at the end of the}} month of fasting. Bahá'í communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a Feast for worship, consultation and socializing.|$|E
40|$|The Iranian, or Persian, {{calendar}} is solar, {{with the}} particularity that {{the year is}} defined by two successive, apparent passages of the Sun through the <b>vernal</b> (spring) <b>equinox.</b> It is based on precise astronomical observations, and moreover uses a sophisticated intercalation system, which makes it more accurate than its younger European counterpart, the Gregoria...|$|R
5000|$|While the Nisan-years {{begin the}} {{year from the}} Spring season, around the <b>Vernal</b> Equinox/Spring <b>Equinox</b> (Gregorian March 20/21), the Tishri-years begin the years from the Autumn season, around the Autumn Equinox (Gregorian September 22/23). The New Years Day of the Tishri-years is called Rosh Hashanah ("Head of the Year"); it begins the Fall Feasts of Israel.|$|R
25|$|The halachic equinox usually jumps a day every century {{because the}} {{algorithm}} that established the Gregorian calendar dictates that leap years {{do not occur}} in years divisible by 100, unless also divisible by 400. Jewish law, however, provides no means for changing the established calendar until such a time as the Sanhedrin might be reconvened, and compensates for it by moving {{the date of the}} equinox almost every century. There was no shift between 1909 and 2009, however, because of the exception regarding years divisible by 400; thus, the year 2000 did contain a February 29 and no compensation was necessary. The table at right depicts all the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinoxes</b> from 1981 to 2009, two years in which Birkat Hachama occurs; note that the equinox does not occur at sunset (time=0) on the fourth day (Tuesday) any other years in the entire 28-year cycle.|$|R
5|$|The First Point of Aries, the {{location}} of the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox,</b> is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the First Point of Aries has since moved into Pisces and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox</b> of 1930, Fortune {{declared}} that—with the 'Lesser Mysteries' {{and three}} degree system now properly established—she {{wanted to turn}} away from public work and focus on personal spiritual development. At the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox</b> of 1931, Fortune stepped down as leader of the Fraternity, with Loveday being appointed Magus of the Lodge in her place. During the 1930s, Fortune's emphasis moved away from mediumship and towards ritual, {{while at the same time}} other Fraternity members embraced mediumship in order to channel the messages of the Masters. In late 1931, Fortune began mooting the idea of the construction of a permanent base, or Sanctuary, at the Chalice Orchard, and despite the economic obstacles of the Great Depression was able to raise sufficient funds. The group experienced a growth in the numbers attending its lectures, subscribing to its correspondence course, and using their private library; conversely, their Sunday services were not very popular, with a move from the morning to the evening seeing no effect. One significant individual who joined the Fraternity was Christine Campbell Thomson, who had been Fortune's literary agent since 1926. Fortune subsequently aided Thomson in separating from her abusive husband, after which she grew close to another Fraternity member, Colonel C. R. F. Seymour, in 1937. Although Seymour became a senior member of the Fraternity, relations between him and Fortune were strained, and during the Second World War he left London and settled in Liverpool, terminating his involvement with Fortune's Bayswater temple.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{altitude}} of the Moon {{in the sky}} varies with the lunar phase and the season of the year. The full moon is highest during winter. The 18.61-year nodes cycle also has an influence: when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox,</b> the lunar declination can {{go as far as}} 28° each month. This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°. The orientation of the Moon's crescent also depends on the latitude of the observation site: close to the equator, an observer can see a smile-shaped crescent moon.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecliptic}} {{coordinate system}} is a celestial coordinate system commonly used for representing the positions and orbits of Solar System objects. Because most planets (except Mercury), and many small Solar System bodies have orbits with small inclinations to the ecliptic, using it as thefundamental plane is convenient. The system's origin can be either {{the center of the}} Sun or the center of the Earth, its primary direction is towards the <b>vernal</b> (northbound) <b>equinox,</b> and it has a right-handed convention. It may be implemented in spherical coordinates or rectangular coordinates.|$|R
5000|$|S. L. MacGregor Mathers {{claimed it}} to have been derived from Khabs Am Pekht, which in the Egyptian {{language}} means roughly [...] "Light in extension" [...] or [...] "Light rushing out in a single ray", which {{is used in the}} Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn's <b>Vernal</b> and Autumnal <b>Equinox</b> ceremonies.|$|R

5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox,</b> also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|Other {{prominent}} artworks on {{the grounds}} include a Marc Chagall stained glass window memorializing the death of Dag Hammarskjöld, the Japanese Peace Bell which is rung on the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox</b> {{and the opening of}} each General Assembly session, a Chinese ivory carving made in 1974 (before the ivory trade was largely banned in 1989), and a Venetian mosaic depicting Norman Rockwell's painting The Golden Rule. A full-size tapestry copy of Pablo Picasso's Guernica, by , {{on the wall of the}} United Nations building at the entrance to the Security Council room. In 1952, two Léger murals were installed in the General Assembly Hall. The works are meant to merely be decorative with no symbolism. One is said to resemble cartoon character Bugs Bunny and U.S. President Harry S. Truman dubbed the other work Scrambled Eggs.|$|E
2500|$|The acrostic {{of these}} words and phrases reads [...] "CLOSEBYAMPTHILL".

25|$|The Passover {{begins on}} the 15th {{day of the}} month of Nisan, which {{typically}} falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar. Passover is a spring festival, so the 15th day of Nisan typically begins {{on the night of}} a full moon after the northern <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox.</b> However, due to intercalary months or leap months falling after the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox,</b> Passover sometimes starts on the second full moon after <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox,</b> as in 2016.|$|E
25|$|As {{explained}} in the Talmud, there is a tradition that the Sun was created in its <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox</b> position {{at the beginning of}} the springtime Jewish lunar month of Nissan. The sages of the Talmud settled disputes over the halachic definition of the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox</b> by establishing it on March 25 of the Julian calendar. Because both the Julian calendar and Jewish tradition define a solar year as exactly 365.25 days, the halachic <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox</b> historically fell out on March 25 every year. This halachic equinox now falls about 17 days after the true equinox, with the error increasing by about 3/4 of a day per century.|$|E
25|$|The <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox</b> is {{currently}} located in Pisces, due south of ω Psc, and, due to precession, slowly drifting below the western fish towards Aquarius.|$|E
2500|$|In ancient Israel, {{the start}} of the ecclesiastical new year for the {{counting}} of months and festivals (i.e., Nisan) was determined by reference to Passover. Passover is on 15 Nisan, (...) which corresponds to the full moon of Nisan. As Passover is a spring festival, it should fall on a full moon day around, and normally just after, the <b>vernal</b> (northward) <b>equinox.</b> If the twelfth full moon after the previous Passover is too early compared to the equinox, a leap month is inserted {{near the end of the}} previous year before the new year is set to begin.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Seasonal {{variations}} of reproductive functions in wild mammals are well known. Similar but blunted seasonal trends {{have also been}} described for humans. METHODS: We performed a questionnaire-based study of 149 patients {{that was designed to}} search for environmental in¯uence on symptom presentation among patients attending an open menopause service. RESULTS: The evaluated data show a conspicuous seasonality in cessation of menstrual bleeding, with a higher peak after the <b>vernal</b> (spring) <b>equinox</b> and a lower one after the autumn equinox. CONCLUSIONS: Of the several environmental factors considered in this study, the sequence of seasons seems to affect most obviously the process leading to the loss of menstrual cycling. The triggering factor(s) eliciting the onset of the menopausal process and the mediators involved, however, need further analysis.

25|$|The {{last day}} of the Julian {{calendar}} was Thursday, 4 October 1582 and this was followed by {{the first day of the}} Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October. Thus, while the halachic <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox</b> occurred on March 25 until 1582, in 1583 it occurred on April 4 of the new Gregorian Calendar. However, the Jewish calendar was in no need of such a modification, and remained uninfluenced by it. As a result, the halachic <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox</b> has been shifting slightly forward in the Gregorian year ever since 1582.|$|E
25|$|In summary, Birkat Hachama is recited {{when the}} halachic <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox</b> (the {{position}} {{at which the}} Sun was created) occurs at sundown on a Tuesday (the time at which the sun was created).|$|E
25|$|The dating of Easter {{was modeled}} on {{that of the}} Jewish Passover, which marks the liberation of the Jews from Egypt and which {{traditionally}} falls in the Jewish lunar calendar on the 14th of the month of Nisan, {{the day of the}} first full moon after the vernal (spring) equinox. Roman Christians however had a twelve-month calendar, first the Julian calendar until 1582, and then the Gregorian calendar. Since the Council of Nicaea in 325, the Western Church had required that Easter be celebrated on the Sunday on or after the full moon following March 21, which at that time corresponded indeed to the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox.</b> The Julian calendar being imprecise however, by the 16th century March 21 fell about 10 days after the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox,</b> a problem that was solved by the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. (The Eastern Christian Church continues to date Easter by the Julian calendar.) Languet de Gergy, however, wished to verify independently the exact date of the <b>vernal</b> <b>equinox</b> through the gnomon in order to ascertain the date of Easter.|$|E
40|$|The {{variation}} of the geomagnetic activity index Ap at the IMF sector boundaries (+ to - and - to +) has been studied for three solar cycles, separating data into <b>vernal</b> and autumnal <b>equinoxes.</b> It was found that a reported increase in Ap as an effect of a Hale boundary can be better attributed to the occurrence of a negative IMF Bz component in the geocentric solar magnetospheric coordinate system and to the occurrence of high speed solar wind streams...|$|R
50|$|Many ancient monuments were {{constructed}} {{with the passing}} of the solar year in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta and at Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the <b>vernal</b> and autumnal <b>equinoxes.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{geomagnetic}} activity shows the semiannual variation stronger in <b>vernal</b> and autumnal <b>equinoxes</b> than {{in summer and}} winter solstices. The semiannual variation has been explained by three main hypotheses such as Axial hypothesis, Equinoctial hypothesis, and Russell-McPherron Effect. Many studies using the various geomagnetic indices have done to support three main hypotheses. In recent, Oh & Yi (2011) examined the solar magnetic polarity dependency of the geomagnetic storm occurrence defined by Dst index. They reported {{that there is no}} dependency of the semiannual variation on the sign of the solar polar fields. This study examines the solar magnetic polarity dependency of quiet time {{geomagnetic activity}}. Using Dxt index (Karinen & Mursula 2005) and Dcx index (Mursula & Karinen 2005) which are recently suggested, in addition to Dst index, we analyze the data of three-year at each solar minimum for eight solar cycles since 1932. As a result, the geomagnetic activity is stronger in the period that the solar magnetic polarity is anti-parallel with the Earth’s magnetic polarity. There exists the difference between <b>vernal</b> and autumnal <b>equinoxes</b> regarding the solar magnetic polarity dependency. However, the difference is not statistically significant. Thus, we conclude that there is no solar magnetic polarity dependency of the semiannual variation for quiet time geomagnetic activity...|$|R
