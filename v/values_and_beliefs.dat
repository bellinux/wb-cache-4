5|$|The {{relationship}} between war and Australian {{society has been}} shaped {{by two of the}} more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture: bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare. Indeed, Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942, while since then an alliance with the United States has underwritten its security. Arguably, this pattern of bandwagoning—both for cultural reasons such as shared <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>beliefs,</b> as well as for more pragmatic security concerns—has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies. Regardless, a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident, with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises; a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges.|$|E

25|$|Although Turkey was secularized at the {{official}} level, religion remained a strong {{force at the}} popular level. After 1950 some political leaders tried to benefit from popular attachment to religion by espousing support for programs and policies that appealed to the religiously inclined. Such efforts were opposed {{by most of the}} state elite, who believed that secularism was an essential principle of Kemalist Ideology. This disinclination to appreciate religious <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> gradually led to a polarization of society. The polarization became especially evident in the 1980s as a new generation of educated but religiously motivated local leaders emerged to challenge the dominance of the secularized political elite. These new leaders have been assertively proud of Turkey's Islamic heritage and generally have been successful at adapting familiar religious idioms to describe dissatisfaction with various government policies. By their own example of piety, prayer, and political activism, they have helped to spark a revival of Islamic observance in Turkey. By 1994 slogans promising that a return to Islam would cure economic ills and solve the problems of bureaucratic inefficiencies had enough general appeal to enable avowed religious candidates to win mayoral elections in Istanbul and Ankara, the country's two largest cities.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{seeks to}} explore {{perceptions}} of local employees regarding MNE subsidiaries’ attitudes {{in relation to}} local customs, <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> systems prevalent in the settings in which they operate. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research design {{was used as the}} methodological grounding for the study. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Ghana with a total of 20 participants (16 males and 4 females). Interviews were audio-taped, with permission of the participants. A convenience sampling method was used, and all 20 participants were recruited via initial personal visits by the researcher and subsequent follow-up visits and phone call. Interviews were transcribed via thematic analysis. The views of participants were organized into four major themes: relevance of CSR (business ethics) to local employees; local employees’ attitude towards firms’ (un) ethical behaviour; educating managers and employees of foreign-owned companies; and attractiveness of company and ability to draw resources. Findings: Our interpretive research in the Ghanaian context suggests that most of the participants appreciate the salient role of cooperation between companies and traditional authorities in identifying and resolving potential tension that could evolve out of non-compliance with local socio-cultural <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> systems. In respect to this, the findings from the present study reinforce the insights of Kjonstad and Willmott (1995) that reliance on rule-based approaches to business ethics is deficient, as it {{has been found to be}} ineffective or at best, less ‘empowering’ when it comes to influencing organizations in their ethical behaviour. The findings further suggest that inadequate information about local customs, <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> systems, partly explains the seeming ‘irresponsible’ posture of foreign-owned companies towards aspects of local socio-cultural <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> systems. Thus, as scanty information is available to the companies and their managers, few are able to either integrate them into their core CSR practices and/or encourage employees to uphold them in their processes. Research limitations/implications: Findings are based on a single-country investigation. This limitation, combined with a relatively small sample size (20 participants, across firms that belong to 6 industry-groupings), may have implications that the results might not be readily generalizable. Moreover, as the present study employed an interpretive methodological approach, the findings could have been impacted by self-evaluation (i. e., self-narratives from participants), resulting in socio-cultural preferences and response biases, on the part of the participants. Practical implications: Although results of this study is based on single-country (Ghana) study, given similarities in socio-cultural characteristics across developing-countries, this study is likely to have wider relevance and applicability in developing-countries, as a whole. Originality/value: The present study explored relatively unexplored ground by investigating the perceptions of local employees regarding MNE subsidiaries’ attitudes in relation to local customs, <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> systems, prevalent in the settings in which companies operate. Most importantly, these initial attempts at exploring the perceptions of local employees regarding MNE subsidiaries’ attitudes in relation to local customs, <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> systems, can hopefully be further explored and validated through future research directed at this topic. © www. iiste. or...|$|R

30|$|Contrarily, {{the roots}} of GMA are taken from the {{environmental}} movement. Despite the anthropocentric basis of TMA, GMA considers humankind {{as a part of}} the nature. Therefore, organizations have the responsibility of protecting the environment and a harmonious relationship should be established. This <b>value</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> system affects both academia and the business world. Increasing number of periodicals and scientists that are worried about the future of the human race, criticizes the effects of industrialization, and pressuring on governments and firms to be green, shows that this community has common <b>values,</b> <b>beliefs,</b> <b>and</b> norms. Furthermore, many studies empirically demonstrated that the <b>values,</b> <b>beliefs,</b> <b>and</b> moral obligations behind environmental movement affect the practical implications and motivate managers to adopt green management strategies to their companies (Drumwright 1994; Carter et al. 1998; Tzschentke et al. 2008; Babiak and Trendafilova 2011; Wu and Wu 2014).
