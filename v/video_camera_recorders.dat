40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} group-based image {{retrieval}} method for video image annotation systems. Although the wide spread use of <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> <b>recorders</b> {{has increased the}} demand for an automated annotation system for personal videos, conventional image retrieval methods cannot achieve enough accuracy {{to be used as}} an annotation engine. Recording conditions, such as change of the brightness by weather condition, shadow by the surroundings, and etc, affect the qualities of images recorded by the personal <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> <b>recorders.</b> The degraded image of personal video makes the retrieval task difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to discriminate similar images without any auxiliary information. To cope with these difficulties, this paper proposes a group-based image retrieval method. Its characteristics are 1) the use of image similarity based on the wavelet transformation based features and the scale invariant feature transform based features, and 2) the pre-grouping of related images and screening using group information. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve image retrieval accuracy to 90 % up from the conventional method of 40 %...|$|E

AVCHD is a simpler form of the Blu-ray Disc standard with just one video encoding algorithm and two audio encodings.

5000|$|Transport Stream {{had been}} {{originally}} designed for broadcast. Later it was adapted for usage with digital <b>video</b> <b>cameras,</b> <b>recorders</b> and players {{by adding a}} 4-byte timecode (TC) to standard 188-byte packets, {{which resulted in a}} 192-byte packet. This is what is informally called M2TS stream. The Blu-ray Disc Association calls it [...] "BDAV MPEG-2 transport stream". JVC called it TOD (possibly an abbreviation for [...] "Transport stream on disc") when used in HDD-based camcorders like GZ-HD7. The timecode allows quick access to any part of the stream either from a media player, or from a non-linear video editing system.

MethodsSixty aortic allografts implanted in situ in rats were analyzed. The animals were divided into four groups that received fresh or cryopreserved isogenic (Lewis to Lewis) grafts, or fresh or cryopreserved allogenic (Lewis to DA) grafts, respectively. The diameter and compliance of the grafts were then visually evaluated with the digital <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> <b>recorder</b> after 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days. ResultsGradual increase in diameter and decrease in compliance in case of all allogenic and cryopreserved isogenic grafts were observed. The observed changes in cryopreserved grafts were smaller when compared with fresh grafts, however, the differences did not reach statistical significance.

When analog and/or digital data is combined with video signals, the resulting configuration is a video instrumentation system.

The TV Display Generator accepts four independent analog signals, modulated IRIG B serial time code, three different standard composite video signals and several digital control signals. The analog and time code signals are digitized and inserted into the composite video input signals for recording and display. The Video Countdown Programmer generates four color and two monochrome standard composite video signals and formats and inserts up to six sets of parallel BCD and ASCII digital data into each video signal.
