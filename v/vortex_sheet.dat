LPVM can use a variety of methods to introduce vorticity into the wake. Biot-Savart summation is used to determine the induced flow field of these wake vorticies' circulations, allowing for better approximations of the local flow over the rotor blades. These methods have largely confirmed much of the applicability of BEM and shed insight into the structure of wind turbine wakes. FVM has limitations due to its origin in potential flow theory, such as not explicitly modelling model viscous behavior (without semi-empirical core models), though LPVM is a fully viscous method. LPVM is more computationally intensive than either FVM or RANS, and FVM still relies on blade element theory for the blade forces.|$|E

40|$|Magnetohydrodynamic {{configurations}} {{with strong}} localized current concentrations and vortices {{play an important}} role for the dissipation of energy in space and astrophysical plasma. Within this work we investigate the relation between current <b>sheets</b> and <b>vortex</b> <b>sheets</b> in incompressible, stationary equilibria. For this approach it is helpful that the similar mathematical structure of magnetohydrostatics and stationary incompressible hydrodynamics allows us to transform static equilibria into stationary ones. The main control function for such a transformation is the profile of the Alfven-Mach number M_A, which is always constant along magnetic field lines, but can change from one field line to another. In the case of a global constant M_A, vortices and electric current concentrations are parallel. More interesting is the nonlinear case, where M_A varies perpendicular to the field lines. This is a typical situation at boundary layers like the magnetopause, heliopause, the solar wind flowing around helmet streamers and at the boundary of solar coronal holes. The corresponding current and <b>vortex</b> <b>sheets</b> show in some cases also an alignment, but not in every case. For special density distributions in 2 D it is possible to have current but no <b>vortex</b> <b>sheets.</b> In 2 D <b>vortex</b> <b>sheets</b> of field aligned-flows can also exist without strong current sheets, taking the limit of small Alfven Mach numbers into account.

30|$|We {{perform a}} {{three-dimensional}} simulation of a breaking internal gravity wave in a stratified, compressible, and sheared fluid {{to investigate the}} vorticity dynamics accompanying the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Baroclinic sources contribute preferentially to eddy vorticity generation during the initial convective instability of the wave field, yielding counter-rotating vortices aligned with the external shear flow. These vortices enhance the spanwise vorticity of the shear flow via stretching and distort the spanwise vorticity via advective tilting. The resulting <b>vortex</b> <b>sheets</b> undergo a dynamical (Kelvin-Helmholtz) instability which rolls the <b>vortex</b> <b>sheets</b> into tubes which link, in turn, with the original streamwise convective rolls to produce a collection of intertwined vortex loops. Following the formation of discrete vortex loops, the most important interactions are the self-interactions of single vortex tubes and the mutual interactions of adjacent vortex tubes in close proximity. The initial formation of vortex tubes from the roll-up of localized <b>vortex</b> <b>sheets</b> imposes axial vorticity variations having both axisymmetric and azimuthal wavenumber two components. Axisymmetric variations excite axisymmetric twist waves, or Kelvin vortex waves, which propagate along the tubes, drive axial flows, and deplete and fragment the tubes. Azimuthal wavenumber two variations excite m = 2 twist waves on the vortex tubes which amplify and unravel single vortex tubes into pairs of intertwined helical tubes. Other interactions, judged less fundamental to the turbulence cascade, include reconnection among tube fragments, mutual stretching of orthogonal tubes in close proximity, excitation of azimuthal wavenumber one twist waves, and the continual roll-up of weaker <b>vortex</b> <b>sheets</b> throughout the evolution. Collectively, these vortex interactions result in a rapid cascade of energy and enstrophy toward smaller scales of motion.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} method {{is presented to}} follow the evolution of regularized three-dimensional (3 D) <b>vortex</b> <b>sheets</b> through an otherwise irrotational, inviscid, constant-density fluid. The sheet surface is represented by a triangulated mesh with interpolating functions locally defined inside each triangle. C^ 1 continuity is maintained between triangles via combinations of cubic Bézier triangular interpolants. The self-induced sheet motion generally results in a highly deformed surface which is adaptively refined as needed to capture regions of increasing curvature and to avoid severe Lagrangian deformation. Automatic mesh refinement is implemented with an advancing front technique. Sheet motion is regularized by adding a length scale cut-off to the BiotSavart kernel. Velocity evaluation takes less time than the standard O(N^ 2) scaling, due to utilization of multi-pole expansions of the kernel. Zero, singly, and doubly periodic <b>vortex</b> <b>sheets</b> are simulated, modeling vortex rings, vortex/jet combinations and standard shear layers. Comparisons with previous two-dimensional (2 D) results are favorable and 3 D simulations are presented. The perturbed 3 D planar shear layer is simulated and compared with a similar experiment revealing qualitatively similar results and agreement on the mechanism by which streamwise vorticity is created. We find the ratio of spanwise to streamwise vorticity to vary between 7 and 9 during early stages of roll-up. A new technique for estimating the curvature singularity time of true <b>vortex</b> <b>sheets</b> (i. e., non-regularized motion) is presented.

By introducing an appropriate change of variables, we show that the leading order <b>vortex</b> <b>sheet</b> equation degenerates to a two-dimensional <b>vortex</b> <b>sheet</b> equation {{in the direction of}} the tangential velocity jump.

The Sadovskii vortex is a uniform patch of vorticity surrounded by a <b>vortex</b> <b>sheet.</b> Numerical continuation is used to follow families of solutions. In the limiting cases of the vortex patch and <b>vortex</b> <b>sheet</b> cases, we confirm previous research, and in the vortex patch case show new solutions. In the regime where both sources of circulation exist, we show the relationship between the vortex patch and <b>vortex</b> <b>sheet</b> solution families. The more complicated vortex patch solution families lead to the simpler <b>vortex</b> <b>sheet</b> solution family due to a splitting of the vortex patch families at bifurcation points in the presence of the <b>vortex</b> <b>sheet.</b> The more circular elliptical family remains attached to the family with a single pinch off, and this family extends all the way to the pure <b>vortex</b> <b>sheet</b> solutions. More elongated families below this one also split at bifurcation points, and these families do not exist in the <b>vortex</b> <b>sheet</b> regime. In the presence of surface tension, vortex patch shapes are deformed where the background straining flow is into the vortices.
