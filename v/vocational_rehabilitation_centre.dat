40|$|ABSTRACT This {{paper is}} based on the {{findings}} of a study that focuses on material, social, psychological and physical wellbeing of trainees with physical disabilities at Ithuseng <b>Vocational</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Centre</b> (IVRC) in Maseru, their access to infrastructure and other services around the centre, and choice within the centre. The effects of institutionalization on their quality of life were also explored. The study sample consisted of ten (10) trainees with physical disabilities. Data was collected through qualitative interviews with the respondents, and analyzed qualitatively. The findings of the study reveal that trainees at IVRC are provided with basic needs that include shelter, food and clothing. Furthermore, their psychosocial and physical wellbeing have improved since they enrolled at IVRC. However, the study also reveals some dissatisfaction about the way the trainees are treated by some members of IVRC staff, highlighting lack of privacy, being controlled, and not having choice and a say on the things that concern them as the main causes of dissatisfaction. The findings also reveal that being in a vocational rehabilitation institution has both positive and negative impacts on {{the quality of life of}} those being institutionalized.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} providing psychological {{tests for}} identifying the adult, habitual criminal have neglected the concrete-abstract facets of cognition. The present study explores {{the usefulness of}} the concrete-abstract dimension for such a purpose by means of the Kahn Test of Symbol Arrangement (the K. T. S. A.), and a Symbolization Test for Criminals (the S. T. C.), which was constructed by the author. Two selected groups were employed; an incarcerated 'criminal recidivists' group and a control group of 'non- criminals' from a <b>vocational</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>centre.</b> The groups were matched for social-class and level of education. Controls as a group, however, were significantly older and scored higher on intelligence (p<. 0 l). Product moment correlations and analysis of co-variance indicated that the performance of both groups on these tests was independent of age and intelligence (measured by the AH 4 part II). The results showed that controls scored significantly higher (more abstract responses) than criminals, on both tests. The criminals displayed a typical pattern of more concrete and repetitive types of symbolizations and fewer abstract responses. This has led to the formulation of typical K. T. S. A. and S. T. C. criminal ‘Symbol-Pattern’ which identified correctly 72 % and 77 % of all participants, respectively (chi-square, p <. 001). A combined K. T. S. A + S. T. C. score elicited the best classification (80 % correct identifications, chi-square, p <. 001).). The results were interpreted in terms of the hypothesis that criminality is associated with an "arrested cognitive (and emotional) development on the decriminalization process", i. e. the process of socialisation.

Work and employment are important for {{health and well-being of}} people with intellectual disability. This allows them to maintain skills, integrate into the working and social environment and stimulate their sense of usefulness. In the theoretical part, we introduce important Slovenian and global employment legislation. We contacted the providers of <b>vocational</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> employment <b>centres</b> and the Employment Service of Slovenia in order to obtain the latest information on the implementation of laws in practice. Following, {{we discuss the}} characteristics of functioning, community life, education, learning and socially–emotional aspects of people with moderate intellectual disability. We also present the important factors and different forms of employment for people with moderate intellectual disability. The theoretical part concludes with examples of Slovenian practice in employing people with moderate intellectual disability. Our research was carried out on a sample of 82 potential employers. We examined the issues of employing persons with moderate intellectual disability by the providers of individual craft, entrepreneurial, agricultural, catering, tourist, commercial and other services in the Gorenjska region of Slovenia. We found that respondents often recognize people with moderate intellectual disability.

Material and methods: New disability claimants who had been unable to work because of illness for a few months at least were referred by SSSI physicians to a multidisciplinary team for assessment of rehabilitation potentials and an advice on the appropriate type of rehabilitation. The study group included all the 109 individuals who were referred to the team in the year 2000. Data on marital status, number of children and level of education was compared with information about the Icelandic population obtained in a national survey. The outcome of the rehabilitation was assessed in a telephone survey, carried out by the Social Science Research Institute, University of Iceland, 1 - 2 years after the assessment and by information obtained from the disability register at SSSI. The effectiveness of the rehabilitation programme was evaluated by comparing the study group with a comparable group that had started to receive rehabilitation pension before the SSSI could offer vocational rehabilitation. Their progress was assessed a year and half after they had contacted the SSSI, the same length of time as the study group had been in the in the rehabilitation programme. Results: In the study group there were about twice as many women as men. The mean age was 35 years (range 18 - 57 years). The main medical reasons for referral to the team were musculosceletal and psychiatric disorders. Those evaluated {{were more likely to be}} unmarried or divorced, had more children and a lower educational level than the general Icelandic population.

40|$|Transportation of mentally {{disabled}} persons {{is subject to}} many specific constraints due to medical or organisational reasons. We consider {{the problem of the}} daily transportation of persons from their home to specialized medical or social institutions. This concerns either {{mentally disabled}} children who attend specialised schools, or adults working in <b>vocational</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>centres.</b> Most of them are unable to travel on their own, so that a dedicated transportation system must be managed by the centres. Daily inbound and return trips for dozens of persons are generally performed by costly taxis or minibuses. We model the underlying optimisation problem as a multi-periodic vehicle routing problem with time windows, heterogeneous fleet and additional constraints. The main characteristic of the model is to mix closed routes (that form loops from the centre) and open routes from the driver's home to the centre. We propose two objective functions aimed at minimising the transportation cost or finding a trade-off between the cost and the quality of service respectively. Our approach for solving this problem efficiently and rapidly is a three phase heuristic. The first phase addresses a so called standard problem where every person is located at their main address with the most classical time window. Initial routes are built through a best insertion procedure based on a regret calculation. The second phase is a tabu search that combines several classical moves of the literature: customer relocation, customer exchange, cross-exchange, string exchange etc. The third step considers the real daily demand of every person. This step integrates possible daily variations in the demand: possible absence, variations in the time windows, daily changes in the addresses (pick-up or delivery at the parents, home family, nurse, etc.). The algorithm has been embedded in a decision support system called Marika. This decision support system seeks both technical efficiency and the satisfaction of human concerns. We present numerical results obtained from both test instances from the VRP literature and real instances. We show that the average of the individual travelling times as well as the total travelling time of the vehicles can be reduced by around 15 % for real instances. We finally enumerate some research perspectives. A first improvement is to obtain consistent schedules for every person. The idea is that daily variations in the demand of some transported persons should have limited impact on the schedules of other persons. This issue is important when applied to a fragile population. A second objective is to look for a trade-off between the cost, the quality and the consistency of service through a multi-objective optimization. The last project research concerns the possibility for distinct centres to organize common transportation services {{in order to reduce the}} costs...|$|R
