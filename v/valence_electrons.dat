5|$|A {{nobelium}} atom has 102 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b> They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f147s2 (ground state term symbol 1S0), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, all the three <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> may be lost, leaving behind a 5f13 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. Nevertheless, {{it is more likely that}} only two <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> may be lost, leaving behind a stable 5f14 core with a filled 5f14 shell. The first ionization potential of nobelium was measured to be at most (6.65±0.07)eV in 1974, based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to nobelium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate and octacoordinate No3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 90 and 102pm respectively; the ionic radius of No2+ has been experimentally found to be 100pm to two significant figures. The enthalpy of hydration of No2+ has been calculated as 1486kJ·mol−1.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E
5|$|A thorium atom has 90 electrons, {{of which}} four are <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b> Three atomic orbitals are {{theoretically}} {{available for the}} <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thorium's position in the f-block of the periodic table, it has an anomalous 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, {{even more so than}} the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. Such unusual behaviour is due to relativistic effects, which become stronger {{near the bottom of the}} periodic table, specifically the relativistic spin–orbit interaction. The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, for which +4 is the highest possible state but +3 also plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. Each of these elements has one <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> in the outermost s-orbital (<b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> configuration ns1), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the alkali metals are very reactive elements. Ununennium is predicted to continue the trend and have a <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> configuration of 8s1. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.|$|R

5|$|Arsenic and {{antimony}} are not semiconductors {{in their}} standard states. Both form type III-V semiconductors (such as GaAs, AlSb or GaInAsSb) {{in which the}} average number of <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> per atom is {{the same as that of}} Group 14 elements. These compounds are preferred for some special applications. Antimony nanocrystals may enable lithium-ion batteries to be replaced by more powerful sodium ion batteries.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the lanthanide cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter congeners scandium and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive actinium, although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.|$|E
5|$|Like most lanthanides, {{praseodymium}} {{usually only}} uses three electrons as <b>valence</b> <b>electrons,</b> as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: {{this is because}} the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b> Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a double hexagonal close-packed crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560°C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935°C.|$|E

5|$|A {{mendelevium}} atom has 101 electrons, {{of which}} at least three (and perhaps four) can act as <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b> They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f137s2 (ground state term symbol 2F7/2), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, three <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> may be lost, leaving behind a 5f12 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of mendelevium was measured to be at most (6.58±0.07)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to mendelevium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate Md3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 91.2pm; 1988 calculations based on the logarithmic trend between distribution coefficients and ionic radius produced a value of 89.6pm, as well as an enthalpy of hydration of −(3654±12)kJ·mol−1. Md2+ should have an ionic radius of 115pm and hydration enthalpy −1413kJ·mol−1; Md+ should have ionic radius 117pm.|$|E
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b> Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy {{to the point that they}} participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as <b>valence</b> <b>electrons,</b> as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium {{has five}} ionic {{oxidation}} states ranging from +3 to +7 when forming chemical compounds, {{which can be}} simultaneously observed in solutions. It is the heaviest actinide that can lose all its <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> in a stable compound. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds.|$|E
5|$|Oganesson is {{a member}} of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common {{chemical}} reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a closed outer valence shell in which its <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> are arranged in a 7s27p6 configuration.|$|E

In studying the stability of the many-body problem we suggest two principles [1 - 9]. (1) The prime number principle. A prime number is irreducible in the integers, it seems therefore natural to associate it with the most stable subsystem. We prove that 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 23, 47 are the most stable primes.

5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b> Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and {{it is more difficult}} to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E
5|$|Actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and {{moisture}} in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that impedes further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium {{exists in the}} oxidation state +3, and the Ac3+ ions are colorless in solutions. The oxidation state +3 originates from the 6d17s2 electronic configuration of actinium, with three <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> that are easily donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH2); even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener LaH2.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{unstable}} −1 state, three more oxidation states are predicted; +5, +3, and +1. The +1 state should be especially stable {{because of the}} destabilization of the three outermost 7p3/2 electrons, forming a stable, half-filled subshell configuration; astatine shows similar effects. The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p3/2 electrons. The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon because the 7p1/2 electrons are oppositely stabilized. The +7 state has not been shown—even computationally—to be achievable. Because the 7s electrons are greatly stabilized, it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b>|$|E

Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is the {{tendency}} of an atom to attract electrons. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and {{the distance between the}} <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of <b>valence</b> <b>electrons,</b> being in the same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
