5|$|NASA takes both Homer and Barney to Cape Canaveral for training. As {{only one}} of them can go into space, they soon find {{themselves}} in competition. Under NASA's alcohol ban, the newly sober Barney quickly develops superior skills and is selected to fly with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Race Banyon. However, when Barney toasts his victory with non-alcoholic champagne, he inexplicably reverts to his normal alcoholic self and escapes, stealing a jetpack and crashing into a nearby pillow factory. Homer wins by default and is selected for space flight, but after watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy involving space exploration, he becomes <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> going. Just as they prepare to take off in the Corvair space shuttle, Homer runs away. He talks with Marge on the phone, and she says that he ought {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity. He agrees, and the launch, which is also a Nielsen ratings smash, proceeds.|$|E
25|$|Jodie Whittaker {{was cast}} as Beth Latimer, {{the mother of}} the murdered boy. She was hired after Buchan and McClure joined the series. Her {{audition}} consisted of several scenes from the first episode. Whittaker admitted that she was <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> accepting a role in a series whose scripts had not yet been completed. Chris Chibnall, however, told her that none of the actors would know who the murderer was (not even the actor who played the killer) until the last possible moment. She found that highly appealing, for it raised the anxiety level in the actors and reduced each actor's willingness to trust the other characters. She was also impressed by the heart-breaking way the first episode was written, and how many interesting characters there were in the series.|$|E
500|$|Grande came up {{with the}} idea of the music video and {{contacted}} Max Landis, known for his 2012 film Chronicle. In an interview, Grande explained: [...] "It's very unique, it's very different, I called Max [...] up and I said 'hey I want to do something that ends exactly like this' and I described the ending shot to him and then I said I also want it to be (a) one take … and I want the ending shot to look like this, And I described those two things to him and he’s like, 'wow, that's ambitious and it’s brave and it’s different, but let's try it". A day later, Grande discussed the video's concept and said that it was [...] "the coolest concept ever and he killed it and it's very different. I'm <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> it because it's so unique and weird and I feel like brave and different, but it’s exciting".|$|E

500|$|In August 2015, Butters {{and fellow}} {{executive}} producer Chris Dingess stated that Madame Masque {{would appear in}} the season, and that an actress had been cast in the role. Everett was confirmed to be playing the character that October. After being cast and seeing {{a picture of the}} comic version of the character, Everett felt [...] "'They got the wrong girl,' only because I look nothing like her. I was <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> it ... thought, 'They will probably dye my hair dark, and I'm going to need to work out a bit. And those are some pretty big boobs.'" [...] However, the producers were looking to take a different approach to the character, taking inspiration from [...] "Hollywood icons like Hedy Lamarr and Lauren Bacall". The character also does not wear the gold mask from the comics, though the show does reference this, with masks appearing in the background of many scenes featuring Frost. Ivy George and Olivia Welch portray younger versions of Cully during her time growing up in Broxton, Oklahoma.|$|E
500|$|The co-music supervisor, Billy Gottlieb, {{called the}} episode a [...] "little mini feature {{film in the}} sense that we had a lot of camera {{performances}} with the music." [...] In order to get the best performances out of the cast and be able to shoot the scenes in various different ways, the producers had the actors go into a music studio in Vancouver and record their respective musical numbers. According to Gottlieb, the actors were <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> singing in the episode, despite their parts being around a mere 40 seconds. Actor Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop, was adamant that he not sing in the episode, despite the fact he frequently sings on set, causing him to be one of the few cast members with no musical part. As the original script contained no musical number for Jasika Nicole, she emailed Jeff Pinkner specifically asking him to let her sing, which he then approved. Some critics noted their surprise that Tony Award-winning actor Michael Cerveris did not sing in the episode. The producers were initially going to have him sing Django Reinhardt's [...] "Blue Moon", but changed their minds because they thought it would be better to keep the Observer out of the musical aspect of the episode. Despite the pre-recordings, the audio used in the episode was taken from the actors actually singing on set. Tanya Swerling believed the recordings were not a wasted effort however, as it helped make the actors more comfortable about singing on set. At the end of shooting, Gottlieb believed [...] "everybody was great... they could jump on stage and do Broadway and it wouldn't be a problem for any of them". He and other crew members called Jasika Nicole [...] "probably the most accomplished" [...] musical person of the cast. As one of the episode writers, Akiva Goldsman chose the Stevie Wonder song [...] "For Once in My Life".|$|E
2500|$|... "The Foretelling" [...] {{featured}} a guest star appearance by veteran comedian Peter Cook as Richard III. Cook had previously worked with Rowan Atkinson, having appeared together in The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979) [...] and Peter Cook & Co (1980). Cook's appearance in this episode as Richard III caused him some alarm; both producer John Lloyd and co-star Brian Blessed have recalled that Cook was <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> playing the part. Cook {{was also not}} fond of adhering to a script and his lines contained many improvisations. In the end, parts of Cook's performance {{took the form of}} a mock-heroic parody of Laurence Olivier's portrayal of the king in the 1955 film version of Shakespeare's play.|$|E
50|$|Research {{shows that}} there are three types of {{rejected}} or unpopular adolescents who are very likely to be involved in bullying behavior. First type includes adolescents who are overly aggressive: they tend to get into fights, get involved in antisocial activities, and are often involved in bullying; second type includes adolescents who are withdrawn or timid and exceedingly shy and inhibited and who {{are more likely to be}} victims; third- aggressive- withdrawn- type adolescents tend to have trouble controlling their hostility, but they are also <b>very</b> shy and <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> initiating friendships. The latter are likely to be bully-victims. Other students- bystanders can also choose between several roles: victim-defender, bully-reinforcer and/or assistant, and outsiders.|$|R
5000|$|Blanche (French: white, here: [...] "ingénue"), a shy, {{inconspicuous}} and retiring girl, gets to know Christa at the University of Brussels {{and they}} become friends. Christa is the first real friend in Blanche’s life {{and that is why}} in the beginning she is <b>very</b> excited and <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> their friendship. It turns out that Christa is the exact counterpart of Blanche: she is talented, brilliant and above all extremely popular. But it does not take Blanche long to figure out that Christa plays false and loose with her and slowly becomes her [...] "headsman", the Antichrist. Therefore, Blanche has to overcome her trepidation and anxiety {{to get away from the}} [...] "Antichrista" [...] and save her family from an [...] "apocalypse".|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "" [...] {{means to}} be <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> or anxious <b>about</b> something. About the lyrics, Dave Mustaine stated [...] "I wrote that about myself. It was {{pointed out to me}} that I'm kind of {{schizophrenic}} and that I live inside my head. Which is something I don't subscribe to, but I enjoyed the theory nonetheless.", and [...] "I think all of us are sweating bullets all the time. Society's a joke right now, and people are getting more and more hostile. When you think about having an evil twin or schizophrenia, I think {{a lot of us are}} schizo, because we live inside our heads. There's someone we all confer with; it's called our conscience. Some people cannot control their other side; it takes them over. Everybody has that psychotic side. Everyone has a thing that will make them snap." ...|$|R
2500|$|Director Guillermo del Toro and screenwriter Matthew Robbins wrote a {{screenplay}} based on Lovecraft's story in 2006, but {{had trouble getting}} Warner Bros. to finance the project. Del Toro wrote, [...] "The studio is <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the cost and it not having a love story or a happy ending, but it's impossible to do either in the Lovecraft universe." [...] In July 2010 {{it was announced that}} the film would be made in 3D and that James Cameron would become producer, and Tom Cruise was attached to star. This [...] "was a startling prospect considering Lovecraft's tale had long been considered unfilmable." [...] Del Toro confirmed that the film would begin production as early as May 2011 and start filming in June. However, in March 2011, it was announced that [...] "Universal Studios refused to greenlight the project due to del Toro's insistence that it be released with an R rating rather than a PG-13." [...] In 2012, del Toro posted that, due to the resemblance in premise with the Ridley Scott film Prometheus, the project would probably face a [...] "long pause—if not demise". [...] In 2013, del Toro stated {{in an interview that he}} would try one more time to get the picture made.|$|E

Linda and I were on this horse with no saddle, no reins, just the mane. If anybody fell, that camera truck is there to roll under. It was a very dodgey scene. You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. Just hang on and if you feel you can't do it, just don't do it. It's risky. There's no question about it, it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that. It's too dangerous.' And he's probably right. I thought it was very foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it. So she was very pleasant to work with and very nice." ...|$|E

60|$|My dear Friend,--I do {{hope that}} you may not be very angry, but papa thinks--and, indeed, I think--that as I have already had two proof sheets and forty-eight pages, and the {{printers}} have gone on {{to the rest of the}} poem, it would not be very welcome to them if we were to ask them to retrace their steps. Besides, I would rather--I for myself, I--that you had the whole poem at once and clearly printed before you, to insure as many chances as possible of your liking it. I am promised to see the volume completed in three weeks from this time, so that the dreadful moment of your reading it--I mean the 'Seraphim' part of it--cannot be far off, and perhaps, the season being a good deal advanced even now, you might not, on consideration, wish me to retard the appearance of the book, except for some very sufficient reason. I feel <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> it--far more than I did when my 'Prometheus' crept out [of] the Greek, or I myself out of the shell, in the first 'Essay on Mind.' Perhaps this is owing to Dr. Chambers's medicines, or perhaps to a consciousness that my present attempt is actually, and will be considered by others, more a trial of strength than either of my preceding ones.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the public health relevance of the prevalence of dental fear in Kuwait and the resultant barrier that it creates regarding access to dental care. The study analysis demonstrated a high prevalence of dental fear and anxiety in the Kuwaiti population and a perceived need for anesthesia services by dental care providers. The telephone survey of the general population showed nearly 35 % of respondents reported being somewhat <b>nervous,</b> <b>very</b> <b>nervous,</b> or terrified <b>about</b> going to the dentist. In addition, about 36 % of the population postponed their dental treatment because of fear. Respondents showed a preference to receive sedation and anesthesia services as a means of anxiety relief, and they were willing to go to the dentist more often when such services were available. People with high fear and anxiety preferred to receive some type of medication to relieve their anxiety. In conclusion, the significance and importance of the need for anesthesia services to enhance the public health of dental patients in Kuwait has been demonstrated, and improvements are needed in anesthesia and sedation training of Kuwaiti dental care providers...|$|R

60|$|This letter put Miss Mackenzie into a twitter. Like {{all other}} single ladies, she was <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> her money. She was quite alive {{to the beauty}} of a high rate of interest, but did not quite {{understand}} that high interest and impaired security should go hand in hand together. She wished to oblige her brother, and was aware that she had money as to which her lawyers were looking out for an investment. Even this had made her unhappy, as she was not quite sure whether her lawyers would not spend the money. She knew that lone women were terribly robbed sometimes, and had almost resolved upon insisting that the money should be put into the Three per Cents. But she had gone to work with figures, and having ascertained that by doing so twenty-five pounds a year would be docked off from her computed income, she had given no such order. She now again went to work with her figures, and found that if the loan were accomplished it would add twenty-five pounds a year to her computed income. Mortgages, she knew, were good things, strong and firm, based upon landed security, and very respectable. So she wrote to her lawyers, saying that she would be glad to oblige her brother if there were nothing amiss. Her lawyers wrote back, advising her to refer Mr Rubb, junior, to them. On the day named in her brother's letter, Mr Samuel Rubb, junior, arrived at Littlebath, and called upon Miss Mackenzie in the Paragon.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can {{understand}} {{that it was no}} child's play. After ten years of war each nation had got hold of a great deal which had belonged to the other, or to the other's allies. What was to be given back, and what was to be kept? Is this island worth that peninsula? If we do this at Venice, will you do that at Sierra Leone? If we give up Egypt to the Sultan, will you restore the Cape of Good Hope, which you have taken from our allies the Dutch? So we wrangled and wrestled, and I have seen Monsieur Otto come back to the Embassy so exhausted that his secretary and I had to help him from his carriage to his sofa. But at last things adjusted themselves, and the night came round when the treaty was to be finally signed. Now, you must know that the one great card which we held, and which we played, played, played at every point of the game, was that we had Egypt. The English were <b>very</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> our being there. It gave us a foot {{at each end of the}} Mediterranean, you see. And they were not sure that that wonderful little Napoleon of ours might not make it the base of an advance against India. So whenever Lord Hawkesbury proposed to retain anything, we had only to reply, 'In that case, of course, we cannot consent to evacuate Egypt,' and in this way we quickly brought him to reason. It was by the help of Egypt that we gained terms which were remarkably favourable, and especially that we caused the English to consent to give up the Cape of Good Hope. We did not wish your people, monsieur, to have any foothold in South Africa, for history has taught us that the British foothold of one half-century is the British Empire of the next. It is not your army or your navy against which we have to guard, but it is your terrible younger son and your man in search of a career. When we French have a possession across the seas, we like to sit in Paris and to felicitate ourselves upon it. With you it is different. You take your wives and your children, and you run away to see what kind of place this may be, and after that we might as well try to take that old Square of Bloomsbury away from you.|$|E
