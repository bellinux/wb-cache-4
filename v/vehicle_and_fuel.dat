In December 2008, the University of Michigan Board of Regents approved the purchase of the facilities, and the university anticipates hiring 2,000 researchers and staff during the next 10 years.

The federal contribution comes overwhelmingly from motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuel</b> taxes (93.5percent in 2007), and it makes up about 60percent of the contributions by the states. However, any local government contributions are overwhelmingly from sources besides user fees. The portion of the user fees spent on highways themselves covers about 57percent of their costs, with about one-sixth of the user fees being sent to other programs, including the mass transit systems in large cities. Some large sections of Interstate Highways that were planned or constructed before 1956 are still operated as toll roads. Others have had their construction bonds paid off and they have become toll-free, such as in Connecticut (I‑95), Maryland (I‑95), Virginia (I‑95), and Kentucky (I‑65).|$|E

40|$|Compressed {{natural gas}} (CNG) and {{liquefied}} natural gas (LNG) <b>vehicle</b> <b>and</b> <b>fueling</b> infrastructure technologies are relatively well developed and there is negligible risk associated with technical feasibility uncertainties. Natural gas vehicles (NGVs) have been proven to be commercially viable, most definitely in other countries (there are over 5 million NGVs worldwide) and marginally in the U. S. (where there are about 130, 000 NGVs). Private companies are engaged in natural gas engine, <b>vehicle,</b> <b>fueling</b> station, <b>and</b> <b>fuel</b> supply businesses. However, some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have recently discontinued their natural gas engine <b>and</b> <b>vehicle</b> products. Natural gas use as a transportation fuel obviously displaces gasoline <b>and</b> diesel <b>fuel</b> consumption, <b>and</b> it also provides environmental benefits. For any credible set of assumptions, CNG and LNG use reduces greenhouse gas emissions. While nearly all currently consumed natural gas is a fossil fuel, {{it can also be}} a biofuel when sourced from landfills, sewage, or agriculture waste. CNG and LNG are and generally have been less expensive than gasoline <b>and</b> diesel <b>fuel</b> on an energy-equivalent basis.
