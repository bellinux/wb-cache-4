We have tested this hypothesis by analyzing the phenotype of mutant cell lines which do not produce ABP- 120. Two different transformation vectors capable of targeted disruption of the ABP- 120 gene locus have been constructed using a portion of an ABP- 120 cDNA clone. Three independent cell lines with different disruption events have been obtained after transformation of amebas with these vectors. The disruption of the ABP- 120 gene by vector sequences results in either the production of a small amount of truncated ABP- 120 or no detectable protein at all. The phenotypes of two different clones lacking ABP- 120, generated in strains AX 3 and AX 4, have been characterized and show identical results. ABP- 120 - cells tend to remain rounder before and after cAMP stimulation, and do not reextend pseudopods normally after rapid addition of cAMP In addition, ABP- 120 - cells translocating in buffer exhibit defects in both the rate and extent of pseudopod formation. The amount of F-actin cross-linked into the cytoskeleton after cAMP stimulation of ABP- 120 - cells is reduced at times when ABP 120 has been shown to be incorporated into the cytoskeleton, and this correlates temporally with the absence <b>of</b> <b>reextension</b> <b>of</b> pseudopods after CAMP stimulation. The instantaneous velocity is significantly reduced both before and after CAMP stimulation in the ABP- 120 - cells, and the cells show decreased chemotactic efficiency compared to ABP- 1201 controls.

This study {{is an attempt to}} learn more about the behavior of both P-wave and S-wave velocity in porous sandstone rock samples for both dry and wet conditions. The statistical analysis indicates that higher values <b>of</b> the P-wave <b>velocity</b> are obtained for saturated samples and lower values are obtained for dry samples. The average P-wave <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> dry rock samples is 2766 m/s and the average P-wave <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> wet rock samples is 2950 m/s. The S-wave velocity is higher in the dry state with an average value of 1585 m/s. The average S-wave <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> wet rock samples is 1357 m/s. The derived equations can be used for the prediction <b>of</b> P-wave <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> wet rock samples from the P-wave <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> dry rock samples, and the S-wave <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> wet rock samples can be predicted from the S-wave <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> dry rock samples. A strong linear correlation between P-wave velocity and S-wave <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> dry rock samples and between P-wave velocity and S-wave <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> wet rock samples was found. The resulting linear equations can be used for the estimation <b>of</b> S-wave <b>velocity</b> from the P-wave velocity in the case of both dry and wet rock samples...|$|R
