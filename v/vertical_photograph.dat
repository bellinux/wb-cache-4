40|$|In {{this work}} it is {{performed}} {{a comparison of}} two methods for obtaining digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthoimages of medium-sized archaeological sites (500 - 5000 m 2). The photogrammetric methods analyzed consist {{in the use of}} a light aerial platform applying the normal case of photogrammetry (<b>vertical</b> <b>photographs</b> and regular blocks), and the second one is based on a network of oblique photographs, taken from a telescopic mast, using a DEM obtained from a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) survey. The main goal is to analyze the more efficient method for these studies taking into account variables such the working time, the accuracy obtained in the final products, the visual analysis of final orthoimages, etc. This study has been applied to the same archaeological site in two different epochs. The image acquisition was performed before and after a conservation intervention at the archaeological site. The results have shown similar characteristics for both products (DEMs and orthoimages) and accuracies but the density of DEMs and the visual analysis of orthoimages have shown differences that allows us to select the more adequate method taking into account the characteristics of each case. Thus the DEMs obtained using the TLS survey has shown more density of points while the visual analysis of orthoimages has shown a better behaviour (radiometrically and visually) in the case of <b>vertical</b> <b>photographs...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results.

40|$|Non-destructive {{estimation}} using {{digital cameras}} {{is a common}} approach for estimating leaf area index (LAI) of terrestrial vegetation. However, no attempt has been made so far to develop non-destructive approaches to LAI estimation for aquatic vegetation. Using the submerged plant species Potamogeton malainus, {{the objective of this}} study was to determine whether the gap fraction derived from <b>vertical</b> <b>photographs</b> could be used to estimate LAI of aquatic vegetation. Our results suggested that upward-oriented photographs taken from beneath the water surface were more suitable for distinguishing vegetation from other objects than were downward-oriented photographs taken from above the water surface. Exposure settings had a substantial influence on the identification of vegetation in upward-oriented photographs. Automatic exposure performed nearly as well as the optimal trial exposure, making it a good choice for operational convenience. Similar to terrestrial vegetation, our results suggested that photographs taken for the purpose of distinguishing gap fraction in aquatic vegetation should be taken under diffuse light conditions. Significant logarithmic relationships were observed between the vertical gap fraction derived from upward-oriented photographs and plant area index (PAI) and LAI derived from destructive harvesting. The model we developed to depict the relationship between PAI and gap fraction was similar to the modified theoretical Poisson model, with coefficients of 1. 82 and 1. 90 for our model and the theoretical model, respectively. This suggests that <b>vertical</b> upward-oriented <b>photographs</b> taken from below the water surface are a feasible alternative to destructive harvesting for estimating PAI and LAI for the submerged aquatic plant Potamogeton malainus...|$|R

30|$|Physical {{surveying}} generated historic maps {{detailed the}} mapped position of physical features influenced by flooding overtime as estimated on site by a land surveyor. Such maps provide accurate information for change detection as the surveyor is physically present during {{the data collection}} period (Graham et al. 2003; Leatherman et al. 2005). However, the approach tends to be limited both spatially and temporally due to several factors (Morton 1991; Smith and Jackson 1992). The method is time consuming, expensive and impractical for long distance mapping (Leatherman et al. 2005). It is also associated with human errors that can affect its reliability (Appeaning Addo et al. 2008). Aerial photographs are the most commonly used data source in coastal environment monitoring (Moore 2000). In addition to having the ability for stereo pair mapping, they also provide good spatial coverage (Lane et al. 2001).
