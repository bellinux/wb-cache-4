40|$|A sea ice thermal {{microwave}} emission {{model for}} 50 GHz was developed under EUMETSAT&#x 0027;s Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) programme. The model {{is based on}} correlations between the surface brightness temperature at 18, 36 and 50 GHz. The model coefficients are estimated using simulated data from a combined thermodynamic and emission model. The intention with the model {{is to provide a}} first guess sea ice surface emissivity estimate for atmospheric temperature sounding applications in the troposphere in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models assimilating Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) data. The spectral gradient ratio is defined as the difference over the sum of the SSMIS brightness temperatures at 18 and 36 GHz <b>vertical</b> linear <b>polarisation</b> (GR 1836). The GR 1836 is related to the emissivity at the atmospheric temperature sounding channels at around 50 GHz. Furthermore, the brightness temperatures and the polarisation ratio (PR) at the neighbouring 18, 36 and 50 GHz channels are highly correlated. Both the gradient ratio at 18 and 36 GHz and the PR at 36 GHz measured by SSMIS are input into the model predicting the 50 GHz emissivity for horizontal and <b>vertical</b> linear <b>polarisations</b> and incidence angles between 0 &#x 00 B 0; and 60 &#x 00 B 0; The simulated emissivity is compared to the emissivity derived with alternative methods.

40|$|In this study, the {{interferometric}} coherence {{calculated from}} 12 -day Sentinel- 1 image pairs was analysed {{in relation to}} mowing events on agricultural grasslands. Results showed that after a mowing event, median VH (vertical transmit, horizontal receive) and VV (vertical transmit, <b>vertical</b> receive) <b>polarisation</b> coherence values were statistically significantly higher than those from before the event. The shorter the time interval after the mowing event and the first interferometric acquisition, the higher the coherence. The coherence tended to stay higher, even 24 to 36 days after a mowing event. Precipitation caused the coherence to decrease, impeding the detection of a mowing event. Given the three analysed acquisition geometries, {{it was concluded that}} afternoon acquisitions and steeper incidence angles were more useful {{in the context of this}} study. In the case of morning acquisitions, dew might have caused a decrease of coherence for mowed and unmowed grasslands. Additionally, an increase of coherence after a mowing event was not evident during the rapid growth phase, due to the 12 -day separation between the interferometric acquisitions.

Its dependence with incidence angle is found to be significantly different from empirical models previously proposed in the literature. It also exhibits some correlation with surface conditions (wind and wave) with a more important correlation with significant wave steepness. Two new analytical formulations are proposed to model the polarisation ratio, one as a function of incidence angle only, the second one with additional dependence with azimuth angle. It is shown {{that it is necessary to}} consider an azimuth dependent polarisation ratio for incidence angles larger than 30 °.

40|$|Four {{different}} interpretation procedures (involving {{both time}} and frequency domains) {{have been examined}} for measuring travel times in bender/extender element tests, used for measurement of shear and compression wave velocities and hence elastic shear modulus and elastic constrained modulus, respectively.

It was concluded that, for both shear and compression wave velocities, the procedure of determining travel time from a peak-to-first peak measurement in the time domain was the most reliable. This method, unlike the other three, provided a wave velocity that was almost frequency-independent (over an appropriate frequency range) and it also provided equal shear wave or compression wave velocities in different directions in these isotropic samples...|$|R

At 85 GHz the increase of Zdr results in an average increase of the polarisation difference from the satellite; this implies a rather strong correlation between the rain layer at the ground (as seen by radar) and the ice layer {{on the top of the}} cloud as seen at 85 GHz...|$|R
40|$|Changes in rice {{cultivation}} {{systems have been}} observed in the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam. Among the changes in cultural practices, the change from transplanting to direct sowing, the use of water-saving technology, {{and the use of}} high production method could have impacts on radar remote sensing methods previously developed for rice monitoring. Using Envisat (Environmental Satellite) ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) data over the province of An Giang, this study showed that the radar backscattering behaviour is much {{different from that of the}} reported traditional rice. At the early stage of the season, direct sowing on fields with rough and wet soil surface provides very high backscatter values for HH (Horizontal transmit – Horizontal receive <b>polarisation)</b> and VV (<b>Vertical</b> transmit – <b>Vertical</b> receive <b>polarisation)</b> data, as a contrast compared to the very low backscatter of fields covered with water before emergence. The temporal increase of the backscatter is therefore not observed clearly over direct sowing fields. Hence, the use of the intensity temporal change as a rice classifier proposed previously may not apply. Due to the drainage that occurs during the season, HH, VV and HH/VV are not strongly related to biomass, in contrast with past results. However, HH/VV ratio could be used to derive the rice/non-rice classification algorithm for all conditions of rice fields in the test province. The mapping results using the HH/VV polarization ratio at a single date in the middle period of the rice season were assessed using statistical data at different districts in the province, where very high accuracy was found. The method can be applied to other regions, provided that the synthetic aperture radar data are acquired during the peak period of the rice season, and that few training fields provide adjusted threshold values used in the method...|$|R

After considering several types of antenna, horn antenna has been the most practical when trying to meet project requirements. Two of the horn antennas examined here have been the square and conical horn antennas using square and circular waveguides respectively. Each of these waveguides support dual polarisation as they provide a symmetrical structure in two orthogonal planes of polarisation. The square waveguide is flared into a square horn whereas the circular waveguide is flared into a conical horn to increase the gain and reduce the half-power beamwidth to the required angle...|$|R
40|$|The use of High-Frequency (HF) radio-wave {{propagation}} in the ionosphere remains prevalent {{for applications}} such as long-range communication, target detection and commercial broadcasting. The ionosphere presents a challenging channel for radio-wave propagation {{as it is a}} varying medium dependent on a number of external factors. Of the many adverse effects of ionospheric propagation, signal fading {{is one of the most}} difficult to eliminate due to its unpredictable nature. Increase in the knowledge of how the ionospheric channel affects the propagating signals, in particular fading of the signals, will drive the continual improvements in the reliability and performance of modern wide-bandwidth HF systems. This is the underlying motivation for the study of signal fading of HF radio-waves propagating through the ionosphere, from both the theoretical and experimental perspectives, with the focus of application to modern wide bandwidth HF systems. Furthermore, it is the main objective of this investigation to address the lacking in the current literature of a simple analytical signal fading model for wideband HF systems that relates the physics of the ionospheric irregularities to the observable propagation effects due to the irregularities, and one that is verified by experimental observations. An original approach was taken in the theoretical investigation to develop an analytical model that combines the effects of signal fading and directly relating them to the ionospheric irregularities that are causing the fading. The polarisation fading model (PFM) is a combination of geometric optics, perturbation techniques and frequency offset techniques to derive expressions for the Faraday rotation of the radio-wave propagating in the ionosphere. Using the same notation as the PFM, the amplitude fading model (AFM) extends the Complex Amplitude concept using perturbation techniques and Green’s functions solution to arrive at a set of expressions that describes the focussing and defocussing effects of the wave. The PFM and AFM, together with expressions for combining the effects of multiple propagation paths, provide a simple analytic model that completely describes the fading of the signal propagating in the ionosphere. This theoretical model was implemented into an efficient ionospheric propagation simulator (IPS) from which simulations of wide bandwidth HF signals propagating through the ionosphere can be undertaken. As an example of the type of results produced by the IPS, for a typical 1200 km path in the north-south direction with the ionospheric channel under the influence of a travelling ionospheric disturbance (TID), a 10 MHz radio-wave signal in one-hop path is shown to be affected by polarisation fading with fading periods in the order of minutes, and a fading bandwidth in the order of 100 kHz. Further results generated by the IPS have shown to be consistent with the results reported elsewhere in the literature. The experimental investigation involves the study of signal fading from observations of real signals propagating in the ionosphere, a major part of which is the development of a digital compact channel probe (CCP) capable of operating in dual-polarisation mode, and the characterisation of such systems to ensure that data collected are not compromised by the non-idealities of the individual devices contained within the system. The CCP was deployed in experiments to collect transmissions of HF frequency-modulated continuouswave (FMCW) radio signals from the Jindalee Over-the-Horizon radar (OTHR) in dualpolarisation. Analyses of the collected data showed the full anatomy of fading of signals propagating in the ionosphere for both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>polarisations,</b> the results of which are consistent with that from the IPS and thus verifying the validity of the theoretical model of fading. Further experimental results showed that in majority of the observations polarisation fading is present but can be masked by multi-path fading, and confirming that periods of rapid signal fading are associated with rapid changes in the ionospheric channel. From the theoretical and experimental investigations, the major achievement is the successful development of an efficient propagation simulator IPS based on the simple analytical expressions derived in the PFM and AFM theoretical models of signal fading, which has produced sensible signal fading results that are verified by experimental observations. One of the many outcomes of this investigation is that polarisation diversity has the potential to bring improvements to the quality of wide-bandwidth HF signals in a fading susceptible propagation channel. The combination of an efficient propagation simulator IPS based on theoretical signal fading model and the experimental data collection by the dual-polarisation CCP is a major step in allowing one to fully understand the different aspects of fading of signals propagating in the ionosphere, which sets a solid foundation for further research into the design of wide bandwidth HF systems and the possible fading mitigation techniques.

40|$|The {{amount of}} water stored in the soil is a key {{parameter}} for the energy and mass fluxes at the land surface and is of fundamental importance to many agricultural, meteorological, biological and biogeochemical processes. This study investigates the potential of retrieving surface soil moisture in grassland areas from a time series of 68 ENVISAT advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) wide swath mode (WSM) scenes, acquired between 2007 and 2009, using an empirical regression approach. WSM data enable larger areas to be observed with a higher temporal sampling capability, compared to image mode (IM) data, and provide an appropriate spatial resolution for regional applications. As expected, the radar backscatter signal was found to increase with increasing soil moisture. Inter-seasonal analysis showed that the VV (<b>Vertical</b> transmit–Vertical receive) <b>polarisation</b> radar signal is more sensitive to surface soil moisture during the spring and autumn months, where average signal increases of about 4 dB corresponding to relative soil moisture increases of ~ 40 % were obtained.
