40|$|We have {{previously}} described a vaccinia <b>virus</b> late <b>transcription</b> factor, VLTF-X, which we {{found to be}} present in cells at early and late times in infection. In this study, transcription complementation assays were used to demonstrate that VLTF-X activity is also present in virion extracts and in the cytoplasm of uninfected HeLa cells. Mobility shift assays performed on various VLTF-X preparations revealed that a late promoter DNA-binding activity cochromatographed and cosedimented with VLTF-X activity. Competition experiments demonstrated that this binding was specific for the late promoter region of the probe and that late transcrip-tion was dramatically reduced by an oligonucleotide that blocked factor-DNA complex formation but was only minimally affected by an oligonucleotide that did not inhibit complex formation. These results suggest that a cellular factor may participate in vaccinia <b>virus</b> late <b>transcription.</b> These findings also confirm the requirement for VLTF-X and distinguish it from any of the previously described vaccinia <b>virus</b> late <b>transcription</b> factors, which have all been mapped to the viral genome. Finally, these studies also suggest that the biochemical role for VLTF-X may be in late promoter recognition.

40|$|Vaccinia virus, {{a family}} of poxviridae, is a large DNA virus. The life cycle of vaccinia virus occurs in the {{cytoplasm}} of host cells. Vaccinia virus is regulated by the temporal transcription at the early, intermediate and late stages. Gene expression of each stage activates the transcription of the next stage. The lack of any vaccinia virus-encoded factors interacting with intermediate and late classes of promoters suggests that host cellular proteins may participate in the regulation of vaccinia viral transcription. The recruitment of host nuclear proteins in vaccinia <b>virus</b> intermediate <b>transcription</b> was investigated by localization and functional studies. Viral DNA replication before intermediate transcription was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the cytoplasmic translocation of YY 1, a nuclear transcription factor. It was also demonstrated that the DNA binding domain of YY 1 was important for its translocation into the cytoplasm after infection. Experiments with transport inhibitors showed that YY 1 is not transported by either passive diffusion or a Crm 1 -mediated system. The overexpression and RNA interference studies of YY 1 implied that the translocated YY 1 represses the vaccinia <b>virus</b> intermediate <b>transcription.</b> It was previously described that the overexpression of TBP activates vaccinia <b>virus</b> intermediate <b>transcription.</b> A TBP RNA interference study supported overexpression results. Based on the above results and YY 1 binding site mutation experiments, a replacement model of viral intermediate transcription is suggested. In this model, YY 1 competes with a yet-to-be-identified nuclear activator(s) for the binding site on vaccinia virus intermediate promoter. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{eukaryotic}} mRNAs {{to serve as}} primers for influenza <b>virus</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> depends {{on the presence of}} a 5 '-terminal methylated can structure, the absence of which eliminates essentially all priming activity [Plotch, S. J., Bouloy, M. & Krug, R. M. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 1618 - 1622]. The present study was undertaken {{to determine the extent to}} which each of the methyl groups in the cap influences the priming activity of a mRNA. To assess the importance of the 2 '-O-methyl group on the penultimate base of the cap, we used several plant viral RNAs containing the monomethylated cap 0 structure, m 7 GpppG. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA 4 stimulated influenza <b>virus</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> only about 10 - 15 % as effectively as did globin mRNA, which has a cap with a 2 '-O-methyl group. When the cap of BMV RNA 4 was enzymatically 2 '-O-methylated, its priming activity was increased 14 -fold. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with other plant virus RNAs. To assess the importance of the terminal 7 -methyl group, BMV RNA 4 containing the cap structure GpppGm was prepared by a series of chemical and enzymatic steps. These molecules were found to be only about 15 % as active in priming as BMV RNA 4 molecules containing the fully methylated cap, m 7 GpppGm, indicating that the terminal 7 -methyl group also strongly enhances priming activity. These results indicate that the cap 1 structure (m 7 GpppXm) found in all mammalian cellular mRNAs is more stringently required for priming influenza <b>virus</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> than for translation in cell-free systems...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study the extent of endogenous, type-C <b>virus</b> genome <b>transcription</b> in normal and {{regenerating}} mouse liver was analysed by using the technique of nucleic acid hybridization. The RNA preparations from regenerating liver tissues collected at various intervals following partial hepatectomy, and from normal iver samples of BALB/c mice, were hybridized to 3 H-DNA complementary to 60 to 70 S RNA of an endogenous, N-tropic virus, released spontaneously from BALB/c mouse cells in culture. Although partial transcription of the endogenous virus gen-ome can be clearly detected in normal iver, {{a significant increase in}} the level of virus-specific RNA synthesis in the regenerating liver, in comparison to normal liver, is apparent, following partial hepatectomy. This increase in virus-specific RNA synthesis attains its highest level just before the level of DNA synthesis n the regenerating liver reaches its maximum. These observations may indicate aqualita-tive or quantitative change in the endogenous type-C <b>virus</b> genome <b>transcription</b> pattern in hepatocytes, in response to partial hepatectomy and suggest that this change in the transcription pattern and the initiation of cell proliferation, in regen-erating livers, are probably sequential and related events...|$|R

40|$|Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) open {{reading frame}} 21 (ORF 21) is one of at least five VZV genes {{expressed}} in latently infected human and rodent ganglia. To determine whether ORF 21 is required for latent and lytic infection, we deleted 99 % of ORF 21 from the viral genome. The ORF 21 deletion mutant virus could be propagated only in a cell line expressing the ORF 21 protein. Insertion of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) homolog of VZV ORF 21, HSV- 1 UL 37, into the ORF 21 deletion mutant failed to complement the mutant for growth in cell culture. Inoculation of cotton rats with the ORF 21 deletion virus resulted in latent infection in numbers of animals similar to those infected after inoculation with the parental virus. The mean numbers of latent VZV genomes were similar in animals infected with parental and ORF 21 deletion <b>viruses.</b> <b>Transcription</b> of ORF 63, another latency-associated gene, was detected in ganglia from similar numbers of animals infected with the mutant and parental viruses.
