40|$|This thesis {{develops}} and applies novel {{methods to}} understand water mass variability {{and change in}} the global ocean. A water mass framework is developed that determines the diathermal and diahaline transformations of water between water mass classes from the temporal variations in their <b>volumetric</b> <b>distribution.</b> Water masses are {{defined in terms of}} their temperature and salinity. This reveals the roles of air [...] sea fluxes, mixing and transport changes. The second chapter explores the drivers of interannual variability in the overturning circulation in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre using the water mass framework. Variations in the <b>volumetric</b> <b>distribution</b> of water masses reveal that transport anomalies at the gyre boundaries predominantly set the volume and heat budget and that these transport anomalies are governed by Ekman pumping over the gyre. In the third and fourth chapters of this thesis the water mass framework is applied to observations of temperature and salinity in the Southern Ocean. Seasonal variations in the distribution of water masses reveal the imprint of the Southern Ocean overturning. This highlights the importance of seasonally varying air-sea fluxes in the formation of intermediate water at the expense of deep water, winter water and surface water. This reveals a diabatic pathway for the upwelling and conversion of deep water into intermediate water. Deep water is first cooled and freshened during the winter by mixing with overlying winter water triggered by a cabbeling instability. Sea ice-melt and surface heating then warm and freshen this seasonally formed water mass to create intermediate water during the summer months. These results suggest that the process of cabbeling could be a rate determining step in the global overturning circulation and the upwelling of deep waters. The fifth chapter of this thesis explores an alternative method to determine a <b>volumetric</b> <b>distribution</b> using individual Argo profiles. The <b>volumetric</b> <b>distribution</b> determined using this profile based estimate is compared to the distribution calculated using a geographically interpolated dataset. This comparison reveals that the interpolation scheme used to geographically grid Argo appears to artificially mix water masses toward the centre of the distribution. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermal effect}} {{developed}} {{due to the}} heating of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in presence of external magnetic field can be precisely controlled by the proper selection of magnetic absorption properties of the MNPs. The present paper deals with the numerical simulation of temperature field developed within or outside the tumor, {{in the presence of}} an external alternating magnetic field, using a thermofluidic model developed using ANSYS FLUENT®. A three-layer nonuniform tissue structure with one or two blood vessels surrounding the tumor is considered for the present simulation. The results obtained clearly suggest that the <b>volumetric</b> <b>distribution</b> pattern of MNPs within the tumor has a strong influence on the temperature field developed. The linear pattern of <b>volumetric</b> <b>distribution</b> has a strong effect over the two other types of distribution considered herein. Various other important factors like external magnetic field intensity, frequency, vascular congestion, types of MNP material, and so forth are considered to find the influence on the temperature within the tumor.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{determining}} the efficiency curves - i. e. partition number versus particle volumetric grade - for two-product separators is presented. Areal grade measurements are made on polished sections of the feed, the concentrate and the tailings of the separator and a kernel-based inversion technique is then used to obtain the <b>volumetric</b> grade <b>distribution</b> of the three assemblages of particles. The inversion is constrained by mass-balance equations. A plain kernel (by number of occurrences) and a weighted kernel (each occurrence counted with its area) are used for the solution. The weighted damped least-squares solution minimizes balance error and provides the partition curves of the separator. The method is tested on synthetic data from computer-generated areal grade measurements. Comparison of the derived <b>volumetric</b> <b>distributions</b> and partition curves with the original (simulated) liberation spectra of the feed and products of the separators allows {{the efficiency of the}} method as a means of evaluating the performance of a separator to be judged.

Thus, there {{is the need for}} a dosimetric system that is truly three dimensional, sensitive to radiation in each point and tissue equivalent. In this framework, great interest is encountered by radio-chromic gel dosimeters. In order to address the limitations of gels based on natural matrices, some investigators have proposed dosimeters based on poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) made by freezing-thawing cycles. Even though these gels have a low diffusion rate, they are also difficult to prepare and they have low sensitivity. Furthermore, depending on the gelation temperature they can only be read out by MRI. We hereby present a PVA gel that is chemically crosslinked, and that offers high sensitivity and low diffusion. These gels can be read out with optical techniques. Materials and Methods: The proposed gel contains 10...|$|R

This study aimed at evaluating the effect of the vertical <b>volumetric</b> <b>distribution</b> of an axial fan sprayer on the Brevipalpus phoenicis control efficiency. First, an assay was performed to evaluate the vertical volume distribution uniformity of the sprayer, assessing different spray nozzles configurations on the spray arcs, sides of the sprayer and spray heights. Afterwards, another experiment was carried out to analyze the relationship between the distribution of the Fenpyroximate acaricide on Coffea arabica L. and the B. phoenicis control efficiency. The treatments were arranged in a 4 x 2 factorial + 1 additional control, consisting of four spray volumes (200 L ha- 1, 400 L ha- 1, 600 L ha- 1 and 800 L ha- 1) and two spray nozzles configurations (1 : 100 % of MAG 1. 5 nozzles; 2 : upper extension with 5 MAG 3. 0 nozzles, middle extension with 9 MAG 1. 5 nozzles and lower extension with 4 MAG 3. 0 nozzles). Configuration 2 provided the smallest coefficient of variation (28 %). Nozzle configurations had no effect on the incidence of B. phoenicis.

The application involves: 1. generation of a spatial mineral texture of a mineralized rock sample. 2. derivation of the (volumetric) liberation spectrum of the particulate resulting from the simulation of the sample fragmentation. 3. calculation of the inversion kernel based on measures of areal grade made on the intersection of random testing planes with the particles generated. 4. generation of areal measures on a virtual polished section. 5. solving the inversion problem for comparison of the recovered <b>volumetric</b> <b>distribution</b> with the original (simulated) liberation spectrum.

40|$|The <b>volumetric</b> <b>distribution</b> of cobalt-rich {{manganese}} crusts (CRC) is {{of significant}} interest for mining and geology. Traditionally studying underwater deposits of CRC involved physical sampling from Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) or using dredges. Recently, acoustic measurements of crust thickness {{have been demonstrated}} that can give a significantly higher spatial resolution for measurement. The probe makes high resolution measurements of sub-surface reflections to calculate {{the thickness of the}} deposit. However, CRC coverage is often not continuous {{and it is difficult to}} determine from the acoustic signals alone whether an acoustic signal was measured over CRC or not. The authors propose a method to filter these using visual information (3 D colour map of the seafloor) from the same region. After locating the acoustic beam on the seafloor, points around the region are selected. A number of analyses are performed on this point cloud to extract parameters that can reliably discriminate between exposed CRC and other types of seafloor. The proposed method was tested on two areas of seafloor - one which is known to contain crust and one which does not contain crust. These two sets of data were then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The trained classifier was then tested with the training sets and a test set containing both crust and non-crust regions to verify if the CRC is being detected reliably. The results were promising; in 85. 4 % of the cases, the detection was successful. The performance will be verified by using larger sets of data.

Accurate volumetric data {{can easily be}} acquired with the ever-increasingly available computerized tomography (CT) scan. This manuscript reviews the available staghorn stone classifications and rationalizes the morphometry-based classification. Materials and Methods: A Pubmed search was performed for articles concerning staghorn classification and morphometry. Twenty abstracts were shortlisted from a total of 43 published abstracts. In view of the paucity of manuscripts on staghorn morphometry (4), older staghorn classifications were analyzed with the aim to determine the most optimum one having relevance to the percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) monotherapy outcome. Results: All available staghorn classifications are limited with non-widespread applicability. The traditional partial and complete staghorn are limited due to non-descript stone volumetric data and considerable overlap of the intermediate ones in either group. A lack of standardized definition limits intergroup comparison as well. Staghorn morphometry is a recent addition to the clinical classification profiling of a staghorn calculus.

Geoelectrical monitoring can provide temporal and <b>volumetric</b> <b>distributions</b> of electrical resistivity, which are directly related to moisture content. To date, studies demonstrating this capability have been restricted to 2 D sections, which are insufficient to capture the full degree of spatial heterogeneity.

Crucially the time-lapse inversion methodology employed here incorporates movements of the electrodes on the unstable surface. Although seasonal characteristics dominate the shallow moisture dynamics during the first two years with surficial drying in summer and wetting in winter, in the months preceding reactivation, moisture content increased by more than 45 % throughout the slope. This is in agreement with independent data showing a significant rise in piezometric heads and shallow soil moisture contents as a result of prolonged and intense rainfall.

The acoustic data were acquired as the ship steamed a survey grid relative to the track of a surface drifter with a subsurface drogue. Although quite irregular in geographical coordinate space, the ship's track relative to the moving water closely matched the intended grid pattern once the drifter's movement in the tidal flow was taken into account. After changing coordinate systems to compensate for tidal advection, the acoustic data set was transformed from its curtain-like distribution in 3 -dimensional space to a <b>volumetric</b> <b>distribution.</b> Two-dimensional point kriging was performed on the irregularly spaced data from each 2 -m-thick depth stratum to produce a series of 2 -dimensional, regularly spaced data grids.

A similar procedure was followed with the error variance values produced at each grid point through kriging to construct a three-dimensional, <b>volumetric</b> <b>distribution</b> of the error variance. To examine zooplankton patchiness within the surveyed volume of water, isosurfaces corresponding to specific levels of acoustic backscatter were highlighted in the visualization.
