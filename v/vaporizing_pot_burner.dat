5000|$|In the pre Hispanic period, {{the best}} pottery makers {{in what is}} now the State of Mexico were the Matlatzincas, whose work was {{influenced}} by that of the Nahuas, producing urns, <b>pots,</b> incense <b>burners,</b> cups and plates. However, it was not as brilliant or as fine as the pottery produced in Cholula or Tenochtitlan. [...] In the colonial period, pottery did not disappear, like some other indigenous crafts, but was radically changed. European techniques were introduced, such as glazing, along with both European and Oriental decorative designs.|$|R
5000|$|The Yue Kiln Sites are a {{group of}} sites where Yue ware was made,, though they {{are by no means}} the only ones. They are located near Shanglin Lake, in Cixi City, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. The kilns {{produced}} celadon porcelain around the Shanglin Lake area during the Tang, Han, and Song dynasties are referred to as such. A variety of different wares were manufactured during the kilns' history, including [...] "jars, spittoons, wine <b>pots,</b> incense <b>burners,</b> cups, bowls, flasks, cases, writing-brush basins, dishes, handle-less cups, pots, wine cups, flat bowls, basins", and children's toys.|$|R
50|$|During the {{oil boom}} in the late 1970s and 1980s, there was a focused civic effort to bring art to Jeddah's public areas. As a result, Jeddah {{contains}} {{a large number of}} modern open-air sculptures and works of art, typically situated in roundabouts, making the city one of the largest open-air art galleries in the world. Sculptures include works by Jean/Hans Arp, César Baldaccini, Alexander Calder, Henry Moore, Joan Miró and Victor Vasarely. They often depict traditional Saudi items such as coffee <b>pots,</b> incense <b>burners,</b> palm trees, etc. The fact that Islamic tradition prohibits the depiction of living creatures, notably the human form, has made for some very creative, as well as bizarre, modern art. These include a giant geometry set, a giant bicycle, and a huge block of concrete with several cars protruding from it at odd angles. A monumental sculpture by Aref Rayess is devoted to Allah (God).|$|R
50|$|Iced lemon tea is {{available}} at many Hong Kong restaurants. A strong black tea (e.g. Ceylon) is brewed at length in a metal <b>pot</b> over a <b>burner,</b> and prepared as follows: a large glass is filled with ice, a scoop of simple syrup is added (if desired), and the glass is filled to the top with hot tea. Slices of lemon are placed atop the mixture, which are then muddled into the tea by the customer, ensuring that the volatile oils present in the lemon peel are at their peak when consumed.|$|R

50|$|A {{traditional}} turkey fryer kit {{consists of}} a burner, a large stock pot with lid, a basket and/or poultry holder, a lifter and a thermometer. The burner operates on a standard propane tank that usually must be purchased separately. Current burner units are {{much lower than the}} original design so as to increase stability and help prevent tip-overs. Lower cost units use an aluminum stock pot and a steel burner while higher-end units include a stainless steel <b>pot</b> and <b>burner.</b> Some stock <b>pots</b> may have an integrated valve to drain the oil. The poultry holder {{consists of a}}n aluminum or stainless steel disk with a metal rod formed into a loop with the ends affixed {{to the center of the}} disk. The loop is placed through the cavity of the turkey and the lifter is used to lower and remove the turkey. If a basket is used, it includes a bail that is grabbed by the lifter. The thermometer has a long probe and is used to monitor the temperature of the oil. The fryer can also be used to cook other poultry and seafood. The stock pot lid is used to cover the pot only when not actually frying or when preparing other foods by boiling in water. Heavy gloves and an apron are recommended.|$|R
50|$|Other {{practices}} {{may have}} included ancestor worship as god <b>pots</b> and incense <b>burners</b> {{have been found}} at burial sites. Reports of cremation burials (Baer and Baer, 1952) exist as well as ritual links to astronomy and dream interpretation. Not much is known about these practices. A specific belief regarding the god Akyantho’ is that he had first given the Lacandón tools, medicine, animals, liquor, and other trade associated items but then took them away and gave them to foreigners because they were taking better care of these items. As a punishment for their irresponsibility, the Lacandón had {{to interact with the}} foreigners in order to obtain what they needed. In addition, the Lacandón believed that their Gods had once dwelled in the ruins along with their ancestors. Many rituals were performed at these sites as evidenced by the numerous god pots found throughout. Breaking any of the rocks or damaging the buildings of the ruins was seen as disrespecting the Gods. Often these places were guarded but the increasing interruption of ceremonies along with the damaging of the sites and the god pots there forced the Lacandón back into the jungles to perform their rituals privately. Didier Boremanse, in the book South and Meso-American Native Spirituality, gives some detailed accounts of specific rituals that he witnessed (pp. 324-351).|$|R
40|$|Two {{common types}} of wood (beech and fir) were burned in {{commercial}} pellet (11. 1 kW) and wood (8. 2 kW) stoves following a combustion cycle simulating {{the behavior of}} a real-world user. Ultrafine particulate matter (UFP, dp< 100 nm) was sampled with three parallel multistage impactors and analyzed for metals, main water soluble ions, anhydrosugars, total carbon, and PAH content. The measurement of the number concentration and size distribution was also performed by a fourth multistage impactor. UFP mass emission factors averaged to 424 mg/kgfuel for all the tested stove and wood type (fir, beech) combinations except for beech log burning in the wood stove (838 mg/kgfuel). Compositional differences were observed for pellets and wood UFP samples, where high TC levels characterize the wood log combustion and potassium salts are dominant in every pellet sample. Crucial aspects determining the UFP composition in the wood stove experiments are critical situations in terms of available oxygen (a lack or an excess of combustion air) and high temperatures. Whereas for the automatically controlled pellets stove local situations (e. g., hindered air-fuel mixing due to heaps of pellets on the <b>burner</b> <b>pot)</b> determine the emission levels and composition. Wood samples contain more potentially carcinogenic PAHs with respect to pellets samples. Some diagnostic ratios related to PAH isomers and anhydrosugars compiled from experimental UFP data in the present study and compared to literature values proposed for the emission source discrimination for atmospheric aerosol, extend the evaluation usually limited to higher particle size fractions also to UFP...|$|R
40|$|Combustion {{generated}} ultrafine {{particles are}} believed to have an effect on human health. Their presence in the atmosphere is mainly attributed to outdoor sources, but they may also form indoor. Gas cooking is a widely diffused indoor activity commonly considered environmentally clean, and without emissions of particulate matter. However, even bluish flames of natural gas may produce considerable number concentrations of sub- 10 nm particles if operating conditions deviate from stoichiometry and mixing at atomic level. These particles negligibly account for particulate mass but, due to their very low sizes, they can deposit far inside the airways and on skin and potentially reach target organs being dangerous although present in low mass concentrations. We have characterized the exhausts of a domestic cooktop burner measuring stable compounds, gas-phase aromatic compounds and particulate matter and collected nanoparticles for in vitro toxicological studies and for the analysis of their possible inflammatory effects. Combustion exhausts, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and nanoparticles, have been sampled above a mid-range cooktop burner fed with network natural gas. Tests have been performed in a free flame and by putting a <b>pot</b> on the <b>burner</b> in order to simulate operating conditions closer to those of the real life. Speciation of PAHs and the distribution of the particles generated during combustion has been measured. Results of measurements show that the cooktop burner flames produce and emit low concentrations of PAHs and huge number concentrations of sub- 10 nm particles. Tests on cell viability performed with crystal violet assay shows no significative reduction in cell number after 24 h of treatment, both with nanoparticles collected in a "free flame" and in the operating conditions with "a pot on the fire". It is interesting to note a little positive effect in increasing cell number (+ 20 %) at the lowest concentration. No relevant overexpression or downregulation is noted on the secretion of the 27 Plex Panel of Human Cytokine, performed with Bio-Plex 200 system...|$|R
