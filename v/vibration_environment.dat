40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Naval Postgraduate School CubeSat Launcher (NPSCuL) is a five-sided structure {{capable of carrying}} up to 24 CubeSats to orbit. The vibration test environment for CubeSats flying on NPSCuL on the Atlas-V is extremely harsh, {{partly due to the}} input <b>vibration</b> <b>environment</b> from the launch vehicle itself, and partly due to amplification from the NPSCuL structure. This thesis documents the implementation of a relatively new technology, Force Limited Vibration Testing (FLVT), and the design of a stiffer structure to reduce the <b>vibration</b> <b>environment</b> for NPSCuL payloads. Most acceleration-controlled vibration tests result in significant over-test. FLVT limits shaker forces, producing more realistic tests and potentially provides relief to payloads. Additionally, increasing the stiffness of NPSCuL using an isogrid design, aimed to increase its first-fundamental frequency, could result in less displacement at higher frequencies for a given amount of input energy, possibly improving the payload <b>vibration</b> <b>environment.</b> It was found that FLVT was very successful in reducing vibration environments for NPSCuL payloads. Although redesigning NPSCuL using an isogrid design achieved the goal of increasing system stiffness, it did not reduce the <b>vibration</b> <b>environment.</b> None the less, lessons learned from the redesign process will be valuable for continuing <b>vibration</b> <b>environment</b> reduction efforts.

40|$|The vibration-based energy {{scavenger}} {{consists of}} beams with piezoelectric layers and proof mass, is usually designed by single-link or cantilever beam configurations. In order to overcome inherent problems, for example, insufficient bandwidth and model inaccuracies, {{we consider the}} motion of a two-link flexible arm with non-uniform cross-section. The governing equations consist of coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDE) with appropriate boundary conditions. Most of the energy scavengers are based on linear electromechanical devices excited at resonance. Besides, realistic <b>vibration</b> <b>environments</b> {{can be described as}} stochastic, multi-frequency and time varying.

40|$|When {{equipment}} designs must {{perform in}} a broad band <b>vibration</b> <b>environment</b> {{it can be difficult}} to avoid resonances that affect life and performance. This is especially true when an organization seeks to employ an asset from a heritage design in a new, more demanding <b>vibration</b> <b>environment.</b> Particle dampers may be used to provide significant attenuation of lightly damped resonances to assist with such a deployment of assets by including only a very minor set of modifications. This solution may be easier to implement than more traditional attenuation schemes. Furthermore, the cost in additional weight to the equipment can be very small. Complexity may also be kept to a minimum, because the particle dampers do not require tuning. Attenuating the vibratory response with particle dampers may therefore be simpler (in a set it and forget it kind of way) than tuned mass dampers. The paper will illustrate the use of an "equivalent resonance test jig" that can assist designers in verifying the potential resonance attenuation that may be available to them during the early trade stages of the design. An approach is suggested for transforming observed attenuation in the jig to estimated performance in the actual service design.
