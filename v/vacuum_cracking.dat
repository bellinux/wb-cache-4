Structural parts may be subjected to very high numbers of load cycles, and therefore the very high cycle fatigue properties of these materials are of great interest. Fatigue tests in laboratory air were carried out on wrought magnesium alloy AZ 61 using ultrasonic fatigue testing equipment. The fatigue strength at 109 cycles is 98 MPa, which is 32 % of the tensile strength. Fatigue cracks are predominantly initiated from slip bands at the surface. Near threshold fatigue crack growth was studied in ambient air and vacuum and showed a dominant influence of the environment.

40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} for an elliptical cylinder cavity or a crack inside an infinite piezoelectric medium under combined mechanical-electrical loadings are formulated via the Stroh formalism and well confirmed by finite element analysis. The {{results show that}} the stress and electric fields {{in the vicinity of the}} crack tip are, in general, determined by a complex vector of intensity factors. The complex vector of intensity factors may reduce to be real under certain circumstances. For a <b>vacuum</b> <b>crack,</b> the electric field inside the crack in the direction perpendicular to the crack magnifies the corresponding applied electric field by more than 1000 times. In this case, the electric field strength in the material has a finite value at the crack tip, but the electric displacement approaches infinity at the crack tip due to the piezoelectricity. The self-consistent analysis is developed to determine the deformed crack profile. The energy release rate for the cavity propagation is formulated under the condition that the ratio of the minor semi-axis to the major semi-axis of the ellipse remains unchanged. For an insulating crack, the applied electric field contributes nothing to the energy release rate when the undeformed crack profile is used, while the electric field resists crack propagation when the deformed crack profile is used. For a conducting slit crack, the energy release rate is independent of the applied electric field perpendicular to the crack, and is enhanced by the applied electric field parallel to the crack.

40|$|The high {{temperature}} fatigue characteristics of U 720 Li {{have been investigated}} over the temperature range 650 °C to 725 °C under imposed dwell times (at maximum load) of 1 and 20 seconds in vacuum and air conditions. The effect of varying grain size and coherent precipitate size under these conditions has been assessed. Testing in air resulted in oxidation dominated intergranular crack growth at all temperatures and dwell times with the slope (m-values) of the crack growth rate curves remaining constant. Increased crack growth rates are seen at the higher temperatures and at longer dwells, although no effect of dwell was observed at 650 ?C in the as-received fine grained variant. In <b>vacuum</b> <b>crack</b> growth rates were much lower than in air and a purely cyclic dependent regime was evident at 650 °C. As temperature and dwell time at maximum load was increased, m-values increased and were accompanied by a change in crack growth mechanism from transgranular to intergranular cracking. This indicated that true, time-dependent, creep-fatigue processes were occurring. The large grain variant of the U 720 Li showed little advantage in crack growth rates within the cyclic dependent and creep-fatigue regime, but did show {{a significant increase in}} resistance to crack growth in the time dependent (oxidation-fatigue) regime.

Generalized semi-permeable crack-face boundary conditions are proposed to simulate realistic opening cracks with dielectric.

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of vacuum environment on fatigue crack propagations in a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy, K-decreasing tests were conducted in air and <b>vacuum.</b> The fatigue <b>crack</b> propagation rate became slower and threshold stress intensity factor range became larger with decreasing vacuum pressure. The tendency cannot be fully explained by the crack closure. Based on fracture surface observations, granular region of a few micrometer size asperities was observed on the fracture surface only in high vacuum and ultra high vacuum. The high vacuum environment is one of the necessary conditions for the formation of the granular region, and the fraction of surface coverage of adsorbed gas on fracture surfaces relates to the phenomenon. The formation of the granular region represents the difference of the crack propagation mechanism between vacuum and air environments. A new mechanism for the formation of the granular region was proposed, {{and that is one of}} the phenomena which can explain the reduction of crack propagation rate in vacuum. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Titanium alloys {{are widely}} used in the {{aerospace}} industry, owing largely to their high specific fatigue strength at temperatures approaching 550 C. A highly adherent and repassivating oxide layer makes titanium alloys highly corrosion resistant in many environments; their presumed immunity to corrosion-enhanced fatigue in typical aerospace environments was another initial attraction. The inaccuracy of this assumption was first revealed in the 1960 s. Later, numerous studies found titanium to be vulnerable to stress corrosion cracking, particularly {{in the presence of}} molten salts. This thesis concerns the fatigue behaviour of titanium alloys used for aeroengine gas turbine compressor discs, specifically Ti- 6246 and IMI 834. This research originally arose from the unexpected premature cracking of a spinning rig test component, suffered by Rolls-Royce plc, with a mysterious blue spot at the fatigue crack origin. The same macroscopic appearance of the crack origin could also be found in some test specimens held within the company's specimen archives. Initial discussions led to a parallel investigation of (i) the blue spot origins and (ii) the rate of crack growth in subsurface, naturally initiated cracks. Chemical characterisation of the blue spot origin was undertaken using focussed ion beam-secondary ion mass spectrometry and scanning-transmission electron microscopy based energy dispersive X-ray analysis as the principle techniques. The blue spot cracking phenomenon is found to be due to a hot salt stress corrosion cracking mechanism. Evidence from chemical analysis on the fracture surface and adjacent specimen surface suggests that in the presence of moisture, stress and elevated temperatures, NaCl deposits react with and disrupt the protective titanium oxide scale, producing byproducts of sodium titanate and HCl(g). In subsequent reactions the HCl attacks the newly exposed bare titanium metal, forming volatile titanium chlorides and atomic hydrogen, as well as a regenerating cycle of gaseous HCl. The resulting hydrogen segregating to the crack tip causes the crack to advance in a brittle manner, until the finite supply of corrodant is exhausted leading to a transition back to conventional low cycle fatigue. Importantly, it is inferred that because HSSCC requires both low pressures (so the alloy chlorides are volatile) and high temperatures, this is a mechanism that will operate in spin rig tests and under laboratory conditions, but not in compressors during flights where the localised air pressure is much higher. Post-mortem examination of electron transparent specimens lifted directly from the fracture surface enabled comparisons of the dislocation morphology and density beneath a hydrogen assisted origin (blue spot), low cycle fatigue origin and low cycle fatigue propagation region. A distinct change in dislocation mechanism is observed in the presence of hydrogen, where a lower dislocation density is observed compared to the LCF origin and propagation region. The results are consistent with the hydrogen enhanced localised plasticity (HELP) mechanism, and reference is also made to the competing theories of hydrogen enhanced decohesion (HEDE) and adsorption induced dislocation emission (AIDE). X-ray microtomography was used to monitor the growth of naturally initiated surface and subsurface fatigue cracks in air and vacuum environments at elevated temperatures. Surprisingly, this appears to be the first time that naturally initiated subsurface fatigue cracks have been examined using synchrotron X-ray microtomography. It is found that subsurface cracks grow more slowly than surface breaking <b>cracks,</b> even in <b>vacuum,</b> whilst air-exposed <b>cracks</b> grow fastest of all. In all three cases, cracking initiates at the primary alpha grains. The topic is of interest, as while it has long been known that cracks grow more slowly in laboratory vacuum than in air, the vacuum found in a subsurface crack would be much better, and potentially so good that hydrogen could be desorbed from the matrix material.
