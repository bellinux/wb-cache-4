The {{aim of the}} present study was to provide a better insight into the adaptive processes within Rosa hybrid plants cv. Eurored grown in soilless cultivation when exposed to water deficit. Also, the study and evaluation of the local and easily available substrates using in hydroponics and finally, the identification of plants effects from the particular cultivation system in order to improve productivity. Next, postharvest behavior of rose stems were evaluated relatively to the fast reversal of balance between water absorption and transpiration of cut flower stems during vase life and the investigation of physiological and biochemical changes that take place after harvesting. Rose plants were grown under three different substrates conditions (perlite, pine bark-almond shells 1 : 1 (v/v), and perlite-pumice 1 : 1 (v/v)) and two water regimes (100 % and 67 % of the irrigation needs). At the beginning, seasonal changes (spring, summer and winter) in photosynthetic parameters, water relations, leaf chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence and flower stem production were quantified. The photosynthetic rate of young rose leaves had higher values during spring, reduced while winter and obtained the lowest values during summer. Photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and relative humidity (RH, %) correlated with photosynthesis positively at both water regimes and leaf temperature negatively. Also chlorophyll content of the young leaves showed a high positive correlation with photosynthesis. Stomatal conductance of the young leaves showed the lower value during summer and intercellular CO 2 of the same leaves showed an inverse pattern from leaf photosynthesis. The mean value of the seasons was shown that mild water stress leads to a) a negative effect on the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance although there was no reduction on the intercellular CO 2, b) a decline of leaf chlorophyll and chlorophyll fluorescence, c) a decrease on the transpiration rate, leaf water potential (LWP) and relative water content (RWC), however water use efficiency (WUE) was increased, d) a reduction on the total production of flower stems, however, the number of extra quality flower stems was not affected. However, substrates did not affect any physiological or biochemical or growth parameters. As a result the reduced metabolic energy represses growth. Also daily changes were quantified in photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Cs), intercellular CO 2 concentration (Cint, ppm), leaf temperature (oC) photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and relative humidity (RH, %) and leaf water potential (LWP) at the 2 - 3 h and at 6 - 7 h after the sunrise. Stomatal conductance and the intercellular CO 2 concentration had positive correlation with photosynthesis, as well as the intercellular CO 2 concentration had positive correlation with stomatal conductance. Photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and leaf water potential were differentiated during the day, with the higher <b>values</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> at the first hours after sunrise and the lowest values at midday for all the substrates, with the lowest percentage of reduction to be observed at the plants which are subjected to mild stress. ...|$|E

Materials and methods: Rat parotid and submandibular glands were X-irradiated with doses up to 25 Gy and morphological damage assayed up to 6 days after irradiation. Damage to the different cell types in the glands was assessed after H & E staining. Apoptotic appearance was judged by compacted chromatin and fragmentation of cells into lobulated masses. Results: In about 3 % of the cells aberrant nuclei <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> after doses as low as 2 Gy and around 7. 5 and 24 h after irradiation.

At 6 days after 2 Gy, no signs of radiation-induced apoptosis was apparent and for most cell types a <b>value</b> close <b>to</b> zero <b>was</b> <b>observed.</b> Conclusions: Radiation studies on salivary function in the rat show the typical response with respect to;lose (5 - 15 Gy) and time (1 - 3 days).

For {{a wide variety of}} infall histories of unprocessed baryonic matter to feed star formation, most of the <b>observed</b> MDs can <b>be</b> well described by our model.

Interactions between these two compounds and miltefosine were classified as synergistic, with the most effective association being between AB 13 and miltefosine, where decreases of IC 50 <b>values</b> <b>to</b> 6 mM <b>were</b> <b>observed,</b> similar <b>to</b> the miltefosine activity alone. AB 13 induced significant morphological changes, while both derivatives produced anti-proliferative activity through cell cycle arrest at the G 0 /G 1 phase. Neither of these derivatives induced significant apoptosis/necrosis, as indicated by phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation assays. In addition, neither of the derivatives induced death in macrophage cell lines. Thus, they do not present any potential risk of toxicity for the host cells. This study has identified the betulin derivative BT 06 and the betulinic acid derivative AB 13 as promising molecules {{in the development of}} new alternative therapies for leishmaniasis, including those involving combined-therapy with miltefosine...|$|R
40|$|Biofiltration of Triethylamine (TEA) vapor {{used as a}} {{catalyst}} in casting operations was evaluated in this study. The unit consisted of a 6 -L three-stage biofilter containing a mixture of compost and wood chips (40 : 60 v/v) as the filter medium. Seed microbial population from municipal activated sludge was acclimated {{for a period of}} three weeks prior to the actual experimental runs. In the startup period, high pH <b>values</b> up <b>to</b> 10 <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> due <b>to</b> alkaline nature of TEA and inadequate formation of biofilm and low overall biodegradation. Steady increase of organic-N concentration along with gradual upward trend of pressure drop indicated sound establishment of microbial population. Operational parameters studied included loading rate (6 - 116 g m- 3 h- 1), hydraulic detention times (40 - 60 s), temperature (30 ± 1 °C), and humidity (50 - 55 %). Results indicated effluent ammonia concentrations meeting standards of 25 ppm can be obtained after 2. 5 months of operation. Optimal organic loading rates (OLRs) of 90 ± 14 g m- 3 h- 1 for Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) value of 48 s was suggested. Under these conditions, elimination capacity of 71 ± 3 g m- 3 h- 1 and removal efficiency 81 ± 14 % were achieved. Mass balance was performed on different forms of nitrogen products for a constant inlet concentration of 180 ppm TEA with a relatively stable removal efficiency of about 90 % maintained for over a month. Both liquid (leachate) and gas (different sections, inlet, and outlet) phase measurements were made for the purpose of performing calculations. Ammonium-N and Nitrate-N were dominant in the first and third sections of the reactor, respectively. Cumulative TEA-N mass balance over a 2 -month period indicated an equal proportion breakdown into ammonia-N, nitrate-N, and ammonium & organic-N. The fact that up to 30 % of TEA-N could not be accounted for in the leachate and gas measurements can <b>be</b> attributed <b>to</b> incorporation into the cellular constituents...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is {{associated}} with abnormalities of lung function characterized {{by an increase in}} static elastance of the respiratory system. We examined the following: a) the effects of CPB on the total inspiratory volume-pressure (V-P) relationship of the respiratory system; b) the relative contribution of the chest wall and lung to the impairment of respiratory system mechanics; and c) the time-course of such impairment. Design: Prospective, interventional study. Setting: Surgical and medical intensive care units in a teaching hospital. Patients: Eight adult patients scheduled for elective open heart surgery to correct valvular dysfunction. Interventations: V-P curves (interrupter technique) of the respiratory system were partitioned between the chest wall and lung by measurements of esophageal pressure. Measurements were obtained before sternotomy (control), immediately after, 4 hrs after, and 7 hrs after separation from CPB. Measurements and Main Results: Control V-P relationships of the respiratory system and lung showed lower inflection points (P(flex)) at pressure values of 5. 9 ± 2. 3 and 4. 3 ± 2. 5 cm H 2 O, respectively. Immediately after and 4 hrs after separation from CPB, both curves had sigmoid shapes because of lower P(flex) and formation of upper inflection (UIP) points. The pressures corresponding to the P(flex) increased significantly (p &lt;. 001) by 56 % ± 3 % and 78 % ± 4 %, whereas the UIP corresponded <b>to</b> a pressure <b>value</b> of 42. 34 ± 8. 5 and 35. 6 ± 7. 8 cm H 2 O in the respiratory system and lung, respectively. A linear V-P relationship of the chest wall <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> during the control condition and after separation from CPB. Four hours later, no further increases in the pressure <b>values</b> corresponding <b>to</b> P(flex) <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> on the inspiratory V-P curves of the respiratory system and lung, whereas the UIP occurred at a pressure of 35. 6 ± 9. 1 and 29. 7 ± 8. 4 cm H 2 O, respectively. A UIP was present on the V-P curve of the chest wall at a volume of 0. 77 ± 0. 02 L. Seven hours after separation from CPB, the inspiratory V-P curves of the respiratory system, chest wall, and lung returned to normal. Conclusions: Sternotomy and CPB produced immediate changes in lung mechanics. Chest wall mechanics were affected only 4 hrs after sternotomy. Seven hours after disconnection from CPB, all mechanics had returned to normal...|$|R
