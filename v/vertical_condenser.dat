In an earlier paper {{the results of a}} simulation of unstable flow phenomena in <b>vertical</b> <b>condensing</b> flows were presented. The horizontal condensing flow model was extended to include gravitational effects. The simulation of the non-linear model revealed existence of limit-cycle type of oscillations of large amplitude, including possibilities of flow reversals, as were observed on horizontal flows. The simulations also revealed that the gravitational effects have an attenuating effect on the oscillatory behavior in downward flows, and an enhancing effect on the upward flows. Matlab/Simulink tools were used for the system simulations. In the present paper the non-linear model was linearized, leading to an identification of the stable and unstable domains of operation for <b>vertical</b> <b>condensing</b> flows in both upward and downward flow directions. The stability boundary for the horizontal condensing flows lies in between the stability boundaries for vertical flows. The downward condensing flow is more stable and has a narrower unstable region than the horizontal flow. By comparison the <b>vertical</b> <b>condensing</b> upward flow is more unstable than both horizontal and downward flows. These observations are in correspondence with those of the non-linear model.

40|$|A new {{condensation}} heat transfer methodology has been implemented into a coarse-mesh finite-volume computer code. This methodology combines heat transfer logic based on bulk properties {{with the flow}} representation required to capture boundary layer phenomena. Application of the methodology increases {{the ability of the}} finite-volume code to predict thermal stratification, which in certain situations depends on resolving boundary layer flow adjacent to a <b>vertical</b> <b>condensing</b> surface.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study [1] it was shown that tilting a compact plate condenser may increase the heat flux to the coolant by about 8 %, depending on the inlet humidity. The explanation for this is enhanced drainage: {{the length of the}} paths of large drainage drops is increased, and the re-initiation of condensation at the ‘dry’ tracks decreases the mean gas-to-plate heat resistance. In the present study this explanation is verified, using infrared thermography and the following strategy of analysis [2]. The spatial temperature variations that occur in dropwise condensation on a condenser plate are measured instantaneously. They are averaged in time only in the direction parallel to the coolant flow (not vertical in a tilted exchanger). An assessment of extreme values leads to determination of the gas-to-plate heat resistance. The parameter Fcond quantifies the deviation of actual heat transfer from purely conductive heat transfer through the condensate. Mixing in the condensate, and the continual refreshing of liquid in contact with the gas, causes Fcond to be about 4 in a <b>vertical</b> <b>condenser</b> with dropwise condensation [2].

A code was also developed for the Kern’s method for the condenser design.

40|$|The 60 kW Heat Cycle Research Facility (HCRF) {{provides}} a means of examining different concepts and components associated with the generation of electrical power from a geothermal resource using a binary power cycle. In this power cycle the heat or energy in a hot geothermal fluid is transferred to a secondary working fluid. This working fluid is vaporized in the heat exchange process and the vapor is in turn expanded through a turbine which drives a generator producing electrical power. the heat or energy in the vapor leaving the turbine is transferred to a circulating cooling water in the condenser where the working fluid is condensed to a liquid which can be pumped back to the heaters, completing the cycle. This waste heat load in the condenser is in turn transferred from the cooling water to the atmosphere in a cooling tower. The HCRF allows the different components described in the cycle above to be tested {{as well as the}} basic cycle itself. This cycle may vary in that the heaters, condenser, cooling system, pumps, etc. may differ in number and type, however the basic cycle does not change significantly.

Experimental studies {{were conducted on}} three <b>vertical</b> <b>condenser</b> surfaces, resulting in film Reynolds numbers ranging from 17 to 238. Correspondingly, conditions in the condensate film varied from smooth laminar flow to wavy laminar flow. ^ The experimentally measured film condensation heat transfer rates with 3 M FC- 72 fluorocarbon {{were found to be}} in good agreement with condensation data for other fluids and standard film condensation correlations in both the laminar and wavy laminar regimes. Wave evolution on the condensate film was experimentally captured using high-speed video photography. Wave velocities and wavelengths were experimentally measured on a condensate film. The author is unaware of any prior experimental measurements of these quantities. Wave velocities in the condensing film appear to be slightly smaller than isothermal falling film wave velocities due to condensation at the vapor-liquid interface. ^ A numerical model was developed to simulate wavy condensate films in which the time-dependent evolution of the liquid-vapor interface was determined as part of the solution of the governing equations. A nonorthogonal coordinate transformation was used to accurately track the position of the wavy liquid film surface. The governing equations and boundary conditions were transformed and then discretized using the control volume formulation. Small amplitude disturbances were sustained {{through the use of a}} single-frequency forcing perturbation. ^ The numerical model captures the evolution of the wavy interface of the condensate film as it transitions from a smooth surface to one with small amplitude, sinusoidal type waves and finally to one with large amplitude, non-sinusoidal type waves. The local heat transfer coefficients associated with the wavy condensate film were found to be approximately 40 to 50 percent greater than predicted by the Nusselt smooth film model. Time-averaged thinning and increased fluid convection due to increased time-averaged velocities in the large amplitude, non-sinusoidal wave regime in the condensate film were both found to be significant and approximately equal contributing mechanisms to the heat transfer enhancement. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the simulation of the condensation of water vapour {{in the presence}} of non-condensable gas using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for turbulent flows in a <b>vertical</b> cylindrical <b>condenser</b> tube. The simulation accounts for the turbulent flow of the gas mixture, the condenser wall and the turbulent flow of the coolant in the annular channel with no assumptions of constant wall temperature or heat flux. The condensate film is assumed to occupy a negligible volume and its effect on the condensation of the water vapour has been taken into account by imposing a set of boundary conditions. A new strategy is used to overcome the limitation of the currently available commercial CFD package to solve the simultaneous simulation of flows involving multispecies and fluids of gas and liquid in separate channels. The results from the CFD simulations are compared with the experimental results from the literature for the condensation of water vapour with air as the non-condensable gas and for inlet mass fraction of the water vapour from 0. 66 to 0. 98. The CFD simulation results in general agree well with the directly measured quantities and it is found that the variation of heat flux in the condenser tube is more complex than a simple polynomial curve fit. The CFD results also show that, at least for flows involving high water vapour content, the axial velocity of the gas mixture at the interface between the gas mixture and the condensate film is in general not small and cannot be neglected...|$|R

Condensation heat transfer coefficients and overall UA-values are presented as a function of the applied voltage for the optimum smooth tube electrode design. The results show, for a given heat load, the Turbo CII tube can increase the condensation heat transfer coefficient up to 5. 5 times smooth tubes values by applying electric fields. Lower but considerable enhancements were also achieved for the Korodense tube. The necessary electric power input was found to be negligible representing less than 0. 004 % of the exchanged heat...|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{dance is}} a new and {{collaborative}} form of dance that typically utilises rock climbing equipment to suspend dancers against a range of vertical surfaces in public spaces. Its effects are to alter familiar systems we use to orientate ourselves in space and to produce or change social spaces. My pedagogical practice (2002 – the present day) and a portfolio of choreographic outputs (created and performed between 2009 and 2015) are of primary importance in my investigation into how I perceive space when dancing on a tilted floor and how this vertical stage and its location in social space influences my choreographic practice. The thesis begins with a manifesto for <b>vertical</b> dance that <b>condenses</b> the central arguments in{{to a set of}} instructions. There follows a categorization of the form using prototype theory (Wittgenstein, 1953;; Rosch, 1978;; Lakoff, 1987) applied to a set of vertical dance case studies from the 1970 s to the present day. I discuss how the specific spatial parameters of vertical dance affect how a dancer orientates herself on a vertical floor, and how a choreographer on the ground communicates with a dancer on a wall above, drawing on spatial theories in dance and cognitive linguistics (Laban, 1966;; Levinson et al., 2002 and Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). Lefebvre’s (1974) work on the production of social space as an intersecting triad of spatial practice, representation of space and representational spaces, and recent site-specific discourse (Kwon, (2004), Kester (2004)), (e. g. Kaye (2001), Hunter et al. (2015), Pearson (2010), Kloetzel and Pavlik (2009)) are used to analyse how space is produced and changed, and how the built environment is reminded of nature through the vertical dancing body at diverse locations such as Belfast City Hall, Welsh Government offices, a WW 2 German submarine station in France and Guildford Cathedral...|$|R
