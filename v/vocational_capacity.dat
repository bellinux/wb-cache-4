40|$|The study {{examined}} the variations in interest and self-concept of young adults in <b>vocational</b> <b>capacity</b> development in agriculture. The expo facto research type based on survey research approach was adopted for the study. Multi-stage sampling was used to select 300 young adult farmers who have completed their formal training in virtually all sectors of agriculture among secondary school programmes in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. Of the total sample, 113 (37. 7 %) were female while 187 (62. 3 %) were male. 151 (52. 2 %) of the respondents lived in the urban area while 149 (47. 8 %) respondents lived in the rural area. The respondents responded to the three sections of standardized validated instrument. The instrument was designed to collect information on the demographic characteristics, interest and self-concept of the respondents. Data analysis involved the use of independent T-test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to examine the variations in the self-concept and interest of the young adult farmers on the <b>vocational</b> <b>capacity</b> development programme by their gender, location and age. The result indicated that males had more interest and self-concept towards poultry enterprise than the females. Location did not significantly influence {{the interest of the}} respondents. Respondents between the age group of 31 - 35 were significantly different in their interest and self-concept as compared to other age groups. Based on the findings, it was suggested that it is vitally important that young adults, both male and female, irrespective of place or area of resident be exposed to counseling interventions geared towards enhancing the self-concept and interest of young adults in agricultural vocations. Government agencies should work towards the provision of basic amenities in the rural area to make the area attractive to the youths and by extension prevent rural-urban migration...|$|E

30|$|From an {{instructive}} perspective {{new technologies}} {{play an important}} role in VET, and in different ways. Firstly, they shift the educational content more closely toward the actual competencies needed in the workplace (Ludwig-Mayerhofer et al. 2011; Mayer and Solga 2008). For example, labelling the following themes “Ausbildung 4.0 ” (by which, in imitation of “Industry 4.0,” we mean “VET 4.0 ”; Frey and Osborne 2013), Zinn (2015) picked out digitization, industrial automation, and interconnectedness as central themes for a future reorganization of learning processes in VET. The rationale behind this reorganization is that changes to the requirements of professional life must have a direct impact on the nature of the essential workplace competencies that have to be assessed. Given the background assumption that VET should primarily enable young adults or trainees to participate in the workplace and should promote their <b>vocational</b> <b>capacities,</b> these changes in the field of learning require us to review the test modes and formats that we have deemed adequate for assessment.|$|R
30|$|Vocational {{education}} and training (VET) aims to enable young adults or trainees {{to participate in the}} workplace, and to promote their <b>vocational</b> <b>capacities.</b> In order to examine trainees’ competencies at the end of VET, appropriate instruments are needed. This contribution aims: (1) to give an outline of such an instrument, one that has been designed to evaluate vocational competencies in the field of economics, and (2) to present the results of an empirical comparison of two possible test modes: computer-based assessment (CBA) versus paper-based assessment (PBA). The use of new technologies offers various opportunities for competence measurement: in particular, the computer as an assessment tool presents an authentic work tool drawn from professional life and promises novel ways of designing assessments. However, the current assessment practice in Germany is dominated by the use of traditional PBA, and there is less evidence about the possible effects of CBA. This study addresses the question of whether there are significant differences in the various ways of representing and measuring commercial competence with respect to specific content, item format, and, finally, motivational aspects.|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} the {{experiences}} of traditional healers who work in a hospital environment in a different capacity. A secondary aim of this inquiry {{is to look at}} how participants' perceptions of the interface between traditional and modern medicine in a hospital context influences their practices as both traditional healers and hospital employees. A snowball sampling strategy was employed and five suitable participants were identified through referral and post-interview selection. Participants were selected from a sample of South African-born women who have experienced an ancestral calling and initiation into African traditional healing, have been initiated as an Inyanga/iSangoma (diviner), and are presently working in a different <b>vocational</b> <b>capacity</b> in a hospital environment. All participants work and reside in Gauteng. Data was collected through two semi-structured interviews per participant. Interviews were based on an interview guide. In looking at participants' experience as traditional healers who work in a hospital and how their perceptions on the interface between traditional and modern medicine influence their traditional healing practices, four research questions have been identified: 1. How do participants perceive themselves as a traditional healer? 2. How do participants perceive and experience their work in the hospital? 3. How do participants perceive the interface between traditional and modern approaches to healing in a hospital context? 4. How do participants experience the perceptions of others at work? A qualitative approach was adopted in order to gain an in-depth understanding of participants' experiences. Data analysis was guided by narrative and thematic approaches. Thus results are presented in accordance with principles of narrative and thematic content analysis. Interpretation of data focused on the ways in which these women relate to their role as traditional healer in a different <b>vocational</b> <b>capacity</b> and how their perceptions reflect a broader dialogue on the relationship between traditional and modern healing modalities in a modern health care context. Participants felt empowered by some colleagues who consulted them on traditional healing skills and applied them to patients without constraint upon their working duties. All felt they needed their jobs to support a decent living as full-time work as traditional healers would not provide for all their needs. Implications for future research and collaboration between western and traditional healing systems are considered...|$|E

One instrument currently dominating personality research is the Five Factor Model, a taxonomy that identifies five major domains of personal traits, composed of sets of facets. This model can be used within an organizational or <b>vocational</b> <b>capacity</b> to reveal dominant tendencies, such as openness to new experiences. Within a security context, this tool could show what patterns professionals exhibit, which may reveal the areas in which we are insufficiently diverse and where our blind spots are. We surveyed 43 security professionals using a Five Factor Model-based test (the IPIP-NEO) to reveal common dominant traits. We found that our sampled security population demonstrated that they were highly dutiful, achievement-striving, and cautious; in addition, they were high in morality and cooperation, but low in imagination. We conclude that many of these characteristics are appropriate for security professionals, although the low scores in the “openness to experience ” domain may indicate difficulties in devising new security defense methods and in anticipating new forms of attack. This potentially leaves large organizations and nation-states vulnerable to attacks that might have otherwise been prevented. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{purposes}} of vocational {{education and training}} (VET) go beyond developing the technical capacities required to perform an occupation effectively or securing students’ employment (Baethge et al. [2009]; Renold [2009]); they extend {{to the formation of}} students’ identity within and attachment to an occupation, as well as their integration into society through that identity (Baethge and Arends [2009]; Drexel [2005]). A characteristic feature of the German initial vocational training system, for example, is that those undertaking apprenticeships develop strong occupational ties and form an identity associated with that occupation, rather than loyalties to a specific company or employer (Haasler [2007]; Rauner [2007]). Skilled workers’ vocational identity is a crucial component of the German workforce, central to its ability to remain successful in an era of unprecedented global competition, because of its effects on <b>vocational</b> <b>capacities,</b> skill performance, and quality (Rauner [1999]; Skorikov and Vondracek [2007]). Without vocational identities, workers’ abilities to plan, execute, and monitor their work activities autonomously would be far less likely. In turn, vocational identity guides workers’ practices during the course of completing complex, demanding tasks, and it offers a sustainable source of intrinsic motivation that directs and secures individual engagement with the vocation (Rauner [1999]). Thus, for both institutional and personal purposes, developing strong vocational identities is an implicit goal of German vocational education; in Switzerland, it is even explicitly included in the stated learning outcomes for the vocational education system (§ 50 BBG [2002]).|$|R

30|$|Ensure maximum {{integration}} at {{the workplace}} for apprentices. Apprentices need support as they develop {{their sense of}} self as workers, through enhanced participatory practices afforded by workplaces. Our results suggest that by being allowed to participate in all operating processes, they more readily develop vocational identity and apply more workplace effort. Therefore, apprentices need opportunities for active, productive participation in work processes, rather than just taking observational roles or performing isolated, monotonous work. These practices often occur already, but this emphasis should become a central motif for securing the development of <b>vocational</b> identity and <b>capacities.</b>|$|R
40|$|Work {{integrated}} learning (WIL) {{has become}} a catch phrase in higher education in recent years with various models advanced, and each advocating their virtues for students, educators and professions. In the milieu of WIL experiences, the notion of developing professionals is a key driving factor of WIL programs. At James Cook University (JCU), this imperative is equally noticeable across the various disciplines and schools but one model is exemplary for its linking of students within the Human Resource Management (HRM) discipline with Human Resource Professionals through the ongoing support of and collaboration between School of Business, JCU Careers and Employment, and the local HRM Professional Association. This partnership has been effective in developing graduate attributes, <b>vocational</b> identity, occupational <b>capacity</b> and professional skills that facilitate the successful transition of students to graduates to professionals. The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine in more depth the factors which have contributed to the evolution of this model and to evaluate its success as measured by the perspectives of various stakeholders, especially those of students, graduates and HRM professionals. It uses qualitative approaches integrating individual conversations and reflective tools to illuminate how shared meanings of what it means to become a HRM professional have enabled the program to grow over the years such that graduates return as HRM professionals to perpetuate best practice in the HRM profession. In this way, the paper proposes a model for a scaffolded approach to embedding WIL activities in a HRM major so that students are presented with valuable opportunities to position themselves for entry into the professional world of HRM...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The {{ability to}} {{independently}} organize {{and carry out}} scientific and pedagogical search, receive and apply in practice new skills is a distinctive feature of creative teachers. Obligatory presence of research competence among graduates of pedagogical specialties of higher education institutions is declared in federal state educational standards of the higher school. The aim of the article is to direct attention of high school educators to the topical problem of pre-service teachers’ creativity development {{and the need to}} strengthen their methodological training. Methodology and research methods. Based on understanding of education quality as the ensemble of its essential characteristics (properties according to A. I. Subetto), evaluation criteria of quality of education of bachelor’s and master’s degree students are revealed. The objective and research components are the basis for the development of criterion-evaluation tools of future profession. Teachers’ insights on the level of their own contribution to creative development of students and the quality of training of students to independent carrying out researches were made known using the following methods: structuring, analysis and interpretation of the questionnaire materials, individual interviews, and observation evaluation. Results. The data concerning the organization, content and technologies of teachers’ pre-service training for independent research activity, the learning conditions created for their training and the outcomes are obtained. A number of positive results, especially in logistics and staffing of the educational process, are achieved. Evident mistakes in the program and methodological support of educational process, {{in the use of the}} <b>vocational</b> disciplines’ research <b>capacity</b> and teaching practice for the development of students’ research experience are found. Scientific novelty. An authors’ estimation of a standpoint of some part of teachers in regard to practical realization of basic target orientation of the Russian higher education is given. Insufficient methodological readiness of a considerable part of university teachers and lecturers to the scientific leadership in research activity of bachelors and undergraduates is stated. Practical significance. The pointed and selected criteria for evaluation of quality of training to research work are base for development of criteria-estimated tools of level of formation of educational-research skills. The use of the proposed set of measures in pedagogical and management work, according to the authors, would serve to enhance research competence of future professionals and at large improve the management of educational process.  </p...|$|R
