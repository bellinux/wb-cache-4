5000|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>privity</b> {{characterizes the}} {{relationship}} between the original party to the covenant and the subsequent owner. To be bound by the covenant, the successor must hold the entire estate in land held by the original party (strict <b>vertical</b> <b>privity</b> of estate). Note that because strict <b>vertical</b> <b>privity</b> is required for a burden to run, a lessee could not have a burden enforced against them. However, a benefited party could sue the owner of the reversion of the estate, and the owner could possibly sue the lessee for waste.|$|E
50|$|Privity of {{contract}} occurs only {{between the parties}} to the contract, most commonlycontract of sale of goods or services. Horizontal privity arises when the benefits from a contract are to be given to a third party. <b>Vertical</b> <b>privity</b> involves a contract between two parties, with an independent contract between one of the parties and another individual or company.|$|E
50|$|Lord Cottenham LC {{found in}} favour of the {{plaintiff}} and granted an injunction to restrain the defendant from violating the covenant. The Court noted that if the agreement had been a contract instead of a covenant, {{it would have been}} enforceable. Therefore the covenant was enforceable at equity, that is, when the plaintiff seeks an injunction as opposed to damages. The case stands for the proposition that <b>vertical</b> <b>privity</b> (privity of estate) is not required for the burden of a covenant to run at equity.|$|E
40|$|The citadel of privity has {{undergone}} a massive assault {{in the field of}} products liability yet still remains a viable force in warranty law. In most cases, the privity requirement is held to be a function of the dangerousness of the product, the type of harm caused and the situs of the chose in action. As a prerequisite to recovery under a contract theory for breach of warranty, courts have required a finding of privity [...] a direct nexus between vendor and vendee. While the strict application of the doctrine created harsh results, courts made inroads to mitigate its effects and to satisfy judicial notions of justice where conduct was inexcusable and harm intolerable. The results in some instances were unpredictable and inconsistent until they were finally codified judicially into a category of exceptions that either supplied privity directly or obviated the need for its application, although in many instances the route taken was obfuscated. This article will explore the devices employed to evade the privity requirements and will discuss the necessity of extending judicial reasoning to its logical extreme [...] the elimination of the <b>vertical</b> <b>privity</b> barrier, regardless of the qualitative aspect of the harm caused...|$|E
