40|$|The Wang Yai {{prospects}} are located along the Loei Foldbelt, central Thailand. They are a newly discovered resource and {{up until now}} have not {{been the subject of}} any scientific research. Eleven <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> at Wang Yai were investigated in terms of vein textures, mineralogy, fluid inclusions and stable isotopes. The <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> occur as either well-preserved outcrop or sparse sporadic float. The <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> can be divided into two types. They include: (1.) mineralised veins which are characterised by quartz - chalcedony - calcite ± adularia and (2.) poorly mineralised veins characterised by chalcedony and opaline quartz. The <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> are hosted in volcanic and volcanosedimentary units intruded by andesite and diorite. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon geochronological studies have revealed the age of host rocks as Late Permian to Early Triassic. Volcanology studies of the host rocks indicate that the depositional environment was a submarine below wave base setting. Zr/Y vs Zr plot of least altered volcanic rocks have identified the andesitic sandstone and andesitic lithic breccia as having island arc affinities. The younger andesite and diorite intrusives were found to have continental arc affinities. These findings are consistent with interpretations of the volcanic setting at the nearby low-sulphidation Chatree deposit. Vein texture, mineralogy, alteration and paragenesis studies have identified zonation between gold-bearing <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> and barren <b>vein</b> <b>systems.</b> Gold-bearing systems yield crystalline quartz, lattice-bladed quartz, pseudo-acicular quartz and pseudomorphs after adularia. Ore mineralogy in these systems is hosted in ginguro bands which comprise of electrum ± argentite ± pyrite assemblages. Barren <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> yield chalcedony and opaline quartz assemblages with associated recrystallisation textures. Based on quartz textural analysis and ore mineralogy assemblages the gold-bearing veins are interpreted to have formed at levels deeper in the system than the barren <b>vein</b> <b>systems.</b> Fluid inclusion studies of quartz indicate salinities are between 1 to 5 wt...|$|R
5000|$|Most mineral <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> are {{a result}} of {{repeated}} natural fracturing during periods of relatively high pore fluid pressure.

40|$|The {{study area}} is {{situated}} in the Southern Central Zone of the intracontinental Pan-African Damara Orogen, approximately 20 km NNE of Navachab Gold Mine in the Karibib district of Namibia. Mesothermal <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> with Cu-Fe±Au mineralization are hosted by amphibolite facies calcitic and dolomitic marbles belonging to the Navachab Member of the Karibib Formation, and are best developed around the defunct Onguati Copper Mine, Brown Mountain and Western Workings areas. The Onguati study area {{is located in the}} saddle region of a moderately-to-gently inclined anticlinorium that experienced significant flattening during NNW-SSE-directed compression. The parallelogram arrangement of ENE- and NNE-trending thrusts and reverse faults that surround the Onguati study area may have developed when the direction of greatest principle subregional stress was oriented WSW-ESE. These structures define part of a Riedel shear system and later faults may have developed in the position of R and P shears respectively. Significant strain partitioning occurred between the ductile calcitic marbles which host the best developed, shear-related <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> and the more competent dolomitic marbles. The thickness distributions of veins in the marbles of the Onguati Mine, Brown Mountain and Western Workings areas conform to a fractal or power-law distribution, The most intensely mineralized <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> in the Onguati Mine and Western Workings calcitic marbles share similar low fractal dimensions (D-values) of 0. 41 and 0. 37 respectively. Veins In the calcitic and dolomitic marbles of the Brown Mountain area and in the dolomitic marbles of Western Workings have elevated D-values (> 0. 60) and are poorly mineralized.

40|$|Advanced chronic venous {{insufficiency}} (CVI) {{is an important}} health problem. In Hong Kong, with its predominantly Chinese population, most patients have primary CVI because deep vein thrombosis is less common. Nevertheless, 80 % of the limbs with advanced CVI had reflux in both the superficial and deep <b>vein</b> <b>systems.</b> This showed that advanced CVI in this population is a multisystem pathological condition affecting both the superficial and deep <b>vein</b> <b>systems.</b> In the present study, {{it was hypothesized that}} the abnormal hydrostatic forces in the superficial and perforating <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> are the significant pathologic forces leading to advanced CVI, although deep vein incompetence is common. This deep vein incompetence can be contributed to significantly by venous overload as a result of superficial reflux (reflux circuit of venous overload). This is well supported by the abolition of deep venous reflux as well as significant haemodynamic improvement as measured by air plethysmography after superficial vein surgery in limbs with mixed superficial and deep venous incompetence. Recently, subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery (SEPS) was introduced as a minimally invasive technique to interrupt incompetent calf perforators. Preliminary local experience showed that SEPS with concomitant superficial vein surgery was associated with a 97 % ulcer healing at a mean follow up of 15 months. Significant haemodynamic improvement was also shown by air plethysmography. However, recurrent ulcers were noted in 15 % of the limbs. Thus, SEPS with superficial vein surgery where appropriate can be the optimal operative treatment strategy for advanced CVI in the local population, although ulcer recurrence remains a concern. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Several {{methods are}} {{investigated}} for the quantitative {{analysis of a}} range of Sn-W sheeted <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> from southwest England and Spain. The methods are based on fractal concepts and include the measurement of vein thickness and spacing distributions, {{and the development of a}} multifractal interval-counting method, equivalent to box counting in two dimensions. The results indicate that sets of subparallel veins are generally distributed randomly or with only slight clustering, and develop from fracture systems in which the spacing of veins is homogeneous. The opening of the veins is much more heterogeneous, suggesting localization of subsequent deformation and flow. This is especially true in mineralized areas and, together with power-law distributions of vein thickness, can be used to characterize mineralized systems. New data presented in this paper suggest that fracture evolution may play a fundamental role in defining the location and style of Sn-W mineralization observed. Greisen-dominated and disseminated Sn-W systems develop where the initial fracture system dominates the fluid flow regime, whereas sheeted <b>vein</b> <b>systems</b> are best developed where stress-induced critical behavior of flow in fracture networks controls the permeability and fluid flow of the syste...|$|R
