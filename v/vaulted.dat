5000|$|A groin <b>vault</b> or groined <b>vault</b> (also {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a double barrel <b>vault</b> or cross <b>vault)</b> is produced by the intersection at right angles of two barrel <b>vaults.</b> The word [...] "groin" [...] refers to the edge between the intersecting <b>vaults.</b> Sometimes the arches of groin <b>vaults</b> are pointed instead of round. In comparison with a barrel <b>vault,</b> a groin <b>vault</b> provides good economies of material and labour. The thrust is concentrated along the groins or arrises (the four diagonal edges formed along the points where the barrel <b>vaults</b> intersect), so the <b>vault</b> need only be abutted at its four corners.|$|R

5|$|Some {{minor works}} {{took place during}} the {{remainder}} of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the <b>vaulted</b> ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its <b>vaulted</b> ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers were substantially overhauled with a viewing platform provided {{at the top of the}} north tower.|$|E
5|$|The ground floor, {{accessed}} {{directly from}} the outside courtyard, led into a portcullis-protected, <b>vaulted</b> passage, eleven feet wide and extending {{the depth of the}} building. On either side of the passage were two <b>vaulted</b> rooms. The room nearest the entrance on the right was a guardroom or the porter's room, which housed a well; the back-right room, with a garderobe located in the south west turret (accessed via a passage running along the south wall), was for an official. The other two rooms to the left were used to house staff or storage.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} a single-subject study on the top-elite vaulter in the world. This study was purposed to compare {{kinematic}} differences between Yang Hak-Seon <b>vault</b> (Yang- 1) and Tsukahara 1260 <b>vault</b> (Yang- 2) performed by Yang Hak-Seon. Fourteen high-speed cameras were used to capture a whole body segment motion of Yang- 2 <b>vault</b> during the practice session. Yang- 1 <b>vault</b> showed faster CM vertical velocity until the <b>vault</b> table takeoff and faster CM horizontal velocity prior to the <b>vault</b> table touchdown. However, the trunk rotation angle and its angular velocity of Yang- 2 <b>vault</b> exceeded Yang- 1 <b>vault</b> significantly. This {{might be due to}} a half turn off the springboard onto the <b>vault</b> table of Yang- 2 <b>vault,</b> which resulted in larger initial angular momentum at the <b>vault</b> table touchdown and further increase in angular velocity during the <b>vault</b> table contact...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Vault</b> Dweller {{explores the}} Cathedral of the Children {{and finds a}} {{prototype}} <b>Vault</b> beneath it where the Master commands his army. Disguised {{as one of the}} Children, the <b>Vault</b> Dweller infiltrates the <b>Vault</b> and destroys the Master. The <b>Vault</b> Dweller travels north to a military base, where the Master was using a mutagen called the Forced Evolutionary Virus to mutate humans into his Super Mutants. The <b>Vault</b> Dweller destroys the base, stopping the creation of more Super Mutants and splintering their army. The <b>Vault</b> Dweller returns to the <b>Vault</b> and is greeted at the entrance by the Overseer. The Overseer is happy that the <b>Vault's</b> safety is secured, but fears the <b>Vault</b> Dweller's adventure has changed them, and that hero worship of them in the <b>Vault</b> may encourage others to leave. For the greater good of the <b>Vault</b> and to preserve its isolation, the <b>Vault</b> Dweller is exiled into the Wasteland.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} building's {{main floor}} has <b>vaulted</b> ceilings, large windows, brick walls, a flat roof, and wooden cross beams. The mezzanine {{consists of three}} rooms. The second floor has large windows and <b>vaulted</b> ceilings, restrooms, and a lunchroom. Stairs and elevators connect the levels, including the basement and its boiler room. A lobby and office in {{the southwest corner of}} the main floor can be entered from inside or via the original main door off Southeast 10thAvenue.|$|E
5|$|A stone {{building}} {{to the east of}} the main complex is thought to have been the abbot's house. It contains two levels of <b>vaulted</b> apartments consisting of two halls, bedchambers, a private chapel and service rooms. The upper level was reached by an external staircase, which allowed this floor to be used independently if needed.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1096 and 1536, Norwich Cathedral has a Norman form, {{retaining}} {{the greater part}} of its original stone structure, which was then <b>vaulted</b> between 1416 and 1472 in a spectacular manner with hundreds of ornately carved, painted, and gilded bosses. It also has the finest Norman tower in England, surmounted by a 15th-century spire, and a large cloister with many more bosses.|$|E
50|$|A burial <b>vault</b> {{encloses}} a casket on {{all four}} sides, the top, and the bottom. Modern burial <b>vaults</b> are lowered into the grave, and the casket lowered into the <b>vault.</b> A lid is then lowered to cover the casket and seal the <b>vault.</b> Modern burial <b>vaults</b> may be made of concrete, metal, or plastic. Because {{the sides of the}} burial <b>vault</b> are attached {{to the bottom of the}} <b>vault,</b> the burial <b>vault</b> is generally stronger than a burial liner. Some burial <b>vaults</b> reverse the construction, so that only a base is placed beneath the coffin. The lid consists of the four sides and the top. These types of burial <b>vaults</b> allow a better seal between the lid and base.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of a groin <b>vault</b> can be understood most simply by visualising two barrel <b>vault</b> sections at right angles merging to form a squarish unit. The resulting four ribs convey the stress loading to the four corners, or piers. The more complex groin <b>vault</b> is intrinsically a stronger design compared to the barrel <b>vault,</b> since the barrel <b>vault</b> structure must rest on long walls creating less stable lateral stress, whereas the groin <b>vault</b> design can direct stresses almost purely vertically on the piers. A common association of <b>vaulting</b> in cathedrals of the Middle Ages involves a nave of barrel <b>vault</b> design with transepts of groined <b>vaulting.</b> Rib <b>vaults</b> resemble groin <b>vaults</b> but introduce structural ribs running along the angles which carry much of the weight, making possible much greater variations of proportion.|$|R
50|$|In architecture, a cloister <b>vault</b> or domical <b>vault</b> is a <b>vault</b> {{with four}} concave {{surfaces}} (patches of cylinders) meeting {{at a point}} above {{the center of the}} <b>vault.</b>|$|R
5|$|Geometric motifs are {{carved in}} the Price Building's stone cladding, {{especially}} over the first few levels. The building is topped by a more classical, specifically Châteauesque, steepled copper roof, the final composition showing Beaux-Arts influences. The main exterior decorative themes are pilasters topped with palm motifs, pinnacles and a large <b>vaulted</b> arch with extrados over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|Inside the Shrine is the Sanctuary, a high <b>vaulted</b> space {{entered by}} four tall portals of Classical design. A simple entabulature {{is carried on}} sixteen tall fluted Ionic columns and {{supports}} a frieze with twelve relief panels sculptured by Lyndon Dadswell, depicting the armed services at work and in action during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Over ten Han-era {{underground}} tombs {{have been}} found, {{many of them}} featuring archways, <b>vaulted</b> chambers, and domed roofs. Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were {{held in place by}} earthen pits. The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{complexity}} of the <b>vault</b> is another significant feature of English cathedrals. The <b>vaults</b> range from the simple quadripartite <b>vault</b> in the French manner at Chichester through increasingly elaborate forms including the multi-ribbed (“tierceron”) <b>vault</b> at Exeter, the similar <b>vault</b> with inter-connecting (“lierne”) ribs at Norwich, the still more elaborate variation at Winchester, the array of unique lierne <b>vaults</b> at Bristol, the net-like stellar <b>vaulting</b> of the choirs at Gloucester and York, the fan <b>vaulting</b> of the retro-choir at Peterborough, and the pendant <b>vaulting</b> of the choir at Oxford, where elaborate long stone bosses are suspended from the ceiling like lanterns. Many of the more elaborate forms are unique to England, with stellar <b>vaulting</b> also occurring in Spain and Germany.|$|R
5000|$|...**** A Yurchenko or Scherbo <b>vault</b> is {{identified}} {{like any other}} by its [...] "entry method" [...] (i.e. before hands touch the <b>vaulting</b> platform). Yurchenko <b>vaults,</b> in particular, have been classed as a specific family of <b>vaults</b> in competition, namely all <b>vaults</b> with the common [...] "entry method" [...] of starting with a round-off back-handspring; hence, Scherbo <b>vaults</b> are by definition also Yurchenko <b>vaults,</b> albeit more complex and difficult versions of them. Thus, unless specified, all Yurchenko <b>vaults</b> listed above begin simply with a round-off back-handspring entry onto the <b>vaulting</b> platform. The difference between a basic Yurchenko and Scherbo <b>vault</b> {{is that there is}} an additional element, a full twist, integrated into the back-handspring of a Scherbo, and it happens while in motion after feet leave springboard and before hands arrive onto <b>vaulting</b> platform. Yurchenko and Scherbo <b>vaults</b> were named after their originators, Natalia Yurchenko of the former Soviet Union and Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus.|$|R
50|$|The Tuscan <b>Vault</b> {{once held}} {{many more than}} the present 14 tombs, but most were moved to the New <b>Vault</b> or {{enclosed}} within the piers of the Ferdinand <b>Vault</b> during the major rearrangement of 1960. The 5-meter wide <b>vault</b> is very large, being 21 meters long, and extends along the entire western lengths of both the Ferdinand <b>Vault</b> and the Franz <b>Vault,</b> ending only when it meets the outside wall of the west transept of the Maria Theresia <b>Vault.</b>|$|R
5|$|Stela 43 {{dates to}} AD 514. It {{was set in}} a <b>vaulted</b> chamber near the base of Structure 2. The text is damaged but carries an early {{spelling}} of the k'uhul chatan winik non-royal noble title used in Calakmul and the Mirador Basin.|$|E
5|$|The 13th-century chancel has two rib <b>vaulted</b> bays, {{making it}} one of only six extant Early English <b>vaulted</b> chancels. Its walls were raised in the 15th century by {{constructing}} a chamber above the vaulting using stone from the demolished 13th-century nave, but, from the outside, this end of the church is still lower than the western section. Internally, the chancel vault is much lower than the adjacent nave because of the room above. It has three 15th-century Perpendicular windows down each side, and is notable for the unusual east window with seven stepped lights, a feature found in only two other Early English churches, Lincoln Cathedral and St Martins in Ockham. The chancel contains three simple sedilia, or priest's seats, with trefoil arches and round columns. The sacristry behind the altar has a small lancet window, and the chamber above the chancel, which is floored only by the curved upper surface of the vault below, is lit by a single two-light window.|$|E
5|$|The east {{range was}} located {{between the north}} and east towers, {{although}} only foundations remain. This was the principal range of buildings and contained a large hall above <b>vaulted</b> cellars. The hall had double-lancet windows, decorated with carved patterns, which were later blocked up; their outlines {{can be seen in the}} east curtain wall.|$|E

50|$|The {{township}} is {{also home}} to a few cemetery <b>vaults,</b> 4 of which still stand. Also known as dead houses, these stone <b>vaults</b> were used to store bodies in cold-climate areas until the ground could be excavated for burial. The Shanly cemetery <b>vault</b> is located in close proximity to the hamlet's cemetery. This <b>vault</b> is in poor condition but still stands; it is estimated to have been built around 1876, the same time the Shanly cemetery was erected. There are two <b>vaults</b> located in Spencerville, the Spencerville Funeral Home <b>vault</b> and the Connell <b>vault.</b> The Connell <b>vault</b> is located just outside the village, on the Connell family's property. It was built in 1912 as a private family <b>vault</b> and remains a private structure today. The Spencerville Funeral Home <b>vault</b> is located on County Road 44 just south of the village. The <b>vault</b> was built in 1892, and according to The Prescott Journal in an article published August, 24th 1893, the <b>vault</b> was built at a cost of $600 and had every modern convenience of the time in regards to <b>vaults.</b> As of 2008, the <b>vault</b> was owned by the Grant Brown Funeral Home of Spencerville and was still in use. St. Paul's Cemetery <b>vault</b> is located within St. Paul's Cemetery on the outskirts of Cardinal. It is believed this <b>vault</b> was built using stones salvaged from the St. Paul's Anglican church when it was dismantled in 1872. This <b>vault</b> was still in use as of 2008.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of the stones contain masonic symbols, {{as well as a}} number of carved tree-stumps. Several family <b>vaults</b> are also found here, {{including}} the Sanford <b>Vault,</b> the Tuckett <b>vault,</b> the Thomas C Watkins <b>vault,</b> the Col. Land Family <b>Vault</b> and the Stinson Family Mausoleum.|$|R
5|$|The huge, <b>vaulted</b> lid of N. rajah, {{the largest}} in the genus, is another {{distinguishing}} characteristic of this species. It is ovate to oblong in shape and has a distinct keel running down the middle, with two prominent lateral veins. The spur {{at the back of the}} lid is approximately 20mm long and unbranched.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{was to have}} been a riot of Burgesian excess but not a single room was completed to Burges's designs.

However some of the interiors, such as the library, <b>vaulted</b> hall and the arched red drawing room, remain or have been re-instated.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper floor}} of this {{building}} was the reredorter or latrine. It is a large room with a door conveniently leading into the monks' dormitory. The stalls were in the south wall and the effluent dropped into an underground stream which runs in a <b>vaulted</b> passage underneath the building.|$|E
