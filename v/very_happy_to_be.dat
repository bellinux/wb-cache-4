Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat; Heywood was among those who remained with Bounty. Later, he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti, while Bounty sailed on, ending its voyage at Pitcairn Island. Bligh, after an epic open-boat journey, eventually reached England, where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny's prime instigators. In 1791 Heywood and his companions were met with in Tahiti by the search vessel , and held in irons for transportation to England. Heywood and one other actually went out to the Pandora in canoes , <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rescued-as they thought. They were then arrested and treated barbarously by the Captain, Edward Edwards, who had them and 12 others fettered and handcuffed in an 11 ft. box built for the purpose on deck. Their subsequent journey was prolonged and eventful; Pandora was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, four of Heywood's fellow prisoners were drowned, and Heywood himself was fortunate to survive, being the 3rd last {{to get out of the}} box, which had only an exit 18 inches sq. in the roof..|$|E

They both reveal that they were subconsciously trying to sabotage their relationship, feeling unworthy of the other. Leonard, concerned {{that he was trying}} to sabotage his relationship with Penny, meets with the woman he kissed on the boat. She barely remembers the incident and quickly grows bored with Leonard's ramblings, taking a sarcastic and dismissive tone toward him. From that meeting Leonard comes to terms with his insecurities and he and Penny are able to become more comfortable in dealing with their mutual fears about their relationship. Leonard seriously tries to move into Penny's apartment though Sheldon has serious objections and makes them compromise to spend multiple nights a week in Leonard's old room. Early in season 10, the couple is <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> finally living alone after Sheldon moves in with Amy.|$|E

Representations at one level might represent colored expanses, whose shapes are (perhaps) just two dimensional silhouettes; another (much informed by vision, if not within "vision alone") represents everyday three dimensional physical objects. So, as Lycan puts it, visual representata are not always "physical objects of the everyday sort " (see Lycan 1996, 152). Here, here.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{contributing}} to {{the debate about the}} agenda of the forthcoming Polish Presidency of the EU {{in the second half of}} 2011, in November 2010 Egmont organized an international expert seminar in Brussels with its sister institute from Warsaw, PISM – the Polish Institute of International Affairs, under the heading Crisis Management Operations: European Lessons Learned. The EU has undeniably become an important actor in the field of crisis management. In view of its expertise and its capabilities, the demand for CSDP operations, both civilian and military, can only <b>be</b> expected <b>to</b> increase. The EU is also reshaping its institutional architecture and its procedures for crisis management. The establishment of the Crisis Management and Planning Directorate (CMPD) and its integration into the External Action Service (EAS) are determining for the future shape of EU crisis management. As this re-engineering of the CSDP machinery is in full swing, the moment <b>is</b> right <b>to</b> take stock of crisis management operations so far and identify lessons learned, in order to inform decisionmaking in the very near future. To that end, the seminar addressed three key dimensions of EU crisis management: – The comprehensive approach: To which extent does the EU really implement a comprehensive or holistic approach both in theatre and at the Brussels level? Which conclusions can be drawn for the running of operations and for the training of relevant staff? – Command & control: How effective have command & control arrangements proved, in the various stages of mounting and running operations, at the various levels of the chain of command? – The Battlegroups: While they have so far never been deployed, as a rapid reaction capacity they do constitute an important part of the CSDP toolkit, of which the EU arguably could use more. How can the Battlegroups <b>be</b> adapted <b>to</b> current needs? In this Egmont Paper, the Institute publishes two very thought-provoking contributions about command & control, based on the presentations by the two academics who addressed the seminar on that topic. 1 Dr. Luis Simón and Alexander Mattelaer focus respectively on the planning and the conduct of CSDP operations. Their creative thinking on these topics constitutes an important contribution to a debate which will feature prominently on the EU agenda in 2011. Egmont <b>is</b> <b>very</b> proud and <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> publish the work of two such fine colleagues...|$|R
