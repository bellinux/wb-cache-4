50|$|The {{safety of}} the road has been called into {{question}} following a few deadly wrecks. Most wrecks generally occur along same stretch of road and are similar in details: A car traveling west into the city loses control while traveling around a curve near Avalon Drive. The wrecks sometimes occur after rain and the vehicle generally hits another <b>vehicle</b> <b>head</b> on. The {{reality is that the}} road is never the cause of the accidents - it has always been driver error, usually caused by distracted driving. As noted, over 20,000 cars travel this road daily and the incidents of wrecks that have happened in almost 15 years have been minimal. Unlike other roads in the area (for example Hwy 72 over Chapman Mountain) which are straight, with long-distance visibility, but have an inordinate amount of wrecks, Cecil Ashburn has a very good safety record.|$|E

30|$|Monocular {{methods have}} {{established}} a clear role (alongside stereoscopy) but they rely on assumptions that {{may not always be}} true or consistently valid. Assumptions such as uniform parallel road marking, continuity of road texture, and operational <b>vehicle</b> <b>head</b> or tail lights are somewhat utopian and real world variability serves to diminish reliability. Often, what is easily achievable with stereoscopy can prove to be substantially complex with monocular approaches [17]. The converse may also be true, because stereovision depends on the ability to unambiguously find corresponding features in multiple views. Stereovision additionally brings a few challenges of its own, such as the need for a large baseline camera separation, sensitivity to relative camera positioning and sensitivity to inter-camera synchronisation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To {{gather data}} {{of a larger}} area and improve the {{capability}} in the system, vehicles in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) are organized into clusters. Moreover, the effectiveness of application in VANET depends on performance of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol.

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{challenges}} in building robust and reliable autonomous systems is {{the large number of}} parameters and settings such systems often entail. The traditional approach to this task is simply to have system experts hand tune various parameter settings, and then validate them through simulation, offline playback, and field testing. However, this approach is tedious and time consuming for the expert, and typically produces subpar performance that does not generalize. Machine learning offers a solution to this problem in the form of learning from demonstration. Rather than ask an expert to explicitly encode his own preferences, he must simply demonstrate them, allowing the system to autonomously configure itself accordingly. This work extends this approach to the task of learning driving styles and maneuver preferences for an autonomous <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Head</b> to head experiments in simulation and with a live autonomous system demonstrate that this approach produces better autonomous performance, and with less expert interaction, than traditional hand tuning...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the generating an efficient fundamental matrix for image rectification problem under motion. Computation of fundamental matrix is the information source to estimate the accurate optic flow in computer vision area. This includes extraction of images from real world, using 8 -point algorithm, and calibration for predicting optic flow. We are performing a comparative study over different fundamental matrix, and implementation techniques to propose a method which reduces the complexity in analysis of an image rectification and improves computational speed for <b>vehicle</b> <b>head</b> lamp tracking. Fundamental matrix estimation is difficult since it is often based correspondences that are spoilt by noise and outliers. Outliers must be thrown out via robust statistics, and noise gives uncertainty. In this article we provide a closed-form formula for the uncertainty of the so-called 8 point algorithm, which is a basic tool for fundamental matrix estimation via robust methods. As an application, we modify a well established robust algorithm accordingly, leading to a new criterion to recover point correspondences under epipolar constraint, balanced by the uncertainty of the estimation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a prototype of}} a digital video image analysis system that measures the relative luminance of highway signs using nighttime video images taken by a camera mounted in a moving vehicle. The concept is that by using an inexpensive video camera and laptop computer mounted in a vehicle a measurement of the brightness and visibility of the sign can be made. The system uses real time image analysis of night images of signs acquired on a mobile platform moving at highway speeds, illuminated by normal <b>vehicle</b> <b>head</b> lamps. Using video images at night results in measurements that {{as closely as possible}} reflect what the human eye sees. This is an improvement over current practice for ensuring that the signs are performing at night as required. Current methods consist of either visual inspection, measurement of retroreflectivity with a hand-held retroreflectometer, or systematic periodic replacement of signs irregardless of whether they are deficient or not. None of these approaches are ideal. Visual inspection is too subjective, hand-held retroreflectometer measurements are tedious, time-consuming, and sometimes dangerous, and systematic replacement is not cost effective. Results of this research have not only demonstrated that this is a viable way {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the signs at night, but research has also shown that the retroreflectivity of signs as measured by portable retroreflectometers is not well correlated with the visibility of the signs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For {{wheelchair}} users {{unable to}} transfer to a vehicle seat, the wheelchair serves {{as a means of}} mobility and postural support during activities of daily living and as a seating support in a vehicle. The performance of commer-cially available adaptive seating components in a dynamic or impact situation, as well as their effect on the safety of the user, is unknown and should be determined. The main objective of the project was to develop a test methodology to statically determine the crashworthiness of wheelchair head-rest systems and show the efficacy of that methodology by applying it to several commercially available headrest sys-tems. The methodology was based on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) test conditions, which use static test procedures to ensure that <b>vehicle</b> <b>head</b> restraints will perform adequately during actual crash conditions. The procedure developed to evaluate the headrests gave informative and repeatable results. The tests performed calculated the energy associated with a critical deformation of the headrest under quasi-static conditions. The results were used to determine the level of safety provided by the devices and to recommend design improvements. The headrests tested exhibited similar modes of deformation due to bending of a vertical adjustment bar, and several devices were determined to be capable of providing adequate restraint in an impact situation. Key words: physical disability, postural support, vehicle transport, wheelchair. This material is based upon work supported by the National Institute o...|$|E
40|$|Traumatic head {{injuries}} {{are a major}} cause of permanent brain damage and may cause death and long term disabilities. It is expected to surpass the mortality rate caused by many diseases and it is predicted to be {{a major cause of}} death and disabilities by 2020. A retrospective analysis of medical records of paediatric patients aged 16 years and younger admitted to Asir Central hospital-Abha (main referral unit for southwestern Saudi Arabia) with traumatic {{head injuries}} (for the period from 15 / 11 / 2012 to 2 / 1 / 2014) was undertaken. This study was done to analyze the epidemiology of paediatric head injury in relation to age distribution, sex, mode of injury, and types of injuries. A total of seventy one cases with traumatic head injuries were admitted. 54 (76. 1 %) were males and 17 (23. 9 %) were females. Motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>head</b> injuries constituted 63. 4 % of all cases, fall from heights constituted 32. 4 %, while direct head trauma and gunshot constituted 2. 8 % and 1. 4 % respectively. Fifty five percent of all cases were in the age group of + 7 years to 16 years. The study confirmed a male preponderance (76. 1 % of total). The most common lesion found on CT scan was skull fracture with underlying brain injury and or haemorrhage in 42. 3 % of the cases. Preventive measures are necessary to reduce the impact of this alarming problem, which is becoming the future epidemic claiming many lives and causing devastating long term disabilities.
