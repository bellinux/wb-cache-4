5|$|Polling {{conducted}} between late December 2012 to mid-January 2013 by Civic Science {{found that}} a race between Luke Ravenstahl and Bill Peduto would be within single digit percentage points. The polling firm, however, emphasized that the poll {{was not intended to}} provide two-way race numbers and that the polling (which was completed on January 16) did not include Michael Lamb, who had entered the race the next day. According to the poll, blue-collar primary <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> more apt to support Ravenstahl while white-collar primary <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> more apt to support Peduto.|$|E
5|$|The Reform Act did not enfranchise {{the working}} class since <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> {{required}} to possess property worth £10, a substantial sum at the time. This split the alliance between {{the working class}} and the middle class, giving rise to the Chartist Movement.|$|E

5|$|A {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held in}} Puerto Rico on 19 August 2012. <b>Voters</b> <b>were</b> asked whether they approve of two amendments to the constitution; one to eliminate the absolute right to bail {{and the other to}} decrease the number of members of the Legislative Assembly. Despite support from the party in government and part of the main opposition party, both amendments were rejected by voters.|$|E

In late 1998, Hasbro announced a campaign to add an all-new token to U.S. standard edition sets of Monopoly. <b>Voters</b> <b>were</b> allowed to select from a biplane, a piggy bank, and a sack of money — with votes being tallied through a special website, via a toll-free phone number, and at FAO Schwarz stores.|$|E

The new <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> Hall of Famers Roberts and Seaver, executive Schuerholz, and sportswriter Pepe.

5000|$|In politics, <b>voter</b> fatigue <b>is</b> the apathy {{that the}} {{electorate}} can experience under certain circumstances, {{one of which}} could be (in exceptional circumstances) that they are required to vote too often, or that they feel disengaged. Voter fatigue and <b>voter</b> apathy should <b>be</b> distinguished from what arises when <b>voters</b> <b>are</b> not allowed or unable to vote, or when disenfranchisement occurs, or <b>voters</b> <b>are</b> engaged generally but repelled by the options available.|$|R

5000|$|When <b>voters</b> <b>are</b> ex ante {{symmetric}} (equally {{likely to}} be part of the majority or the minority), Storable Votes lead to higher aggregate payoffs than Majority Voting unless the number of <b>voters</b> <b>is</b> small and odd and the number of decisions is small.|$|R
5|$|The main {{ideological and}} {{political}} {{strategies of the}} Vlaams Blok started out with its radical nationalist rejection of the People's Union compromise on the Flemish autonomy issue, later {{to be followed by}} focus on immigration and security, exploitation of corruption and other scandals, and defense of traditional values. While the party was legitimized first and foremost by its defense of Flemish interests, its <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> mainly motivated by anti-immigration and anti-establishment protest.|$|E
5|$|United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century interpreted the amendment narrowly. From 1890 to 1910, most black voters in the South were effectively disenfranchised by new state constitutions and state laws incorporating such obstacles as poll taxes and discriminatory literacy tests, from which white male <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> exempted by grandfather clauses. A system of whites-only primaries and violent intimidation by white groups also suppressed black participation.|$|E
5|$|Analyzing the results, The Burlington Free Press {{pointed to}} Shumlin's {{relatively}} soft numbers in opinion polls – {{he was in}} the mid-40s in the last four polls of the race – as evidence that <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> dissatisfied with the progress the state had made in instituting single-payer health care, with rising property taxes, and with the unsuccessful roll-out of Vermont Health Connect, the state's federal health care exchange. Shumlin's internal polls showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try to put him over 50%. By comparison, Milne lagged in fundraising and spending, with $100,000 available compared to Shumlin's $1.1 million, which meant that he could not afford to pay for polling.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{consider}} a two-alternative election with voluntary participation and nearly common interests in which voters may acquire information about which alternative <b>is</b> best. <b>Voters</b> may <b>be</b> rational or naive {{in the sense}} of being able, or not, to update their beliefs {{about the state of the}} world conditioning on the behavior of others. We show that there is full information equivalence if all <b>voters</b> <b>are</b> rational and there is arbitrarily cheap information. Electoral participation converges to zero if and only if information is costly for all voters. Per contra, if some <b>voters</b> <b>are</b> naive, participation remains bounded way from zero, and full information equivalence requires that information is free for some voters. Increasing the number of naive <b>voters</b> <b>is</b> bad for information aggregation if naive <b>voters</b> <b>are</b> few, but may be good if there are already many...|$|R

5|$|Four {{days before}} the New York Film Critics Circle's vote in 2002, Lane was given a career tribute by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. A day before that, Lyne held a dinner for the actress at the Four Seasons Hotel. Critics and award <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> invited to both. She {{went on to win}} the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle awards and was {{nominated}} for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Actress. In 2003, she was named ShoWest's 2003 Female Star of the Year, and was also a co-recipient of the Women in Film Crystal Award honoring outstanding women in entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Nominations were {{announced}} on January 21, 2009, {{one day before}} the 81st Academy Award nominations, and according to Razzies tradition the ceremony itself also preceded the corresponding Academy Award function by one day. The most nominated film of 2008 was the box-office bomb The Love Guru, with seven nominations. Paid members of the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation voted to determine the winners; individuals may become members of the foundation by visiting the organization's website at www.razzies.com. Award results were based on votes from approximately 650 journalists, cinema fans and professionals from the film industry. <b>Voters</b> <b>were</b> from 45 states in the United States and 19 other countries.|$|E
5|$|One {{third of}} the council is elected each year, {{followed}} by one year without elections. At the 2008 election, for example, there were 70 candidates contesting 20 seats. In 2007, turnout at the polling stations ranged from 26% in Orton Longueville to 55% in Central ward. At the previous election, <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> required to provide a signature before being issued with a ballot paper.

5|$|Racial {{politics}} {{had long}} {{played a role}} in Baltimore. As the state of Maryland did not attempt to prevent African Americans from voting through Jim Crow laws, political coalitions often involved African American community leaders. Theodore McKeldin, who served as mayor from 1943 through 1947 and from 1963 through 1967, {{was one of the first}} political leaders to work with African American community leaders. By 1999, 63% of Baltimore's registered <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> African American, and 90% were registered to the Democratic Party. Baltimore had not elected a Republican mayor since 1963.|$|E
5|$|South Africans {{living abroad}} could {{register}} to vote at any South African Embassy, High Commission or Consulate-General from 9 January 2014 to 7 February 2014. South Africans living abroad who wished to vote had to notify the IEC of their intention to vote by 12 March 2014. The weekends of 18–19 January and 25–26 January were made registration weekends to accommodate voters who were unable to register during business hours. Over 26,000 <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> registered to vote abroad {{by the time of}} the election.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} for the Legislative Assembly held on 2 April 1955 was a lively and closely fought affair, with several new political parties joining the fray. Unlike previous elections, <b>voters</b> <b>were</b> automatically registered, expanding the electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was soundly {{defeated in the}} election, winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning Labour Front was the biggest winner with ten seats and it formed a coalition government with the UMNO-MCA Alliance, which won three seats. Another new party, the leftist People's Action Party (PAP), won three seats.|$|E
