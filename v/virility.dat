5|$|Mrs Rix Nicholas is very {{gifted and}} {{she has her own}} {{individuality}} as an artist; but her personal outlook is not so much that of an artist with startling things to say... as of a healthy fellow-Australian who loves the familiar beauty of our landscape and delights in representing it in all its splendour and <b>virility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{have had}} a strong {{presence}} in many cultures, especially in areas where they form {{the most common type}} of livestock. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led. In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of <b>virility</b> and power; the logos of the Los Angeles Rams football team and the Dodge Ram pickup truck allude to males of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is growing}} {{increasingly}} jealous of Gabe's relationship with Erin. While observing Gabe's room, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{tells him that}} a Chinese <b>virility</b> supplement that Gabe keeps in his room is incredibly potent. Once alone Andy drinks the entire bottle of the supplement, which makes him intoxicated, prompting him to admit his jealousy to Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith). Phyllis volunteers to talk to Erin and find out if she is having sex with Gabe, but as Phyllis is fairly intoxicated herself, her inquiries segue into an explicit account of her sexual experiences with her husband Bob, which mortifies Erin. Andy's intoxication turns into sickness, and he ultimately retreats to Gabe's room and vomits on the bed.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, under Albery's management, John Gielgud staged Romeo and Juliet at the New Theatre, co-starring with Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans and Olivier. Gielgud {{had seen}} Olivier in Queen of Scots, spotted his potential, and now {{gave him a}} major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they {{exchanged}} roles. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the <b>virility</b> of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, contrasting it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry. The friendship {{between the two men}} was prickly, on Olivier's side, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In Genesis 24:22, Abraham's servant gave Rebecca a nose ring. Nose {{piercing}} {{has been}} {{practiced by the}} Bedouin tribes of the Middle East and the Berber and Beja peoples of Africa, as well as Australian Aboriginals. Many Native American and Alaskan tribes practiced septum piercing. It was popular among the Aztecs, the Mayans and the tribes of New Guinea, who adorned their pierced noses with bones and feathers to symbolize wealth and (among men) <b>virility.</b> The name of the Nez Perce tribe {{was derived from the}} practice, though nose piercing was not common within the tribe. The Aztecs, Mayans and Incas wore gold septum rings for adornment, with the practice continued to this day by the Kuna of Panama. Nose piercing also remains popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh and is practiced in a number of Middle Eastern and Arab countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} millennium, the boar was worshipped {{as a symbol}} of <b>virility.</b> The Chalukya dynasty (543–753) was the first dynasty to adopt Varaha in their crest and minted coins with Varaha on it. The Gurjara-Pratihara king Mihira Bhoja (836–885 CE) assumed the title of Adi-varaha and also minted coins {{depicting}} the Varaha image. Varaha was also adopted as a part of royal insignia by the Chola (4th century BCE–1279 CE) and Vijayanagara Empires (1336–1646 CE) of South India. In Karnataka, a zoomorphic image of Varaha is found in a carving on a pillar in Aihole, which is interpreted as the Vijayanagara emblem, as it is seen along with signs of a cross marked Sun, a disc and a conch.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Gielgud staged perhaps {{his most famous}} Shakespeare production, a Romeo and Juliet in which he co-starred with Ashcroft and Olivier. Gielgud had spotted Olivier's potential {{and gave him a}} major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they exchanged roles. As at Oxford, Ashcroft and Evans were Juliet and the nurse. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running at the New Theatre for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the <b>virility</b> of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, comparing it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry. The friendship between the two men was prickly, on Olivier's side, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|The {{forms in}} which the gods are shown, {{although}} diverse, are limited in many ways. Many creatures that are widespread in Egypt were never used in divine iconography. Others could represent many deities, often because these deities had major characteristics in common. Bulls and rams were associated with <b>virility,</b> cows and falcons with the sky, hippopotami with maternal protection, felines with the sun god, and serpents with both danger and renewal. Animals that were absent from Egypt {{in the early stages}} of its history were not used as divine images. For instance, the horse, which was only introduced in the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650–1550 BC), never represented a god. Similarly, the clothes worn by anthropomorphic deities in most periods changed little from the styles used in the Old Kingdom: a kilt, false beard, and often a shirt for male gods and a long, tight-fitting dress for goddesses.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of <b>virility</b> and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1645, after Jiangnan {{had been}} superficially pacified, Dorgon issued a most inopportune edict {{ordering}} all Chinese men to shave their forehead and to braid {{the rest of}} their hair into a queue identical to those of the Manchus. The punishment for non-compliance was death. This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus in telling friend from foe. For Han officials and literati, however, the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning (because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one's body intact), whereas for common folk cutting their hair was the same as losing their <b>virility.</b> Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule, the hair cutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest. The defiant population of Jiading and Songjiang was massacred by former Ming general Li Chengdong (李成東; d. 1649), respectively on August 24 and September 22. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Qing army led by Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐; d. 1667) massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. These massacres ended armed resistance against the Qing in the Lower Yangtze. A few committed loyalists became hermits, hoping that for lack of military success, their withdrawal from the world would at least symbolize their continued defiance against foreign rule.|$|E
5|$|Thematically, Viking metal draws {{extensively}} on elements of black metal, but the lyrics and imagery are pagan and Norse rather than anti-Christian or Satanic. It combines the exaltation {{of violence and}} <b>virility</b> through weapons and battlefields, which is common to many death and black metal bands, {{with an interest in}} ancestral roots, particularly a pre-Christian heritage, which is expressed through Viking mythology and imagery of northern landscapes. Some bands such as Sorhin keep the Satanic elements of black metal but musically are influenced by more recent folk tunes. Visuals such as album art, band photos, website design, and merchandise all highlight the dark and violent outlook of Viking metal lyrics and themes. The art on albums by Viking metal artists frequently depicts Viking Age archeological finds: Thor's hammers are especially common, but other artifacts such as Oseberg posts and even the Sutton Hoo helmet have appeared. Some bands incorporate far more ancient, pre-medieval imagery, such as the Finnish band Moonsorrow's use of prehistoric rock carvings and megaliths. Other Finnish bands, such as Ensiferum, Turisas, and Korpiklaani, focus on Sami traditions and shamanism, further stretching the definition of Viking metal. Not all bands rely on Viking-related visuals or other ancestral images to aid their musical character: for instance, the members of Týr do not wear Viking costumes on stage, and only their folk-influenced music and lyrical themes distinguish them from other heavy metal bands.|$|E
25|$|The testes {{have two}} primary functions: to produce hormones and to produce sperm. The Leydig cells produce testosterone, {{which in turn}} {{produces}} most of the male pubertal changes. Most of the increasing bulk of testicular tissue is spermatogenic tissue (primarily Sertoli and Leydig cells). Sperm can be detected in the morning urine of most boys {{after the first year}} of pubertal changes, and occasionally earlier. On average, potential <b>virility</b> (or fertility) in boys is reached at 13 years old, but full <b>virility</b> will not be gained until 14–16 years of age.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently, the Dutch {{accused the}} U.S. of dumping {{chickens}} at prices below cost of production. The French government banned U.S. chicken and raised concerns that hormones could affect male <b>virility.</b> German farmers' associations accused U.S. poultry men of fattening chicken artificially with arsenic.|$|E
25|$|The Churel {{is mostly}} {{described}} as extremely ugly and hideous {{but she has}} the power to shape-shift and disguise herself as a beautiful woman to lure men to the mountains where she either kills them or sucks up their <b>virility,</b> turning them into old men.|$|E
25|$|Many myths {{are given}} {{regarding}} the possible causes of baldness {{and its relationship}} with one's <b>virility,</b> intelligence, ethnicity, job, social class, wealth, etc. While skepticism may be warranted in many cases {{due to a lack}} of scientific validation, some claims may have a degree of underlying truth and are supported by research.|$|E
25|$|Another form {{of worship}} practiced by women, {{who have no}} {{children}} for various reasons, install stone statues of snakes below the peepal tree and offer worship seeking blessings of the snake god for bestowing them with children. This is done as it is believed snakes represent <b>virility</b> and have the gift of inducing fecundity curing barrenness.|$|E

During the viral replication cycle, spikes proteins mature in the host cell Golgi complex with a high mannose glycosylation. This spike manno-glycosylation stage is vital for the acquisition of coronavirus <b>virility.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fascism {{emphasizes}} youth both in {{a physical}} sense of age and in a spiritual sense as related to <b>virility</b> and commitment to action. The Italian Fascists' political anthem was called Giovinezza ("The Youth"). Fascism identifies the physical age period of youth as a critical time for the moral development {{of people who will}} affect society.|$|E
25|$|Scholars cite {{integrity}} and equality as masculine values in male-male relationships and <b>virility</b> in male-female relationships. Legends of ancient heroes include the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad and the Odyssey. The stories demonstrate qualities in the hero which inspire respect, such as wisdom and courage: knowing things other {{men do not}} know and taking risks other men would not dare.|$|E
25|$|<b>Virility</b> {{as a kind}} of {{life force}} (vis) or virtue (virtus) is an {{essential}} characteristic of Mars. As an agricultural guardian, he directs his energies toward creating conditions that allow crops to grow, which may include warding off hostile forces of nature. As an embodiment of masculine aggression, he is the force that drives wars – but ideally, war that delivers a secure peace.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the formal}} disapproval of {{religious}} authority, gender segregation in Muslim societies {{and the strong}} emphasis on <b>virility</b> leads adolescents and unmarried young men to seek alternative sexual outlets to women, especially with males younger than themselves. Not all sodomy is homosexual, but for many young men heterosexual sodomy is considered better than vaginal penetration, and female prostitutes report the demand for anal penetration from their male clients.|$|E
25|$|It {{was one of}} {{the poorest}} Test matches in {{technique}} and spirit that I have witnessed. It lacked <b>virility</b> from birth. The Australians came to it with no great spirit of adventure or relish after the Ashes had been won. The policy was, after winning the toss, to hold tight and let the pitch and the Englishmen go to pieces. What went to pieces, of course, was the game itself.|$|E
25|$|In {{a society}} that was {{beginning}} to consider women as men's equals, Nazi policies constituted a setback, forcing women from political life. The Nazis' policies pertaining to women were one aspect of their efforts to stem what they viewed as the decadence of the Weimar Republic. In their eyes, the Weimar regime, which they perceived as having a Jewish character, in effect appeared as feminized, as well as tolerant of homosexuality the veritable antithesis of German <b>virility.</b>|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{despite the}} formal disapproval of {{religious}} authority, the segregation {{of women in}} Muslim societies and the strong emphasis on male <b>virility</b> leads adolescent males and unmarried young men to seek sexual outlets with boys younger than themselves—in one study in Morocco, with boys in the age-range 7 to 13. Men have sex with other males {{so long as they}} are the penetrators and their partners are boys, or in some cases effeminate men.|$|E
25|$|In north western India, {{in cities}} such as Benares, it is the time when Akharas (venues of wrestling {{practice}} and competitions) as part of Naga Panchami celebrations are bedecked; on this occasion the ahkaras are cleaned up thoroughly and walls painted with images of snakes, priests preside, and the gurus are honoured along with the sponsors. Its significance is that the wrestlers stand for <b>virility</b> and Naga symbolizes this “scheme of virility”. Akharas are decorated with snake images showing snakes drinking milk.|$|E
25|$|Levels of free {{testosterone}} {{are strongly}} linked to libido and DHT levels, but unless free testosterone is virtually nonexistent, levels {{have not been}} shown to affect <b>virility.</b> Men with androgenic alopecia {{are more likely to}} have a higher baseline of free androgens. However, sexual activity is multifactoral, and androgenic profile is not the only determining factor in baldness. Additionally, because hair loss is progressive and free testosterone declines with age, a male's hairline may be more indicative of his past than his present disposition.|$|E
25|$|While not {{commonly}} {{thought of}} as food in most cultures, in some cultures, the consumption of snakes is acceptable, or even considered a delicacy, prized for its alleged pharmaceutical effect of warming the heart. Snake soup of Cantonese cuisine is consumed by local people in autumn, to warm up their body. Western cultures document the consumption of snakes under extreme circumstances of hunger. Cooked rattlesnake meat is an exception, which is commonly consumed {{in parts of the}} Midwestern United States. In Asian countries such as China, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia, drinking the blood of snakes—particularly the cobra—is believed to increase sexual <b>virility.</b> The blood is drained while the cobra is still alive when possible, and is usually mixed with some form of liquor to improve the taste.|$|E
25|$|The {{average age}} Brazilians lose their virginity is 17.4 years of age, the second lowest {{number in the}} {{countries}} researched (first was Austria), according to the 2007 research finding these results, and they also ranked low at using condoms at their first time, at 47.9% (to the surprise of the researchers, people of lower socioeconomic status were {{far more likely to}} do so than those of higher ones). 58.4% of women reported that it was in a committed relationship, versus solely 18.9% of men (traditional Mediterranean cultures-descended mores tend to enforce strongly about male sexual prowess equating <b>virility</b> and female quality being chastity and purity upon marriage), and scored among the countries where people have the most positive feelings about their first time, feeling pleasure and more mature afterwards (versus the most negative attitudes coming from Japan).|$|E
25|$|In the Zenú culture, {{women were}} {{the symbol of}} fertility, wisdom and respect. Female {{characters}} were frequently portrayed in clay {{and placed in the}} graves of the dead as a symbol of human and agricultural fertility. The presence of these statuettes in the grave symbolized conception and rebirth in the underworld, {{in the same way that}} seeds germinate and grow. During the funeral ceremony, which was attended by the whole community with music and dance, a mound was built over the grave. On top of the mound a tree was planted, and golden bells were hung in the branches. The golden breastplates that important women and chiefs wore during ceremonies symbolized the pregnancy of women and the <b>virility</b> of men. The roundness of the mound, like the roundness of a breastplate, was an allusion to the place where pregnancy and birth took place. Thus, women possessed great social and political significance. When the Zenú culture was discovered by the Spaniards in the 16th century, the religious center of Finzenú at the river Sinú was led by Toto, a female chief who governed several nearby villages.|$|E
25|$|Since TCM recognizes bear bile as a medicinal, {{more than}} 12,000 asiatic black bears {{are held in}} bear farms. The bile is {{extracted}} through a permanent hole in the abdomen leading to the gall bladder, which can cause severe pain. This can lead to bears trying to kill themselves. As of 2012, approximately 10,000 bears are farmed in China for their bile. This practice has spurred public outcry across the country. The bile is collected from live bears via a surgical procedure. The deer penis {{is believed to have}} therapeutic benefits according to traditional Chinese medicine. It is typically very big and, proponents believe, in order to preserve its properties, it should be extracted from a living deer. Medicinal tiger parts from poached animals include tiger penis, believed to improve <b>virility,</b> and tiger eyes. The illegal trade for tiger parts in China has driven the species to near-extinction because of its popularity in traditional medicine. Laws protecting even critically endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger fail to stop the display and sale of these items in open markets. Shark fin soup is traditionally regarded in Chinese medicine as beneficial for health in East Asia, and its status as an elite dish has led to huge demand with the increase of affluence in China, devastating shark populations. The shark fins {{have been a part of}} traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Shark finning is banned in many countries, but the trade is thriving in Hong Kong and China, where the fins are part of shark fin soup, a dish considered a delicacy, and used in some types of traditional Chinese medicine.|$|E
500|$|He located two {{designs for}} the Bustum Caesaris Augusti, {{concluding}} that they were based upon sexual ritual, with [...] "two phallic plans penetrating the semicircular cubicula". [...] Piranesi believed {{that the purpose of}} the phallic designs were to celebrate <b>virility</b> and male regenerative power. Other commentators such as Carl August Ehrensvärd also provided illustrations and analysis of Priapic temples and the meaning of phallic architecture. A work of note to this effect is Neoclassical Temple of <b>Virility</b> and the Buildings with a Phallic Shaped Plan (1977) of the Institute for Art History of the University of Lund, Sweden.|$|E
500|$|Patton's niece Jean Gordon {{appeared}} again; {{they spent}} some time together in London in 1944, and again in Bavaria in 1945. Gordon actually loved a young married captain who left her despondent when he went home to his wife in September 1945. Patton repeatedly boasted of his sexual success with this young woman but his biographers are skeptical. Hirshson says the relationship was casual. Showalter believes that Patton, under severe physical and psychological stress, made up claims of sexual conquest to prove his <b>virility.</b> D'Este agrees, saying, [...] "His behavior suggests that in both 1936 [...] and 1944–45, {{the presence of the}} young and attractive Jean was a means of assuaging the anxieties of a middle-aged man troubled over his <b>virility</b> and a fear of aging." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Oscar Reutersvärd, the {{interest}} in neoclassical architecture in the 18th century was synonymous with and motivated by a similar interest in masculine <b>virility.</b> Works such as Francesco Colonna's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (1467) and Giovanni Battista Piranesi's Campo Marzio (1762) show profoundly the ancient influence of phallic architecture in design and worship, and contain numerous illustrations of Priapic temples and architecture. Piranesi in particular {{is said to have}} offered a [...] "prototype for the mysterious architecture of phallic worship that more closely resembles the houses of pleasure" [...] in his etchings.|$|E
500|$|Indonesian {{literary}} critic Boen Sri Oemarjati finds Kami, Perempuan to be a romance which also shows {{the strength and}} <b>virility</b> of the Indonesian people. She concludes, however, {{that it is a}} work of propaganda, summarising its message as [...] "Women with the spirit of Srikandi want their husbands to be as strong and virile as their own hearts", and to do so they must join PETA. M. Yoesoef of the University of Indonesia likewise categorises the play as propaganda vehicle, emphasising the theme of women willing to surrender their lovers to PETA, {{for the good of the}} nation.|$|E

The Ijaw people of the Niger Delta wore masks of aquatic animals like the hippo when practicing their water spirit cults and hippo ivory {{was used in the}} divination rituals of the Yoruba. The Behemoth from the Book of Job, 40:15–24 is thought to be based on a hippo.|$|E
