40|$|Abstract Background Minimum {{hospital}} procedure volumes {{are discussed}} {{as an instrument}} for quality assurance. In 2004 Germany introduced such annual minimum volumes nationwide on five surgical procedures: kidney, liver, stem cell transplantation, complex oesophageal, and pancreatic interventions. The present investigation is {{the first part of}} a study evaluating the effects of these minimum volumes on health care provision. Research questions address how many hospitals and cases were affected by minimum <b>volume</b> <b>regulations</b> in 2004, how affected hospitals were distributed according to minimum volumes, and how many hospitals within the 16 German states complied with the standards set for 2004. Methods The evaluation is based on the mandatory hospital quality reports for 2004. In the reports, all hospitals are statutorily obliged to state the number of procedures performed for each minimum volume. The data were analyzed descriptively. Results In 2004, 485 out of 1710 German hospitals providing acute care and approximately 0. 14 % of all hospital cases were affected by minimum <b>volume</b> <b>regulations.</b> Liver, kidney, and stem cell transplantation affected from 23 to hospitals; complex oesophageal and pancreatic interventions affected from 297 to 455 hospitals. The inter-state comparison of the average hospital care area demonstrates large differences between city states and large area states and the eastern and western German states ranging from a minimum 51 km 2 up to a maximum 23. 200 km 2, varying according to each procedure. A range of 9 % – 16 % of the transplantation hospitals did not comply with the standards affecting 1 % – 2 % of the patients whereas 29 % and 18 % of the hospitals treating complex oesophageal and pancreatic interventions failed the standards affecting 2 % – 5 % of the prevailing cases. Conclusion In 2004, the newly introduced minimum <b>volume</b> <b>regulations</b> affected only up to a quarter of German acute care hospitals and few cases. However, excluding the hospitals not meeting the minimum volume standards from providing the respective procedures deserves considering two aspects: the hospital health care provision concepts by the German states as being responsible and from a patient perspective the geographically equal access to hospital care. </p...|$|R

50|$|Based {{on these}} studies {{conducted}} on VRACs role in both excitotoxicity {{conditions and the}} regulation of the osmosensing supraoptical nucleous (SON), there are large implications for the actual influence this channel has on everyday neuronal activity.

Another important aspect of neurons {{to keep in mind is}} that potassium, chloride cotransporters (KCCs) are other proteins that are also part of the RVD process and are activated when cells undergo swelling.This is important to keep in mind because VRACs are not the only molecules present that aid in cell <b>volume</b> <b>regulation,</b> and recent research has shown that the likelihood that these two channels work cooperatively is high.|$|E

Thus, the primary goals of my dissertation research were {{to better understand the}} role of osmosis in membrane fusion or fission and identify the aquaporin(s) responsible using the yeast vacuole as a model. First, I characterized osmosis across isolated vacuole membranes and identified the aquaporins responsible, Aqy 3 and Fps 1, using stopped-flow fluorometry. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that knocking out AQY 3 or both aquaporins disrupted vacuole morphology, indicative of an impairment in membrane fission. Using a new cell-free vacuole fission assay, I then determined that osmosis can drive fission in vitro and that this process involves inactivation of Ytp 7, a Rab-GTPase and key regulator of vacuole morphology. These results support a model whereby water efflux by Aqy 3 permits membrane invagination while signaling the fission machinery necessary for membrane fission...|$|R

50|$|The {{regulation}} of cell volume is necessary {{not only as}} a prevention against swelling or shrinkage caused by a change in the cell's environment, but also throughout all stages of a cell's life. The changing of a cell's volume, whether it be swelling or shrinkage, generally occurs without major changes, such as exocytic insertion or endocytic retrieval of the plasma membrane. Instead, <b>volume</b> <b>regulation</b> mostly occurs through the transport of potassium, sodium, chloride, and organic osmolytes across the membrane. The ramifications of cells not being able to regulate their volume size in relation to their environments are great as swelling leads to lysis, and shrinking eventually leads from dehydration to apoptosis. The specific role that VRACs play in the {{regulation of}} cell volume specifically is regulatory volume decrease (RVD) of cells.|$|E
50|$|Overall, the red {{king crabs}} {{have a high}} {{adaptation}} capacity in changes of salinity level because the crabs retain their vital functions and also their feeding locomotor activities. However, {{there is a difference}} in the salinity tolerance between juvenile red king crabs and adult red king crabs. Juvenile red king crabs are slightly more tolerant to low concentrations of salinity because the juvenile's <b>volume</b> <b>regulation</b> is significantly better. Juveniles are consistently hyposmotic to the seawater because they have lower sodium concentration in their hemolymph. Due to the smaller size of the juveniles their exoskeleton is structurally more rigid. The adult red king crabs are hyperosmotic in high salinity and becomes hyposmotic in lower salinity. The hyperosmoticity is due to the higher sodium and potassium concentrations in the hemolymph compared to the surrounding water they live in.|$|E
50|$|The {{different}} {{families of}} stretch-activated ion channels {{are responsible for}} different functions around the body. The DEG/ENaC family consists of two subgroups: the ENaC subfamily regulates Na+ reabsorption in kidney and lung epithelia; the ASIC subfamily is involved in fear conditioning, memory formation, and pain sensation. The TRP superfamily of channels are found in sensory receptor cells {{that are involved in}} heat sensation, taste, smell, touch, and osmotic and <b>volume</b> <b>regulation.</b> MscM, MscS, and MscL channels (mechanosensitive channels of mini, small, and large conductance) regulate osmotic pressure in cells by releasing intracellular fluid when they become too stretched. In the body, a possible role in myoblast development has been described. Furthermore, mechanically gated ion channels are also found in the stereocilia of the inner ear. Sound waves are able to bend the stereocilia and open up ion channels leading to the creation of nerve impulses. These channels also play a role in sensing vibration and pressure via activation of Pacinian corpuscles in the skin.|$|E

5000|$|For [...] glutamate, when {{excitatory}} [...] neurotransmitters {{are released}} and activates channels on surrounding [...] neurons, {{it results in}} overactive depolarization, and increase in calcium ions, and eventually cellular apoptosis. This is generally called excitotoxicity, and it normally results in neuronal swelling. VRACs release of organic osmolytes {{as a response to}} this swelling and influx of ions most likely aids in the prevention of the neuron from bursting, as the release of inorganic compounds from a cell has only been associated with a cellular volume decrease of about 20-30%. Yet, in addition to the prevention of lysis for the neuron, the release of taurine and [...] glutamate will also continue to propagate the excitotoxicity effect on neighboring [...] neurons. The most relevant cells to study regarding VRACs role and reaction to excitotoxicity are [...] astrocytes. This is because of their role as supporters of neuronal communication in the brain, {{the fact that they have}} been proven to contain VRACs, and the fact that they have been found in a swollen condition in response to pathologies regarding excitotoxicity. As we have stated, the increase of stimulation on a neuron results in excitotoxicity, and [...] glutamate is one of the [...] neurotransmitters that in excess could cause this neuronal response. There are many pathologies attributed to this cellular response including stroke and hypoglycemia among others. As an example, a few studies have found that astrocytes cellular VRAC activation might be associated with stroke-related increases in substances like ATP. Experiments have found that VRAC inhibitors were able to decrease the stroke-related release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain; [...] which means that VRACs are likely activated by the increase of cellular ATPand other molecules in astrocytes, and the release of glutamate by these cells causes the neurons around them to become depolarized, increase their calcium ion concentration, and undergo apoptosis. The other organic osmolyte associated with VRACs, taurine, also has many extracellular signaling functions. Specifically, it is thought that the release of taurine from glia by VRACs is linked to systemic <b>volume</b> <b>regulation</b> in the osmosensing supraoptical nucleous (SON).At first, researchers thought that neurons found in SON were not able to undergo RVD, but it was later found that they do eventually develop a chloride ion current after a certain amount of time. Astrocytes were again studied in relation to this discovery, and they found that the cells readily respond to a hypertonic environment by releasing taurine through VRAC-like channels. In turn, the taurine activates glycine receptor chloride channels on neighboring SON neurons, which causes them to hyperpolarize. Since the SON neurons shrink and depolarize in a hypertonic environment, [...] this interaction between the astrocytes acts as an inhibitor of the secretion of vasopressin by SON.|$|E
