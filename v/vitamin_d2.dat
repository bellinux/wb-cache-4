5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2,</b> which they may use directly or make <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{values of}} the {{composition}} and concentrations of trace metals and minerals in Boletus edulis tend to differ considerably, as the mushroom bioaccumulates different elements to varying degrees, and the element concentration in the fruit bodies is often {{a reflection of the}} element concentration of the soils from which they were picked. In general, B.edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium (1317 ppm), a trace mineral essential for good health, though the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low. Whole fruit bodies also contain 4.7μg of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> per 100g dry weight. The relatively high ergosterol content (see next section) of the fruit bodies can make the mushroom nutritionally pragmatic for vegetarians and vegans, who would otherwise have a limited intake of vitamin D.|$|E

25|$|Mushrooms {{can be a}} good dietary {{source of}} <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> if exposed to {{ultraviolet}} light. Mushrooms contain high concentrations of ergosterol (provitamin D2).

25|$|Several forms (vitamers) {{of vitamin}} D exist. The two major forms are <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> or ergocalciferol, and vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol; vitamin D without a {{subscript}} refers to either D2 or D3 or both. These are known collectively as calciferol. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> was chemically characterized in 1931. In 1935, the chemical structure of vitamin D3 was established and proven {{to result from}} the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol.|$|E
25|$|Alfalfa {{is rich in}} chlorophyll, carotene, protein, {{calcium and}} other minerals, {{vitamins}} in the B group, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K. The sun-dried hay of alfalfa {{has been found to}} be a source of vitamin D, containing 48ng/g (1920 IU/kg) <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> and 0.63ng/g (25 IU/kg) vitamin D3. There is reference to <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> and vitamin D3 being found in the alfalfa shoot; this is awaiting verification.|$|E
25|$|While fresh A. bisporus only {{contains}} 0.2 micrograms (8 IU) {{of vitamin}} D as ergocalciferol (<b>vitamin</b> <b>D2),</b> the ergocalciferol content increases substantially after exposure to UV light.|$|E
25|$|Synthesis {{of vitamin}} D in nature is {{dependent}} on the presence of UV radiation and subsequent activation in liver and in kidney. Many animals synthesize vitamin D3 from 7-dehydrocholesterol, and many fungi synthesize <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> from ergosterol.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is {{produced}} industrially by exposing 7-dehydrocholesterol to UVB light, followed by purification. The 7-dehydrocholesterol {{is a natural}} substance in fish organs, especially the liver, or in wool grease (lanolin) from sheep. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> (ergocalciferol) {{is produced}} {{in a similar way}} using ergosterol from yeast or mushrooms as a starting material.|$|E
25|$|Chemically, {{the various}} forms of vitamin D are secosteroids, i.e., steroids in which one of the bonds in the steroid rings is broken. The {{structural}} difference between <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> and vitamin D3 is the side chain of D2 contains a double bond between carbons 22 and 23, and a methyl group on carbon 24.|$|E

25|$|In 2016 in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) amended food {{additive}} {{regulations for}} milk fortification, stating that vitamin D3 levels not exceed 42 IU vitamin D per 100 g (400 IU per US quart) of dairy milk, and not exceed 84 IU of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> per 100 g (800 IU per quart) of plant milks.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, he was {{appointed}} as the first lecturer in Structural Crystallography at Cambridge, becoming the {{assistant director of the}} Cavendish Laboratory in 1934. Here he started applying his crystallographic techniques to organic molecules, starting with oestrin and sterol compounds including cholesterol in 1929, forcing a radical change of thinking among sterol chemists. While at Cambridge, he analysed vitamin B1 (1933), pepsin (1934), <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2</b> (1935), the sterols (1936), and the tobacco mosaic virus (1937).|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{comes in}} two forms. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is {{synthesized}} {{in the skin}} after exposure to the sun, or consumed {{in the form of}} animal products; when produced industrially it is taken from lanolin in sheep's wool. Ergocalciferol (<b>vitamin</b> <b>D2)</b> is derived from ergosterol from UV-exposed mushrooms or yeast and is suitable for vegans. Conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms {{may or may not be}} bioequivalent. According to researchers from the Institute of Medicine, the differences between vitamins D2 and D3 do not affect metabolism, both function as prohormones, and when activated exhibit identical responses in the body.|$|E
25|$|Other forms (<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D2,</b> alfacalcidol, and calcitriol) do {{not appear}} to have any {{beneficial}} effects with regard to the risk of death. High blood levels appear to be associated with a lower risk of death, but it is unclear if supplementation can result in this benefit. Both an excess and a deficiency in vitamin D appear to cause abnormal functioning and premature aging. The relationship between serum calcifediol level and all-cause mortality is parabolic. Harm from vitamin D appears to occur at a lower vitamin D level in the black population than in the white population.|$|E
25|$|With its vitamin D content being {{related to}} post-harvest treatment, the vitamin is not {{included}} in the listed nutritional content of mushrooms in the USDA nutrient database. However, when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light even after harvesting, natural ergosterols in mushrooms produce <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2,</b> a process now used to supply fresh vitamin D mushrooms for the functional food grocery market. In a comprehensive safety assessment of producing vitamin D in fresh mushrooms, researchers showed that artificial UV light technologies were equally effective for vitamin D production as in mushrooms exposed to natural sunlight, and that UV light has a long record of safe use for production of vitamin D in food.|$|E
25|$|Reasonable {{exposure}} to ultraviolet {{radiation from the}} sun {{can be a good}} source of vitamin D. One minimal erythemal dose of sunlight UV radiation provides the equivalent of about 20,000 IU of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D2,</b> taken as an oral supplement. If an adult's arms and legs are exposed to a half minimal erythemal UV radiation, it is the same as taking 3,000 IU of vitamin D3 through an oral supplement. This exposure of 10–15 minutes, on a frequency of two to three times per week will cause the adult's skin to produce enough vitamin D. It is not necessary to expose the face to the UV, as facial skin provides little vitamin D3. Individuals whose metabolism makes taking oral vitamin D ineffective are able, through {{exposure to}} an ultraviolet lamp that emits UV-B radiation, to achieve a 25 (OH) D blood level.|$|E

2500|$|Vitamin D {{refers to}} a group of fat-soluble secosteroids {{responsible}} for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, and multiple other biological effects.

[...] Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol can be ingested from the diet and from supplements. [...] Only a few foods contain vitamin D. [...] The major natural source of the vitamin is synthesis of cholecalciferol in the skin from cholesterol through a chemical reaction that is dependent on sun exposure (specifically UVB radiation). Dietary recommendations typically assume that all of a person's vitamin D is from taken by mouth, as sun exposure in the population is variable and recommendations about the amount of sun exposure that is safe are uncertain in view of the skin cancer risk.|$|E
