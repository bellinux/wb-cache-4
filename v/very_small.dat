5|$|A {{family of}} <b>very</b> <b>small</b> birds. There are seven species worldwide, with two in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Average weights {{reported}} for this species {{are based on}} <b>very</b> <b>small</b> sample sizes or are general ranges for its genus and thus require further research.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is removed}} from the body very slowly, mainly through urine. Smaller amounts of lead are also {{eliminated}} through the feces, and <b>very</b> <b>small</b> amounts in hair, nails, and sweat.|$|E
50|$|The first {{classification}} {{is meant}} {{for only the}} <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> libraries. The first classification has only seven top level classes, and only eight classes in all.|$|R
25|$|The use of {{the term}} toy to refer to dogs is based on tradition, and is not a precise classification. Dogs {{traditionally}} referred to as toy dogs are usually the <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> dogs. Toy dogs can be one of several dog types. Some are of ancient lap dog types, and some are small versions of hunting dog, spitz, or terrier types, bred down in size for a particular kind of work or to create a pet of convenient size. The <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> dogs are sometimes called Teacup, although no major dog registry recognizes that term.|$|R

5|$|The flight {{feathers}} {{of the wing}} comprise 10 primaries, the outermost being <b>very</b> <b>small,</b> and 13 secondaries, and there are 12 tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|The flowerpeckers are <b>very</b> <b>small,</b> stout, often brightly {{coloured}} birds, {{with short}} tails, short thick curved bills and tubular tongues.|$|E
5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for <b>very</b> <b>small</b> insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being trapped by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think, Robert," [...] he said, {{disregarding}} his daughter's protest, [...] "that I {{will have}} a drop, just the <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> possible drop, of brandy. A mere thimbleful will do; but I rather think I have caught cold during the snowstorm to-day." ...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} species are adapted to {{spending}} {{a portion of their}} time feeding on the ground, and a <b>very</b> <b>small</b> minority have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes in the ground. The ground woodpecker is one such species, inhabiting the rocky and grassy hills of South Africa, and the Andean flicker is another.|$|E
5|$|After its {{confluence}} with Uono River, the Shinano is crossed by Koshiji Bridge and the Shinetsu {{train line}} before emerging onto Echigo Plains of the Niigata Prefecture at Sanjō. After entering the Echigo Plains the river becomes deltaic and swampy {{due to its}} <b>very</b> <b>small</b> gradient (an average of 1 in 4000).|$|E
5|$|Akodon caenosus is a rodent in {{the genus}} Akodon found in northwestern Argentina and south-central Bolivia. Since its {{description}} in 1918, {{it has been}} alternatively classified as a separate species or a subspecies of Akodon lutescens (formerly Akodon puer). The species Akodon aliquantulus, described from some <b>very</b> <b>small</b> Argentine specimens in 1999, is now recognized as a synonym of A.caenosus.|$|E
60|$|The Honorable Eric Lindon, {{who was at}} {{this moment}} {{walking up and down}} with Lady Muriel, might have solved it at once, no doubt, by announcing his {{intention}} of returning on foot. Of this solution there {{did not seem to be}} the <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> probability.|$|R
5000|$|The key {{advantage}} of Laser blended vision is the freedom from reading glasses. Between 95% and 98% of Laser Blended Vision patients can read normal newsprint and between 80% to 96% {{can read the}} <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> print on medicine bottle inserts (J1 or N4 print size)., ...|$|R
60|$|The poor {{greengrocer}} bowed very humbly {{while these}} little epithets were bestowed upon him, {{in the true}} spirit of the <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> tyranny; and when everybody had said something to show his superiority, Mr. Tuckle proceeded to carve the leg of mutton, and to help the company.|$|R
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} <b>very</b> <b>small</b> scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution. This may make the population of Coptothyrus adamsi useful {{as a measure of}} environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Antlion larvae require loose soil, not {{necessarily}} but often sand. The larvae prefer dry places {{protected from the}} rain. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specialises in <b>very</b> <b>small</b> insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger pits, and thus catches larger prey, sometimes much larger than itself.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Robbins medallions {{were also}} struck, in <b>very</b> <b>small</b> numbers, in 14k gold. These medallions were {{generally}} {{ordered by the}} mission crew as a personal memento of their flight and were often taken to the lunar surface in the Landing Module. For {{the duration of the}} Apollo program, Robbins medallions (3–7 gold and 80–450 silver per mission) were flown into space.|$|E

60|$|Nothing would induce Gascoyne {{to take a}} {{prominent}} part in the public affairs of his chosen home; but he did attempt to teach a class of the <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> {{boys and girls in}} the missionary's Sunday school, and he came, in time, to take special delight in this work.|$|R
50|$|The {{branches}} of the middle meningeal artery are distributed partly to the dura mater, but chiefly to the bones; they anastomose with the arteries of the opposite side, and with the anterior and posterior meningeal arteries. The <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> distal branches anastomose through the skull with small arterioles from the scalp.|$|R
5|$|Arsenal Stadium {{was well}} known for its <b>very</b> <b>small</b> immaculately-kept pitch, which {{measured}} only 109×73 yards (100×67 metres). Arsenal's groundsmen, Steve Braddock and his successor Paul Burgess, have won the FA Premier League's Groundsman of the Year award several times for their work on the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs, larger {{vascular}} malformations) {{occur in}} larger organs, predominantly the lungs (50%), liver (30–70%) {{and the brain}} (cerebral AVMs, 10%), with a <b>very</b> <b>small</b> proportion (<1%) having AVMs in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the pass, {{the road}} descends through three more long switchbacks {{to the floor}} of the Lake Creek valley. From there it heads south at first but quickly curving to the east. As it assumes that heading it passes the other set of gates, just west of the <b>very</b> <b>small</b> {{settlement}} of Everett, near where Lake Creek's North Fork joins the main stream.|$|E
60|$|For {{the plan}} which Colonel Esmond had in view, and the stroke he intended, 'twas {{necessary}} that the <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> {{number of persons}} should be put in possession of his secret. It scarce was known, except {{to three or four}} out of his family, and it was kept to a wonder.|$|R
2500|$|Its {{reception}} in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in The Times Literary Supplement on 21 June 1917. [...] "The {{fact that these}} things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> importance to anyone, even to himself. They certainly have no relation to poetry." ...|$|R

5|$|C# is {{intended}} to be suitable for writing applications for both hosted and embedded systems, ranging from the very large that use sophisticated operating systems, down to the <b>very</b> <b>small</b> having dedicated functions.|$|E
5|$|Californium-251 has a <b>very</b> <b>small</b> {{calculated}} {{critical mass}} of about , high lethality, and {{a relatively short period}} of toxic environmental irradiation. The low {{critical mass of}} californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{striking}} {{differences in}} appearance, S.parthenopion {{may be most}} closely related to S.nicholsi. Like the diminutive S.parthenopion in the Virgin Islands, S.nicholsi, the smallest endemic sphaerodactylid in Puerto Rico, is <b>very</b> <b>small.</b> The geographic range of another species, S.townsendi, divides these two closely related populations, suggesting that S.townsendi evolved after S.parthenopion and S.nicholsi diverged.|$|E
50|$|Shredders {{range in}} size and price from small and {{inexpensive}} units designed for {{a certain amount of}} pages, to large units used by commercial shredding services that cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} and can shred millions of documents per hour. While the <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> shredders may be hand-cranked, most shredders are electrically powered.|$|R
50|$|This {{leads to}} some {{interesting}} situations on the smaller channels. Since {{there are many}} television stations, and many hours in the day, there can be situations where BARB will record zero viewers for certain program. As the TV advertising system is geared round BARB ratings all but the <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> channels subscribe to BARB.|$|R
5000|$|Vessels in the 1,500-2,499 TEU range are {{the most}} likely size class to have cranes, with more than 60% of this {{category}} being geared ships. [...] Slightly {{less than a third of}} the <b>very</b> <b>smallest</b> ships (from 100-499 TEU) are geared, and almost no ships with a capacity of over 4,000 TEU are geared.|$|R
