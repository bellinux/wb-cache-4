5|$|All British {{patterns}} were different, first tested on small wooden models <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> a periscope in a studio. Most {{of the model}} designs were painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their designs for the real thing. Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Jim Reardon {{directed}} the episode and has noted {{he remembers the}} episode for several scenes in which the action is <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> windows, such as when Homer prank calls the dean.

5|$|The Sun is a G2V star, with G2 {{indicating}} {{its surface}} temperature of approximately 5,778K (5,505°C, 9,941°F), and V that it, like most stars, is a main-sequence star. The average luminance of the Sun is about 1.88gigacandela per square metre, but as <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> Earth's atmosphere, this is lowered to about 1.44Gcd/m2. However, the luminance is not constant across the disk of the Sun (limb darkening).|$|E

5|$|There are two distinct, though connected, {{regions of}} ER that differ in {{structure}} and function: smooth ER and rough ER. The {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} is so named because the cytoplasmic surface is covered with ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> an electron microscope. The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11.5°. That is, the planet always appears nearly fully {{illuminated}} when <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained. A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere. A large telescope will show Jupiter's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth.|$|E
5|$|Lynx is rich {{in double}} stars. The second {{brightest}} star in the constellation is 38 Lyncis at magnitude 3.8. When <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> a moderate telescope, the two components—a brighter blue-white star of magnitude 3.9 and a fainter star of magnitude 6.1 that {{has been described as}} lilac as well as blue-white—can be seen. 15 Lyncis is another star that is found to be a double system when <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> a telescope, separating into two yellowish stars of magnitudes 4.7 and 5.8 that are 0.9arcseconds apart. The components are a yellow giant of spectral type G8III that is around 4.01 times as massive as the Sun, and a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F8V that is around 3.73 times as massive as the Sun. Orbiting each other every 262 years, the stars are 178 ± 2 light years distant from Earth. 12 Lyncis has a combined apparent magnitude of 4.87. When seen through a telescope, it can be separated into three stars: two components with magnitudes 5.4 and 6.0 that lie at an angular separation by 1.8″ (as of 1992) and a yellow-hued star of magnitude 7.2 at a separation of 8.6″ (as of 1990). The two brighter stars are estimated to orbit each other with a period that is poorly known but estimated to be roughly 700 to 900 years. The 12 Lyncis system is 210 ± 10 light years distant from Earth.|$|E

5|$|Many reticle {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} to be visible when <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> night vision devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E
5|$|YouTube {{does not}} usually offer a {{download}} link for its videos, and intends {{for them to}} be <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> its website interface. A small number of videos, such as the weekly addresses by President Barack Obama, can be downloaded as MP4 files. Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos. In February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout. In June 2012, Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos. In response, Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the {{different levels of}} the game, the city <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> the apartment window in the level selection screen gradually becomes more vibrant and colorful. If the player triggers three secret flowers in each level, the cityscape is replaced with a bright field with mountains in the background. The music changes in scope as the game progresses, growing in scale and complexity and adding to the narrative arc. The credits level is played {{in a similar manner}} to the main levels, but as the player flies through each flower the name of a person involved in the game appears above it. Flower includes PlayStation Network trophies in keeping with the game's feel. While some are objective-based, many are centered on relaxing and watching the scenery.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Thomas Henry Flewett {{suggested}} the name rotavirus after observing that, when <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> an electron microscope, a rotavirus particle {{looks like a}} wheel (rota in Latin); the name was officially recognised by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses four years later. In 1976, related viruses were described in several other species of animals. These viruses, all causing acute gastroenteritis, were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting humans and animals worldwide. Rotavirus serotypes were first described in 1980, and in the following year, rotavirus from humans was first grown in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys, by adding trypsin (an enzyme found in the duodenum of mammals and now known to be essential for rotavirus to replicate) to the culture medium. The ability to grow rotavirus in culture accelerated the pace of research, and by the mid-1980s the first candidate vaccines were being evaluated.|$|E
5|$|Enemy {{encounters}} {{trigger a}} combat mode. As in Chrono Trigger, enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush {{the party and}} thus are not random. Similar to Final Fantasys Active Time Battle, each character has a meter that gradually fills with time. When the meter is full, characters can physically attack enemies, use MysTech magic, unleash BattleSkill attacks, use items, move to a different position, or use a nearby object to attack, if present. For playable characters and computer-controlled enemies, each attack has their number of hit points (a numerically based life bar) get reduced, which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags. Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron-Radiated Glodents (NRG), a separate energy reserve displayed beneath a character's life bar. NRG is replenished through certain items. Use of BattleSkills require Bouge, a third bar beneath NRG that automatically fills with time; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is. Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game. Winning battles earns experience points and raises characters' levels, granting them improved statistics. These statistics can be <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> the status screen, which displays important character information and current quests. Unlike many other RPGs, Anachronox displays a character's attributes with qualitative descriptors (such as Poor and Excellent) instead of integers.|$|E

25|$|The Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle also {{believed}} that female pleasure {{played a central role}} in conception. Female reproduction was, in many ways, <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> the lens of male reproductive processes, imagining that female organs functioned as inverted versions of male organs, and hence orgasm was required for conception.|$|E

Symptoms often include problems with glare and light scatter at night.|$|E
25|$|In recent historiographical works, pirates {{have been}} <b>viewed</b> <b>through</b> various lenses.
