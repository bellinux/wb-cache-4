50|$|Huemulite can be {{synthesized}} {{by mixing}} stoichiometric proportions of vanadium pentoxide, magnesium carbonate, and sodium carbonate {{in cold water}} in a humid environment. The mixture is heated to dissolve the compounds which react with each other as CO2 is drawn off. The solution is then concentrated, excess <b>vanadic</b> <b>acid</b> is removed by filtration, and allowed to cool and crystallize.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vanadic</b> <b>acid</b> H3VO4 shows {{similarities}} with {{phosphoric acid}} H3PO4 {{though it has}} a much more complex vanadate oxoanion chemistry. Chromic acid H2CrO4, has similarities with sulfuric acid H2SO4; for example, both form acid salts A+HMO4−. Some metals, e.g. V, Cr, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, tend to exist in high oxidation states. Rather than forming hydroxides in aqueous solution, they convert to oxo clusters {{by the process of}} olation, forming polyoxometalates.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of zeolite Y destruction by steam {{in the presence}} of vanadium is described. Electron spin resonance, UV-VIS diffuse reflectance, and sorption measurements are used to understand vanadium dynamics on the zeolite. Vanadium deposited on the external surface of the zeolite migrates into the channels by being heated in oxidizing atmosphere; although water helps vanadium reach the acid sites, it is not required. Vanadium is stabilized as VO 2 + cation near the acid sites. The strongest acid sites can stabilize V as VO 2 + cations, but experimental results show that V-IV does not play any role in zeolite destruction. Extraframework aluminum competes with the zeolite for vanadium and delays its migration to the acid sites. In the presence of water <b>vanadic</b> <b>acid</b> is formed inside the zeolite according to the reaction VO 2 +- Y + 2 H 2 O reversible arrow H+-Y + H- 3 VO 4. Since <b>vanadic</b> <b>acid</b> is a strong acid, it can destroy the zeolite by hydrolysis of the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 framework; in this way, vanadium can act as a catalyst for zeolite destruction. Synergistic action between sodium and vanadium is explained. A detailed mechanism for zeolite dealumination by steam is proposed. (C) 1997 Academic Press. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Nano {{magnetic}} Fe 3 O 4 based <b>vanadic</b> <b>acid</b> [MNPs@VO(OH) 2] (average diameter 20 – 26 nm) {{has been}} synthesized by grafting VOCl 3 on the Fe 3 O 4 surface nanoparticles as a retrievable supporter to produce novel heterogeneous reusable solid acid with dual ability (Bronsted and Lewis acid) followed by stirring in the air. The resultant material {{was characterized by}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Significantly, the as-prepared [MNPs@VO(OH) 2] exhibits a high catalytic activity in the synthesis of 4, 4 ’-(arylmethylene) bis(3 -methyl- 1 -phenyl- 1 H -pyrazol- 5 -ols). Additionally, the newly synthesized heterogeneous solid acid catalyst can be reused for several times without apparent loss of its catalytic activity.

30|$|Vanadium oxide, iron {{vanadate}} or <b>vanadic</b> <b>acid</b> doped with alkali or {{alkaline earth}} metal ions are suitable catalysts for anthracene oxidation [16, 33, 34]. Industrially, the reaction {{has been carried}} out at temperatures in the range 320 – 390  °C and using catalysts consisting of V 2 O 5, K 2 SO 4 and Fe 2 O 3 on pumice; yields of 95 – 97  wt% of anthraquinone were reported [17]. A reaction scheme derived from the oxidation of anthracene using V 2 O 5 –MoO 3 –P 2 O 5 and V 2 O 5 –Fe 2 O 3 as catalysts can be found [33]. In this case, oxidation at the inner and outer rings of anthracene leads to 9, 10 -anthraquinone, 1, 4 -anthraquinone and 2, 3 -naphthalic anhydride. At high conversion, the selectivities towards these compounds decreases and production of phthalic anhydride, pyromellitic anhydride and CO 2 is favored.|$|E
