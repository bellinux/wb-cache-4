The intensity of scattered X-rays that become background noise in a spectrum is reduced with the improvement in surface accuracy of an X-ray reflector used in the portable spectrometer and therefore using an X-ray reflector with an ultra-precision specular surface can lead to further improvement in detection limits obtained by the portable spectrometer. Approach: In the present paper, a combination of electrolytic in process dressing (ELID) grinding and Magnetorheological Finishing (MRF) is applied to fabricating an X-ray reflector for the portable spectrometer. Magnetorheological finishing is used as final finishing after ELID grinding. Results: A peak to <b>valley</b> <b>value</b> of 107 nm and a root mean square value of 17 nm in a surface cross section with a length of 27 mm are obtained with the use of ELID grinding and MRF.

Favorable is an aluminium base body plated with a thick-film of Nickel-Phosphorus alloy (NiP). This alloy can be polished with computer assistance.
