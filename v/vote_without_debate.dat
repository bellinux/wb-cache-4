5000|$|On June 15, 2006, House Democrats {{voted to}} strip Jefferson of his {{committee}} assignment while the federal bribery investigation continued. The intra-party vote passed 99 to 58. Some {{have reported that}} the vote was passed {{as a result of}} Democrats who were determined to make an election-year point about ethics. [...] The full House, the only group with the power actually to remove Jefferson, then stripped him of his seat on the committee on June 16 in a voice <b>vote</b> <b>without</b> <b>debate.</b> Jefferson had offered to step aside temporarily if the Democratic caucus established a rule concerning cases like his and if his seat went to Rep. Charlie Melancon (D-LA). This offer was rejected by House Democratic leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi.|$|E

50|$|The House Democratic {{leadership}} reportedly {{agreed to}} this quick change to a voice vote in advance. Pressure from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) {{may have been involved}} in this decision, since the Senate needed a doc fix bill quickly in order to get one passed before the deadline. Many democratic supporters are disappointed in Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) who pushed House Democrats to a Voice <b>Vote</b> <b>without</b> additional <b>debate</b> or time necessary to submit amendments.|$|R
50|$|The {{debate on}} 65th Street {{occurred}} {{just a week}} after the State Assembly committee issued a go-ahead for Kaufman's electrification bill. Kaufman's proposal had not yet aroused public interest; on April 7, The New York Times barely mentioned as a local ordinance limited to the freight yards along Riverside Drive. Hylan stayed aside from the electrification debate and the bill passed the Assembly <b>vote</b> <b>without</b> much <b>debate.</b> The act was signed by Governor Al Smith on June 2, 1923.|$|R
50|$|The President {{is elected}} through a secret <b>vote</b> and <b>without</b> <b>debate</b> by the Parliament of Albania by a {{majority}} of three-fifths of all its members and is in every case elected for 5 years. However, the Constitution of Albania sets a limit to a maximum of two terms in office. The president-elect is required to take an oath of office before the members of the Parliament of Albania. The 7th and current officeholder is Ilir Meta of the Socialist Movement for Integration who was elected on 28 April 2017.|$|R
5000|$|The President {{is elected}} through a secret <b>vote</b> and <b>without</b> <b>debate</b> by the Parliament by a {{majority}} of three-fifths majority of all its members, for 5 years. The Constitution sets a limit to a maximum of two terms in office. The Parliament is elected to a four-year term in twelve multi-seat constituencies analogous to the 12 county borders, with amendments to achieve a uniform number of eligible voters in each constituency to within 3%. Within the constituencies, seats are elected by closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of 3% for parties and 5% for alliances. Seats were allocated to alliances using the d'Hondt system, then to political parties using the Sainte-Laguë method.|$|R
50|$|The President of Albania {{is elected}} by a secret <b>vote</b> and <b>without</b> <b>debate</b> in the Parliament of Albania. A {{candidate}} needs to receive three-fifths {{of the votes}} to win. If the required majority is not reached {{in the first round}} of voting, a second round takes place within seven days. If a majority is still not reached, a third round must take place within a further period of seven days. If required, a further two rounds must be held within seven days, with the majority needed to win reduced to an absolute majority of 50% +1 votes. If after five rounds of voting no candidate has attained the necessary majority outlined for each round of voting, Parliament will be dissolved and elections must be held within 60 days.|$|R

5000|$|A {{delegated}} Legislation Committee (DLC) is {{a general}} committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom that allows for debate of a statutory instrument or Church Measure which has been laid before the House of Commons. With respect to statutory instruments, it differs from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and Commons Select Committee on Statutory Instruments in that those committees only scrutinise certain technical aspects of them. By contrast, DLC's provide a forum for discussing the merits of proposed instruments. They do not approve or reject delegated legislation, but merely debate it on a motion [...] "That this committee has considered" [...] the legislation. A statutory instrument or measure debated in a DLC's is not later debated on the House floor; rather, a <b>vote</b> is taken <b>without</b> <b>debate</b> if one is sought.|$|R
50|$|The President {{represents}} {{the unity of}} the Albanian people in the country and abroad as the head of state and is also the commander-in-chief of the military. The President is elected through a secret <b>vote</b> and <b>without</b> <b>debate</b> by the Parliament of Albania by a majority of three-fifths of all its members and is in every case elected for 5 years. The President maintains regular and coordinated operation and stability of the national government system, safeguards the independence and territorial integrity of Albania and appoints Prime Ministers {{on the basis of the}} balance of power in the Parliament. The Prime Minister is appointed by the president after each parliamentary election and must have the confidence of the Parliament stay in office. The Prime Minister is elected on the basis of universal suffrage, through a secret ballot, for a four-year term. The constitution sets no limit as to office terms of the prime minister. The Prime Minister is de facto the most powerful and influential person in Albanian politics. However, in the absence of the prime minister, the Deputy Prime Minister takes over his functions, such as chairing the cabinet and the council of ministers of Albania.|$|R
50|$|The {{union has}} been criticised {{for its use}} of e-surveys when {{determining}} policy. Such a survey {{was used for the}} general secretary’s proposal to Congress in 2012 that the size of the National Executive Committee be reduced from 70 members to a maximum of 40, to save money on expenses. E-surveys were challenged at Congress {{on the grounds that they}} ‘encourage people to <b>vote</b> <b>without</b> hearing the <b>debates</b> first’. In its campaign against compulsory membership of the Institute for Learning (IfL) UCU came under criticism for this online survey which, it transpired, was open to the general public and could be completed by non-members without any membership validation. The former deputy chief executive of the IfL, Lee Davies, called this 'slapdash' and said that it 'undermined the union as a democratic voice, especially given a low response rate’.|$|R
6000|$|In June 1633 Charles at last {{visited his}} ancient kingdom, {{accompanied}} by Laud. His subjects were alarmed and {{horrified by the}} sight of prelates in lawn sleeves, candles in chapel, and even a tapestry showing the crucifixion. To this the bishops are said to have bowed,--plain idolatry. In the Parliament of June 18 the eight representatives of each Estate, who were practically all-powerful as Lords of the Articles, were chosen, not from each Estate by its own members, but on a method instituted, or rather revived, by James VI. in 1609. The nobles made the choice from the bishops, the bishops from the nobles, and the elected sixteen from the barons and burghers. The twenty-four were all thus episcopally minded: they drew up the bills, and the bills were <b>voted</b> on <b>without</b> <b>debate.</b> The grant of supply made in these circumstances was liberal, and James's ecclesiastical legislation, including the sanction of the [...] "rags of Rome" [...] worn by the bishops, was ratified. Remonstrances from the ministers of the old Kirk party were disregarded; and--the thin end of the wedge--the English Liturgy was introduced in the Royal Chapel of Holyrood and in that of St Salvator's College, St Andrews, where it has been read once, on a funeral occasion, in recent years.|$|R
