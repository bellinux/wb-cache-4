25|$|The Stainforth Trophy was {{designed}} by Robin Beresford. The trophy depicts in silver three supersonic aircraft and spiralling <b>vapour</b> <b>trails</b> soaring into the stratosphere.

J. Mitchell, of the Spitfire, which played such a major role in Britain's victory in World War II. In the design of the trophy, the artist has tried to show the Earth as seen by the astronauts, <b>vapour</b> <b>trails</b> ending in arrows to depict high speed altitude flight, and with an outward sweep to infinity, which suggests that the sky is literally the limit of man's achievement in the air.

5000|$|Bang Fai come {{in various}} sizes, {{competing}} in several categories. Small ones are called Bang Fai Noi (น้อย). Larger categories are {{designated by the}} counting words for 10,000, 100,000 and 1,000,000: Meun (หมื่น) [...] "Saen" [...] (แสน) and the largest Bang Fai, the Lan (ล้าน). These counting words see use in many contexts to indicate increasing size or value. Lan in this context may be taken to mean extremely large as well as extremely expensive and extremely dangerous: Bang Fai Lan are nine metres long and charged with 120 kg of black powder. These may reach altitudes reckoned in kilometres, and travel dozens of kilometres down range (loosely speaking, as they can go in any direction, including right through the crowd). Competing rockets are scored for apparent height, distance, and beauty of the <b>vapour</b> <b>trail</b> (ไอ). A few include skyrocket pyrotechnics. A few also include parachutes for tail assemblies, but most fall where they may.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was only}} one {{aircraft}} in the vicinity, Air New Zealand Flight 103, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 travelling from Fiji to Auckland. The flight had 88 passengers on board. The captain was Gordon Vette, the first officer was Arthur Dovey, and the flight engineer was Gordon Brooks. Vette knew {{that if they did}} not try and help, Prochnow would almost certainly die. Vette was a navigator, and {{at the time of the}} incident he still held his licence. Furthermore, another passenger, Malcolm Forsyth, was also a navigator; when he heard about the situation he volunteered to help. As neither Prochnow nor the crew of the DC-10 had any real idea of where the Cessna was, the crew had to devise creative ways to find it. By this time, contact between both aircraft had been made on long range HF radio. Prochnow had crossed the international date line, and the date was now 22 December. Vette was able to use the setting sun to gain an approximate position of the Cessna. He instructed the Cessna to point directly at the setting sun. He did the same, and noted the difference in heading between the aircraft as four degrees. After making an allowance for the differing altitudes of the aircraft, the difference in sunset times between the aircraft and Norfolk Island was also noted. This data allowed the crew to calculate that the Cessna must be south west of the DC-10 by about 400 nautical miles. About 25 minutes after turning in that direction, contact on short range VHF radio was established. This had a range of 200 nautical miles. It was hoped the DC-10 would be making a <b>vapour</b> <b>trail</b> to make it more visible. After contacting Auckland it was determined that weather conditions were not suitable for a trail. Brooks knew that by dumping fuel they could produce a <b>vapour</b> <b>trail.</b> As the search was getting more and more desperate, they decided to try it. Prochnow did not see the trail, and it was starting to get dark. Vette wanted all the passengers to be involved, so he asked them to look out of the windows and invited small groups to come to the cockpit.|$|E

5000|$|The Battle of Britain (1941) is {{an imaginative}} {{representation}} of an aerial battle in progress {{over a wide}} landscape of land and sea, suggesting the Thames Estuary and the English Channel.

40|$|The IPCC natural {{climate change}} denialists simply ignore {{the full extent}} of the massive {{quantitative}} negative cloud feedback data (from Spencer et al 2) which offset if they don’t totally cancel out the naïve heating predictions due to CO 2 increases. The lower air pressure and temperature above the surface causes sunlight-warmed evaporated water vapour to rise and condense into cloud cover which dims and cools the surface below. Go further up in altitude and the air gets cleaner, with less dust and condensation nuclei (it’s the high air density at sea level which keeps fine dust suspended for long periods; as air density decreases higher up, dust falls out faster; in a vacuum dust would accelerate downward at 9. 8 ms- 2). It’s analogous to a Wilson cloud chamber, where air ions from cosmic rays act as condensation nuclei that attract water molecules and set off cloud formation. This produces <b>vapour</b> <b>trails</b> around the tracks of alpha and beta particles, and charged cosmic ray collision particles. Nigel Calder, the former New Scientist editor, has correlated the inverse cosmic ray cycle with radiosonde temperature (Fig. 1). Fig. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Norwegian singer-songwriter Jenny Hval said in 2011 that Laughing Stock [...] "is an {{incredibly}} intuitive and bare recording - some songs feel like <b>vapour</b> <b>trails.</b> To me, every {{sound on the}} album is about death, like the songs are about to die, like a band of Beckett characters.

5000|$|When {{spotting}} aircraft, observers generally {{notice the}} key attributes of an aircraft, {{such as a}} distinctive noise from its engine {{or the number of}} <b>vapour</b> <b>trails</b> it is leaving. Observers assess the size of the aircraft and the number, type and position of its engines. Another distinctive attribute is the position of wings relative to the fuselage {{and the degree to which}} they are swept rearwards. The wings may be above the fuselage, below it, or fixed at midpoint. The number of wings indicate whether it is a monoplane, biplane or triplane. The position of the tailplane relative to the fin(s) and the shape of the fin are other attributes. The configuration of the landing gear can be distinctive, as well.Other features include the speed, cockpit placement, colour scheme or special equipment that changes the silhouette of the aircraft. Taken together these traits will enable the identification of an aircraft. If the observer is familiar with the airfield being used by the aircraft and its normal traffic patterns, he or she is more likely to leap quickly to a decision about the aircraft's identity - they may have seen the same type of aircraft from the same angle many times. This is particularly prevalent if the aircraft spotter is spotting commercial aircraft, operated by airlines that have a limited fleet.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{grows out}} of funded fieldwork. Between August 2001 - November 2001, I undertook a research trip to the USA, funded by the Boise Scholarship scheme. During the trip I {{made a series of}} long exposure photographs exploring the relationship between travel and duration. I was exploring the possibilities for an alternative way in which the experience of travelling through the USA could be documented photographically. The photographs show entire nights’ sleep in budget motels in California, Arizona, Utah, Oregon, Nevada and Washington State. Using 8 –hour exposures the night–long shots record the movement of the sleeping figures as <b>vapour</b> <b>trails</b> over the bed. This movement is set against every detail, in sharp focus, of the sparsely decorated rooms. Recurring features are in this way highlighted; framed landscapes; lamps and tables, providing perhaps a semblance of domestic comfort. The work has been shown in a number of exhibitions. These included: London Calling, Con-temporary Gallery, Berlin, [URL] in which the five selected (London Based) artists looked at the use of photography and lens-based media, subverting its intended function; Passing Through, Ffotogallery, Cardiff, [URL] in which the three artists in the exhibition (Natalie Latham, Tim MacMillan and Martin Newth) focus on people traversing through real and imaginary spaces; and Sequences [URL] a national touring exhibition which brought together artists using sequences of images relating their research to the work of nineteenth century ‘Chronophotographers’ including Etienne-Jules Marey (1830 - 1904).
