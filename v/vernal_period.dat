40|$|Each of the {{following}} phytoplankton functional attributes could be described by significant (P < 0. 05) response surfaces defined by trophic status (T) from oligotrophy to hypertrophy and season (S) from early <b>vernal</b> <b>period</b> to late summer: phytoplankton cell volume, growth rate, the ratio between minimum quotas of total N and total P, affinity for P, half-saturation constant for growth with respect to P, and temperature optimum and light optimum for growth. Sinking rate could not be so described. The response surfaces were calculated by multiple regressions, including first- and second-order terms of T and S and the interaction term T. S. Although the data base was rather limited (number of phytoplankton species ranged from 10 to 3 I), the resulting surfaces often reflected a corresponding attribute of the water along T and S (e. g. phyto-plankton temperature optimum for growth reflected water temperature). The results support the frequent use of physical factors as explanatory variables for the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton. The abundance of phytoplankton species and the spe-cies structure of phytoplankton assemblages vary along trophic and seasonal gradients (Reynolds 1980, 1984 b). Because phytoplankton species with similar functiona...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring the 2001 – 2002 {{hydrological}} cycle, 8, 000 tons P year− 1 (44 % as particulate phosphorus) {{originating from}} the Seine basin entered the Seine estuary. P content in suspended sediments (SS) is 2. 9 g P kg− 1 (80 % as inorganic form) at Poses (the upstream {{limit of the}} Seine estuary). During the transfer from Poses to Caudebec (the limit of saline water intrusion), Particulate Inorganic Phosphorus (PIP) in SS decreases by 40 % whereas Particulate Organic Phosphorus (POP) remains stable. This decrease is explained {{as the result of}} (i) a dilution by SS poorer in P, originating from storage zones (mudflats) within the estuary, and (ii) a loss of P by sedimentation, especially in the Rouen harbour where 15 % to 20 % of SS are yearly trapped and extracted. Downstream, in the turbidity maximum of the estuary, P content in SS is twice as low as at Poses (1. 5 g P kg− 1, 70 % as inorganic form). PIP content is fairly homogeneous both vertically and throughout an annual survey. On the other hand, POP varies by season. Higher POP content is observed during <b>vernal</b> <b>period</b> with phytoplankton accumulation. In a salinity gradient from 0 to 30 (PSS 78), PIP content further decreases by 30 %. POP does not vary much in this gradient, leading to the assumption that PIP is submitted to desorption in response to the dilution by marine waters (poor in orthophosphates). Using 32 P isotopic method, we establish a mathematical formulation of P exchangeable between the suspended solid and water phases of the Seine estuary. Particulate P in the turbidity maximum zone is shown to represent a possible source of dissolved P, available for algal growth in the Seine Bight. Instead of playing a role of nutrient retention, the turbidity maximum zone of the Seine estuary could favour coastal eutrophication...|$|E
40|$|At Ancon, Peru, {{simultaneous}} {{observations of}} 1550 -MHz and 136 -MHz {{signals from the}} ATS 5 and Intelsat- 1 spacecraft showed ionospheric fading as great as 27 db at 136 MHz and 6 db at 1550 MHZ. The observations were made on 48 days during the 1970 autumnal and 1971 <b>vernal</b> equinox <b>periods.</b> Comparison of the two frequencies, in respect to rates and depths of fades, is made. Statistical distributions of the received signal levels during ionospheric scintillation occurrences are presented which may be of use to communications system engineers with operational requirements in the equatorial regions. The distributions show that during expected periods of scintillation, the L band signal typically falls 1. 1 db below the median for 1. 0 percent of the time, and the VHF signal falls 11. 5 db below the median for 1. 0 percent of the time...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were made}} {{into the body}} condition, energy {{metabolite}} and endocrinal changes of male green turtles Chelonia mydas prior to and during their <b>vernal</b> breeding <b>period</b> in the southern Great Barrier Reef. Prior to migration, breeding males exhibited a higher body condition index than non-breeding males. However, during the migratory reproductive period, breeding males lost significant body condition. Concurrent with these physical changes, breeding males showed a reduction in plasma triglycerides and an increased level of total protein towards the mid- to late breeding period. The plasma steroids corticosterone and testosterone increased and decreased, respectively, during the migratory/breeding phase. The pattern of change in body condition and physiology allude to a high-activity fasting period during the migratory/breeding phase of the male green turtle's life history. These marked physiological events during breeding suggest a proximate basis for terminating seasonal reproductive events, and a potential basis for phenotypic variation in male reproductive tactics...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{altering}} {{the timing and}} duration of the <b>vernal</b> window, a <b>period</b> that {{marks the end of}} winter and the start of the growing season when rapid transitions in ecosystem energy, water, nutrient, and carbon dynamics take place. Research on this period typically captures only a portion of the ecosystem in transition and focuses largely on the dates by which the system wakes up. Previous work has not addressed lags between transitions that represent delays in energy, water, nutrient, and carbon flows. The objectives of this study were to establish the sequence of physical and biogeochemical transitions and lags during the <b>vernal</b> window <b>period</b> and to understand how climate change may alter them. We synthesized observations from a statewide sensor network in New Hampshire, USA, that concurrently monitored climate, snow, soils, and streams over a three-year period and supplemented these observations with climate reanalysis data, snow data assimilation model output, and satellite spectral data. We found that some of the transitions that occurred within the vernal window were sequential, with air temperatures warming prior to snow melt, which preceded forest canopy closure. Other transitions were simultaneous with one another and had zero-length lags, such as snowpack disappearance, rapid soil warming, and peak stream discharge. We modeled lags as a function of both winter coldness and snow depth, both of which are expected to decline with climate change. Warmer winters with less snow resulted in longer lags and a more protracted vernal window. This lengthening of individual lags and of the entire vernal window carries important consequences for the thermodynamics and biogeochemistry of ecosystems, both during the winter-to-spring transition and {{throughout the rest of the}} year...|$|R
40|$|Granulosa-theca cell tumors (GTCTs) {{are able}} to secrete {{variable}} amounts of sex steroids and immunoreactive inhibin (ir-INH). Although the pituitary appears {{to be affected by}} the presence of a GTCT, pituitary responsiveness to exogenous GnRH has not been examined. The aims of the present study were to: (i) assess the plasma hormone concentrations of ir-INH, gonadotropins and sex steroids in eight mares with GTCT and (ii) assess the responsiveness of pituitary gonadotroph cells to exogenous GnRH stimulus both before and after tumor removal. In seven mares, the contralateral ovary was firm, small and inactive. Histopathological observations of the tumors confirmed the presumptive diagnosis of a GTCT. Four mares, judged to be in <b>vernal</b> transition <b>period</b> (n = 2) and in the breeding season (n = 2), were used as controls. A single intravenous injection of 40 mu g of GnRH agonist was given to each mare and blood samples were collected every 15 min from 2 h before to 4 h after injection. In four GTCT mares, this procedure was repeated 20 (n = 2) and 90 (n = 2) days after tumors removal. All plasma samples were analyzed for concentrations of ir-INH, LH, FSH, estradiol- 17 beta (E- 2) testosterone (T) by RIA and progesterone (P) by EIA. Results showed that E- 2 levels were significantly higher (P < 0. 001) in control animals compared to E- 2 levels in GTCT mares before and after surgery. P and T concentrations were not statistically different between the groups. Baseline levels of ir-INH were greater (P < 0. 05) in GTCT mares before surgery than in control mares, and decreased to undetectable levels after neoplasia ablation. Baseline FSH did not differ between control and GTCT animals either before or after the ovaries were removed. LH baseline values appeared to be higher for affected mares, but the difference was not statistically significant. Maximum release (MR) and area under the gonadotrophin release curve (AUC) after the GnRH challenge for both the gonadotrophins were similar between the groups. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was {{establishing}} the trophic level of water from Ciric lacustrine complex, based on the algological (phytoplankton) and biochemical criterion (chlorophyll a). The researches were carried out on water samples assayed from 5 stations (Dorobanţi, Aroneanu, Ciric I, Ciric II and Veneţia) during the <b>vernal</b> and summer <b>period</b> of the year 2007. The results reveal the fact that the phytoplankton structure reflects significant differences regarding the trophic level of each of the 5 lakes studied and respectively, the different degree of their pollution. Also, the investigations carried out emphasized the fact that when interpreting the water quality based on the algological criterion must be taken into consideration both the quantitative general data, and the distribution of the great group of algae(Cyanophyta, Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and Euglenophyta), their ecophysiological role, the dominant species and the global level of the algae diversity. The analyses of phytoplankton regarding the total number of samples/ml and through the dominant species have emphasized the mesotrophic character of the 5 lakes and the significant pollution of Dorobanţi lake, in the last period of the year and of Ciric lake II in the entire year. The data regarding the quantity of chlorophyll a signal the meso-eutrophic character of the ecosystems investigated and attest that Aroneanu and Dorobanţi lakes are the most polluted ones. According to the season, the concentration of the chlorophyll a also reveals fluctuations with oligotrophic character (in June month - Ciric II) and oligo-mesotrophic (in July and August months- Dorobanţi) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii is a {{strongly}} migratory race of white-crowned sparrow that exhibits a marked deposition of fat during the <b>vernal</b> migratory <b>period.</b> The physiological basis for fat deposition {{is a positive}} energy balance which results from a photo-periodically induced hyperphagia. Simultaneously with the increased caloric intake there is an adjustment of the intermediary metabolism so that the excess calories are deposited as fat rather than glycogen. The possible mechanism by which the intermediary metabolism is altered {{was the subject of}} this investigation. It was surmised that a photoperiodically stimulated change in the feeding pattern, along with hyperphagia, might induce the metabolic alterations necessary for lipogenesis and fat deposition. This idea was prompted by investigations with force-fed rats and rats limited to a two-hour feeding period per day. Ten immature Z. 1. gambelii were confined individually to small breeding cages modified to measure perch and feeding activity. The feeding activity was recorded by means of a mechanically operated feeder which electrically activated a pen on an Esterline-Angus recorder whenever the bird placed its head in the feeder to obtain food. The motor activity was registered similarly with each movement of a perch-activated microswitch. Recordings of the feeding and perch activity were made continuously throughout the premigratory and migratory periods of March, April and May. During the experimental period the birds were weighed {{at least twice a week}} with observations of molt being recorded. Prenuptial molt, fat deposition and Zugunruhe occurred essentially at the same time and magnitude as previously reported for caged and wild white-crowned sparrows. The median date for the onset of fat deposition was determined as April 11 ± 1 day. With fat deposition the mean body weight of six birds increased from 26. 5 grams to 34. 3 grams in 13 days. Prenuptial molt occurred at maximum intensity during the first ten days of April. The median date for the onset of Zugunruhe was determined as April 17. The mean daily feeding and perch activity of six birds were determined for five one-week periods chosen in relationship to fat deposition. The feeding activity was analyzed by the frequency, the number of feeding periods in each half-hour per bird per day, and by the duration, the total number of minutes spent at the feeder in each half-hour per bird per day. The perch activity was presented as the number of activity units per half-hour per bird per day. The results indicated a general feeding pattern with two phases: a morning phase characterized by numerous trips to the feeder of short duration interrupted by the high motor activity of the bird, and an afternoon phase distinguished from the morning phase by low perch activity and relatively less frequent feeding periods of longer duration. The feeding day was initiated almost invariably at the beginning of the morning civil twilight. The termination of the feeding day, before and after hyperphagia, was relatively constant and somewhat independent of the increasing evening photoperiod. During hyperphagia the last feeding period occurred gradually later for each succeeding day. Hyperphagia was evident in the feeding patterns of the weeks before and during fat deposition. For the week prior to fat deposition, the duration increased to 3. 8 minutes/half-hour/bird/day and 112 minutes/bird/day from 3. 6 minutes/half-hour/bird/day and 97 minutes/bird/day of the preceding week. The duration during the week of fat deposition increased to 4. 7 minutes/half-hour/bird/day and 142 minutes/bird/day. The frequency showed similar results. The mean environmental temperature increased for each week. During hyperphagia no change in the over-all feeding pattern was indicated from those of other weeks. Under the conditions of this investigation, it was concluded that there appears to be no change in the food intake pattern of Z. 1, gambelii which can be construed as a mechanism for inducing metabolic alterations necessary for vernal fat deposition...|$|R
