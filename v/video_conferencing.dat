The launch function was marked by the submission of the script, songs and lyrics. Principal photography was scheduled to begin in mid-December that year, but commenced slightly earlier. Vikram shot for the film simultaneously with Samurai (2002). When Kalabhavan Mani was hesitant in accepting the film due to other commitments in Malayalam, shooting was re-scheduled to film his scenes first. Saran persuaded Mani to allot dates for twelve days to complete his scenes. Since Mani was a mimicry artist, Saran asked him to exhibit his talents; Mani aped the behaviour of a few animals and Saran chose among them, which were added to the film.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Peer-to-peer {{computing}} and multipoint <b>video</b> <b>conference</b> {{are both}} gaining popularity with the explosive development of Internet. Although {{there are many}} existing <b>video</b> <b>conference</b> systems in the world, these solutions are all centralized {{and none of them}} can run without MCU (Multipoint Control Unit). The centralized nature usually causes single-point failure and does not make efficient use of network resources. Moreover, many IM (Instant Messenger) applications begin to support point-to-point <b>video</b> <b>conference.</b> However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, none of them can support multipoint <b>video</b> <b>conference.</b> In this paper, a peer-to-peer multipoint <b>video</b> <b>conference</b> system “PipeSeeU”, which is based on existing IM applications, is proposed to solve the problem mentioned above. 1...|$|R

Rainsy, {{the leader of the}} SRP, rejected his proposal. When the election campaign began in June 2008, Ranariddh, though not able to enter the country, raised issues such as border disputes with Cambodia's neighbours, illegal logging, and promised to lower petrol prices. When voting took place in July, the NRP won two parliamentary seats. Immediately after the election, the NRP joined the SRP and the HRP in charging the Election Commission with irregularities. The NRP subsequently dropped their accusations, after Hun Sen brokered a secret deal with Ranariddh which allowed the latter to return from exile, in exchange for the NRP's recognition of the election results.|$|E

25|$|The main {{university}} library {{is located in}} the middle of the main campus. It houses approximately 1,265,000 books and over 13km of archives and manuscripts. The main library has recently been remodelled and now houses new services to support Research and Teaching practice and collaboration between departments. The Wolfson Research Exchange opened in October 2008 and provides collaboration spaces (both physical and virtual), seminar rooms, conference facilities and study areas for Postgraduate Research students. The Teaching Grid, which opened in 2008, is a flexible space which allows teaching staff to try out new technologies and techniques. Adjacent to the main library building is the Modern Records Centre, a sizeable archive collection, including the UK's largest industrial relations collection. The Central Library Service also runs the Learning Grids, reference libraries which are accompanied by technology rich study space, providing access to <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> facilities, smart boards and networked PCs. These are currently based in University House, the Rootes Building and Leamington Spa Town Hall. The two learning grids located on Main Campus provide study space for approximately 600 students. In addition, the Central Library Service also operates the BioMed Grid, a reference library and study space specifically for Life Science students. An additional study space, The Postgraduate Hub, is also maintained for use by Postgraduates in Senate House.|$|E
