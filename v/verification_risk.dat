We characterize the optimal contract and show that (i) the contractual payoff in verification states varies by states in accord with risk aversion and probability belief of the borrower and lender, and (ii) teh verification region may consist of many intervals. Under these general assumptions, verification states are not necessarily interpreted as "default" states.

The decisive {{factor in this}} regard is that risk aversion requires to consider further sources of risk the lenders are exposed to. The main results derived in a setting of asymmetric information – the payment obligation of the optimal incentive compatible contract increases due to risk aversion of lenders which is reinforced by the introduction of a further source of risk – are shown to be in line with the results from the industrial organization approach of banking. Moreover, the result of the present paper are more general than the ones from the industrial organization approach.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of a binary diagnostic test is usually {{measured in terms}} of its sensitivity and its specificity, or through positive and negative predictive values. Another way to describe the validity of a binary diagnostic test is the risk of error and the kappa coefficient of the risk of error. The risk of error is the average loss that is caused when incorrectly classifying a non-diseased or a diseased patient, and the kappa coefficient of the risk of error {{is a measure of the}} agreement between the diagnostic test and the gold standard. In the presence of partial verification of the disease, the disease status of some patients is unknown, and therefore the evaluation of a diagnostic test cannot be carried out through the traditional method. In this paper, we have deduced the maximum likelihood estimators and variances of the risk of error and of the kappa coefficient of the risk of error in the presence of partial verification of the disease. Simulation experiments have been carried out to study the effect of the verification probabilities on the coverage of the confidence interval of the kappa coefficient.

40|$|As ship systems {{become more}} complex, with an {{increasing}} number of safety-critical functions, many interconnected subsystems, tight integration to other systems, and a large amount of potential failure modes, several industry parties have identified the need for improved methods for managing the verification and examination efforts of such complex systems. Such needs are even more prominent now that the marine and offshore industries are targeting more activities and operations in the Arctic environment. In this paper, a set of requirements and a method for verification and examination management are proposed for allocating examination efforts to selected subsystems. The method is based on a definition of a <b>verification</b> <b>risk</b> function for a given system topology and given requirements. The marginal verification risks for the subsystems may then be evaluated, so that examination efforts for the subsystem can be allocated. Two cases of requirements and systems are used to demonstrate the proposed method. The method establishes a systematic relationship between the verification loss, the logic system topology, verification method performance, examination stop criterion, the required examination effort, and a proposed sequence of examinations to reach the examination stop criterion.

40|$|The {{development}} of novel radiofrequency (RF) coils for human ultrahigh-field (≥ 7 T), non-proton and body applications {{is an active}} field of research in many MR groups. Any RF coil must meet the strict requirements for safe application on humans with respect to mechanical and electrical safety, {{as well as the}} specific absorption rate (SAR) limits. For this purpose, regulations such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard for medical electrical equipment, vendor-suggested test specifications for third party coils and custom-developed test procedures exist. However, for higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths in ultrahigh-field MR, the RF fields may become extremely inhomogeneous in biological tissue and the risk of localized areas with elevated power deposition increases, which is usually not considered by existing safety testing and operational procedures. In addition, important aspects, such as risk analysis and comprehensive electrical performance and safety tests, are often neglected. In this article, we describe the guidelines used in our institution for electrical and mechanical safety tests, SAR simulation and <b>verification,</b> <b>risk</b> analysis and operational procedures, including coil documentation, user training and regular quality assurance testing, which help to recognize and eliminate safety issues during coil design and operation. Although the procedure is generally applicable to all field strengths, specific requirements with regard to SAR-related safety and electrical performance at ultrahigh-field are considered. The protocol describes an internal procedure and does not reflect consensus among a large number of research groups, but rather aims to stimulate further discussion related to minimum coil safety standards. Furthermore, it may help other research groups to establish their own procedures. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

On the contrary, measurements of pollen on leaves reflect potential exposure directly, transparently and unambiguously. This has been realised for many years by authors such as Darvas et al. [6], Gathmann et al. [7], Schuppener et al. [8] and Masetti et al. [9]. More recently, the meticulous approach of Lang et al.

40|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of an effective safety program is the recognition and control of hazards before mishaps or failures occur. Conducting potentially hazardous tests necessitates a thorough hazard analysis in order to protect our personnel from injury and our equipment from damage. The purpose of this hazard analysis is to define and address the potential hazards and controls associated with the Z 1 Suit Port Test in Chamber B located in building 32, and to provide the applicable team of personnel with the documented results. It is imperative that each member of the team be familiar with the hazards and controls associated with his/her particular tasks, assignments, and activities while interfacing with facility test systems, equipment, and hardware. The goal of this hazard analysis is to identify all hazards that have the potential to harm personnel and/or damage facility equipment, flight hardware, property, or harm the environment.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the risks of the information systems. The simplified classification of risks with the specific examples is described {{in the first part of}} the paper. We can divide the risks relating to the information systems into two different groups accordingly. The first group is concerned with the components of the information systems. The second group of risks is connected with their exposures. There are both the unconscious and intentional risks from this point of view. The second part of this paper is engaged in the characteristics of the selected methods that are possible to employ in the risk evaluation of the information system. Because of the fact that the users of the information systems are not acquainted with the statistical methods the simplest demonstration of the formulation of the probability of occurrence and the impact of the risk event in the form of the scale system is offered for them.

The methodology was based on the methodologies outlined in the National Greenhouse Office guide “Climate Change: Impacts and Risk Management: A Guide for Business and Government, and for Health Impact Assessment. In brief the project was conducted in three phases incorporating two half-day workshops and an internal risk assessment. The phases were a.
