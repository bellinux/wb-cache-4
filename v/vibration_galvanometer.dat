I now {{removed the}} helices with their soft iron cores, and {{replaced}} them by two flat helices wound upon card board, each containing forty-two feet of silked copper wire, and having no associated iron. Otherwise the arrangement was as before, and exceedingly sensible; {{for a very}} slight motion of the magnet between the helices produced an abundant <b>vibration</b> of the <b>galvanometer</b> needle.|$|R

The effects obtained by him have been referred by Messrs. Babbage and Herschel to the same cause as that considered as influential in Arago's experiment[B]; but {{it would be interesting to}} know how far the electric current which might be produced in the experiment would account for the deflexion of the needle. The mere inversion of a copper wire six or seven times near the poles of the magnet, and isochronously with the <b>vibrations</b> of the <b>galvanometer</b> needle connected with it, was sufficient to make the needle vibrate through an arc of 60° or 70°. The rotation of a copper shell would perhaps decide the point, and might even throw light upon the more permanent, though somewhat analogous effects obtained by Mr. Christie.|$|R
6000|$|... 1711. I {{arranged}} two magneto-electric helices {{with iron}} cores end to end, {{but with an}} interval of an inch and three quarters between them, in which interval was placed the end or pole of a bar magnet. It is evident, that on moving the magnetic pole from one core towards the other, a current would tend to form in both helices, in the one because of the lowering, {{and in the other}} because of the strengthening of the magnetism induced in the respective soft iron cores. The helices were connected together, and also with a galvanometer, so that these two currents should coincide in direction, and tend by their joint force to deflect the needle of the instrument. The whole arrangement was so effective and delicate, that moving the magnetic pole about the eighth of an inch to and fro two or three times, in periods equal to those required for the <b>vibrations</b> of the <b>galvanometer</b> needle, was sufficient to cause considerable vibration in the latter; thus showing readily the consequence of strengthening the influence of the magnet on the one core and helix, and diminishing it on the other.|$|R
50|$|A <b>vibration</b> <b>galvanometer</b> {{is a type}} of mirror galvanometer, {{usually with}} a coil {{suspended}} in the gap of a magnet or with a permanent magnet suspended in the field of an electromagnet. The natural oscillation frequency of the moving parts is carefully tuned to a specific frequency; commonly 50 or 60 Hz. Higher frequencies up to 1 kHz are possible. Since the frequency depends on the mass of the moving elements, high frequency vibration galvanometers are very small with light coils and mirrors. The tuning of the <b>vibration</b> <b>galvanometer</b> is done by adjusting the tension of the suspension spring.|$|E
40|$|Inertia of the {{electric}} carrier in metals. — Although Tolman and Stewart had apparently demonstrated that the carriers in metals have approximately the same ratios of mass to charge as an electron, it was desirable to verify this result and if possible obtain a more accurate value for m/e by using an entirely different method. An oscillating apparatus was constructed, consisting of a copper cylinder 91 / 8 ″ long, 4 ″ outside diameter and 3 ″ inside diameter, attached to a brass torsion rod {{in such a manner}} that it could be oscillated about its axis with a frequency of about 20 cycles per second. Surrounding this copper cylinder was a coil, containing about 60 miles of No. 38 copper wire, which acted as the secondary of a transformer, and was connected to a <b>vibration</b> <b>galvanometer</b> through a specially designed three-stage amplifier. The tendency of the electrons in the oscillating copper cylinder to lag behind because of their inertia leads to an electromotive force, the effects of which were finally measured by the deflection of the <b>vibration</b> <b>galvanometer,</b> tuned to the frequency of the mechanical oscillations. This galvanometer deflection was then compared with that produced by the known electromotive force accompanying a transverse oscillation of the cylinder across the earth's magnetic field. The apparatus was mounted on a massive concrete pier in a special location 150 yards from the nearest electrical circuits, was constructed without the use of magnetic materials, and was driven by compressed air. The axis of the oscillating cylinder was set parallel to the earth's magnetic field to reduce accidental effects. The apparatus avoids the direct electric connections between moving and stationary parts, and the sudden stopping of a coil of wire, with the attendant chance of buckling and slipping of the wire, which were present in the apparatus used by Tolman and Stewart. The fact that the <b>vibration</b> <b>galvanometer</b> will respond only to the frequency of the desired effect is also important in eliminating accidental effects. Mass of carrier in copper. The average of 86 determinations of m/e is 5. 2 × 10 ^- 8. However since the means of the first 42 determinations and of the last 44, obtained with the cylinder earthed only through the concrete pier and specially earthed, respectively, are 5. 97 and 4. 35, and since the corrections for zero amplitude were large, these preliminary results are not regarded as demonstrating a difference between the ratio m/e of the carrier in copper and of an election in free space, 5. 66 × 10 ^- 8...|$|E
40|$|Nature of the experiments. —An {{apparatus}} {{similar to}} that of Tolman, Karrer and Guernsey, in which a copper cylinder is oscillated around its axis and the current due to the lag of the electrons in the cylinder detected by means of a secondary of many turns of fine wire connected through an amplifier with a tuned <b>vibration</b> <b>galvanometer,</b> has been used for a further study of the inertia of the electric carrier in metals. The method has been improved, among other ways by arranging to measure the direction, phase, and magnitude of the alternating current produced by the acceleration instead of merely determining the amplitude of the effect, as was done in the earlier experiments. The null method of balancing out the electromotive force of interest, introduced for this purpose, also had the advantage of eliminating the previous uncertain correction for the "zero effect. " A thorough study of the effect of the earth's field on the moving cylinder was also made, which has not been previously done. Results. —The effect of the earth's field in inducing currents in the moving apparatus was found to be in accord with that theoretically predicted, and it was satisfactorily demonstrated that this effect is eliminated when the cylinder is set parallel to the field and the coil set parallel to the cylinder. The final best value for the electromotive force produced by the acceleration was found to have an amplitude 19...|$|E
40|$|Method {{of testing}} {{equivalence}} of a mechanically osciallted charge to an alternating current. —The apparatus {{consisted of a}} cylinder approximately 4 inches in diameter by 9 inches long, constructed of insulating material, but coated on the out-side with a thin sheet of copper foil which could be charged to potentials which varied from 1400 to 2600 volts. The cylinder was arranged to oscillate around its axis at frequencies {{in the neighborhood of}} 20 cycles per second through an amplitude of something over 180 °. It was surrounded by an "effect coil," having 260, 772 turns of fine wire, which was connected through a three-stage amplifier with a tuned <b>vibration</b> <b>galvanometer</b> for detecting the electromotive force which would presumably be induced by the oscillation of the charged cylinder. The "effect coil" was shielded by a grounded covering of sheet copper, the inner portion of this covering and the coating of copper foil on the cylinder thus forming the two plates of an electrostatic condenser. Connected in series with the "effect coil" was a similar "compensating coil" having the same number of turns but connected in opposition so as to neutralize the effect of external magnetic disturbances. The electromotive force induced in the "effect coil" was measured by balancing out {{with the help of an}} auxiliary current flowing in a current sheet in such a way as to induce an opposing electromotive force in the "compensating coil," this auxiliary current having the same frequency as the electromotive force to be balanced and being adjustable as to phase and amplitude. The apparatus was calibrated by replacing the charged oscillating cylinder by a current sheet of known dimensions and carrying a known current. Accidental effects coming from a number of sources were studied and as far as possible reduced or eliminated. Results of the test and conclusions. —A total of 64 effect runs were made, together with the necessary blank runs for correcting for the small residual effect. The runs were made in 16 different groups of 4 runs each under a given set of conditions. The changes in conditions consisted in changes in the sign and magnitude of the potential applied to the cylinder, changes in the method of connecting the "effect coil" and "compensating coil" to the grid and filament of the amplifier, changes in the neutral position around which the cylinder was oscillated, and change to a different frequency of oscillation. The phase of the effect obtained depended on the conditions of operation in the way predicted by theory. It was changed through 180 ° by a reversal of the sign of the applied potential, depended on the connections used and on the frequency of oscillation in the manner predicted from the calibration runs, and was independent of the neutral position around which the cylinder was oscillated. The magnitude of the effect obtained was also in agreement with theory. It was closely proportional to the potential applied to the cylinder and to the velocity of motion of the cylinder, and had very approximately the absolute value predicted from the measured capacity of the cylinder, the applied potential and the velocity of motion. The result of the experiment is to show that a mechanically oscillated electrostatic charge of electricity surrounds itself with an alternating magnetic field, accompanied at right angles by an alternating electric field capable of producing an alternating electromotive force in a suitably placed secondary. It further shows that at right angles to both the magnetic and electric fields there must be a Poynting-vector field corresponding to the observed transmission of energy to the secondary, and that these quantities all have the magnitude and time dependence predicted by electromagnetic theory. The present experiment must be regarded as testing a more extended portion of the fundamental basis of electromagnetic theory than the original Rowland experiment, and as giving a more clear-cut demonstration of the equivalence of a mechanically oscillated charge of electricity to an ordinary alternating current than have previous experiments...|$|E
