Because it tracks {{conditions on the}} failure plane, it also provides close fits for the post failure region of sensitive clays and silts something that other theories {{are not able to}} do. Additionally DSSM explains key relationships in soil mechanics that to date have simply been taken for granted, for example, why normalized undrained peak shear strengths vary with the log of the over consolidation ratio and why stress–strain curves normalize with the initial effective confining stress; and why in one-dimensional consolidation the <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> must vary with the log of the effective vertical stress, why the end-of-primary curve is unique for static load increments, and why the ratio of the creep value Cα to the compression index Cc must be approximately constant {{for a wide range of}} soils..|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} <b>void</b> <b>ratio,</b> the soil {{material}} can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then cyclic liquefaction can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress is not possible to occur, then cyclic mobility takes place.|$|E

2500|$|But in {{addition}} to friction, soil derives significant shear resistance from interlocking of grains. [...] If the grains are densely packed, the grains tend to spread apart from {{each other as they}} are subject to shear strain. The expansion of the particle matrix due to shearing was called dilatancy by Osborne Reynolds. If one considers the energy required to shear an assembly of particles there is energy input by the shear force, T, moving a distance, x and there is also energy input by the normal force, N, as the sample expands a distance, y. [...] Due to the extra energy required for the particles to dilate against the confining pressures, dilatant soils have a greater peak strength than contractive soils. Furthermore, as dilative soil grains dilate, they become looser (their <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> increases), and their rate of dilation decreases until they reach a critical <b>void</b> <b>ratio.</b> Contractive soils become denser as they shear, and their rate of contraction decreases until they reach a critical <b>void</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The shear {{strength}} and stiffness of soil determines {{whether or not}} soil will be stable or {{how much it will}} deform. Knowledge of the strength is necessary to determine if a slope will be stable, if a building or bridge might settle too far into the ground, and the limiting pressures on a retaining wall. It is important to distinguish between failure of a soil element and the failure of a geotechnical structure (e.g., a building foundation, slope or retaining wall); some soil elements may reach their peak strength prior to failure of the structure. Different criteria can be used to define the [...] "{{shear strength}}" [...] and the [...] "yield point" [...] for a soil element from a stress–strain curve. One may define the peak shear strength as the peak of a stress–strain curve, or the shear strength at critical state as the value after large strains when the shear resistance levels off.

40|$|Field {{compaction}} of sands {{usually involves}} different equipments with the compaction energy varying significantly. The relative density {{is the better}} indicator for specifying the compaction of granular soil. If the relative density can be correlated simply by any index property of the granular soil, it can be more useful in the field. The relative density is {{defined in terms of}} <b>voids</b> <b>ratio.</b> It is well known that the minimum and maximum <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> depend on the mean grain size. However, there is no direct relation available for the <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> in terms of grain size. Therefore, in this dissertation, the effect of mean grain size on the relative density of sand has been studied at different compaction energies. In order to arrive at the above, fifty five number of clean sands having D 50 ranges from 0. 34 to 2. 6 mm collected from different river bed of Orissa have been tested in the laboratory. The various index properties like grain specific gravity, grain size distribution of all the samples have been determined. The minimum and maximum <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> have been determined. For determining minimum voids ratio; both wet and dry method have been adopted. The <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> corresponding to energy level of standard, modified, reduced standard, and reduced modified Proctor tests have been correlated with mean grain size and thus the simple nonlinear empirical relations have been developed. Similarly, the relative densities corresponding to the energy level of above mentioned Proctor tests also have been correlated with mean grain size to arrive at simple empirical equations. The percentage deviation of the relative density estimated by the proposed method is in the range of ± 5 % of the measured value. The above correlations of relative densities will be helpful for the design specifications in the field...|$|R

The general theory of Dewar for particle mixtures and {{the implementation of the}} <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> diagrams of Powers in this theory are explained. The basic water demand of the concrete mixture is derived from the theory of particle mixtures and a consistency prediction model is used to calculate the water demand of the concrete mixture. By using the <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> diagrams of Powers, the theory of Dewar for particle mixtures, and a systematic follow up of the parameters of the raw materials, a reliable water prediction model can be obtained. Consequently this model enables to make accurate consistency and strength predictions, which can be used in mix design and mix proportioning in order to steer the concrete production. In this contribution a case study is provided, based on data from Belgian ready mixed concrete plants. The influence of the variation of the mean size and the <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> of the cements, fine and coarse aggregates as well as the variation in grain size distributions on the water demand of the concrete is analyzed.
