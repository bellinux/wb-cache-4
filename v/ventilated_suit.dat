40|$|The {{vortex tube}} has no moving parts and its {{makes it an}} {{attractive}} form of refrigerator when a source of compressed air is available. The drawback is that this device has a low efficiency. The proposed application involves passing compressed air, from a jet engine, through a precooler and a vortex tube to the <b>ventilated</b> <b>suit.</b> Investigations show that {{the temperature of the}} air entering the <b>ventilated</b> <b>suit</b> is decreased as engine compression ratio and precooler efficiency are increased. Increase of the aircraft's forward speed will result in decreased cooling until a maxim= Mach number is reached above which the <b>ventilated</b> <b>suit</b> cooling requirement, of 115 o F, can no longer be satisfied. The maximum permissible Mach number, for an aircraft flying at sea level under the maximum ambient tropical temperature of 45 °C, has been calculated over a range of compression ratios, 3 - 15 and precooler efficiencies, 75 - 100 per cent. These results are plotted in figures 6 and 7. It is found that a practical application requires a precooler efficiency of not less than. 80. per cent...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, ILC Dover, LP, {{developed}} a special garment, the Demilitarization Protective Ensemble (DPE), {{to fulfill the}} U.S. Army’s need for an off-the-shelf, positive pressure, totally encapsulating suit for use by maintenance personnel at a chemical weapons site. The DPE was delivered to the Army in 1979 and is still currently in daily use, with over 700 recorded entries into a [...] "hot" [...] environment and a perfect safety record. From the technology used in production of the DPE, ILC developed a PPPS {{to be used for}} commercial applications. Delta Protection, a subsidiary of French company Bacou-Dalloz, designed a Michelin Man-inspired suit in 2003, known in the United States at that time as French BSL 4 Suit. In July 2007, the CDC purchased 30 Delta Protection suits to be used in BSL-4, and called them [...] "orange suits". On August 20, 2007, Bacou-Dalloz became Sperian Protection. The same suit design became part of Sperian Protection <b>ventilated</b> <b>suits</b> ("White Suits"). On September 15, 2010, Sperian Protection became part of Honeywell. The product is now called Honeywell BSL 4 suits. The Chemturion series is a series of multi-use, totally encapsulating PPPSs, currently used by Public Health Canada, Boston University, AI Signal Research, USAMRIID, the CDC, and many industrial companies such as DuPont, Dow, and Georgia Pacific.|$|R
50|$|Electrical cables {{are mounted}} on the right abdomen of the suit; on the left abdomen there are {{separate}} hoses for air and oxygen. Normally, an electric blower <b>ventilates</b> the <b>suit</b> with cabin air through the larger hose {{at the rate of}} 150 L per minute. If the cabin pressure drops below , the air supply is automatically replaced with oxygen from pressurised bottles. at a rate of 22 L per minute. Both air and oxygen exhaust through the blue pressure relief valve at the centre of the chest; this valve also regulates the pressure of the suit.|$|R
40|$|A {{device is}} {{reported}} for regulating the pneumatic pressure in a <b>ventilated</b> space <b>suit</b> {{relative to the}} pressure imposed on the suit when being worn by a person underwater to simulate space environment for testing and experimentation. A box unit located on the chest area of the suit comprises connections for suit air supply and return lines and carries a regulator valve that stabilizes the air pressure differential between the {{inside and outside of}} the suit. The valve and suit pressure is controlled by the suit occupant and the valve includes a mechanism for quickly dumping the suit pressure in case of emergency. Pressure monitoring and relief devices are also included in the box unit...|$|R
40|$|When a reactor {{is closed}} down the air {{temperature}} in the containment falls from about 55 °C to ambient {{temperature in the}} course of 3 - 4 days. Early repair and maintenance work, hence, has to be carried out in hot conditions. A common temperature during most of maintenance work is around 25 - 30 °C. Workers have to wear protective clothing according to the demands for each contamination zone. Heat stress on the individual worker is determined by climate, protective clothing and work intensity. Experiments with four subjects were carried out at 40 and 50 °C with the <b>ventilated</b> Mururoa <b>suit</b> (465 l/min). The suit allows light and moderate work for several hours with only limited heat strain...|$|R
