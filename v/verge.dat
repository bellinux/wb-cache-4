40|$|Effect of {{different}} mowing regimes on butterflies and diurnal moths on road <b>verges.</b> — In northern and central Europe road <b>verges</b> offer alternative habitats for declining plant and invertebrate species of semi– natural grasslands. The quality of road <b>verges</b> as habitats depends on several factors, {{of which the}} mowing regime {{is one of the}} easiest to modify. In this study we compared the Lepidoptera communities on road <b>verges</b> that underwent three different mowing regimes regarding the timing and intensity of mowing; mowing in mid–summer, mowing in late summer, and partial mowing (a narrow strip next to the road). A total of 12, 174 individuals and 107 species of Lepidoptera were recorded. The mid–summer mown <b>verges</b> had lower species richness and abundance of butterflies and lower species richness and diversity of diurnal moths compared to the late summer and partially mown <b>verges.</b> By delaying the annual mowing until late summer or promoting mosaic–like mowing regimes, such as partial mowing, the quality of road <b>verges</b> as habitats for butterflies and diurnal moths can be improved...|$|R
40|$|In a 2772 km {{survey in}} western France, we {{compared}} the relative abundance and activity of diurnal raptors along motorway <b>verges</b> and secondary roads to those in open cropland, during dierent seasons and hours of the day. Motorway <b>verges,</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent secondary road <b>verges,</b> were used significantly more than adjacent areas by buzzards (Buteo buteo), kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and black kites (Milvus migrans), but not by harriers (Circus aeruginosus, C. cyaneus, C. pygargus). There was a sea-sonal shift in the use of roadsides by buzzards and kestrels, with a high use of motorway <b>verges</b> in winter and a low use in summer. Although kestrels and buzzards clearly used <b>verges</b> for hunting, their abundance along roads was not directly related to the relative abundance of small mammals. The supply of perching sites, allowing a less energy-demanding hunting behaviour than flight-hunting, and the width of the <b>verges,</b> appeared important factors in the attractiveness of roadsides for these species.

5|$|Jack <b>Verge</b> went to Sydney University in 1900 and for {{the first}} two years played fullback for the University second rugby team. In his second year, he began to be noticed by the rugby press, both for his {{defensive}} play and kicking skills.

5|$|The {{first game}} was against Otago University on 10 September, which the home side won easily, 21–0. Jack <b>Verge</b> {{was the only}} one of the team to play well, {{preventing}} the home side scoring through his tackling. For the return match on 15 September, the younger <b>Verge</b> was brought in at five-eighth, which helped strengthen the team. No points were scored in the first half, although the visitors came close to getting a try but were held up on the line. In the second half, Otago scored six points to Sydney's three, and again came away the winners. <b>Verge</b> missed scoring from a penalty kick, which hit the crossbar.|$|E

He was awarded a Fellowship at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and played rugby for Edinburgh University in 1908. Verge's brother, meanwhile, continued to play for University and also played fullback for Metropolitan against the Anglo-Welsh touring team in Sydney on 15 August 1908, which the tourists won 13–16 with a try in the final moments, and against the Ponsonby team on tour from New Zealand in August 1909. On his return from Europe, <b>Verge</b> practised as a doctor in Macquarie Street before joining the army, and did not play competitive rugby again.|$|E

40|$|Roadside <b>verges</b> in densely {{populated}} areas {{are often a}} significant addition to the total semi-natural area and as such {{may contribute to the}} conservation of biodiversity. Furthermore, they can enhance the ecological cohesion of a region, especially when the existing nature reserves are small and/or highly fragmented. We investigated the occurrence of ground beetles and spiders in six highway <b>verges</b> with grey hair-grass vegetation in the Veluwe region, The Netherlands. Total species number in the <b>verges</b> was similar to the values found in nearby nature reserves with comparable vegetation, but the ground beetles tended to be more abundant in the reserves. Many stenotopic species were present in the <b>verges,</b> confirming the significant conservation value of this habitat. However, compared with the nature reserves, there were fewer species of stenotopic ground beetles and the stenotopic spiders were less abundant in the <b>verges.</b> From our knowledge of the biology and ecology of the species captured it seems likely that this is attributable to differences in "habitat quality". In the <b>verges,</b> species preferring bare sand are scarcer, and the weighted mean body length of ground beetles is shorter than in nature reserves. This suggests that the sward in the road <b>verges</b> is too dense and the suitable vegetation too patchy to sustain some of the stenotopic species. Habitat analyses support this contention: Compared with the nature reserves, the <b>verges</b> had proportionally less bare sand, more herb and tree cover and the vegetation patches were smaller. The strategy suggested to promote stenotopic species entails removing encroaching trees and shrubs from the <b>verges</b> in order to expand the nutrient-poor zone and (re-) create pioneer conditions. Subsequent management should aim at further improving the road <b>verges</b> as extensions of nutrient-poor habitat...|$|R

5|$|On 2 October 1914, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, <b>Verge</b> enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force as a captain in the Australian Army Medical Corps. He was subsequently attached to the 6th Light Horse Regiment as its medical officer. After completing rudimentary training in Sydney, his regiment embarked on HMAT A29 Suevic on 21 December, reaching Egypt on 1 February 1915. When the light horse regiments were sent to Gallipoli as reinforcements following the initial landing, <b>Verge</b> was attached to the 1st Australian Division. The reinforcements landed on 20 May, just after the failed Turkish attack on Anzac Cove. The 6th Light Horse Regiment was tasked with securing the right hand flank of the Allied lodgement, and during the months that followed undertook mainly defensive duties around the beachhead. The conditions on the peninsula were very harsh, and sanitation was poor. Several months after landing, <b>Verge</b> contracted dysentery and was evacuated to No. 17 British General Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. He died on 8 September 1915, and was buried at the Chatby War Memorial Cemetery (Row Q, Grave No. 523) in Alexandria.|$|E

40|$|Heathland {{areas in}} the Netherlands are declining in size and quality, and {{becoming}} more fragmented. The connectivity of the landscape for threatened insects might be improved by creating networks of corridors. We compared heathy roadside <b>verges</b> and linear forest clearings with heathland nature reserves and forests. The clearings were created in between the roadside <b>verges</b> and the nature reserves. In all four landscape types carabid beetles were inventoried with pitfall and window traps. Principal Component Analyses showed that the carabid species composition in roadside <b>verges</b> differed from that in nature reserves, {{both before and after}} the creation of the connecting forest clearings. However, an analysis of data on 31 target species (stenotopic species of drift sand, heathland and other nutrient-poor open habitats) selected from the pitfall trap catches revealed that 21 were present in the roadside <b>verges.</b> In addition, the occurrence of teneral individuals and flightless species indicate the <b>verges</b> provide valuable habitat where reproduction takes place. Forests themselves were barriers for almost all target carabids. In the forest clearings, similar amounts of target carabids were encountered in pitfall traps as in the nature reserves and roadside <b>verges,</b> but only teneral individuals of two species were found. In contrast, flying carabids were very abundant in the forest clearings: more than twice as many as in the nature reserves and the roadside <b>verges.</b> This indicates that dispersing carabids in particular make use of these linear forest clearings. We conclude that roadside <b>verges</b> can act as habitat corridors and that linear forest clearings are particularly used as movement corridors. Thus, both offer simple solutions for increasing the connectivity of fragmented landscapes for a threatened insect group...|$|R
