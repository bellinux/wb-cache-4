40|$|Abstract. We give polynomial-time {{algorithms}} for computing the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> Markov decision processes (MDPs) with limsup and liminf objectives. A real-valued {{reward is}} assigned to each state, and the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infinite path in the MDP is the limsup (resp. liminf) of all rewards along the path. The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MDP is the maximal expected <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infinite path {{that can be achieved}} by resolving the decisions of the MDP. Using our result on MDPs, we show that turn-based stochastic games with limsup and liminf objectives can be solved in NP ∩ coNP. ...|$|R

40|$|For {{many aspects}} of DNA–protein interaction, {{it is vital to}} know how DNA bending {{rigidity}} (or persistence length, a) depends on its sequence. We addressed this problem using the method based on cyclization of short DNA fragments, which allows very accurate determination <b>of</b> <b>a.</b> Our approach was based on assigning specific <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> to each <b>of</b> 10 distinct dinucleotide steps. We prepared DNA fragments, each about 200  bp in length, with various quasi-periodic sequences, measured their cyclization efficiencies (j factors), and fitted the data by the theoretical equation to obtain the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> for each fragment. From these data, we obtained <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> <b>a</b> for the dinucleotide steps. To test this set, we used it to design DNA sequences that should correspond to very low and very high <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>a,</b> prepared the corresponding fragments, and determined their <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> experimentally. The measured and calculated <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> were very close to one another, confirming that we have found the correct solution to this long-standing problem. The same experimental data also allowed us to determine the sequence dependence of DNA helical repeat...|$|R
5|$|A land tax, {{aimed at}} {{breaking}} up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while {{coverage of the}} Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, {{the age at which}} women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty. The introduction of the maternity allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates. Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next of kin. Eligibility for pensions was also widened. From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be eligible for a pension. That same year, the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pensioner's home was excluded from consideration when assessing the value of their property.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from sports}} that have world-wide appeal and competitions, {{such as the}} Olympic Games, the {{entertainment}} <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sport depends on the culture and country {{in which it is}} played. For example, in the United States, baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is rugby union; in Iran, it is freestyle wrestling. Japan's unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history. In some cases, such as the international running group Hash House Harriers, participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component {{is more important than the}} competitive.|$|E
5|$|By April 1896 the Welsh Football Union had sanctioned a {{subscription}} of 1,000 shillings to be {{contributed to the}} Gould testimonial. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) complained and the IRFB reacted by informing the WFU that only a plate up to the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hundred pounds sterling could be given to Gould, and that the remaining funds should be donated to charity; otherwise Wales would lose their international fixtures. The WFU stood down and withdrew their subscription. The reaction in Wales was one of anger, with the people feeling that the WFU had bowed to English pressure, and had been bullied into a decision against the people's wishes.|$|E

5|$|Examples of {{matching}} include the Head Start program, which requires that recipients provide 20% {{of the total}} annual expenses in either monetary or in-kind contributions. Recipients of these funds may contribute money to cover teacher payroll, or may contribute a building to house the program classrooms. However, the federal government requires that in-kind contributions be properly valued and evidenced (such as estimating the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building {{to make sure that}} it meets the 20% of the program budget), and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{the salary}} for patrolmen {{was set at}} $1,400 a year. Police {{officers}} had to buy their own uniforms and equipment which cost over $200. New recruits received $730 during their first year, which increased annually to $821.25 and $1000, and to $1,400 after six years. In the years following World War I, inflation dramatically eroded the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> police officer's salary. From 1913 to May 1919, {{the cost of living}} rose by 76%, while police wages rose just 18%. Discontent and restiveness among the Boston police force grew as they compared their wages and found they were earning less than an unskilled steelworker, half as much as a carpenter or mechanic and 50 cents a day less than a streetcar conductor. Boston city laborers were earning a third more on an hourly basis.|$|E

5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E

Ascertained dangers for cultural properties include serious deterioration of materials, structure, ornaments or architectural coherence {{and the loss of}} historical authenticity or cultural significance. Potential dangers for both cultural and natural sites include development projects, armed conflicts, insufficient management systems or changes in the legal protective status of the properties. In {{the case of}} cultural sites, gradual changes due to geology, climate or environment can also be potential dangers.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in {{an attempt}} to avoid losing large {{quantities}} of circulating nickels to melting, the United States Mint introduced new interim rules on December 14, 2006, that criminalized the melting and export of pennies (which as of 2013 cost 1.83 cents to produce) and nickels. Violators of these rules can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000, five years imprisonment, or both. The rules were finalized on April 17, 2007. The melt <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nickel for some time was more than five cents, including nearing over one-and-a-half times its face value in May 2007. Since then, the supply and demand of the coin's composition metals have stabilized. A nickel's melt value fell below its face value from late 2008 through mid-2010, and more recently again from late mid-2012 through the present. In February 2014, it was reported that the Mint was conducting experiments to use copper-plated zinc (the same composition used for the United States 1 cent coin) for the nickel.|$|E
