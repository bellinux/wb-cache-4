Monopoles and dipoles have to be larger to achieve the same gain and performance as loop antennas. Conversely, loop antennas hold a disadvantage in that they require stiffeners to maintain the loop structure which poses challenges in both stowage and deployment. To address these challenges, the University of Florida has been developing an innovative solution to store and deploy a 16 meter square-loop antenna that can be stored within a 1 U volume. The design consists of four 2. 8 meter long booms to support the antenna element and a novel deployment mechanism to entanglement.

40|$|The {{physiological}} mechanism(s) for {{the regulation}} of the dynamic pressure–flow relationship of the cerebral circulation are not well understood. We studied the effects of acute cerebral vasoconstriction on the transfer function between spontaneous changes in blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in 13 healthy subjects (30 ± 7 years). CBFV was measured in the middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler. BP was increased stepwise with phenylephrine infusion at 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 μg kg− 1 min− 1. Phenylephrine increased BP by 11, 23 and 37 % from baseline, while CBFV increased (11 %) only with the highest increase in BP. Cerebrovascular resistance index (BP/CBFV) increased progressively by 6, 17 and 23 %, demonstrating effective steady-state autoregulation. Transfer function gain at the <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> (LF, 0. 07 – 0. 20 Hz) was reduced by 15, 14 and 14 %, while the phase was reduced by 10, 17 and 31 %.

Windkessel model simulation suggests that increases in steady-state cerebrovascular resistance and/or decreases in vascular compliance during cerebral vasoconstriction contribute to the changes in gain and phase. These findings suggest that changes in steady-state cerebrovascular resistance and/or vascular compliance modulate the dynamic pressure–flow relationship at the <b>low</b> and high <b>frequencies,</b> while dynamic autoregulation {{is likely to be}} dominant at the <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Thus, oscillations in CBFV are modulated not only by dynamic autoregulation, but also by changes in steady-state cerebrovascular resistance and/or vascular compliance...|$|R
50|$|<b>Very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> {{earthquakes}} (<b>VLFs)</b> can {{be considered}} a sub-category of <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> earthquakes that differ in terms of duration and period.

VLFs predominantly occur with LFEs, but the reverse is not true. There are two major subduction zone settings where VLFs have been detected, 1) within the offshore accretionary prism and 2) at the plate interface down-dip of the seismogenic zone. Since these two environments have considerably different depths, they have been termed shallow VLFs and deep VLFs, respectively. Like LFEs, <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> earthquakes migrate along-strike during ETS events. VLFs have been found at both the Cascadia subduction zone in western North America, as well as in Japan at the Nankai trough and Ryukyu trench.|$|R

50|$|<b>Very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> or <b>VLF</b> is the ITU {{designation}} {{for radio}} frequencies (RF) {{in the range}} of 3 to 30 kilohertz (kHz), corresponding to wavelengths from 100 to 10 kilometres, respectively. The band is also known as the myriametre band or myriametre wave as the wavelengths range from one to ten myriametres (an obsolete metric unit equal to 10 kilometres). Due to its limited bandwidth, audio (voice) transmission is highly impractical in this band, and therefore only low data rate coded signals are used. The VLF band is used for a few radio navigation services, government time radio stations (broadcasting time signals to set radio clocks) and for secure military communication. Since VLF waves can penetrate at least 40 meters (120 ft) into saltwater, they are used for military communication with submarines.|$|R
50|$|A {{whistler}} is a <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> or <b>VLF</b> electromagnetic (radio) wave {{generated by}} lightning. Frequencies of terrestrial whistlers are 1 kHz to 30 kHz, {{with a maximum}} amplitude usually at 3 kHz to 5 kHz. Although they are electromagnetic waves, they occur at audio frequencies, and {{can be converted to}} audio using a suitable receiver. They are produced by lightning strokes (mostly intracloud and return-path) where the impulse travels along the Earth's magnetic field lines from one hemisphere to the other. They undergo dispersion of several kHz due to the slower velocity of the lower frequencies through the plasma environments of the ionosphere and magnetosphere. Thus they are perceived as a descending tone which can last for a few seconds. The study of whistlers categorizes them into Pure Note, Diffuse, 2-Hop, and Echo Train types.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{reproduce}} slow earthquakes with short duration such as <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> events (<b>VLFs)</b> migrating along the trench direction as swarms, we apply a 3 -D subduction plate boundary model {{based on the}} slowness law of rate- and state-dependent friction, introducing close-set numerous small asperities (rate-weakening regions) {{at a depth of}} 30 km under high pore pressure condition, in addition to a large asperity. Our simulation indicates that swarms of slip events occur repeatedly at the small asperities, and these events are similar to the observed slow earthquake group, especially to VLF, {{on the basis of the}} relation between characteristic duration and seismic moment. No slip events occur there without the small asperities, which mean that the close-set numerous small asperities may be one of the necessary conditions for generating the short-duration slow earthquakes such as VLFs. In the preseismic stage of the megathrust earthquakes that occur at the large asperity, the swarms of VLFs have higher migration speeds and higher moment release rate as well as shorter recurrence interval. Thus, monitoring the migration of slow earthquakes may be useful in imaging the preseismic slip of megathrust earthquakes.|$|R
