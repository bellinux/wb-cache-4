5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying <b>vegetable</b> <b>material,</b> and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as they make their way between these resources.|$|E
5|$|The choughs {{have black}} plumage and brightly {{coloured}} legs, feet, and bills, and are resident {{in the mountains}} of southern Eurasia and North Africa. They have long broad wings and perform spectacular aerobatics. Both species pair for life and display fidelity to their breeding sites, which are usually caves or crevices in a cliff face. They build a lined stick nest and lay three to five eggs. They feed, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey, supplemented by <b>vegetable</b> <b>material</b> or food from human habitation, especially in winter.|$|E
25|$|Be sure to {{frequently}} {{clean the}} feed and water dishes. The {{amount of feed}} a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and {{on the availability of}} drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container {{to reduce the risk of}} the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green <b>vegetable</b> <b>material</b> and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.|$|E

25|$|Since the 6th century BC, {{cane sugar}} {{producers}} have crushed the harvested <b>vegetable</b> <b>material</b> from sugarcane {{in order to}} collect and filter the juice. They then treat the liquid (often with lime (calcium oxide)) to remove impurities and then neutralize it. Boiling the juice then allows the sediment to settle to the bottom for dredging out, while the scum rises to the surface for skimming off. In cooling, the liquid crystallizes, usually {{in the process of}} stirring, to produce sugar crystals. Centrifuges usually remove the uncrystallized syrup. The producers can then either sell the sugar product for use as is, or process it further to produce lighter grades. The later processing may take place in another factory in another country.|$|E
25|$|Snails usually prefer juicy {{leaves and}} {{vegetables}} over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed {{as it will}} quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% wheat bran while 80% is fruit and <b>vegetable</b> <b>material.</b> Some growers use oats, corn meal, soybean meal, or chicken mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed oyster shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their body weight. Active snails deprived of food will lose {{more than one-third of}} their weight before they starve to death—a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.|$|E
500|$|An annual spring mulch of well {{rotted manure}} is ideal and poultry manure {{can also be}} used but needs prior {{composting}} with straw or other waste <b>vegetable</b> <b>material.</b> Spent mushroom compost can be used but care should be taken as it often contains lime and blackcurrants prefer slightly acidic soils. The blackcurrant is a gross feeder and benefits from additional nitrogen, and phosphatic and potash fertilisers should also be applied annually. A balanced artificial fertilizer can be used and a 10-10-10 granular product can be spread around the bushes at the rate of [...] per plant. Weed growth can be suppressed with an organic mulch such as sawdust, bark, mushroom compost or straw, heavy plastic topped with an organic mulch cover or landscape fabric.|$|E
50|$|Other {{forms of}} fish feed being used include feeds made entirely with <b>vegetable</b> <b>materials</b> for {{species such as}} carp, moist feeds {{preferred}} by some species (easier to make but more difficult to store), and trash fish — that is fish caught and fed directly to larger species being raised in aquaculture pens.|$|R

New artificial materials are not the sole products meant to achieve sustainable solutions : lately a number of old materials - straw, stone, rammed earth - are becoming again updated for sustainability, zero waste production, bioclimatic beh aviour and comfort and health, besides being economy and locally available. Their great potential, as envelope elements is investigated in this paper, through a bioclimatic comparison between cases from Italy and from Portugal.

Some found it difficult...to account for these anomalous motions. ...that the seeds becomes (how is not said) a perfect nimalcule, which after enjoying an animal existence for a time ceases to live animally, and, reverting to its original nature, gives birth to a vegetable. Thus, this seed was first vegetable, then animal, and then again vegeable,... During the 18th Century there was a stormy controversy as to whether coralline algae were plants or animals. Up to the mid-18th century coralline algae (and coral animals) were generally treated as plants. By 1768 many, {{but by no means}} all authorities, considered them animal. Five years later, Harvey concluded that they were certainly of <b>vegetable</b> <b>material</b> he noted: [...] "The question of the vegetable nature of Corallines, among which the Melobesia take rank, may now be considered as finally set at rest, by the researches of Kützing, Phillipi and Decaisne."

2500|$|Nests {{are built}} in April or May more than [...] above ground in trees. This height varies {{according}} to habitat, but while nests have been found almost [...] up, most are 2–16m above ground. Presence of mistletoes or vines like common ivy (Hedera helix) on side branches near the trunk (where nests are preferentially built) will make a tree markedly more attractive. Fieldfares (Turdus pilaris) nesting in the vicinity will also increase the desirability of nest sites to great grey shrikes, which moreover often refuse to prey upon these thrushes' nestlings though the opportunity is there. Apparently, the two species are more efficient in spotting potential nest predators – in particular corvids – early on and mobbing them off cooperatively than either is on its own. Otherwise, {{there is no clear}} preference for particular taxa of nesting trees, provided they are sufficiently dense. Conifers seem to have become more popular with European L. excubitor in recent decades, but a diversity of deciduous trees is used just as well. Far more rarely, large and especially thorny shrubs are used for nesting. The actual nesting site is chosen by the male; the courtship visits of the female are mainly to form and strengthen the pair bond. Also, though the partners build the nest together, the male collects most of the nesting material. The cup nest is quite sizable, measuring [...] in outer diameter. Its body is constructed of coarse <b>vegetable</b> <b>material</b> – mainly large twigs and chunks of moss, though bits of fabric and rubbish may be added. The interior cup is [...] in diameter and [...] deep; it is lined with fine twigs and roots, lichen, hair and feathers. Building a nest from scratch takes a pair one to two weeks, but if nests of the previous year in good locations remain usable, they are repaired rather than discarded.|$|E

The tanned leather was then tested in terms of its organoleptic, physical, chemical, and morphological properties. Results of the organoleptic test and most of the results of the physical test showed that leather for jackets which was tanned using a <b>vegetable</b> tanning <b>material</b> met the requirements set out by SNI 4593 : 2011 (sheepskin/goatskin leather for jackets).
