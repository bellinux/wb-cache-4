25|$|Gastrointestinal {{bleeding}} can {{be roughly}} {{divided into two}} clinical syndromes: upper gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. About 2/3 of all GI bleeds are from upper sources and 1/3 from lower sources. Common causes of gastrointestinal bleeding include infections, cancers, <b>vascular</b> <b>disorders,</b> adverse effects of medications, and blood clotting disorders. Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) is when a source is unclear following investigation.|$|E

25|$|Hyperkinesia {{occurs when}} {{dopamine}} receptors, and norepinephrine receptors {{to a lesser}} extent, within the cortex and the brainstem are more sensitive to dopamine or when the dopaminergic receptors/neurons are hyperactive.

Other causes include toxins within the brain, autoimmune disease, and infections, which include meningitis.|$|E
25|$|The Belgians enjoy good health. According to 2012 estimates, {{the average}} life {{expectancy}} is 79.65 years. Since 1960, life expectancy has, {{in line with the}} European average, grown by two months per year. Death in Belgium is mainly due to heart and <b>vascular</b> <b>disorders,</b> neoplasms, disorders of the respiratory system and unnatural causes of death (accidents, suicide). Non-natural causes of death and cancer are the most common causes of death for females up to age 24 and males up to age 44.|$|E
25|$|The work of Di Chiro, Doppman and Ommaya was {{critical}} {{to the development of}} spinal angiography. The visualization of arteries and veins allowed for understanding of the pathophysiology of spinal AVMs in addition to classification of lesions. Di Chiro, Ommaya and Doppman also reported one of the earliest interventional radiology approaches using stainless steel pellets to treat a spinal cord AVM. This percutaneous embolization approach was noted as less traumatic than surgical treatment by the authors and represented another step forward in pecutaneous vascular embolization as an addition the surgical armamentarium for treating certain <b>vascular</b> <b>disorders</b> of the central nervous system.|$|E

25|$|As {{a type of}} hematoma, {{a bruise}} is always caused by {{internal}} bleeding into the interstitial tissues which does not break through the skin, usually initiated by blunt trauma, which causes damage through physical compression and deceleration forces. Trauma sufficient to cause bruising can occur {{from a wide variety}} of situations including accidents, falls, and surgeries. Disease states such as insufficient or malfunctioning platelets, other coagulation deficiencies, or <b>vascular</b> <b>disorders,</b> such as venous blockage associated with severe allergies can lead to the formation of purpura which is not to be confused with trauma-related bruising/contusion. If the trauma is sufficient to break the skin and allow blood to escape the interstitial tissues, the injury is not a bruise but instead a different variety of hemorrhage called bleeding. However, such injuries may be accompanied by bruising elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{headaches}} {{are classified}} {{based on their}} cause and not on their symptoms. According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury, intracranial hematoma, post craniotomy or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical <b>vascular</b> <b>disorders</b> such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headaches may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial <b>vascular</b> <b>disorders.</b> Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system. ICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or by exposure to some substances. HIV/AIDS, intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders {{in the category of}} secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by dialysis, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, and cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the same classification system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches.|$|E
2500|$|Headaches are broadly {{classified}} as [...] "primary" [...] or [...] "secondary". Primary headaches are benign, recurrent headaches {{not caused by}} underlying disease or structural problems. For example, migraine {{is a type of}} primary headache. While primary headaches may cause significant daily pain and disability, they are not dangerous. Secondary headaches are caused by an underlying disease, like an infection, head injury, <b>vascular</b> <b>disorders,</b> brain bleed or tumors. Secondary headaches can be harmless or dangerous. Certain [...] "red flags" [...] or warning signs indicate a secondary headache may be dangerous.|$|E

40|$|Cardiovascular risk {{management}} {{is common in}} patients suffering from manifest cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes mellitus. It is generally accepted that medication {{is the most effective}} treatment for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients. Remarkably, cardiovascular {{risk management}} is rare in patients suffering from branch retinal vein occlusion. This common retinal <b>vascular</b> <b>disorder</b> in middle aged and elderly people occurs where a thickened retinal artery compresses the affected vein. Although thrombosis is involved, procoagulant disorders are only present in selected cases. On the other hand, prior diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease are associated with an increased risk of developing branch retinal vein occlusion up to a decade later, and retinal <b>vascular</b> <b>disorder</b> is associated with an increased risk of subsequently developing hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease later on. Therefore, branch retinal vein occlusion is a marker of developing cardiovascular disease and warrants adequate cardiovascular risk management...|$|R
