Through {{the end of the}} 1970s, the US, UK, and Soviet Union reached agreement on draft provisions prohibiting all testing, temporarily banning PNEs, and establishing a <b>verification</b> system including on-site inspections. However, the sides remained at odds over the precise details of <b>verification</b> and talks would permanently disband with the departure of President Jimmy Carter in 1981.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{magnitude}} {{of many of the}} units comprising the SI system of measurement is ultimately defined by the mass of a -year-old, golf-ball-sized piece of metal, the quality of the IPK must be diligently protected to preserve the integrity of the SI system. Yet, despite the best stewardship, the average mass of the worldwide ensemble of prototypes and the mass of the IPK have likely diverged another µg since the third periodic <b>verification</b> years ago. Further, the world's national metrology laboratories must wait for the fourth periodic <b>verification</b> to confirm whether the historical trendspersisted.|$|E

40|$|Software {{architectures}} must frequently evolve to {{cope with}} changing requirements, and this evolution often implies integrating new concerns. Unfortunately, existing architecture description languages provide little or no support {{for this kind of}} evolution. The software architect must modify the architecture manually, which risks introducing inconsistencies. In previous work, we have proposed the TranSAT framework, which provides a pattern construct for describing new concerns and their integration into an existing architecture. As the interaction between the new concern and the existing architecture may be complex, it is essential that the framework ensure the coherence of the resulting architecture. In this paper, we introduce a language for specifying patterns and <b>verifications</b> that ensure that the concern represented by a pattern can be safely integrated into an existing architecture. The <b>verifications</b> comprise static <b>verifications</b> that check coherence properties before the architecture is modified and dynamic <b>verifications</b> that focus on the parts of the architecture that are affected by the pattern. As a result of these <b>verifications,</b> patterns can be provided as a commodity, such that a software architect can confidently apply a pattern obtained from a third-party developer. ...|$|R

40|$|In 2010, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{established}} the Commercial Crew Program (CCP) {{in order to}} provide human access to the International Space Station and low Earth orbit via the commercial (non-governmental) sector. A particular challenge to NASA has been how to determine that the Commercial Provider's transportation system complies with programmatic safety requirements. The process used in this determination is the Safety Technical Review Board which reviews and approves provider submitted hazard reports. One significant product of the review is a set of hazard control <b>verifications.</b> In past NASA programs, 100 % of these safety critical <b>verifications</b> were typically confirmed by NASA. The traditional Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA) model does not support the nature of the CCP. To that end, NASA S&MA is implementing a Risk Based Assurance process to determine which hazard control <b>verifications</b> require NASA authentication. Additionally, a Shared Assurance Model is also being developed to efficiently use the available resources to execute the <b>verifications...</b>|$|R
