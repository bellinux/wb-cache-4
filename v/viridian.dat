5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called <b>viridian</b> or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{circumstances}} surrounding infective endocarditis (IE) are under constant change {{due to an}} increase in drug-resistant organisms, a decrease in rheumatic valve disease, progress in surgical treatment, and aging society. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare clinical features of IE between the 1990 s and 2000 s and to elucidate the determinants of death or clinical event. MethodsAll hospital admission records between January 1990 and December 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. The definition of IE was based on modified Duke criteria. Clinical presentation, blood culture, laboratory results, and echocardiography findings were compared between the 1990 s and 2000 s. ResultsThere were 112 patients with definite or probable IE according to modified Duke criteria. The most frequent organism causing IE was Streptococcus <b>viridians</b> both in the 1990 s and 2000 s. The determinants of in-hospital death were hemodialysis and congestive heart failure. The in-hospital mortality of IE was 5. 4 % in the 1990 s and 13. 3 % in the 2000 s. Composite events of in-hospital death and central nervous system disorders were significantly higher in the 2000 s compared with the 1990 s.

As Ash carries the {{reluctant}} Pikachu, he hopes that they can be friends, but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of Ash. Just then, the two stumble upon a Pidgey in the wild and Ash unsuccessfully tries to catch it by throwing a Poké Ball. Ash uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon, a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it, thereby weakening it, to be caught by a Poké Ball. With Pikachu being uncooperative, Ash tries to fight the Pidgey himself, but is easily beaten, which greatly amuses Pikachu. The Pidgey escapes and Ash finds a Rattata rummaging through his pack.

40|$|Purpose : We {{investigated}} {{the efficacy of}} potent or combined antibiotics in patients suffering bacterial infections sec ondary to H 1 N 1 by retrospectively analyzing their bacterial pathogen spectrum and clinical characteristics. Methods : Multi-center retrospective analysis was performed using clinical data of H 1 N 1 patients from 27 hospitals in Hebei Province, China, from November 1 to December 31, 2009. Results : Of 480 H 1 N 1 -infected patients enrolled from an inpatient clinic, 91 were positive for bacterial culture. Bacteria were detected in sputum culture at 7. 00 ± 8. 87 days post-admission. Compared with the negative group, the patients in the positive sputum culture group had a higher mean age and prevalence of basic diseases, higher APECHEII (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score within 24 hours of admission, longer hospital stays, and higher mortality. In total, 189 bacterial strains were isolated, {{with the majority of}} samples testing positive for Acinetobacter baumanii (47), Streptococcus <b>viridians</b> (26), or Pseu domonas aeruginosa (19). S. <b>viridians</b> was the major cause of infection within 3 days of admission, while A. baumanii infection was more prevalent from 4 days post-admission; {{there was a significant difference}} in the constituent ratio be tween the two pathogens (p 0. 001). Compared with patients administered common antibiotics, the potent antibiotics group showed no significant difference in hospitalization time, time until bacterial detection, mortality, or detection ratio of resistant strains (p > 0. 05). Conclusions : Complicated bacterial infection in H 1 N 1 patients increases hospitali zation time and mortality. Gram-negative bacilli and multi-resistant strains are the main sources of infection. Early ad ministration of potent or combined antibiotics, even during the period of rapid onset, may not be suitable in H 1 N 1 -in fected patients, particularly previously healthy young patients.   </p...|$|R

Although many studies have focused on two-component systems in closely related Streptococcus species such as S. mutans, S. pneumoniae and S. gordonii; the mechanism of the response regulator in S. sanguinis is still unknown. The ability of S. sanguinis to adapt and thrive in hostile environments suggests this bacterium is capable of sensing and responding to various environmental stimuli.

Interstitial cells were activated directly by glu-cosyltransferase in a dose-dependent manner through concerted mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor–B signaling pathways; activation resulted in up-regulation of synthesis and release of interleukin- 6, interleukin- 8, ormonocyte chemoattractantprotein– 1 andenhanced transwellmigrationofU 937 monocytic cells or primarymononuclear cells.

40|$|Background: Streptococcus mutans are gram {{positive}} bacteria {{classified into}} <b>viridians</b> group, {{and have a}} role in pathogenesis of dental caries. It’s adhesion to the tooth surface is mediated by cell surface proteins, which interact with specific receptor located in tooth pellicle. Glucan binding protein, Glukosyltransferase, and antigen I/II are basic proteins of S. mutans, which {{have a role in}} initiating the interaction. A previous study showed that chicken’s IgY can interfere the interaction. Purpose : The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the ability of IgY in recognizing the surface molecule of Streptococcus mutans expressed by various serotypes (c, d, e, f) and a strain derived from IPB, Bogor. Method : Western blot was used as a method to determine such capability. Result : The result showed that IgY has a potency to recognize antigen I/II, but not the other proteins on the cell surface of all bacteria tested.

40|$|Background: The {{dilemma of}} {{pathogens}} identification {{in patients with}} unidentified clinical symptoms such as fever of unknown origin exists, which not only poses a challenge to both the diagnostic and therapeutic process by itself, but also to expert physicians.

This methodological approach detects viruses and corrects the incidence of false positive detection rates of pathogens in a much shorter period.
