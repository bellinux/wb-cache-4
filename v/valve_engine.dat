25|$|At {{the price}} of {{increased}} complication for a high pressure diesel type injection system, fuel consumption in the same range as small pre-chamber automotive and industrial diesels has been demonstrated with Curtiss-Wright's stratified charge multi-fuel engines, while preserving Wankel rotary advantages Unlike a piston and overhead <b>valve</b> <b>engine,</b> there are no valves which can float at higher rpm causing loss of performance. The Wankel is a more effective design at high revolutions with no reciprocating parts, far fewer moving parts and no cylinder head.|$|E
25|$|By 1930, the BSA Group's primary {{activities}} were BSA motorcycles and Daimler vehicles. However, all the quality car businesses experienced financial {{difficulties in the}} late 1920s. Daimler's situation seemed particularly serious. Sales fell sharply in 1927–1928, a period of losses ensued and no dividends were paid between 1929 and 1936. The sleeve <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> was outdated, Daimler's production methods had become old-fashioned, they had an extravagantly large range of products. Their bankers noted the decreasing sales volume, the poor performance for price {{and the need for}} up-to-date machine tool equipment. Stratton-Instone's dominance of distribution was removed and other outlets arranged. The interests in Singer and the Daimler Hire business were sold and Lanchester bought. The in-house bodywork department was closed and by the spring of 1931 car production ceased, only commercial vehicle production and aero engine work kept Daimler in business.|$|E

2500|$|At mid-year 1977, Pontiac {{introduced}} the Phoenix, an upscale {{version of the}} Ventura which replaced the Ventura entirely {{after the end of}} the 1977 model year. Pontiac also introduced its 151 cubic inch [...] "Iron Duke" [...] 4-cylinder overhead <b>valve</b> <b>engine.</b> It was first used in the 1977 Astre, replacing Astre's aluminum-block 140 cubic inch Vega engine. The 'Iron Duke' engine would later go into many GM and non-GM automobiles into the early 1990s. The 151 cubic inch L4 and the 301 cubic inch V8 were the last two engines designed solely by Pontiac. Subsequent engine design would be accomplished by one central office with all designs being shared by each brand.|$|E
2500|$|While the C5 {{may have}} been {{initially}} criticized for using inexpensive materials and older technology (e.g., [...] composites in body panels and floor boards; an OHV engine; and leaf springs), ostensibly as cost-cutting measures, these components are actually very strong for their relatively light weight (low mass), or have proven reliability. The C5's modular body panels make excellent use of a lightweight composite material known in the automotive industry as SMC or Sheet Molded Composite, a type of fiberglass that is blended and bonded with plastics. SMC provides better protection against direct blows because it is very stiff and will not dent. The floor boards on the C5 are a composite sandwich of SMC with balsa wood in the middle. Balsa wood was chosen for its extreme stiffness, light weight and excellent sound absorption qualities. The all aluminium LS1 overhead <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> is much lighter than its cast iron predecessor, the LT1, and provides for a much lower hoodline when compared to an overhead cam design of relative displacement. The composite leaf springs are much lighter and sit much lower than typical coil springs and help provide the C5 with its excellent ride characteristics and distinctive ride height.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|E

5000|$|By 1925, all Panhard's {{cars were}} powered by Knight sleeve <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> that used steel sleeves. [...] The steel sleeves were thinner and {{lighter than the}} cast iron ones that had been fitted in Panhard sleeve <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> since 1910, and this already gave rise to an {{improved}} friction coefficient permitting engines to run at higher speeds. [...] To reduce further the risk of engines jamming, the outer sleeves, which are less thermally stressed than the inner sleeves, were coated on their inner sides with an anti-friction material, employing a patented technique with which Panhard engineers had been working since 1923. This {{was one of several}} improvements applied by Panhard engineers to the basic Knight sleeve-valve engine concept.|$|R
