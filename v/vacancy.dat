5000|$|In most {{theories}} of this state, {{it is supposed}} that <b>vacancies,</b> empty sites normally occupied by particles in an ideal crystal, exist even at absolute zero. These <b>vacancies</b> are caused by zero-point energy, which also causes them to move from site to site as waves. Because <b>vacancies</b> are bosons, if such clouds of <b>vacancies</b> can exist at very low temperature, then a Bose-Einstein condensation of <b>vacancies</b> could occur at temperatures less than a few tenths of a kelvin. A coherent flow of <b>vacancies</b> is equivalent to a [...] "superflow" [...] (frictionless flow) of particles in the opposite direction. Despite {{the presence of the}} gas of <b>vacancies,</b> the ordered structure of a crystal is maintained, although with less than one particle on each lattice site on average.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We are {{investigating}} the properties of <b>vacancies</b> in solid 4 He with the exact zero temperature SPIGS method. Our aim is to study the possibility of phase–separation between <b>vacancies</b> and the perfect crystal. We find a significant correlation among <b>vacancies</b> both in two and in three dimensional solid 4 He. In 3 D we have considered up to 5 <b>vacancies</b> in a hcp crystal at a density ρ = 0. 0293 ˚A − 3, close to the melting, and in 2 D we have considered up to 6 <b>vacancies</b> in a triangular crystal at ρ = 0. 0765 ˚A − 2. In all the considered cases the correlation among <b>vacancies</b> seems to display an exponential decay that would suggest {{the presence of a}} bound state. The systematically sublinear dependence on the number of <b>vacancies</b> found for the activation energy strengthens the indication of an attractive interaction, even if we have direct evidence that <b>vacancies</b> do not form a single compact cluster. <b>Vacancies</b> in a quantum solid like solid Helium have attracted a great interest because of their unique properties [1]: extensive theoretical and experimental work on solid Helium has indicated that <b>vacancies</b> have an high probability of tunneling from site to site due to the large zero–point motion of the atoms. This distinguishes helium from other solids in which the <b>vacancies</b> are localized at low temperature. Despite of this large effort, our understanding of <b>vacancies</b> i...|$|R
