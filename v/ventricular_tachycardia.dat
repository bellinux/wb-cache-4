An ICD has the ability to treat many types of heart rhythm disturbances by means of pacing, cardioversion, or defibrillation. Some ICD devices can distinguish between ventricular fibrillation and <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> (VT), and may try to pace the heart faster than its intrinsic rate in the case of VT, to try to break the tachycardia before it progresses to ventricular fibrillation.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of cardiac arrhythmia increases with advancing age, {{as does the}} prevalence of structural heart disease. Serious arrhythmias, such as sustained <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardias,</b> are uncommon in elderly patients, but nonsustained <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardias</b> and atrial fibrillation are relatively frequent. The {{first step in the}} treatment of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias is the identification of an underlying (cardiac) disease, which should be treated appropriately. Patients with supraventricular arrhythmias who do not have a severe underlying cardiac disease may be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs to prevent recurrences of the arrhythmia. In selected patients, radiofrequency catheter ablation may nowadays be a first-line therapeutic strategy. In elderly patients with underlying cardiac disease who are experiencing non-life-threatening arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic drugs are generally discouraged because of the risk of proarrhythmic effects or other adverse events. In patients experiencing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, beta-blockers may be the first-line therapy. If these drugs are not effective, or cause adverse effects, class III or class IC antiarrhythmic drugs may be used as alternatives.

25|$|Although the {{electrical}} impulses of AF occur {{at a high}} rate, {{most of them do}} not result in a heart beat. A heart beat results when an electrical impulse from the atria passes through the atrioventricular (AV) node to the ventricles and causes them to contract. During AF, if all of the impulses from the atria passed through the AV node, there would be severe <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia,</b> resulting in a severe reduction of cardiac output.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effectiveness of antitachycardia pacing modes and detection algorithms in patients with a new third-generation implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Methods. Twenty-three of 42 consecutive patients had coronary artery disease, 14 had dilated cardiomyopathy, 2 had prior valve replacement and 3 had arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. The mean ejection fraction was 41 ± 14 %; there were 31 men (74 %) and 11 women, {{with a mean age of}} 53 years. On the basis of preoperative and postoperative electrophysiologic studies, in 28 patients antitachycardia pacing was postoperatively programmed randomly as “burst” (66 %) or autodecremental “ramp” (34 %) stimulation with a first coupling interval of 81 % of tachycardia cycle length and up to 8 sequences with 3 to 10 stimuli. Results. During a follow-up interval of 6. 3 ± 2. 2 months, 15 patients were treated by antitachycardia pacing for a median of 6 (range 1 to 59) hemodynamically stable <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardias</b> (175 ± 12 beats/min). In 5 patients, 22 <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardias</b> (9 %) were not terminated by antitachycardia pacing but by cardioversion. Seven (3 %) of these episodes accelerated (> 50 ms) during antitachycardia pacing. Syncope did not occur during these episodes. In seven patients initial antitachycardia pacing in cases of supraventricular tachycardias delayed charging and redetection prevented inappropriate discharges. Additional detection algorithms were programmed only after inappropriate therapy. The sudden “onset” and “sustained rate duration” criteria were programmed in three patients and the cycle length “stability” criteria in six patients, respectively. After activation of these detection algorithms only two of the seven patients had further inappropriate device discharges. Conclusions. Thus, antitachycardia pacing by this implantable cardioverter-defibrillator effectively and appropriately terminated 91 % of hemodynamically stable <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardias.</b> Inappropriate device discharges were prevented in some patients by antitachycardia pacing and additional detection algorithms...|$|R

We aimed to study the electrophysiological and haemodynamic effects of simultaneous intracoronary endothelin- 1 and intravenous isoproterenol infusions. 18 anaesthetised open chest dogs were studied after AV-ablation. Mean arterial blood pressure, coronary blood flow, left ventricular contractility, standard electrocardiograms, right and left ventricular epi- and endocardial monophasic action potential (MAP) signals were recorded. Intracoronary endothelin- 1 (30 pmol/min) was given to Group ET (n= 6), intravenous isoproterenol (0. 2 microg/kg/min) to Group ISO (n= 6), both endothelin- 1 and isoproterenol to Group ET+ISO (n= 6) for 30 min. MAP duration increased in all studied regions of Group ET, decreased in all studied regions of Group ISO and ET+ISO (control vs. maximal changes of left ventricular epicardial MAP 90 % duration, Group ET: 296 +/- 22 vs 369 +/- 20 ms, p< 0. 05, Group ISO: 298 +/- 18 vs 230 +/- 27 ms, p< 0. 01, Group ET+ISO: 302 +/- 18 vs 231 +/- 10 ms, p< 0. 01). In Group ET, early after depolarisations (3 / 6), polymorphic non-sustained <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardias</b> (6 / 6), and ventricular fibrillation (3 / 6) could be observed.
