5000|$|Traditionally {{the term}} {{vocation}} {{was used in}} the Catholic Church only to refer to priestly or religious <b>vocations,</b> the <b>vocation</b> <b>to</b> live a life directly consecrated to God. Thomas Aquinas, e.g., only explicitly uses the term <b>vocation</b> <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>vocation</b> <b>to</b> grace or conversion, or to enter religious life, though {{it has been argued that}} his teaching may be logically extended to include marriage as a vocation. In the 20th century there has been a growing movement to extend the use of the term widely. The Second Vatican Council taught that all Christians, whatever their state, are called [...] "to the fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity". The conclusion drawn from this principle is that any way of life that can be a full expression of Christian charity, and a means for growing towards the perfection of it, can be a vocation. Pope John Paul II taught that [...] "there are two specific ways of realizing the vocation of the human person, in its entirety, to love: marriage and virginity or celibacy".|$|R
