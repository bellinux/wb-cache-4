These three units replaced the previously existed VPI generators. The manufacturing process utilized for these generators is known as Global <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>Impregnation</b> (GVPI). Even though GVPI process is more economical and offers many advantages, several cases of premature failures of GVPI generators have been reported worldwide. This influenced carrying out this study to assess the insulation condition of GVPI insulation comparatively with the VPI insulation. One new GVPI stator and two VPI stators were selected as test specimens. Removed stator of Old Laxapana and newly installed stator of Wimalasurendra Power Stations were selected to represent VPI insulation. During this research, {{the condition of the}} GVPI Stator was evaluated using the DC ramped high voltage test and Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS) test. A mathematical model that has been established by both local and international research was utilized for separating the current components of the total measured current of the DC ramped high voltage test. By the current component separation it could be observed that minimum absorption current was required for the new GVPI insulation, which is an indication of superior quality of the insulation. The FDS test revealed important information of the dielectrics in the low frequency region. The results proved that minimum dielectric loss and minimum moisture absorption of all the three samples was for the GVPI insulation. The new VPI insulation had losses and moisture absorption lesser than the old VPI stator but nevertheless it could not match the low values of the GVPI insulation.

The significant problem in determination of an inductor's frequency characteristic is the intrinsic resistance, inductance and parasitic capacitance. In this triplet, the parasitic capacitance is the major limiting factor of inductor's frequency range. This capacitance depends on inductor design parameters and materials filling the spaces of coil like resin and its coherency after curing process.

40|$|An {{extensive}} R&D {{program has}} been conducted that has confirmed the feasibility of designing and fabricating copper alloy magnets that can successfully operate at temperatures as high as 350 C. The process, originally developed {{for the possibility of}} manufacturing in-vessel resonant magnetic field perturbation (RMP) coils for JET, has been optimized for insulated magnet (and, potentially, other high temperature component) applications. One of the benefits of high temperature operation is that active cooling may no longer be required, greatly simplifying magnet/component design. These elevated temperatures are beyond the safe operating limits of conventional OFHC copper and the epoxies that bond and insulate the turns of typical magnets. This would necessitate the use an alternative copper alloy conductor such as C 18150 (CuCrZr). Coil manufacture with polyimide is very similar to conventional epoxy bonded coils.

It was discovered that after preparation of the full cross section stack until completion of the VPI, the stack shrunk in height by 20 - 25 mm. Our study of the literature and discussions with the leading experts in VPI did not reveal obvious reasons for this change of height, so we launched a study to address this issue. We assembled two 12 x 1 (tall by wide) arrays and several 7 x 1 arrays in order to study characteristics of the dry winding pack under compressive force and effects of different fabrication steps. Then we impregnated these arrays in different conditions under compressive force and studied change of height as a result of compression, impregnation, gelling and curing of the stack of insulated conductors. We showed that by controlling the application of the compressive force, before closing the mold and during impregnation, one can reduce the height uncertainty. Most of the height reduction takes place while the glass is dry under the dead weight and the applied compressive force. Reduction of height during injection of the resin and during gelling, curing and cooling of the coil is noticeable, reproducible and relatively small.

A {{key component of}} NSTX-U is the fabrication of a new, higher field centerstack (CS). In order to simultaneously provide robust joints between {{the inner and outer}} legs of the Toroidal Field Coils (TF) and minimize radial build, the NSTX-U CS design requires that the Ohmic Heating solenoid (OH) be wound directly on the inner TF bundle. To protect the OH against thermal expansion stress during scenarios where the inner TF bundle is hot but the OH is relatively cool, the completed CS will have a 0. 100 inch annular gap between the outer diameter of the TF bundle and the inner diameter of the OH solenoid. "Aquapour", a proprietary material produced by the Advanced Ceramics Manufacturing Company will be used during manufacture to produce this gap. After the TF bundle is vacuum pressure impregnated and cured, a cylindrical "clam shell" mold will be assembled around it, and a slurry of powdered Aquapour and water will be pumped into the annular space between the mold and TF bundle. Subsequent baking will turn the Aquapour solid, and a protective layer of wet lay-up fiberglass and resin will be added. The OH solenoid will be wound directly on this wet lay-up shell.

The as-spun and stabilized composite fibers exhibited a 50 and 40 % increase, respectively, in modulus {{when compared to}} neat PAN. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>impregnation</b> (VPI) method was employed to reinforce SWCNT fibers. SWCNT fibers were impregnated with polyamic acid (PAA) solution at 100 psi followed by thermal imidization to obtain fibers reinforced with polyimide (PI). The tensile strength was increased form 68 to 215 MPa for SWCNT fibers after VPI and imidization. Surfactant-wrapped chemically converted graphene (CCG) sheets obtained from the hydrazine reduction of GO were functionalized by treatment with aryl diazonium salts. The functionalized nanosheets disperse readily in polar aprotic solvents. A one-pot method has also been developed for reducing GO and simultaneously functionalizing it with alkyl and aryl groups. The alkyl functionalized reduced GO shows higher {{solubility in organic solvents}} when compared to GO. Graphene-filled PI composite films were prepared by solution blending of GO and PAA, casting the mixture and imidizing the films by heating up to 400 °C resulting in composite films that exhibit up to a ∼ 75 % increase in modulus and low moisture uptake. At 2 wt % loading GO, the composite films exhibit a conductivity of 1. 25 × 10 - 5 S/cm. The layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique was also employed in the fabrication of thin film composites of CCG and PI.

40|$|Permanent magnet {{generators}} (PMG) {{represent the}} cutting edge technology in modern wind mills. The efficiency remains high (over 90 %) at partial loads. To improve the machine efficiency even further, every aspect of machine losses has to be analyzed. Additional losses are often given as a certain percentage without providing any detailed information about the actual calculation process; meanwhile, there are many design-dependent losses that {{have an effect on}} the total amount of additional losses and that have to be taken into consideration. Additional losses are most often eddy current losses in different parts of the machine. These losses are usually difficult to calculate in the design process. In this doctoral thesis, some additional losses are identified and modeled. Further, suggestions on how to minimize the losses are given. Iron losses can differ significantly between the measured no-load values and the loss values under load. In addition, with embedded magnet rotors, the quadrature-axis armature reaction adds losses to the stator iron by manipulating the harmonic content of the flux. It was, therefore, re-evaluated that in salient pole machines, to minimize the losses and the loss difference between the no-load and load operation, the flux density has to be kept below 1. 5 T in the stator yoke, which is the traditional guideline for machine designers. Eddy current losses may occur in the end-winding area and in the support structure of the machine, that is, in the finger plate and the clamping ring. With construction steel, these losses account for 0. 08 % of the input power of the machine. These losses can be reduced almost to zero by using nonmagnetic stainless steel. In addition, the machine housing may be subjected to eddy current losses if the flux density exceeds 1. 5 T in the stator yoke. Winding losses can rise rapidly when high frequencies and 10 – 15 mm high conductors are used. In general, minimizing the winding losses is simple. For example, it can be done by dividing the conductor into transposed subconductors. However, this comes with the expense of an increase in the DC resistance. In the doctoral thesis, a new method is presented to minimize the winding losses by applying a litz wire with noninsulated strands. The construction is the same as in a normal litz wire but the insulation between the subconductors has been left out. The idea is that the connection is kept weak to prevent harmful eddy currents from flowing. Moreover, the analytical solution for calculating the AC resistance factor of the litz-wire is supplemented by including an end-winding resistance in the analytical solution. A simple measurement device is developed to measure the AC resistance in the windings. In the case of a litz-wire with originally noninsulated strands, <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>impregnation</b> (VPI) is used to insulate the subconductors. In one of the two cases studied, the VPI affected the AC resistance factor, but in the other case, it did not have any effect. However, more research is needed to determine the effect of the VPI on litz-wire with noninsulated strands. An empirical model is developed to calculate the AC resistance factor of a single-layer formwound winding. The model includes the end-winding length and the number of strands and turns. The end winding includes the circulating current (eddy currents that are traveling through the whole winding between parallel strands) and the main current. The end-winding length also affects the total AC resistance factor...|$|E

40|$|Vacuum venting is {{a method}} {{proposed}} to improve feature replication in microparts that are fabricated using micro injection molding (MIM). A qualitative and quantitative study {{has been carried out}} to investigate the effect of vacuum venting on nano/micro feature replication in MIM. Anodized aluminium oxide containing nanofeatures and a bulk metallic glass tool mold containing micro features were used as mold inserts. The effect of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> at constant <b>vacuum</b> time, and of vacuum time at constant <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> on the replication of these features is investigated. It is found that vacuum venting qualitatively enhances the nano-scale feature definition as well as increases the area of feature replication. In the quantitative study, higher aspect ratio features can be replicated more effectively using vacuum venting. Increasing both <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> and <b>vacuum</b> time are found to improve the depth of replication, with the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> having more influence. Feature orientation and final sample shape could affect the absolute depth of replication of a particular feature within the sample...|$|R
