5|$|Before the 12th century, Jain writers had {{dominated}} Kannada literature {{with their}} champu (verses mixed with prose) style of writings popular in court literature. In the later medieval period, {{they had to}} contend with the Veerashaivas who challenged the <b>very</b> <b>notion</b> of royal literature with their vachana poetry, a stylised form of spoken language, more popular in folk genres. The popular growth of Veerashaiva (devotees of the Hindu god Shiva) literature began in the 12th century, while Vaishnava (devotees of the Hindu god Vishnu) writers began to exert their influence from the 15th century. Jain writers had to reinvent their art, moving away from the traditional themes of renunciation and tenets to focus on contemporary topics. Andayya's 13th century classic Kabbigara Kava ("Poets defender") was an early example of the change in literary style, and also reflected the hostility toward the Veerashaivas; the Jain author found it ideal to narrate the story of Manmatha, the God of Love, who turned Shiva into a half woman. The Veerashaivas had initiated an important change, casting aside the concept of formal literature and making way for shorter local genres. The Vaishnava haridasas later popularised musical forms that were more acceptable to the common man. Written classics eulogising kings and commanders were a thing of the past. Kannada literature had moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with singability being its hallmark, and devotion to God its goal.|$|E

25|$|Read on its own, the First Meditation {{can be seen}} as {{presenting}} skeptical doubts as {{a subject}} of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, how can we claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight {{to the heart of the}} Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world. It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our <b>very</b> <b>notion</b> of rationality.|$|E

Noting that the document “consistently objects to ‘the Occupation,’ without making clear that it is referring exclusively to lands occupied by Israel and in dispute since the Six-Day War of 1967,” the rabbis said that the document implicitly rejects “the <b>very</b> <b>notion</b> of a Jewish State.” The rabbis were additionally concerned that the document, while professing to reject violence, expressed “respect” and “high esteem for those who have given their life for our nation,” which they interpreted as praise of suicide bombers.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1980s, Putnam became {{increasingly}} disillusioned with what he perceived as the [...] "scientism" [...] and the rejection of history that characterize modern analytic philosophy. He rejected internal realism because it assumed a [...] "cognitive interface" [...] model of the relation between the mind and the world. Putnam claimed that the <b>very</b> <b>notion</b> of truth would have to be abandoned by a consistent eliminative materialist. Under the increasing influence of James and the pragmatists, he adopted a direct realist view of this relation. For a time, under the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein, he adopted a pluralist view of philosophy itself and came to view most philosophical problems as nothing more than conceptual or linguistic confusions created by philosophers by using ordinary language out of its original context.

500|$|While this {{administrative}} structure was decreed {{by a government}} anxious to deal with [...] interlocutors, such a restructuring has not taken place in Casamance. Jola society is devoid of any formal hierarchy. It has no leader with genuine permanent authority. Instead, there are village elders who meet when important decisions need to be made. According to Italian anthropologist Paolo Palmeri, {{the leader of the}} village has very little power in reality, as he is merely responsible for relations with the national administration. He simply allows the village to continue practicing its traditions. In a society where politics are inextricably linked to religion, the real holders of power are the fetish priests. The <b>very</b> <b>notion</b> of a village is almost inappropriate in this context: it might be more appropriately considered a clan or an aggregation of kinship. Other specialists, such as Christian Sina Diatta, compare Jola communities to those of mound-building termites, in which each member performs a specific function and where the queen is easily replaceable.|$|E
500|$|Wright {{argues that}} Warren's {{inspiration}} of terror through a distorted {{representation of the}} uterus strikes a chord with the 1979 film The Brood, {{in which a woman}} produces deformed children through asexual reproduction. Commenting further, he examines the rape sequence itself, in which Sandy witnesses Karl injecting her with an unknown substance prior to the alien insemination, and makes a connection to dialogue from other scenes indicating that the female Xeno scientists are regularly administered intravenous injections for contraceptive purposes. The impregnation of Sandy through perverted intercourse, conflicting with the suppression of childbirth that is manifested through Karl's use of a hypodermic and (phallic) needle, reveals [...] "coherent sexism" [...] in so far as Inseminoid [...] "attacks the <b>very</b> <b>notion</b> of female sexual freedom, while suggesting, paradoxically, that contraception is the responsibility of women." [...] That Sandy reproduces at an accelerated pace and regresses into an animalistic state are factors adding to her depiction as an abject Other, or object of [...] "male paranoia".|$|E

Conservatives were angered that Madonna dared to portray religious symbolism and the virginal wedding attire in a sexual context. Clerk noted the song attracted an unprecedented level of attention from social groups compared to any female singer's song.

500|$|Another {{major theme}} of Caligari is, as Stephen Brockmann writes, [...] "the destabilized {{contrast}} between insanity and sanity, {{and hence the}} destabilization of the <b>very</b> <b>notion</b> of sanity itself". By {{the end of the}} film, viewers realize the story they have been watching has been told from the perspective of an insane narrator, and therefore they cannot accept anything they have seen as reliable truth. The film's unusual visual abstractions and other stylized elements serve to show the world as one experienced by a madman. Similarly, the film has been described as portraying the story as a nightmare and the frame story as the real world. John D. Barlow said the film exemplifies a common Expressionist theme that [...] "the ultimate perception of reality will appear distorted and insane to the healthy and practical mind". The film serves as a reminder that any story told through a flashback subjectivizes the story {{from the perspective of the}} narrator. At the end of the film, the asylum director gives no indication that he means Francis ill will, and in fact he seems to truly care for his patients. But Francis nevertheless believes he is being persecuted, so in the story as told from his perspective, Dr. Caligari takes on the role of persecutor.|$|E
500|$|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is {{considered}} one of the greatest—and most controversial—of horror films, and a major influence on the genre. In 1999 Richard Zoglin of Time commented that it had [...] "set a new standard for slasher films". The Times listed it as one of the 50 most controversial films of all time. Tony Magistrale believes the film paved the way for horror to be used as a vehicle for social commentary. Describing it as [...] "cheap, grubby and out of control", Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times declared that it [...] "both defines and entirely supersedes the <b>very</b> <b>notion</b> of the exploitation picture". In his book Dark Romance: Sexuality in the Horror Film, David Hogan called it [...] "the most affecting gore thriller of all and, in a broader view, among the most effective horror films ever made ... the driving force of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is something far more horrible than aberrant sexuality: total insanity." [...] According to Bill Nichols, it [...] "achieves the force of authentic art, profoundly disturbing, intensely personal, yet at the same time far more than personal". Leonard Wolf praised the film as [...] "...an exquisite work of art" [...] and compared it to a Greek tragedy, noting the lack of onscreen violence.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut's works have, {{at various}} times, been labeled science fiction, satire and postmodern. He also {{resisted}} such labels, but his works do contain common tropes {{that are often}} associated with those genres. In several of his books, Vonnegut imagines alien societies and civilizations, as is common in works of science fiction. Vonnegut does this to emphasize or exaggerate absurdities and idiosyncrasies in our own world. Furthermore, Vonnegut often humorizes the problems that plague societies, as is done in satirical works. However, literary theorist Robert Scholes noted in Fabulation and Metafiction that Vonnegut [...] "reject the traditional satirist's faith in the efficacy of satire as a reforming instrument. [...] a more subtle faith in the humanizing value of laughter." [...] Examples of postmodernism may {{also be found in}} Vonnegut's works. Postmodernism often entails a response to the theory that the truths of the world will be discovered through science. Postmodernists contend that truth is subjective, rather than objective, as it is biased towards each individual's beliefs and outlook on the world. They often use unreliable, first-person narration, and narrative fragmentation. One critic has argued that Vonnegut’s most famous novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, features a metafictional Janus-headed outlook because the novel seeks to represent actual historical events while, at the same time, problematizes the <b>very</b> <b>notion</b> of doing exactly that. While Vonnegut does use elements as fragmentation and metafictional elements, in some of his works, he more distinctly focuses on the peril posed by individuals who find subjective truths, mistake them for objective truths, then proceed to impose these truths on others.|$|E

500|$|Sgt. Pepper {{opens with}} the title track, {{starting}} with 10 seconds of the combined sounds of a pit orchestra warming up and an audience waiting for a concert, creating the illusion of the album as a live performance. The author Kenneth Womack describes the lyric as [...] "a revolutionary moment in the creative life of the Beatles" [...] that bridges the gap – {{sometimes referred to as}} the fourth wall – between the audience and the artist. He argues that, paradoxically, the lyrics [...] "exemplify the mindless rhetoric of rock concert banter" [...] while [...] "mock the <b>very</b> <b>notion</b> of a pop album's capacity for engendering authentic interconnection between artist and audience". In his view, the mixed message ironically serves to distance the group from their fans while simultaneously [...] "gesturing toward" [...] them as alter egos, an authorial quality that he considers to be [...] "the song's most salient feature". He credits the recording's use of a brass ensemble with distorted electric guitars as an early example of rock fusion. MacDonald agrees, describing the track as an overture rather than a song, and a [...] "shrewd fusion of Edwardian variety orchestra" [...] and contemporary hard rock. The musicologist Michael Hannan describes the track's unorthodox stereo mix as [...] "typical of the album", with the lead vocal in the right speaker during the verses, but in the left during the chorus and middle eight. [...] "Sgt. Pepper" [...] was the first Beatles track that benefitted from the production technique known as direct injection, which according to Womack [...] "afforded McCartney's bass with richer textures and tonal clarity". The song's arrangement utilises a rock and roll oriented Lydian mode chord progression during the introduction and verses that is built on parallel sevenths, which Everett describes as [...] "the song's strength". The five-bar bridge is filled by an Edwardian horn quartet that Martin arranged from a McCartney vocal melody. The track turns to the pentatonic scale for the chorus, where its blues rock progression is augmented by the use of electric guitar power chords played in consecutive fifths.|$|E
