5|$|Also {{known as}} a {{manifold}} cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead. A <b>valve</b> <b>cage</b> is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 Mercury {{engineers}} {{came out}} with the Super 10 Hurricane, Model KG-7. This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum clamp and swivel brackets, a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed <b>valve</b> <b>cage</b> (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance gear case with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed gear case that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and motor's clamp brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing {{engineers}} are frequently asked {{to select the}} best process for creating components but often the judgement is qualitative rather than quantitative. This paper presents a methodology (DCFA – Differential Cost and Feasibility Analysis) for assessing the technological and economic feasibility of using Near Net Shape (NNS) processes for the manufacturing of specific components. The methodology examines changes in raw material usage and finish processes (e. g. machining processes) that would result from adaption of a new manufacturing process. To illustrate the method, a case study that assesses the feasibility of using centrifugal casting {{for the production of}} <b>valve</b> <b>cages</b> is detailed. The case study concludes that the application of this process to the current manufacturing lines could result in significant cost reductions (particularly in machining time and reduction of scrappage). The feasibility methodology is generic and can potentially be used to investigate the application of a broad range of NNS processes in general manufacturing applications. Further, the developed cost models also allow the economic impact of a new process to be assessed, even at the early stages of product design...|$|R

40|$|Nine young {{patients}} with normally functioning bi-leaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves in the mitral or aortic positions were studied with digital phonocardiography and a signal processing technique known as digital deconvolution analysis. This analysis determines the temporal sequence of impacts {{produced by the}} valve's occluding element(s) striking the <b>valve</b> <b>cage</b> and characterizes the acoustic response to normal asynchronous impacting forces. Phonocardiographic signals were recorded with a high frequency accelerometer transducer and digitized at 8000 samples/s. Beat-to-beat variability in asynchrony of leaflet closure occurred with a difference of 0 - 9 msec between closure times of the two valve leaflets. Individual mean asynchrony values ranged from 1. 9 - 5. 8 msec, probably related to changing contours of initial reversing blood flow capturing each leaflet separately. Digital deconvolution analysis characterizes dynamic and structural properties of mechanical prosthetic heart valves and provides a simple noninvasive method for serial assessment of the valve's function...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the mechanisms of failure of current Björk-Shiley cardiac valve prostheses is reported. Two failed valves, one apparently unfailed but defective valve, and one unused valve, were examined by scanning electron microscopy and metallographic section. In the first two valves (removed 12 and 23 months after implantation) fracture {{was associated with the}} welds joining the short strut to the valve ring. The fracture surfaces in all cases were heavily faceted and showed branching cracks. Extensive wear had occurred on one fracture surface in the first case, suggesting that one leg of the short strut had failed before the other, though this had been clinically undetectable. The third valve was removed owing to failure of the suturing (24 months after implantation) but one leg of the short strut was found to be completely fractured. The other leg showed extensive cracking and porosity in the weld region. A metallographic section taken through the weld region of the fourth (unused) valve illustrated several sizable defects directly attributable to the welding process. It is suggested that the valves failed by fatigue and that these problems could be overcome if the complete <b>valve</b> <b>cage</b> were machined as a single piece...|$|E
40|$|REPLACEMENT of nonfunctioning valves is a {{significant}} recent advancement in the correction of cardiac valvular disease. The most widely used artificial device replacing the mitral valve is the Starr-Edwards ball-valve prosthesis. ' Its effectiveness was shown in recent reports by the marked clinical im-provement in properly selected patients. 2 However, cardiologists and cardiac surgeons are faced with several problems {{in the use of}} this valve, which can be answered only by careful studies of the flow dynamics of the ball-valve prosthesis and hemodynamic and clin-ical evaluation of the patient before and after surgery. Despite the effective correction of the regurgitation by the Starr valve, it is as-sumed that the resistance to blood flow through this mechanical device is greater than that of the normal mammalian leaflet valve. The normal mitral valve has a diastolic valve area of 3. 5 to 5 cm. 2 while the presently used Starr-Edwards prosthesis has an opening of 1. 8 to 3. 1 cm. 2 measured at the inner ring of the <b>valve</b> <b>cage.</b> It is assumed that the "effec-tive orifice " is even less, due to changed dy-namics of flow during closure and opening of the ball valve. The "stenotic " orifice of the ball-valve prosthesis becomes even more sig-nificant during high cardiac outputs of exer-cise. Studies to determine the "'effective ori-fice " of the Starr-Edwards valve during the di-astolic flow and the dynamics of the flow during closure and opening of the valve are therefore important. It is presumed that the ball-valve prosthesis with the largest "effective orifice " which...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMore than 300 {{epicardial}} Doppler color flow mapping {{studies on}} 23 {{different types of}} clinical and preclinical valves were performed after implantation in the mitral position in sheep. The transducers were placed directly on the heart to obtain the greatest possible resolution. Studies were performed in each animal under different hemodynamic conditions by varying heart rate and cardiac output. Eighty-six valves were studied late (20 to 52 weeks), whereas the remainder were studied early (0 to 10 days) after operation. The valves included 3 types of ball and <b>cage</b> <b>valves,</b> 3 types of disc and <b>cage</b> <b>valves,</b> 7 types of tilting disc valves, 1 type of bileaflet hemidisc mechanical valve, 13 types of porcine aortic valves and 5 types of bovine pericardial valves. The results of these studies were compared with those obtained in 40 studies of 20 native mitral valves. Doppler color velocity/flow profiles were imaged in real time with simultaneous electrocardiographic gating; the aortic flow was also displayed for the timing of velocity/flow events. Native normal mitral valves had no in-orifice flow disturbances and laminar low velocity/flow directed toward the left ventricular apex. Ball and cage and disc and <b>cage</b> <b>valves</b> had high velocity peripheral jets and vortices of velocity/flow reversals distal to the occluders. Tilting disc valves had differing velocity/flow patterns determined by their orientation in the mitral anulus. Bileaflet hemidisc valves had three jets, which decayed 1. 5 cm downstream. Porcine aortic and bovine pericardial bioprosthetic valves had high velocity, turbulent, nonaxisymmetric jets (more severe for the latter). These observations are similar and complementary to those obtained by in vitro flow visualization techniques and those obtained by laser Doppler anemometry. As such, they provide an important interface between the in vitro assessment of prosthetic valve function and the clinical utility of Doppler color velocity flow imaging technology...|$|R
50|$|The cage {{is a part}} of {{the valve}} that {{surrounds}} the plug and is located inside the body of the <b>valve.</b> Typically, the <b>cage</b> is one of the greatest determiners of flow within the valve. As the plug is moved more of the openings in the cage are exposed and flow is increased and vice versa. The design and layout of the openings can have a large effect on flow of material (the flow characteristics of different materials at temperatures, pressures that are in a range). Cages are also used to guide the plug to the seat of the valve for a good shutoff, substituting the guiding from the bonnet.|$|R
40|$|Globe valves {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} types of valve used for {{throttling}} applications for all sizes due to better controllability and wider range. One of the major limitations associated with the use globe valves in liquid application is cavitation and it takes place both in part open and in fully open conditions due to varied reasons. There are different designs of globe valves available but for control valve applications, cage and plug designs are widely employed. Cage and plug design consists of body, <b>valve</b> <b>cage,</b> plug and an actuating mechanism. Actuating mechanism is connected to the valve plug which is a moving part, through valve shaft. There are many investigations reported about the flow visualization and numerical simulation of normal type globe valves. But study on valves with cage and plug design are not reported in detail. The objective of the present study is to provide a three dimensional analysis of flow through a globe valve with cage and plug design with emphasis on the inception and development of cavitation in detail. Cavitation reduction is achieved by breaking the flow in the form of more than one liquid jet, thereby increasing the turbulence inside the valve flow path. The numerical simulation was done using GAMBIT to set up geometry and grid and FLUENT to solve difference equation postulated from the conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid in motion. The k-epsilon model was used for turbulence. Results of five configurations of the cage with constant flow areas and valve stroke are presented in this paper. The numerical results were verified with an experimental program employing total flow measurement and pressure drop created by the valve at full opening. The study was conducted for different jet configurations to generalize the results of the study. Experimental validation was done in the water test facility with an operating pressure of 1. 6 MPa and flow rate of 0. 05 m 3 /s. In the study, total area of opening for the flow and the valve stroke were kept constant. Accelerometers and dynamic pressure sensors were employed to sense the severity of cavitation at different differential pressures across the test valve...|$|E
40|$|The {{system of}} upper high nickel {{alloying}} steel seal ring and lower high nickel alloying steel seal ring, {{installed in the}} grooves of turbine, can extend out and fit with the wall of <b>valve</b> <b>cage,</b> resulting in forming a good seal under the pressure. In the project, the failure steel seal ring is considered. This situation had threatened {{the safety of the}} whole steam turbine system. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the failure cause of the steel seal ring used in nuclear steam turbines. New high nickel steel alloy seal ring was compared with the failed seal ring. The dimensions of macroscopic ring with clearly plastic deformation were measured using calipers. Surface morphology of ring was observed by optical microscopy through metallographic analysis. There is a lot of precipitation in the grain boundaries of used seal ring, along with smaller grain size than the new seal ring. To explore the composition of precipitation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were used. The results indicated that the concentration of titanium (Ti) and molybdenum (Mo) was higher in the precipitation of used seal ring. At the same time, the hardness and elastic modulus of used seal ring were reduced, measured by nanoindentation test. In-situ SEM tensile testing were used to record and analyze the generation of crack source and crack development under applied load. The reasons of the seal ring failure can be answered because of these experimental results at both macroscopic and microscopic scales. The main reason of the seal ring failure is a combination of long-term stress and elevated temperature during turbine operation. Complex work environment caused recrystallization and recovery, resulting in grain refinement and secondary phase precipitation. Further embodiment, recrystallization and recovery caused the elastic modulus and hardness of used seal ring decrease. Moreover, a lot of secondary phase precipitates appeared at grain boundaries during use. The appearance of secondary phase precipitates become the weakest part of used seal ring. The applied load lead to seal ring failure from the formation of microvoids to microvoids aggregated becoming microcracks until to the appearance of cracks at macroscopic scale. These changes of microscopic structure ultimately reflected in critical plastic deformation of used seal ring...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{artificial}} heart valve was the caged-ball, which utilizes a metal cage to house a silicone elastomer ball. When {{blood pressure in}} the chamber of the heart exceeds that of {{the pressure on the}} outside of the chamber the ball is pushed against the cage and allows blood to flow. At the completion of the heart's contraction, the pressure inside the chamber drops and is lower than beyond the valve, so the ball moves back against the base of the valve forming a seal. In 1952, Charles A. Hufnagel implanted caged-ball heart valves in ten patients (six survived the operation), marking the first long-term success in prosthetic heart valves. A similar valve was invented by Miles [...] "Lowell" [...] Edwards and Albert Starr in 1960 (commonly referred to as the Starr-Edwards Silastic Ball Valve). The first human implant was on Sept 21, 1960. It consisted of a silicone ball enclosed in a cage formed by wires originating from the <b>valve</b> housing. <b>Caged</b> ball <b>valves</b> have a high tendency to form blood clots, so the patient must have a high degree of anti-coagulation, usually with a target INR of 2.5-3.5.

40|$|THIS REPORT {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} left ventriculography in clarifying {{the cause of a}} systolic murmur present following pros-thetic replacement of the mitral valve in a 32 -year-old housewife with chronic rheumatic mitral insufficiency. As reported in detail elsewhere, 1 a good functional result followed surgery performed on January 2, 1961. Eleven months postoperatively, however, the presence of a systolic murmur led to suspicion that partial dislocation of the cage-ball pros-thesis might have occurred. On November 21, 1961, percutaneous retrograde arterial cathe-terization of the left ventricle 2 was done, an injection of sodium iothalamate, 80 per cent, was made, and the radiographs shown in fig-ure 1 were obtained. While the films disclosed no trace of regurgitation through or around the early model Starr-Edwards mitral <b>valve,</b> its <b>cage</b> partly extended into the outflow tract of the left ventricle. In the light of these findings, it was concluded that the systolic murmur was an "innocent " consequence of turbulence and required no further action.

40|$|Control valves {{are used}} under severe service {{conditions}} {{for a wide range}} of applications. These valves are installed with X-Stream cage trims in order to control the flow rate and the pressure drop within the <b>valve.</b> The X-Stream <b>cage</b> trims have a specific capacity rating, commonly known as Flow Coefficient (or Cv). These values of the X-Stream are important as far as customer’s requirements are concerned as are other features of the trim like reduction in erosion via velocity control and the prevention of cavitation via controlled pressure let-down. The X-Stream is a complex geometry part and is traditionally manufactured using a process called electric discharge machining. This is considered a relatively expensive and time consuming process and as a result control valves industry has been extensively reviewing other methods of manufacture. A process known as selective laser melting has been identified as a high potential for cost reduction and competiveness for the business, however early tests have seen issues during the manufacturing process and significant reductions in the Cv of the X-Stream. This study reviews the SLM method of manufacture and evaluates improvements in performance of the X-Stream when reviewing the process of manufacture and the design of the X-Stream component. Extensive flow loop testing of X-Streams have been carried out to calculate Cv of the trims. Then, Computational Fluid Dynamics based techniques have been incorporated to find out the same. The results have been compared and validated. Further tests at higher pressures of water have been conducted to evaluate Cv at severe service conditions This report includes details of the test procedures, CFD modelling and full set of results for each flow condition and the effect of manufacturing constraints like surface roughness on the final Flow Coefficient (Cv) and other performance characteristics to improve the potential for SLM specifically for application with X-Stream...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} for simultaneous estimation of multiphase flow rate and stream composition {{has been developed}} to be applied in a multiple restriction assembly composed of two orifice meters and a <b>cage</b> trim <b>valve.</b> These differential pressure elements are typical instrument installed in the wellhead of production wells in Urucu field (Petrobras/Brazil). To deliver composition and rates four steps were done: 1) a multi-rate well test - an experimental procedure carried out in real operation conditions. 2) modeling of multiphase flow expansion process through <b>cage</b> trim <b>valves.</b> 3) performance and validation of multiphase flow through orifice plate meters {{by the use of}} homogeneous and slip models. 4) tuning and metering procedures for coupling the valve and orifice plate models. The last investigation developed a full field production optimization procedure honouring pressure and routing constraints to be applied in multiple wells. Essentially, the research performed in this thesis is an experimental work followed by numerical modeling. Model errors and performance validation were calculated on the basis of measured data from a multi-rate well test. This field scale experiment consisted in a sequential step response test followed by a transient and a steady state period “a priori” to each next step. Three wells named Well 1, Well 2 and Well 3 were single routed to a test separator. Two types of well performance were investigated: 1) production with stream composition variation caused by gas/water coning. 2) production with steady state composition. Eight wellhead variables were monitored: two orifice plate differential pressures, the differential pressure and temperature through the <b>cage</b> <b>valve,</b> the downstream choke pressure, the wellhead pressure and temperature and the gathering system temperature. The field scale experiments generated a database composed by 1781 test points, averaged in 30 minutes interval.

40|$|The {{precarious}} {{status of}} flat oyster Ostrea edulis stocks in Europe is widely acknowledged. To build a scientific basis for oyster restoration, an elevated experimental reef stocked with O. edulis was established within Poole Bay (Dorset, UK). Oysters were planted out on twenty four oyster reef modules (80 cm above sea bed) and compared with oysters {{held on the}} sea bed close to each reef module {{to test the hypothesis}} that a reef habitat enhances physiological performance of O. edulis and improves local biodiversity. The environmental data indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} in temperature or salinity between the elevated reefs and sea bed. Whilst total suspended solids were significantly higher at the sea bed than at 80 cm above the sea bed at every sampling interval. The filtration rates of oysters varied with elevation (reef/sea bed) and months. Filtration rates of reef oysters were significantly higher than sea bed oysters. Respiration rates varied among months but were not significantly affected by elevation. Elevation and month also affected the total number of haemocytes and the granulocyte population; reef oysters had significantly higher numbers of haemocytes than sea bed oysters. Althought geographical variation in filtration rate was also observed, this study suggested that the improved physiology of reef oysters in summer was still notable when comparing between different populations. An increase in filtration rate for reef oysters may, however, increase the likelihood of uptake of the protozoan parasite, Bonamia sp [...] However, haemocyte and haemolymph protein data suggested that there was no differential impact on physiology between reef and sea bed oysters as a result of Bonamia sp. infection. Fifty-four epifaunal species including oyster spat were found on oyster valves in reef boxes whilst only 23 species with no oyster spat were found on oyster <b>valves</b> in oyster <b>cages</b> laid on sea bed. The epifaunal community on oyster valves on reefs was significantly different from those sea bed valves but also had some species in common. Sixty-five mobile species were observed in reef boxes, whilst 47 species were recorded in oyster cages. These differences in faunal communities observed on the elevated reefs and sea bed implied that the presence of elevated reef habitats created by O. edulis valves can enhance or accelerate local diversity in Poole Bay. As current stocks of European flat oysters (O. edulis) in Europe have declined in both abundance and distribution, the results of this pilot study suggest that the culture of oysters on elevated reef structure represents at least a partial solution to improve O. edulis physiology for restoration in Europe...|$|R
