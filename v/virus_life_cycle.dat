The genome organization indicates that these two viruses have diverged from a common ancestor. Interestingly, the prominent surface turrets of the two viruses are strikingly different. By sequencing and mass spectrometry, we mapped several large insertions and deletions in the known structural proteins that could account for these differences and showed that both viruses can infect the same host.

50|$|Studies in cultured {{human lung}} {{epithelial}} cells {{infected with the}} influenza virus H1N1 or H5N1 have found that endogenous production of PD1 decreases dramatically during infection due to the inhibition of 15-LO-1. Furthermore, the same {{studies have shown that}} in vivo administration of PD1 to H1N1 infected mice can potentially inhibit both the proliferation of the virus and the inflammation caused by the infection, thus increasing survival. Interestingly, PD1 protects against viral infections by disrupting the <b>virus</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle.</b> Specifically, PD1 inhibits the binding of viral RNA to specific nuclear export factors in the host cells, thus blocking the export of viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytosol. The nuclear RNA export factor 1(NXF1) is of particular interest in the attenuation of viral infections via the activity of PD1. Specifically, the NXF1 transporter through its middle and C-terminal domains binds to the phenylalanine/glycine repeats in the nucleoporins (Nups) that line the nuclear pore. In the absence of PD1, influenza viral RNA binds to the NXF1 transporter that later binds specifically to Nup62 nucleoporin and exports the viral RNA into the cytosol. However, the administration of PD1 has shown that this lipid mediator specifically inhibits the binding of the viral RNA to NXF1, thus disrupting the proliferation of the virus.|$|E
50|$|The marburg <b>virus</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> {{begins with}} virion {{attachment}} to specific cell-surface receptors, followed by fusion of the virion envelope with cellular membranes and the concomitant {{release of the}} virus nucleocapsid into the cytosol. The virus RdRp partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-stranded mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. Marburgvirus L binds to a single promoter located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription either terminates after a gene or continues to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome are transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end are least likely to be transcribed. The gene order is therefore a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication results in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that are in turn transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near {{the inside of the}} cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane they bud from. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle.|$|E

40|$|Viral {{internal}} ribosomes entry site (IRES) elements {{coordinate the}} recruitment of the host translation machinery to direct the initiation of viral protein synthesis. Within hepatitis C virus (HCV) -like IRES elements, the sub-domain IIId(1) is crucial for recruiting the 40 S ribosomal subunit. However, some HCV-like IRES elements possess an additional sub-domain, termed IIId 2, whose function remains unclear. Herein we show that IIId 2 sub-domains from divergent viruses have different functions. The IIId 2 sub-domain present in Seneca valley virus (SVV), a picornavirus, is dispensable for IRES activity, while the IIId 2 sub-domains of two pestiviruses, classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and border disease virus (BDV), are required for 80 S ribosomes assembly and IRES activity. Unlike in SVV, the deletion of IIId 2 from the CSFV and BDV IRES elements impairs initiation of translation by inhibiting the assembly of 80 S ribosomes. Consequently, this negatively affects the replication of CSFV and BDV. Finally, we show that the SVV IIId 2 sub-domain is required for efficient viral RNA synthesis and growth of SVV, but not for IRES function.
