40|$|Potential {{ecotourism}} {{attraction in}} Rajegwesi Village, Meru Betiri National Park is high {{due to its}} high biodiversity, especially bird diversity, {{in the form of}} bird watching activity. This study was aimed to determine the species, level of abundance, and diversity of birds found in the Rajegwesi area. Further, this basic information is important to develop the bird watching track at Rajegwesi. We used Quantum-GIS to create the land classification and observation mapping. Bird observation used point count method in the morning and evening with three periods of hour and three repetitions. The study confirmed about 76 species of 39 bird families was found in Rajegwesi. The highest abundance was Pygnonotus goiavier (E:Yellow-vented Bulbul), at the meadows, <b>village,</b> and <b>rehabilitation</b> land. The diversity index showed that the highest diversity was found at the heterogeneous forest (H’ index 3. 745), followed by homogenous forest (H’ index 3. 150), rehabilitation land (H’ index 2. 845), village (H’ index 2. 693), paddy fields (H’ index 2. 529), and savanna (H’ index 1. 880). The observation track was divided into 3 lines based on the bird’s distribution, the <b>Village</b> – <b>Rehabilitation</b> Land track (6. 5 Km), Village track (2. 3 Km), and Village – Rafflessia Park track (7. 5 Km). Total of 25 bird species were found at the <b>Village</b> – <b>Rehabilitation</b> Land track, 22 species were found at the Village track, and 29 bird species were found at the Village – Rafflessia Park track. For the future of ecotourism development through birding development program, there are several issues that should be promoted: promoting birds conservation in the community through bird watching and birds observation competition (Bird race), training on conservation and ecotourism for the community, and strengthening the capacity and capability of Rajegwesi Ecotourism Society (RES) on the ecotourism program management.

The thesis explores some of the complexities and tensions that exist within the village, and their Tanzanian context as a site of healing. It highlights the importance of relationships within this healing. It is based on three months of ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Tanzania, and thirty interviews with patients and health care workers. The focus is on the importance of social relationships in healing, and on the impact of mental illness on the patients’ narratives. By allowing patients’ stories to act as the basis of the research, their voices are honoured and a new perspective emerges on mental health. It contributes to anthropological literature on narrative as well as cross-cultural understandings of illness...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with a particular form of identity politics in Turkey: attempts by state-institutions to mold society and state-society relations {{through the construction of}} space, and oppositional attempts by other state-institutions working against this. Based on a discussion of two cases, this article will show how Turkish state institutions have attempted to shape society through spatial means, but with rather limited success specifically due to the contradictory moves on the part of other institutions. The first case is the so-called ‘Anatolia Return to <b>Village</b> and <b>Rehabilitation</b> Project Sub-Regional Development Plan’, a master plan {{for the development of a}} new settlement structure in the war-affected southeast of Turkey. Implementation of this master-plan, drafted under auspices of the Regional Development Administration of the Southeast Anatolia Project (GAP-BKI), is obstructed by other state-institutions, in particular the governorships in the region. The resulting stalemate derives from the different aims and objectives motivating institutional thinking: while GAP-BKI plans are shaped by a developmental approach, the governors’ thoughts and actions are dictated by security concerns. The second case is an urban one, the names and renaming strategies for the names attached to streets, parks and other public places in cities (in the same area, Turkey’s southeast). This case will show how municipalities, run by a pro-Kurdish party, attempt to bring names representing a struggle for Kurdish and social rights into the existing city-text. These two cases afford a particular perspective on the internal composition of the political system – an uncovering enabled by the particularly fraught circumstances of this region and its recent geo-political history. Taken together, they suggest that ‘the state’ as such does not exist as a real entity, but only as a cluster of institutions which do not have any necessary unity, and may, on the contrary, be inherently contradictory and conflicting with each othe...|$|R
