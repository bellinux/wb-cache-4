25|$|A {{dedicated}} <b>voltage</b> <b>comparator</b> chip such as LM339 {{is designed}} to interface with a digital logic interface (to a TTL or a CMOS). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see analog to digital converter). If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just {{the equivalent of a}} cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small Schottky diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.|$|E

Also known as transconveyance amplifiers, CTAs amplify electronic signals by dynamically conveying charge between capacitive nodes {{in proportion to}} the size of a differential input voltage. By appropriately selecting the relative node capacitances, voltage amplification occurs by the charge-voltage relationship of capacitors. CTAs are clocked, or sampling, amplifiers. They consume zero static power and can be designed to consume (theoretically) arbitrarily low dynamic power, proportional to the size of input signals being sampled. CMOS technology is most commonly used for implementation. CTAs were introduced in memory circuits in the 1970s, and more recently have been applied in multi-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

5000|$|With {{two or more}} base {{resistors}} (R3 and R4) {{instead of}} one, the inverter becomes a two-input RTL NOR gate (see the figure on the right). The logical operation OR is performed by applying consecutively the two arithmetic operations addition and comparison (the input resistor network acts as a parallel voltage summer with equally weighted inputs and the following common-emitter transistor stage as a <b>voltage</b> <b>comparator</b> with a threshold about 0.7 V). The equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical [...] "1" [...] and the equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical [...] "0" [...] form the two legs of a composed voltage divider driving the transistor.

If all the input voltages are low (logical [...] "0"), the transistor is cut-off. The pull-down resistor R1 biases the transistor to the appropriate on-off threshold. The output is inverted since the collector-emitter voltage of transistor Q1 is taken as output, and is high when the inputs are low.
