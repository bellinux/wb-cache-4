5|$|Historically, selos were {{a type of}} Russian rural locality, {{consisting}} of a large <b>village</b> <b>with</b> a church. Most selos in the republic were established {{in the second half}} of the 19th century on lands abandoned by the Circassians.|$|E
5|$|The River Yar trail {{runs through}} the <b>village</b> <b>with</b> the {{milestone}} outside the village Pub. In addition to this, bridleways are maintained, running to nearby villages Wroxall and Niton. Future plans could see a pedestrian link from Whitwell to Niton along the main road.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{property}} in the village is older than the early 17th century, its layout reflects its development in medieval times as a planned village. Eight toft compartments are discernible {{to the west of}} Main Street, and the outline of the four surrounding common fields, now divided, may be identified from the pattern of dry stone walls. The fields were largely arable, providing the <b>village</b> <b>with</b> most of its food requirements, but are now farmed exclusively for pasture and hay. The village manor house was on land now occupied by Hebden Hall {{at the south end of}} Main Street.|$|E
30|$|Another {{dimension}} {{to examine the}} heterogeneity of program’s impact is through the intensity of different Yigong-daizhen projects. It {{is likely that the}} impact of such projects should be larger in <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> more numbers of such projects, or more local labor participation. Therefore, we will compare the impact of Yigong-daizhen projects in <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> only one such project to the <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> more than one projects. Also, we will compare the impact in <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> below average labor participation for the Yigong-daizhen projects to the <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> above average labor participation in these projects.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{a smaller}} part of Ottoman census from 1582—1583 dealt with Montenegro (Vilâyet-i Karaca-dağ) as {{separate}} administrative unit within Sanjak of Scutari. This part consisted of following nahiyah and villages: Grbavci <b>with</b> 13 <b>villages,</b> Župa <b>with</b> 11 <b>villages,</b> Malonšići <b>with</b> 7 <b>villages,</b> Plješivci <b>with</b> 14 <b>villages,</b> Cetinje <b>with</b> 16 <b>villages,</b> Rijeka <b>with</b> 31 <b>villages,</b> Cernica (Crmnica) <b>with</b> 11 <b>villages,</b> Paštrovići <b>with</b> 36 <b>villages,</b> Grbalj <b>with</b> 9 <b>villages.</b> There {{was a total}} of 148 villages belonging to the Montenegrin subdivision.|$|R
30|$|Panel A {{employs a}} triple {{difference}} approach {{to compare the}} impact of Yigong-daizhen projects in <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> only one such project to <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> more than one projects. The dummy variable “more than one” equals to one for <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> more than one Yigong-daizhen projects, otherwise zero. The other specifications {{are the same as}} in Table  8. The consistently positive and significant coefficients across different specifications indicate that the impact of Yigong-daizhen projects is larger in <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> higher program intensity, i.e., more number of projects.|$|R
5|$|Gourley competed at the 2010 IPC Alpine Skiing World Cup in Italy and World Cup in Austria. Going {{into the}} 2010 Winter Paralympic Games, his best ever world ranking was 17th. He {{attempted}} to bulk {{up and put}} on additional weight by eating six to eight meals a day. He arrived in the Paralympic <b>village</b> <b>with</b> the rest of Australia's Para-alpine team on 9 March 2010. Coached by Steve Graham, he competed in the downhill, super-G, giant slalom, slalom and super combined events. In the super-G standing event, he finished 10th. He also finished 27th in the slalom. He came 30th in the giant slalom event.|$|E
5|$|Kali is a winch {{operator}} at {{a village}} power plant. Although a reputed troublemaker, he occasionally does good deeds {{for the local}} community. Kali and his younger sister Vallito whom he is devotedwere orphaned during their childhood and have no close family. When a poor wanderer named Manga and her aged mother arrive in the <b>village</b> <b>with</b> no assets and no-one to assist them, Valli helps them set up their home in the village. Although Manga becomes fond of Kali, he is disgusted by her fondness for food.|$|E
5|$|Lajjun is {{situated}} on an elevated hill with {{an altitude of}} 150 meters above sea level, located on the southwestern edge of the Jezreel Valley (Marj ibn Amer). The village is located on both the banks of Wadi al-Lajjun, with Jenin and the entire valley visible from it. It is bordered by Tall al-Mutsallem to the northeast, and by Tall al-Asmar to the northwest. Lajjun, which was linked by secondary roads to the Jenin-Haifa road, and the road that led southwest {{to the town of}} Umm al-Fahm, laid close to the junctions of the two highways. The main spring that supplied the <b>village</b> <b>with</b> water was Ayn al-Hajja.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{its modern}} European economy and society, Slovakia has a {{significant}} rural element. About 45% of Slovaks live in <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, and 14% in <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> fewer than 1,000.|$|R
30|$|Panel B employs similar {{estimation}} {{strategy as}} in Panel A {{to compare the}} impact of Yigong-daizhen projects in <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> above average labor use for such projects to <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> below average labor use. The dummy variable “labor intensive” equals to one for <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> above average labor days participation in Yigong-daizhen projects, otherwise zero. The positive and significant coefficients in the four specifications indicate that out-migration flow due to Yigong-daizhen projects is larger in <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> more local labor participated in such projects. This is reasonable since more labor participation {{is likely to be}} correlated with more local laborers receiving cash income to finance their migration.|$|R
40|$|Highlights • Net {{settlement}} of families {{is higher in}} smaller <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> higher levels of scenic beauty. • Net {{settlement of}} older people is higher in larger <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> higher levels of service. • Net settlement of young adults is higher in <b>villages</b> <b>with</b> lower levels of scenic beauty and less owner occupied housing. • No evidence was found that accessibility {{and a large number}} of nearby jobs greatly influence flows of movers of villages...|$|R
5|$|Mala and the Eskimos go {{bowhead whale}} hunting in wooden boats and with {{harpoons}} {{provided by the}} white men, and an actual whale hunt and carcass slaughtering is depicted on film. After the successful hunt, two drunken white men kidnap Aba (and prevent Mala from rescuing her) and force her to get drunk. The ship captain rapes Aba, who escapes at dawn. The Captain's Mate, hunting seals with a rifle, mistakes Aba (passed out on the ice) for an animal and kills her. Mala kills the ship captain with a harpoon (mistakenly believing the captain shot his wife). He flees back to his <b>village</b> <b>with</b> his children.|$|E
5|$|Navenby was {{originally}} an agricultural <b>village,</b> <b>with</b> most people {{living off the}} land or trading goods in the local market. Statistics show that, in 1841, 48% of villagers worked in agriculture, but today the majority of villagers, 67%, are employed in the service industry and most commute to work away from Navenby. The village does, however, offer limited work opportunities, with the High Street lined with shops, fast-food stores and public houses. A doctors' surgery, building society and residential care home are based in the village, although the post office closed in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|North of Grand Gorge, NY30 crosses into Schoharie County and intersects NY990V, {{one of four}} {{reference}} {{routes in}} New York erroneously signed as a touring route, near the northeastern edge of the Schoharie Reservoir in Gilboa. From NY990V northward, NY30 follows the Schoharie Creek through Schoharie County to Middleburgh, where it intersects NY145. To the north in Schoharie, NY30 meets NY443 before splitting into NY30 and NY30A north of the <b>village,</b> <b>with</b> Schoharie Creek largely following NY30A. While NY30A connects to Interstate88 (I-88) by way of an interchange a short distance to the north, NY30 has no connection to the freeway. Just past I-88, NY30 intersects NY7. Shortly after passing NY7, NY30 enters Schenectady County.|$|E

5|$|The {{configuration}} of the relay tracks is evidence of the original plans to build {{an extension of the}} Queens Boulevard Line further east into Queens. The line would have continued under Hillside Avenue to Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (both formerly Rocky Hill Road) in Queens <b>Village,</b> <b>with</b> later plans to extend the line to Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The upper level was to be extended eastward while the lower level tracks were always intended to be relay tracks. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the lower level tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks.|$|E
