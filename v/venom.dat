5|$|According to the {{hypothesis}} that snake <b>venom</b> had a single evolutionary origin, <b>venom</b> {{in a number of}} lineages of snakes subsequently atrophied. Evidence of such atrophication has been found in several snakes. A 2005 study in the marbled sea snake, Aipysurus eydouxii found that the gene for a three-fingered protein found in the <b>venom</b> had undergone a deletion of two nucleotide bases which made the <b>venom</b> 50-100 times less toxic than it had been previously. This change was correlated with a change in diet from fish to a diet consisting almost entirely of fish eggs, suggesting that the adaptation to an egg diet had removed the selection pressure needed to maintain a highly toxic <b>venom,</b> allowing the <b>venom</b> genes to accumulate deleterious mutations. A similar <b>venom</b> degradation following a shift to an egg-based diet has been found in the Common egg-eater Dasypeltis scabra, whose diet consists entirely of birds' eggs, meaning that the snake had no use for its <b>venom.</b> This has led biologists to suggest that if <b>venom</b> is not used by a species, it is rapidly lost.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} various viperid and elapid <b>venoms</b> on the {{cellular}} biology of tumour-associated microvascular endothelial cells (TAMECs) were determined {{in the current}} study using cells isolated from a rat mammary adenocarcinoma. Previous studies {{to determine the effects of}} snake <b>venoms</b> on endothelial cells in vitro have in the main been performed on either human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) or endothelial cell lines. These cell populations are accessible and easy to maintain in culture, however, it is well established that endothelial cells display vast heterogeneity depending upon the local microenvironment of the tissue from which they are isolated. Vascular targeting agents have been isolated from a variety of snake <b>venoms,</b> particularly from snakes of the Viperidae family, but it is yet to be established to what extent the <b>venoms</b> from Australian elapids possess similar vascular targeting properties. The present study used endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from the microvasculature of a rat mammary adenocarcinoma to determine the effects of a panel of snake <b>venoms,</b> including viperid <b>venoms</b> with known apoptotic activity and elapid <b>venoms</b> (both exotic and indigenous to Australia), on endothelial morphology and viability, paying specific attention to apoptotic responses. Three of the five Australian snake <b>venoms</b> investigated in this study elicited significant apoptotic responses in ECs which were in many ways similar to responses elicited by the selected viperid <b>venoms.</b> This suggests that these Australian elapids may possess vascular targeting components similar to those found within viperid <b>venoms.</b> Emma Bateman, Michael Venning, Peter Mirtschin and Anthony Wood...|$|R

5|$|Before <b>venom</b> {{immunotherapy}}, {{whole body}} extract immunotherapy was widely used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation. Whole body extract immunotherapy was later proven to be ineffective, and <b>venom</b> immunotherapy was found to be safe and effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting <b>venom.</b> The identification of <b>venom</b> allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. Whole body extracts were first used to desensitize patients, but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn. <b>Venom</b> immunotherapy was shown {{to reduce the risk of}} systemic reactions, demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant-sting allergies.|$|E
5|$|CT {{scanning}} of {{the known}} specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of the <b>venom</b> hypothesis. The canals leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the trigeminal nerve as well as blood vessels. However, {{the fact that the}} canals also directly lead to the root of the canines would suggest that they had a secondary role in <b>venom</b> delivery. In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a <b>venom</b> gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of the <b>venom</b> (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for <b>venom</b> delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl. Benoit et al. noted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver <b>venom</b> through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{duplication}} is not {{the only}} way that <b>venom</b> has become more diverse. There have been instances of new <b>venom</b> proteins generated by alternative splicing. The Elapid snake Bungarus fasciatus, for example, possesses a gene that is alternatively spliced to yield both a <b>venom</b> component and a physiological protein. Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific <b>venom</b> components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor is believed to have had genes for neurotoxic PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic Crotalus species. The various recruitment events had resulted in snake <b>venom</b> evolving into a very complex mixture of proteins. The <b>venom</b> of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families, and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins. The composition of this mixture has been shown to vary geographically, and to be related to the prey species available in a certain region. Snake <b>venom</b> has generally evolved very quickly, with changes occurring faster in the <b>venom</b> than in the rest of the organism.|$|E

30|$|Insulinotropic {{peptides}} {{are various}} kinds of protein molecules that can stimulate insulin secretion by the pancreatic islets β-cells through different pathways. Over the past decades, several families of insulinotropic peptides have been discovered in lizard <b>venoms</b> [3], snake <b>venoms</b> [4], wasp <b>venoms</b> [5], the black widow spider toxins [6] and so forth. Exentides (exentide- 1, - 2, - 3 and - 4) isolated from lizard <b>venoms</b> belong to the glucagon superfamily peptides, {{most of which are}} structurally homologous and can increase insulin release, including glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide and other members. The glucagon superfamily peptides are usually single-chain peptides consisting of 27 – 39 amino acids. However, insulin-releasing peptides purified from snake <b>venoms</b> and spider <b>venoms</b> (e.g. PLA 2 and α-LTX) are commonly much larger polymers with molecular weights around 12 – 130  kDa, which are assembled of several subunits [7, 8]. Mastoparans and temporins are the smallest insulinotropic peptides obtained respectively from wasp <b>venoms</b> and amphibian skin secretions. Native mastoparan is a tetradecapeptide stimulating insulin secretion at a late stage in the secretary pathway [9, 10]. While temporins, the smallest antibacterial peptides from the skin of Rana temporaria, bear insulin-releasing activity with a length of merely 10 – 13 amino acids [11, 12].|$|R

5|$|In 1944, {{writing as}} Major Harold Ridley FRCS RAMC, the English {{ophthalmic}} surgeon published a short {{paper in the}} British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and {{an account of the}} composition and action of snake <b>venom</b> in general.

Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake <b>venom,</b> he conjectured that in the future diluted <b>venom</b> or a constituent of <b>venom</b> might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.|$|E

40|$|Snake {{envenomation}} is {{a serious}} public health threat {{in the rural areas}} of Asia and Africa. To date, the only proven treatment for snake envenomation is antivenom therapy. Owing to the difficulties in the diagnosis of the biting species, {{there is a need to}} develop polyvalent antivenoms that could cross-neutralize <b>venoms</b> of medically important venomous snakes in the various regions. Recently, Thai Red Cross Society from Thailand has developed a new polyvalent antivenom for treatment of cobra and krait <b>venoms.</b> The polyvalent antivenom, termed “Neuro Polyvalent Snake Antivenom (NPAV),” is raised against <b>venoms</b> of two Thai cobras and two Thai kraits. Our results indicated that the polyvalent antivenom can effectively neutralize <b>venoms</b> from many Southeast Asian cobras, kraits and king cobra but is less effective against Indian cobra <b>venoms.</b> Studies using anesthetized rats showed that NPAV can effectively protect against cobra venom-induced cardio-respiratory depressant and neuromuscular blocking effects, confirming that the antivenom can effectively neutralize the major lethal toxins of common cobra <b>venoms.</b> This new antivenom may find potential application in the treatment of elapid bites in Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia, a neighboring nation of Thailand...|$|R

5|$|Snakes {{use their}} <b>venom</b> {{to kill or}} subdue prey, {{as well as for}} other diet-related functions, such as digestion. Current {{scientific}} theory suggests that snake <b>venom</b> is not used for defense or for competition between members of the same species, unlike in other taxa. Thus adaptive evolution in snake <b>venom</b> has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history of snake <b>venom</b> {{is a matter}} of debate. The common view of this history before 2014 was that <b>venom</b> originated just once among all Toxicofera approximately 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today. Under this hypothesis, the original toxicoferan <b>venom</b> was a very simple set of proteins that were assembled in a pair of glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins diversified in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including Serpentes, Anguimorpha, and Iguania. Several snake lineages subsequently lost the ability to produce <b>venom,</b> often due to a change in diet.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} <b>venom</b> {{had a single}} {{evolutionary}} origin has been called into question by a 2015 study, which found that <b>venom</b> proteins had homologs in many other tissues in the Burmese python. The study therefore suggested that <b>venom</b> had evolved independently {{in a number of}} snake lineages.|$|E
50|$|International Society on Toxinology (IST) is {{a global}} society of {{scientists}} and clinicians working {{for the advancement of}} <b>venoms,</b> poisons and toxins.

50|$|Although {{individuals}} can {{vary in their}} physiopathological response and sensitivity to animal <b>venoms,</b> there is no natural immunity to them in humans. Some ophiophagic animals are immune to the <b>venoms</b> produced by some species of venomous snakes, {{by the presence of}} antihemorrhagic and antineurotoxic factors in their blood.|$|R
50|$|Because {{neurotoxic}} <b>venoms</b> {{must travel}} farther {{in the body}} to do harm and are produced in smaller quantities, {{it is easier to}} develop resistance to them than directly cytotoxic <b>venoms</b> (such as those of most vipers) that are injected in large quantity and do damage immediately upon injection.|$|R
5|$|The natural diets {{of snakes}} in the {{widespread}} viper genus Echis are highly varied, and include arthropods, such as scorpions, {{as well as}} vertebrates. Various Echis species consume different quantities of arthropods in their diet. A study carried out in 2009 injected scorpions with the <b>venom</b> of various Echis species, and found a high correlation between the proportion of arthropods that the snakes consumed in their natural habitat, and the toxicity of their <b>venom</b> to scorpions. The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of <b>venom</b> more toxic to arthropods was related {{to an increase in}} the proportion of arthropods in the snakes' diet, and that diet and <b>venom</b> may have evolved by a process of coevolution. A phylogeny of the genus constructed using mitochondrial DNA showed that one instance of a change in <b>venom</b> composition in the species ancestral to all Echis snakes was correlated with a shift to an arthropod based diet, whereas another shift in a more recent lineage was correlated with a shift to a diet of vertebrates. Despite the higher toxicity of the <b>venom</b> of arthropod-consuming species, it was not found to incapacitate or kill prey any faster than that of species with fewer arthropods in their diet. Thus, the <b>venom</b> is thought to have evolved to minimize the volume required, as the production of <b>venom</b> carries a significant metabolic cost, thus providing a fitness benefit. This pattern is also found in other lineages. Similar results were obtained by a 2012 study which found that the <b>venom</b> of arthropod-consuming Echis species was more toxic to locusts than that of vertebrate-consuming species.|$|E
5|$|The single-origin {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the mechanism of evolution in most cases has been gene duplication followed by natural selection for adaptive traits. Some of the various adaptations produced by this process include <b>venom</b> more toxic to specific prey in several lineages, proteins that pre-digest prey, and a method to track down prey after a bite. These various adaptations of <b>venom</b> have also led to considerable debate about the definition of <b>venom</b> and venomous snakes.|$|E

50|$|Myotoxins are small, basic {{peptides}} {{found in}} snake <b>venoms,</b> (e.g. rattlesnakes), and lizard <b>venoms</b> (e.g. mexican beaded lizard).
