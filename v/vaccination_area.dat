The brand name 'Poximune® C' by Ceva is a freeze-dried vaccine, administered by the 'wing web' method to healthy, susceptible passerine birds who have reached at least four weeks of age. Booster vaccination is recommended every 6-12 months if the risk of disease remains high. Pox lesion formation around the <b>vaccination</b> <b>area</b> is indicative that the vaccine has been effective.

The previous census (' 82 /' 85) revealed only 66 inhabited setts. The situation of the species seems therefore better now. That small population increase is thought to be the consequence of the change in the rabies control policy. Systematic gassing of dens was stopped in 1982 and oral vaccination of foxes started in 1986. Three vaccination campaigns were conducted in 1986 and 1987 in an area extending along the border of the grand duchy of Luxembourg and covering approximately half of the badger census zone. In the <b>vaccination</b> <b>area,</b> more new dens were digged and more old ones were occupied again than in the unvaccinated zone whereas a greater number was abandoned or destroyed in the latter one.

According to a veterinary officer, the 2014 outbreak started in Tubu, an area within the swamp, ‘…that cattle crush and the surrounding cattle posts were surrounded with water following the floods and were inaccessible…so they missed the routine vaccination…’ (Expert interview data, veterinary officer, Maun, 2015). However, pastoralists blamed the outbreak on elephants which destroy veterinary fences allowing cattle to cross to the buffalo area or vice versa. Following the outbreak, the Department of Veterinary Services imposed stringent livestock movement protocols on herders.

The two main objectives of yellow fever control programs in Brazil are {{to reduce the number of}} wild cases and to maintain zero incidence of urban cases. Although there is a consensus regarding control measures that should be applied in areas endemic for the wild form, this is not so in relation to areas infested by Aedes aegypti. The arguments for and against expansion of the <b>vaccination</b> <b>area</b> are discussed.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Many {{economic}} {{evaluations of}} HPV vaccination have been published, but most {{have focused on}} the prevention of cervical disease as a primary health outcome. The cost-effectiveness of vaccination is likely to be underestimated if not all HPV-associated diseases are taken into account. In this review, we assess the influence of non-cervical HPV-associated diseases on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of preadolescent HPV <b>vaccination.</b> <b>Areas</b> covered: We systematically searched the literature and identified 18 studies that included non-cervical diseases in the estimates of cost-effectiveness of HPV-vaccination. When taking other HPV-related diseases into account compared to not including such other diseases, the mean ICERs were 2. 85 times more favorable for girls only vaccination and 3. 89 times for gender neutral vaccination. Expert commentary: Including non-cervical diseases in economic evaluations of HPV vaccination programs makes it more likely that the ICER falls beneath accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds and therefore increases the scope for gender neutral vaccination...|$|R
40|$|Expanded {{access to}} measles {{vaccination}} {{was among the}} most successful public health interventions of recent decades. All WHO regions currently target measles elimination by 2020, yet continued measles circulation makes that goal seem elusive. Using Demographic and Health Surveys with generalized additive models, we quantify spatial patterns of measles vaccination in ten contiguous countries in the African Great Lakes region between 2009 – 2014. Seven countries have ‘coldspots’ where vaccine coverage is below the WHO target of 80 %. Over 14 million children under 5 years of age live in coldspots across the region, and a total of 8 – 12 million children are unvaccinated. Spatial patterns of vaccination do not map directly onto sub-national administrative units and transnational coldspots exist. Clustering of low <b>vaccination</b> <b>areas</b> may allow for pockets of susceptibility that sustain circulation despite high overall coverage.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the investigation of}} a sylvatic yellow fever outbreak {{in the state of}} Sao Paulo and the main control measures undertaken. METHODS: This is a descriptive study of a sylvatic yellow fever outbreak in the Southwestern region of the state from February to April 2009. Suspected and confirmed cases in humans and in non-human primates were evaluated. Entomological investigation in sylvatic environment involved capture at ground level and in the tree canopy to identify species and detect natural infections. Control measures were performed in urban areas to control Aedes aegypti. Vaccination was directed at residents living in areas with confirmed viral circulation and also at nearby cities according to national recommendation. RESULTS: Twenty-eight human cases were confirmed (39. 3 % case fatality rate) in rural areas of Sarutaia, Piraju, Tejupa, Avare, and Buri. The deaths of 56 non-human primates were also reported, 91. 4 % were Allouatta sp. Epizootics was confirmed in two non-human primates in the cities of Itapetininga and Buri. A total of 1, 782 mosquitoes were collected, including Haemagogus leucocelaenus, Hg. janthinomys/capricornii, and Sabethes chloropterus, Sa. purpureus and Sa. undosus. Yellow fever virus was isolated from a group of Hg. Leucocelaenus from Buri. Vaccination was carried out in 49 cities, with a total of 1, 018, 705 doses. Nine serious post-vaccination adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The cases occurred between February and April 2009 in areas with no recorded yellow fever virus circulation in over 60 years. The outbreak region occurred outside the original recommended <b>vaccination</b> <b>area</b> with a high percentage of susceptible population. The fast adoption of control measures interrupted the human transmission within a month and the confirmation of viral circulation in humans, monkeys and mosquitoes.

40|$|Oral {{vaccination}} as {{a method}} of rabies eradication in the field was first started in Switzerland in 1978 and after 1984 several other EU countries followed this practice. Due to oral vaccination some European countries are now rabies-free in terrestrial animals. In Slovenia, after the first experimental oral vaccination and study of vaccination models from 1988 - 1992, the spring-autumn campaigns have been carried out since 1995. The model of oral vaccination of wildlife requires 16 - 20 baits per km 2 in the <b>vaccination</b> <b>area.</b> The baits were distributed by plane. They were dispersed from a height of 300 - 500 m. The aeroplanes' paths were 1000 metres apart. In the vaccination campaigns two vaccines were used. Lysvulpen®, produced by the Bioveta company at the Czech Republic, was laid down in the southwestern part of the country, and Fuchsoral®, produced by the German company Impfstoffwerk Dessau-Tornau, was placed {{in the eastern part of}} Slovenia. A rapid decline of rabies was evidenced from 1995 to 1999, when the oral vaccination program in the whole territory using the aircraft baits distributing system was practiced. In 1999, only 6 rabies cases were laboratory-confirmed, whereas in 1995, 1089 rabies cases were documented. Of the 14 rabies cases detected in 1998, 12 were found as an island in a circle with a radius of 30 km in the centre of the vaccinated area. In 2000 and 2001, rabies incidence increased again, so it was decided to change the baits distribution system in the year 2001. The vaccination by crossing flights in certain areas was introduced. In the next year (2002), after changing the vaccination strategy, positive cases rapidly dropped and only 15 cases in 2002, and 8 cases were found in 2003, near the non-vaccinated border with Croatia...|$|E
40|$|Outbreaks {{of yellow}} fever (YF) {{have never been}} {{recorded}} in Kenya. However, in September 1992, cases of hemorrhagic fever (HF) were reported in the Kerio Valley to the Kenya Ministry of Health. Early in 1993, the disease was confirmed as YF and a mass vaccination campaign was initiated. Cases of suspected YF were identified through medical record review and hospital-based disease surveillance by using a clinical case definition. Case-patients were confirmed serologically and virologically. We documented 55 persons with HF from three districts of the Rift Valley Province {{in the period of}} September 10, 1992 through March 11, 1993 (attack rate = 27. 4 / 100, 000 population). Twenty-six (47 %) of the 55 persons had serologic evidence of recent YF infection, and three of these persons were also confirmed by YF virus isolation. No serum was available from the other 29 HF cases. In addition, YF virus was isolated from a person from the epidemic area who had a nonspecific febrile illness but did not meet the case definition. Five patients with confirmed cases of YF died, a case-fatality rate of 19 %. Women with confirmed cases of YF were 10. 9 times more likely to die than men (P = 0. 010, by Fisher's exact test). Of the 26 patients with serologic or virologic evidence of YF, and for whom definite age was known, 21 (81 %) were between 10 and 39 years of age, and 19 (73 %) were males. All patients with confirmed YF infection lived in rural areas. There was only one instance of multiple cases within a single family, and this was associated with bush-clearing activity. This was the first documented outbreak of YF in Kenya, a classic example of a sylvatic transmission cycle.

During six immunizations (spring 1995 to autumn 1997) 666300 baits were set out at lure places. On average 80. 7 % of the lures were not traceable afterwards. The success of oral immunization was examined by the development of swine fever positive-findings within the swine fever endangered district and by the seroconversion in the entire <b>vaccination</b> <b>area.</b> Due to the oral immunization the classical swine fever prevalence decreased from 4. 65 % in March 1995 to 0. 58 % in December 1997.

Specific investigations on ORV in raccoon dogs are needed e. g. evaluation of vaccine effectiveness under field conditions. The objective {{of the current study}} was to investigate the efficacy of the ORV programme 2006 - 2010 in Lithuania by examining the number of rabies cases and estimating the prevalences of a tetracycline biomarker (TTC) and rabies virus antibodies in raccoon dogs. Methods From 2006 to 2010, 12. 5 million rabies vaccine-baits were distributed by aircraft. Baiting occurred twice per year (spring and autumn), targeting raccoon dogs and red foxes in a 63, 000 km 2 area of Lithuania. The mandibles of raccoon dogs found dead or killed in the <b>vaccination</b> <b>area</b> were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for the presence of the TTC. Rabies virus sera neutralizing anti-glycoprotein antibody titres were determined using an indirect ELISA method and seroconversion (> 0. 5 EU/ml) rates were estimated. Results During the study period, 51. 5 % of raccoon dog mandibles were positive for TTC. 1688 of 3260 tested adults and 69 of 175 tested cubs were TTC positive. Forty-seven percent of raccoon dog serum samples were positive for rabies virus antibodies. 302 of 621 investigated adults and 33 of 95 investigated cubs were seropositive. In the same time 302 of 684 and 43 of 124 tested samples were TTC and ELISA positive in spring; whereas 1455 of 2751 and 292 of 592 tested samples were TTC and ELISA positive in autumn.

Pakistan reportedly achieved all milestones except interrupting virus transmission. This paper describes the perceptions of health workers and managers regarding constraints in the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) to ultimately provide evidence for designing future interventions. Methods A qualitative cross-sectional study using focus group discussions and in-depth interviews was conducted in the Nankana Sahib District of Pakistan's Punjab province. Study subjects included staff at all levels in the PEI at district headquarters, in all 4 tehsils (sub-districts) and at 20 randomly selected primary health centers. In total, 4 FGD and 7 interview sessions were conducted and individual session summary notes were prepared and later synthesized, consolidated and subjected to conceptual analysis. Results The main constraints identified {{in the study were}} the poor condition of the cold chain in all aspects, poor skills and a lack of authority in resource allocation and human resource management, limited advocacy and communication resources, a lack of skills and training among staff at all levels in the PEI/EPI in almost all aspects of the program, a deficiency of public health professionals, poor health services structure, administrative issues (including ineffective means of performance evaluation, bureaucratic and political influences, problems in <b>vaccination</b> <b>areas</b> and field programs, no birth records at health facilities, and poor linkage between different preventive programs), unreliable reporting and poor monitoring and supervision systems, limited use of local data for interventions, and unclear roles and responsibilities after decentralization.

Notable findings in raccoons were limited to focal microscopic ulcerations at scarification sites. In 24 experimentally-infected FIV+, FeLV+, FeLV+ and FIP+, and uninfected cats, oral and intradermal inoculation of V-RG vaccine produced no clinically detectable adverse effects. In athymic nude mice, multi-systemic infection followed severe intradermal V-RG inoculation, but with a decrease in positive tissues and viral titers over time. In SCID mice, V-RG was innocuous by the oral route. Parenteral V-RG inoculation produced progressive lesions but at a significantly slower rate than with vaccinia.

40|$|Introduction: An {{effective}} {{vaccine that}} can protect people against {{infection of the}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) remains elusive. HIV- 1 vaccine research has encountered several false starts and a few causes for hope over the last 28 years, but no real success stories. Thus, {{it is time to}} think out of the box and design and test unorthodox <b>vaccination</b> strategies. <b>Areas</b> covered: Recent studies in mice and monkeys have revealed the potential of a gene therapy that provides vaccine-like protection against HIV- 1 infection by producing a potent vector-encoded antibody that neutralizes the invading viruses. This novel strategy is called Vectored Immuno Prophylaxis or VIP, and it circumvents the sometimes difficult phases of regular vaccination protocols, that is, antigen design and induction of protective immune responses. Expert opinion: VIP is a prolonged form of passive immunization by means of a gene therapy. We will discuss {{the ins and outs of}} VIP and the therapeutic possibilities and challenge...|$|R
40|$|Do current {{vaccines}} aid in reproductive performance? Can a {{vaccination program}} help prevent reproductive loss from diseases? During gestation, the bovine reproductive system, with its multilayered placenta, leaves the fetus in a naive environment susceptible to infection. Abortions may occur due to {{infection of the}} pla-centa, inflammation of the ovary, death of the fetus and/or disruption of the cervical plug. So reproductive disease is the hardest to protect against. Vaccination must minimize the amount/ duration of the viremia/septicemia or prevent disease from moving through the cervix. Reproductive diseases and protection against them through <b>vaccination</b> are <b>areas</b> of active research today. With current research, a vaccination program {{to aid in the}} control of reproductive diseases can be established. Un-fortunately, {{there is little or no}} research regard-ing reproductive disease. Due to the numerous causes of reproductive failures (of which in-fectious agents are a small percentage), vacci-nation to prevent infectious reproductive losses may not appear to be effective. This is ofte...|$|R
