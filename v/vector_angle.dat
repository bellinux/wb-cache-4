40|$|Abstract—An {{important}} {{problem in}} color-based image retrieval and video segmentation is to lack {{information about how}} color is spatially distributed. To solve this problem and enhance the per-formance of image and video analyses, a spatial color descriptor is proposed involving a color adjacency histogram and color <b>vector</b> <b>angle</b> histogram. The color adjacency histogram represents the spatial distribution of color pairs at color edges in an image, thereby incorporating spatial information into the proposed color descriptor. Meanwhile, the color <b>vector</b> <b>angle</b> histogram repre-sents the global color distribution of smooth pixels in an image. Since the proposed color descriptor includes spatial adjacency information between colors, it can robustly reduce {{the effect of a}} significant change in appearance and shape in image and video analyses. Moreover, since the color adjacency histogram is simply represented by binary streams, the storage space required for the image histogram values can be effectively reduced. Experimental results show that even with significant appearance changes, the proposed color descriptor could produce a high image retrieval rate and accurately detect abrupt scene-cuts in a video analysis.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the last eleven years, the concept of thrust {{vectoring}} has emerged as a promising method of enhancing aircraft control capabilities in post-stall flight incursions during combat. In order to study the application of simultaneous pitch and yaw vectoring to single expansion ramp nozzles, a static test was conducted in the NASA-Langley 16 foot transonic tunnel. This investigation was based on internal performance data provided by force, mass flow and internal pressure measurements at nozzle pressure ratios up to 8. The internal performance characteristics of the nozzle were studied for several combinations of six different parameters: yaw <b>vectoring</b> <b>angle,</b> pitch <b>vectoring</b> <b>angle,</b> upper ramp cutout, sidewall hinge location, hinge inclination angle and sidewall containment. Results indicated a 2 -to- 3 -percent decrease in resultant thrust ratio with vectoring in either pitch or yaw. Losses were mostly associated with the turning of supersonic flow. Resultant thrust ratios were also decreased by sideways expansion of the jet. The effects of cutback corners in the upper ramp and lower flap on performance were small.
