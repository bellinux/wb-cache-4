5000|$|A {{waveform}} monitor {{is often used}} in conjunction with a <b>vectorscope.</b> Originally, these were separate devices; however modern {{waveform monitor}}s include <b>vectorscope</b> functionality as a separate mode. (The combined device is simply called a [...] "waveform monitor").|$|E
50|$|In video applications, a <b>vectorscope</b> {{supplements}} a {{waveform monitor}} {{for the purpose}} of measuring and testing television signals, regardless of format (NTSC, PAL, SECAM or any number of digital television standards). While a waveform monitor allows a broadcast technician to measure the overall characteristics of a video signal, a <b>vectorscope</b> is used to visualize chrominance, which is encoded into the video signal as a subcarrier of specific frequency. The <b>vectorscope</b> locks exclusively to the chrominance subcarrier in the video signal (at 3.58 MHz for NTSC, or at 4.43 MHz for PAL) to drive its display. In digital applications, a <b>vectorscope</b> instead plots the Cb and Cr channels against each other (these are the two channels in digital formats which contain chroma information).|$|E
5000|$|In some <b>vectorscope</b> models, {{only one}} set of bar targets is provided. The <b>vectorscope</b> {{can be set up}} for 75% or 100% bars by {{adjusting}} the gain so that the color burst vector extends to the [...] "75%" [...] or [...] "100%" [...] marking on the graticule.|$|E

40|$|Abstract ⎯ The paper {{presents}} a multimedia interactive course for teaching {{the operation of}} communications and audiovisual equipment. The objectives of the course are the following: providing a tool for undergraduate students which enables the self-learning of the equipment basis and operation, helping the students {{to get used to}} the laboratory equipment and trying to improve their understanding of the equipment operation, use and theoretical basis, supporting the students during the practical classes and speeding up the laboratory classes. The course must be considered as a supporting tool for the laboratory classes, not as a substitution of these classes. The course consists of a set of videos which explain the theoretical fundaments and the operation of several communications and audiovisual instruments, such as spectral analysers, oscilloscopes, RF detectors, video cameras, <b>vectorscopes,</b> video and TV trainers, etc. The videos are indexed and synchronised with oral explanations, support texts, schemas and graphics, and integrated in a unique visualisation framework, in this way the student can browse the video or section of the video which is of interest and visualise the video or section supported by the oral, textual and graphical explanations simultaneously. The multimedia course can be accessible via web or locally on a PC. The course has been implemented thanks to a specific edition, synchronisation and serving tool developed by the Distributed Real Time Applications and Systems Group (SATRD) of the UPV (Polytechnic University of Valencia). The realisation and edition of the videos, the textual material and the supporting graphics has been conducted by a group of professors of the Polytechnic School of Gandía and the School of Telecommunications Engineering of the UPV...|$|R

50|$|A CCU {{is often}} used in {{conjunction}} with a remote control panel (RCP), a waveform monitor and a <b>vectorscope</b> to rack and match many cameras together remotely.|$|E
50|$|A <b>vectorscope</b> is {{a special}} type of {{oscilloscope}} used in both audio and video applications. Whereas an oscilloscope or waveform monitor normally displays a plot of signal vs. time, a <b>vectorscope</b> displays an X-Y plot of two signals, which can reveal details {{about the relationship between}} these two signals. Vectorscopes are highly similar in operation to oscilloscopes operated in X-Y mode; however those used in video applications have specialized graticules, and accept standard television or video signals as input (demodulating and demultiplexing the two components to be analyzed internally).|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{waveform}} monitors include <b>vectorscope</b> functionality built in; {{and many}} allow the two modes to be displayed side-by-side. The combined device is typically {{referred to as}} a waveform monitor, and standalone vectorscopes are rapidly becoming obsolete.|$|E

50|$|A <b>vectorscope</b> uses an {{overlaid}} circular reference display, or graticule, for visualizing chrominance signals, {{which is}} the best method of referring to the QAM scheme used to encode color into a video signal. The actual visual pattern that the incoming chrominance signal draws on the <b>vectorscope</b> is called the trace. Chrominance is measured using two methods—color saturation, encoded as the amplitude, or gain, of the subcarrier signal, and hue, encoded as the subcarrier's phase. The vectorscope's graticule roughly represents saturation as distance {{from the center of the}} circle, and hue as the angle, in standard position, around it. The graticule is also embellished with several elements corresponding to the various components of the standard color bars video test signal, including boxes around the circles for the colors in the main bars, and perpendicular lines corresponding to the U and V components of the chrominance signal (and additionally on an NTSC <b>vectorscope,</b> the I and Q components). NTSC vectorscopes have one set of boxes for the color bars, while their PAL counterparts have two sets of boxes, because the R-Y chrominance component in PAL reverses in phase on alternating lines. Another element in the graticule is a fine grid at the nine-o'clock, or -U position, used for measuring differential gain and phase.|$|E
50|$|The {{reference}} signal {{used for the}} vectorscope's display is the color burst that is transmitted before each line of video, which for NTSC is defined to have a phase of 180°, corresponding to the nine-o'clock position on the graticule. The actual color burst signal shows up on the <b>vectorscope</b> as a straight line pointing to the left {{from the center of}} the graticule. In the case of PAL, the color burst phase alternates between 135° and 225°, resulting in two vectors pointing in the half-past-ten and half-past-seven positions on the graticule, respectively. In digital (and component analog) vectorscopes, colorburst doesn't exist; hence the phase relationship between the colorburst signal and the chroma subcarrier is simply not an issue. A <b>vectorscope</b> for SECAM uses a demodulator similar to the one found in a SECAM receiver to retrieve the U and V colour signals since they are transmitted one at a time (Thomson 8300 Vecamscope).|$|E
5000|$|The Helical scanner used a tape wrap of 188.57 degrees {{around a}} drum of 3.170 inches in diameter, with two play/record heads. In the NTSC {{version of the}} format, it had 5 helical tracks (segments) per field and 6 in the PAL version, each with 57 lines per segment. The VTR was {{equipped}} with a color video monitor, a waveform monitor scope, and <b>vectorscope.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its public Public-access television network, SPNN facilitates a Community Productions Department that airs programming 16 hours a day. The downtown facility has a large production studio that features four cameras, a switcher, an audio board, two DV CAM decks, two super VHS decks, two mini DV decks, 7 monitors (one for each camera plus a CG, Preview, and Program monitor), a Waveform and <b>Vectorscope</b> monitor for white balance and a graphics console computer capable of accessing the Internet.|$|E
50|$|In audio applications, a <b>vectorscope</b> is used {{to measure}} the {{difference}} between channels of stereo audio signals. One stereo channel drives the horizontal deflection of the display, and the other drives the vertical deflection. A monoaural signal, consisting of identical left and right signals, results in a straight line with a gradient of +1. Any stereo separation is visible as a deviation from this line, creating a Lissajous figure. If a straight line appears with a gradient of −1, this indicates that the left and right channels are 180° out of phase.|$|E
50|$|Prime {{was heavily}} {{involved}} with Ford’s internal computer-aided design (CAD) product, Product Design Graphics System (PDGS). Design engineers used PDGS for auto body design, and {{finite element analysis}} using NASTRAN. It used a <b>vectorscope</b> from Lundy for a display. At one time in 1980s it was the world largest integrated CAD system, spanning the US, Japan (Mazda was Ford's subsidiary/partner), (Cologne) Germany, (Dunton) England and (Geelong) Australia. The creators of PDGS, located in building #3 of Ford's Dearborn design headquarters, began working {{on the concept of}} parametrically driven geometry, which led to a PRIMEDesign system.|$|E
50|$|On older vectorscopes {{implemented}} with {{cathode ray}} tubes (CRTs), the graticule was often implemented as a silk-screened overlay which was superimposed {{over the front}} surface of the CRT. One notable exception was the Tektronix WFM601 series of instruments, which are combined waveform monitors and vectorscopes used to measure CCIR 601 television signals. The waveform-mode graticule of these instruments is implemented with a silkscreen, whereas the <b>vectorscope</b> graticule (consisting only of bar targets, as this family did not support composite video) was drawn on the CRT by the electron beam. Modern instruments have graticules drawn using computer graphics, and both graticule and trace are rendered on an external VGA monitor or an internal VGA-compatible LCD display.|$|E
5000|$|Time base {{correction}} counteracts errors by buffering {{the video}} signal {{as it comes}} off the videotape at an unsteady rate, and releasing it at a steady rate. TBCs also allow a variable delay in the video stream. By adjusting the rate and delay using a waveform monitor and a <b>vectorscope,</b> the corrected signal can now match {{the timing of the}} other devices in the system. If all of the devices in a system are adjusted so their signals meet the video switcher {{at the same time and}} at the same rate, the signals can be mixed. A single master clock or [...] "sync generator" [...] provides the reference for all of the devices' clocks.|$|E
5000|$|Both SPNN {{staff and}} SPNN members {{have access to}} the {{production}} truck is made of two parts, a storage compartment and a [...] "control room." [...] The storage compartment holds 4 cameras and a tripod for each, sandbags, camera cables, headphones for the camera operators, wheel bases to mobilize the cameras, viewfinder case, and mats to assist in holding the camera cables in place. The control room contains a switcher that can take a total of 12 camera outputs, two DV CAM decks, a DPS replay deck, a DVD deck, an audio board, a Waveform and <b>Vectorscope</b> monitor for white balancing, 7 monitors for the director (4 cameras plus a CG, Program and VTR monitor), and a graphics console computer.|$|E
5000|$|In a SMPTE {{color bar}} image, the top {{two-thirds of the}} {{television}} picture contain seven vertical bars of 75% intensity. In order from left to right, the colors are white, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, and blue. This sequence runs through all seven possible combinations that use {{at least one of}} the three basic color components of green, red, and blue, with blue cycling on and off between every bar, red cycling on and off every two bars, and green on for the leftmost four bars and off for the rightmost three. Because green contributes the largest share of luminance, followed by red, then blue, this sequence of bars thus appears on a waveform monitor in luminance mode as a downward staircase from left to right. The graticule of a <b>vectorscope</b> is etched with boxes showing the permissible regions where the traces from these seven bars are supposed to fall if the signal is properly adjusted.|$|E
5000|$|Test cards {{typically}} {{contain a}} set of patterns to enable television cameras and receivers to be adjusted to show the picture correctly (See SMPTE color bars). Most modern test cards include {{a set of}} calibrated colour bars which will produce a characteristic pattern of [...] "dot landings" [...] on a <b>vectorscope,</b> allowing chroma and tint to be precisely adjusted between generations of videotape or network feeds. SMPTE bars—and several other test cards—include analog black (a flat waveform at 7.5 IRE, or the NTSC setup level), full white (100 IRE), and a [...] "sub-black", or [...] "blacker-than-black" [...] (at 0 IRE), which represents the lowest low-frequency transmission voltage permissible in NTSC broadcasts (though the negative excursions of the colourburst signal may go below 0 IRE). Between the colour bars and proper adjustment of brightness and contrast controls {{to the limits of}} perception of the first sub-black bar, an analogue receiver (or other equipment such as VTRs) can be adjusted to provide impressive fidelity.|$|E
5000|$|The bottom {{section of}} the test pattern {{contains}} a square of 100% intensity white and a rectangle of 7.5% intensity black, for use in setting the luminance range. More modern versions of the pattern feature a [...] "pluge pulse." [...] The white square lines up {{so that it is}} below the green and cyan bars, on a waveform monitor this will show up with the white bar overlapping the peak of the yellow and cyan chroma at 100 IRE units. The pluge (short for [...] "Picture Line-Up Generation Equipment") pulse is positioned within the black rectangle, below the red bar (it is present in the illustration but may be hard to see). It comprises three small vertical bars, a rightmost one with intensity 4% above black level, a middle one with intensity exactly equal to black, and a leftmost one with intensity 4% below black (super-black or [...] "blacker than black"). The pluge pulse aids in adjusting the bottom of the luminance range to avoid either washing out the black tones into grays or collapsing picture information into the signal clipping that occurs a small distance below the black level (known as [...] "crushing the blacks"). When a monitor is properly adjusted, the rightmost pluge bar should be just barely visible, while the left two should appear indistinuishable from each other and completely black. Also in the bottom section are two sections that contain -In-phase and +Quadrature signals (see YIQ), centered on black level and having the same gain as the color burst signal; these show up on the pattern as a square of very dark blue, and a square of very dark purple. On a <b>vectorscope,</b> they appear as two short lines ninety degrees apart. These are used to ensure that the television receiver is properly demodulating the 3.58 MHz color subcarrier portion of the signal. The vectors for the -I and +Q blocks should fall exactly on the I and Q axes on the <b>vectorscope</b> if the chrominance signal is demodulated properly.These bars give rise to the former portion of the casual term, [...] "bars and tone". Typically, a television network, TV station, or other originator of video programming transmits SMPTE color bars together with a continuous 1000 Hz audio tone before sending program material, in order to assert ownership of the transmission line or medium, and so that receiving stations and intermediary telecommunications providers may adjust their equipment. Likewise, producers of television programs typically record [...] "bars and tone" [...] {{at the beginning of a}} videotape or other recording medium so that the playback equipment can be calibrated. Often, the name or callsign of the TV station, other information such as a real-time clock, or another signal source is graphically superimposed over the bars.|$|E
40|$|Professional video {{recording}} {{is a complex}} process which often requires expensive cameras and large amounts of ancillary equipment. With the advancement of mobile technologies, cameras on mobile devices have improved {{to the point where}} the quality of their output is sometimes comparable to that obtained from a professional video camera and are often used in professional productions. However, tools that allow professional users to access the information they need to control the technical quality of their filming and make an informed decision about what they are recording are missing on mobile platforms. In this paper we present MAVIS (Mobile Acquisition and VISualization) a tool for professional filming on a mobile platform. MAVIS allows users to access information such as colour <b>vectorscope,</b> waveform monitor, false colouring, focus peaking and all other information that is needed to produce high quality professional videos. This is achieved by exploiting the capabilities of modern mobile GPUs though the use of a number of vertex and fragment shaders. Evaluation with professionals in the film industry shows that the app and its functionalities are well received and that the output and usability of the application align with professional standards...|$|E
