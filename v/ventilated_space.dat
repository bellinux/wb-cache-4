A stream used to flow in the middle of the street until the beginning of the 20th century, the relic of a former noxious-smelling trade, since tanning required large amounts of flowing water for treating and washing animal skins. Most of the old tanner houses date back to the Middle Ages and have a tall attic to provide a <b>ventilated</b> <b>space</b> for drying leather. In the neighbouring streets, rue des Oies ("geese street") and rue des Veaux ("calf street"), many houses were covered with a coat of plaster in the 19th century in order to hide the timbering, which was considered too rustic.|$|E

50|$|CR gas is a lachrymatory agent (LA), exerting {{its effects}} through {{activation}} of the TRPA1 channel. Its effects are approximately 6 to 10 times more powerful than those of CS gas. CR causes intense skin irritation, in particular around moist areas; blepharospasm, causing temporary blindness; and coughing, gasping for breath, and panic. It is capable of causing immediate incapacitation. It is a suspected carcinogen. It is toxic, but less so than CS gas, by ingestion and exposure. However, it can be lethal in large quantities.

50|$|The {{design was}} {{selected}} from a nationwide open competition in 1961 and was a design of Singapore's urban architecture in the 1960s. The original architecture primarily consisted of concrete and glass in its facade. It has a large butterfly roof. In the past the roof and terrace were equipped with vertical sunscreens to provide shade to the interior. The concourse on the first level was conceived as a large space for programmes and from which visitors could {{find their way to}} the upper floors. Today, it is used as a concourse as well as a reception area for the Singapore Chinese Orchestra. The area can be used for exhibitions, receptions, performances and conferences. The area was originally designed as a naturally <b>ventilated</b> <b>space.</b> The trade congress rooms were located on the third to fifth floors of the building. The building was designed by Malayan Architects Co-Partnership and was completed by Architects Team 3. The five-storey building has no basement and has an outdoor car park. The building is next to UIC Building which is now transformed into a mixed development of residential and commercial unit- V on Shenton.|$|E
5000|$|One way {{to measure}} the {{performance}} of a naturally <b>ventilated</b> <b>space</b> is to measure the air changes per hour in an interior space. In order for ventilation to be effective, there must be exchange between outdoor air and room air. A common method for measuring ventilation effectiveness is to use a tracer gas. [...] The first step is to close all windows, doors, and openings in the space. Then, a tracer gas is added to the air. The reference, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E741: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution, describes which tracer gases can be used for this kind of testing and provides information about the chemical properties, health impacts, and ease of detection. [...] Once the tracer gas has been added, mixing fans can be used to distribute the tracer gas as uniformly as possible throughout the space. To do a decay test, the concentration of the tracer gas is first measured when the concentration of the tracer gas is constant. Windows and doors are then opened and the concentration of the tracer gas in the space is measured at regular time intervals to determine the decay rate of the tracer gas. The airflow can be deduced by looking at the change in concentration of the tracer gas over time. For further details on this test method, refer to ASTM Standard E741.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of a vertically distributed source of buoyancy on the vertical stratification in a <b>ventilated</b> <b>space,</b> {{an important factor}} for determining indoor comfort when using displacement ventilation. A new theory describing the behaviour of this buoyancy source in a <b>ventilated</b> <b>space</b> was presented previous to this work, but experimental results were {{required in order to}} validate the theoretical and numerical modelling. The behaviour of this source of buoyancy on the stratification in a <b>ventilated</b> <b>space</b> is studied for a mechanically ventilated at steady-state and for a linearly stratified environment using salt water in a water scale model. The stratifications were measured using a traversing conductivity probe and then compared to theoretical predictions by numerically solving the plume equations for the new theory in Fortran. High quality measurements were produced, showing excellent repeatability for stratification measurements at steady-state with deviations of less than 1 %. Moreover, the linear stratifications had linear best fits up to R 2 = 0. 999 by using the double-bucket method. The theoretical predictions of the influence of the vertically distributed source correlate quantitatively with the mechanically ventilated experiments, showing good agreement to the strength of the ambient stratification, the position of the first front and the ventilation flow rate. The experimental results for the determination of the height of a horizontal intrusion of fluid into the linearly stratified environment were severely affected by the occurrence of gravity current at the ceiling of the <b>ventilated</b> <b>space</b> and comparisons to the new theory was not successful because of this. A two-layer stratification is observed where the upper layer had a weakly stratified density profile, instead of the multi-layer stratification predicted by previous researchers in their theoretical model. This discrepancy is due to smoothing and vertical turbulent mixing in the water scale model. It is recommended that the characteristic of the membrane that is used in the water scale model is investigated in relation to the gravity currents for future research. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} work {{was carried out}} to investigate the effect of inner waves on the stability of flow characteristics in <b>ventilated</b> <b>space.</b> Theoretical and experimental techniques were presented. Energy dissipation by waves {{and its effect on}} the performance of ventilation was considered. Analysis of engineering systems in the bases of the internal waves and thermal concept was considered to find out the best ventilation process. The mixing process was investigated experimentally using a turbulent round jet impinged from the ceiling on the inner wave’s zone. It was carried out at a flow Reynolds number of 7, 000 < Re < 30, 000 and a flow Richardson number of 0 < Ri< 200 based on the local jet scales. In the mixing process a hot and cold air are introduced to a confined space, to mix in the <b>ventilated</b> <b>space</b> to break down the waves. The results showed that the amount of momentum needed is depending on the wave’s amplitude, frequency and flow conditions. It can be seen that the jet momentum has significant influence on breaking down the inner waves and mixing the flow...|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of the indoor air quality (IAQ) of the San Francisco Federal Building (SFFB) was conducted on May 12 and 14, 2009 {{at the request of}} the General Services Administration (GSA). The purpose of the assessment was for a general screening of IAQ parameters typically indicative of well functioning building systems. One naturally <b>ventilated</b> <b>space</b> and one mechanically <b>ventilated</b> <b>space</b> were studied. In both zones, the levels of indoor air contaminants, including CO 2, CO, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and aldehydes, were low, relative to reference exposure levels and air quality standards for comparable office buildings. We found slightly elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including two compounds often found in "green" cleaning products. In addition, we found two industrial solvents at levels higher than typically seen in office buildings, but the levels were not sufficient to be of a health concern. The ventilation rates in the two study spaces were high by any standard. Ventilation rates in the building should be further investigated and adjusted to be in line with the building design. Based on our measurements, we conclude that the IAQ is satisfactory in the zone we tested, but IAQ may need to be re-checked after the ventilation rates have been lowered...|$|E
40|$|Crawl {{spaces are}} known to be risky constructions for both the building’s {{structural}} components and the indoor environment. In Sweden, crawl spaces were popular before the 1940 ’s and again in the mid 1960 ’s and 1980 ’s.

There are four different types of crawl spaces: plinth, outdoor ventilated, indoor ventilated, unventilated and suspended crawl space foundations, four of which are currently available to builders and one traditional design. Due to all the negative publicity associated with outdoor <b>ventilated</b> crawl <b>spaces</b> and the fact that this publicity refers to them only as crawl spaces, two other types of crawl spaces that function well are looked negatively upon.
