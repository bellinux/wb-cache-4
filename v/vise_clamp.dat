5000|$|Donald opens {{a box and}} {{it turns}} out to be a Jack-in-the-box; he {{proceeds}} to play with it. When the boss tells him not to play with toys, he gets angry and has trouble with the Jack-in-the-box in various ways and has trouble wrapping it. He uses a <b>vise</b> <b>clamp</b> to hold the Jack-in-the-box down. He gets annoyed by the speaker horn and solves the problem by shoving a rubber ball in the speaker. The speaker shoots out the ball as Donald is trying to have his pie and quickly dodges the ball, but the ball hits the clamp and the Jack-in-the-box springs out hitting Donald into his pie piece. He then decides to tie down the Jack-in-the-box and hold it down by hammering stakes in the floor. But the Jack-in-the-box breaks through the floor and Donald looks out the window and is surprised that it went through the floor. He then tries to pull the head out but he gets pulled into the Jack-in-the-box and gets trapped inside and wrestles in it until he finally gets free, but the Jack-in-the-box steals Donald's blue shirt and blue hat while Donald Duck is wearing Jack's clown accordion costume and his nightcap.|$|E
50|$|The American Industrial Hygiene Association {{gives the}} {{following}} categories of hand tools: wrenches, pliers, cutters, striking tools, struck or hammered tools, screwdrivers, <b>vises,</b> <b>clamps,</b> snips, saws, drills and knives.|$|R
5000|$|A {{hand tool}} is any tool that {{is powered by}} hand rather than a motor. Categories of hand tools include wrenches, pliers, cutters, {{striking}} tools, struck or hammered tools, screwdrivers, <b>vises,</b> <b>clamps,</b> snips, saws, drills and knives.|$|R
5000|$|The table {{allows a}} <b>vise</b> or <b>clamp</b> {{to be used}} to {{position}} and restrain the work, making the operation much more secure ...|$|R
50|$|Basic combat {{engineering}} tools include safe use of: driving tools and chopping tools (hammers, mauls, sledges, screwdriver, and bits); cutting tools and smoothing tools (saws, chisels, planes, files and rasps, brush-cutting tools, miscellaneous cutting tools); drilling tools, boring tools, and countersinking tools; measuring tools, leveling tools and layout tools (rules, tapes, marking tools, levels, plumb bobs, squares); gripping tools, prying tools and twisting tools (pliers, wrenches, bars); holding tools, raising tools and grinding tools (<b>vises,</b> <b>clamps,</b> jacks, grinders, and oilstones); timber handling tools and climbing tools; digging tools (shovels, posthole diggers, picks, and mattocks); portable power tools and trailer-mounted tools (electric tool trailer and generator, portable power tools); miscellaneous tools.|$|R
40|$|For {{machined}} parts, {{setup time}} is {{a major component of}} the total time required to create a machined part. If the setup time can be reduced, this will not only decrease the machining time, but will also ensure better machining accuracy, require fewer work- holding devices and increase machine usage time. To achieve any improvement in setup time, first we need to estimate the setup time accurately. In this paper we propose a methodology to estimate the setup time for machining prismatic parts in a three axis vertical machining center. We consider three major factors in estimating the number of setups, namely [...] -the precedence constraints among machining operations, the feasibility of work holding using <b>vise</b> <b>clamping,</b> and the availability of datum faces for locating the workpiece...|$|R
60|$|On a dark November morning, when a blustering wind {{drove the}} rain against the windows, Thomas Foster sat {{stripping}} the lock of a favorite {{gun in the}} room he called his study, at Hazlehurst, in Shropshire. The shelves on the handsome paneled walls contained a few works on agriculture, horse-breeding, and British natural history, but two racks were filled with guns and fishing-rods and the table at which Foster was seated had a <b>vise</b> <b>clamped</b> to its edge. He had once had a commodious gun-room, but had given it up, under pressure from his wife, as Hazlehurst was small and she had numerous guests, but the study was his private retreat. A hacksaw, a few files, a wire brush, {{and a bottle of}} Rangoon oil were spread out in front of him, the latter standing, for the sake of cleanliness, {{on the cover of the}} Field.|$|R
50|$|Fixtures {{may also}} be {{designed}} for very general or simple uses. These multi-use fixtures {{tend to be very}} simple themselves, often relying on the precision and ingenuity of the operator, as well as surfaces and components already present in the workshop, to provide the same benefits of a specially-designed fixture. Examples include workshop <b>vises,</b> adjustable <b>clamps,</b> and improvised devices such as weights and furniture.|$|R
50|$|Parallels {{are used}} in {{machining}} operations, be it milling, drilling, turning or sometimes grinding. The most common use is to support work when {{it is in a}} <b>vise</b> or <b>clamped</b> to the machine bed. If a workpiece is too small to be machined in a vise without it being in contact with all three faces of the vice - parallels can be used either side to give clearance from the vise, and to give support from underneath to eliminate the workpiece being pushed down by the force of the cutting tool.|$|R
50|$|Parallels are {{rectangular}} {{blocks of}} metal, commonly made from tool steel, stainless steel or cast iron, which have 2, 4 or 6 faces ground or lapped to a precise surface finish. They are used when machining with a mill, drill {{or any other}} machining operation that requires work {{to be held in}} a <b>vise</b> or with <b>clamps</b> - to keep work parallel or raised evenly such as in a milling vise to give adequate height for the cutting tool/spindle to pass over.|$|R
5000|$|In CNC, a [...] "crash" [...] {{occurs when}} the machine moves {{in such a way}} that is harmful to the machine, tools, or parts being machined, {{sometimes}} resulting in bending or breakage of cutting tools, accessory <b>clamps,</b> <b>vises,</b> and fixtures, or causing damage to the machine itself by bending guide rails, breaking drive screws, or causing structural components to crack or deform under strain. A mild crash may not damage the machine or tools, but may damage the part being machined so that it must be scrapped.|$|R
50|$|By 1891, {{the firm}} {{provided}} employment to 350 men and turned out among other specialties ten distinct styles of patent parlor sliding door hangers, barn door hangers, {{a number of}} different kinds of patented locks, barn door locks, window and door screens, door and window screen frames, hinges, adjustable stove-pipe thimbles, adjustable screw and door frame <b>clamps,</b> <b>vises,</b> spoke shaves and pointers, jack screws, hollow augers, cast-iron stable hay racks and feed boxes, saw vises, bench drills, mallets, chisel handles, lawn mowers, iron sinks, and stable fixtures, etc.|$|R
5000|$|The Japanese saw or nokogiri (...) {{is a type}} of saw used in {{woodworking}} and Japanese carpentry {{that cuts}} on the pull stroke, unlike most European saws that cut on the push stroke. Japanese saws are the best known pull saws, but they are also used in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Nepal. Among European saws, both coping saws for woodworking and jewelers saws for metal working also cut on the pull stroke like Japanese saws. Cutting on the pull stroke is claimed to cut more efficiently and leave a narrower cut width (...) [...] On the other hand, a pull stroke does not easily permit putting ones body weight behind a stroke. This can be readily solved by using a <b>vise</b> or <b>clamping.</b> Another disadvantage, due to the arrangement and form of the teeth , is that Japanese saws do not work as well on hardwoods as European saws do. Japanese saws were originally intended for comparatively soft woods like cypress and pine whereas European saws were intended for hard woods like oak and maple.|$|R
50|$|These saws are {{available}} {{in a number of}} configurations, including table top, free hand, and walk behind models. In the table top models, which are commonly used to cut tile and metal, the cutting wheel and motor are mounted on a pivoting arm attached to a fixed base plate. Table top saws are often electrically powered and generally have a built-in <b>vise</b> or other <b>clamping</b> arrangement. The free hand designs are typically used to cut concrete, asphalt, and pipe on construction sites. They are designed with the handles and motor near the operator, with the blade {{at the far end of}} the saw. Free hand saws do not feature a vise, because the materials being cut are larger and heavier. Walk-behind models, sometimes called flat saws are larger saws which use a stand or cart to cut into concrete floors as well as asphalt and concrete paving materials.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the drive}} system is weaker than the machine {{structural}} integrity, then {{the drive system}} simply pushes against the obstruction and the drive motors [...] "slip in place". The machine tool may not detect the collision or the slipping, so for example the tool should now be at 210 mm on the X axis, but is, in fact, at 32mm where it hit the obstruction and kept slipping. All of the next tool motions will be off by −178mm on the X axis, and all future motions are now invalid, which may result in further collisions with <b>clamps,</b> <b>vises,</b> or the machine itself. This is common in open loop stepper systems, but is not possible in closed loop systems unless mechanical slippage between the motor and drive mechanism has occurred. Instead, in a closed loop system, the machine will continue to attempt to move against the load until either the drive motor goes into an overcurrent condition or a servo following error alarm is generated.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{based on the}} needs to find accurate method for sand casting in producing the <b>clamping</b> <b>vise.</b> Vise is well known as for clamping the work piece. This study is carried out to investigate effect of temperature on dimensional accuracy (mm) of the finish product using sand casting and to find the optimum melting temperature of aluminum for sand casting process. Different setting of melting temperature is applied for sand casting process which is 660 °C, 720 °C and 780 °C. These temperatures are taken using infra red (IR) thermometer. Final products are measured using vernier caliper with tolerance (± 0. 03 mm) respectively. The data obtained are analyzed using standard analysis method and graph is plotted for graphical analysis purpose. The result showed that melting temperature 720 °C has better dimensional accuracy rather than melting temperature 660 °C and 720 °C. From the analysis, it showed that every different setting of melting temperature influenced the performance of final parts in terms of dimensional accuracy (mm) ...|$|R
