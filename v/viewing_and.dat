5|$|Many {{details of}} Monitors history and {{insights}} of everyday crew life {{have been discovered}} from correspondence sent from the various crew members {{to family and friends}} while serving aboard the ironclad. In particular the correspondence of George S. Geer, who sent more than 80 letters, often referred to as The Monitor Chronicles, to his wife Martha during the entire time of Monitors service provide many details and insights into every chapter of the ironclad's short-lived history, offering a rare perspective of a sailor's experience on the naval front during the Civil War. The letters of Acting Paymaster William F. Keeler to his wife Anna also corroborate many of the accounts of affairs that took place aboard the Monitor. The letters of Geer and Keeler are available for <b>viewing</b> <b>and</b> are housed at the Mariners' Museum in Virginia. Other crew members were interviewed later in life, like Louis Stodder, one of the last crew members to abandon Monitor minutes before she sank in a storm at sea, who was the last surviving crew member of Monitor and lived well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, 2004, Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States, {{died after}} having {{suffered}} from Alzheimer's disease {{for nearly a}} decade. His seven-day state funeral followed. After Reagan's death, his body was taken from his Bel Air, Los Angeles home to the Gates, Kingsley and Gates Funeral Home in Santa Monica, California to prepare the body for burial. On June 7, Reagan's casket was transported by hearse and displayed at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, then flown to Washington, D.C. on June 9 for a service, public <b>viewing</b> <b>and</b> tributes at the U.S. Capitol. His death occurred on the 60th anniversary of the WWII Allied D-Day invasion of Normandy, France, and the 20th anniversary of his own well-remembered speech commemorating that occasion at Pointe du Hoc.

40|$|International audienceMaterialized <b>views</b> <b>and</b> indexes are {{physical}} {{structures for}} accelerating data access that are casually used in data warehouses.

In this paper, we adopt the opposite stance <b>and</b> couple materialized <b>view</b> <b>and</b> index selection to take view-index interactions into account and achieve efficient storage space sharing. Candidate materialized <b>views</b> <b>and</b> indexes are selected through a data mining process. We also exploit cost models that evaluate the respective benefit of indexing <b>and</b> <b>view</b> materialization, <b>and</b> help select a relevant configuration of indexes <b>and</b> materialized <b>views</b> among the candidates. Experimental results show that our strategy performs better than an independent selection of materialized <b>views</b> <b>and</b> indexes...|$|R

5|$|The Shroud Exhibit And Museum, {{located in}} White Sands Mall, showcases a {{full-sized}} back-lit photographic transparency of the Shroud of Turin, a religious relic believed {{by some to}} be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. They also feature a working VP8 Image Analyzer, {{the only one in the}} world where one can walk in and interact with this old analog computer. This town was founded the same year (1898) that Secundo Pia took the first photograph of the Shroud which started the modern investigation into the Shroud. This is highlighted in the museum. In 1977 in Albuquerque, they held the conference that resulted in the 1978 study of the Shroud with more scientists from New Mexico than any other state. The displayed photograph was created from the 1978 photographs made by Barrie M. Schwortz as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP). The displays include historical background materials, scientific information, kiosks with a variety of information, videos available for <b>viewing</b> <b>and</b> an exhibit of electronic image analysis of the shroud, among other interesting artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed <b>viewing</b> <b>and</b> did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going {{back and forth from the}} jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as he felt it was too dark for family <b>viewing</b> <b>and</b> insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{challenges}} in local-feature-based image matching are variations of <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination. Different methods have been recently proposed to address these problems by using invariant feature detectors and distinctive descriptors. However, the matching performance is still unstable and inaccurate, particularly when large variation in view or illumination occurs. In this paper, we propose a <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination invariant image matching method. We iteratively estimate {{the relationship of the}} relative <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination of the images, transform the view of one image to the other, and normalize their illumination for accurate matching. The performance of matching is significantly improved and is not affected by the changes of <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination in a valid range. The proposed method would fail when the initial <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination method fails, which gives us a new sight to evaluate the traditional detectors. We propose two novel indicators for detector evaluation, namely, valid angle and valid illumination, which reflect the maximum allowable change in <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination, respectively.
