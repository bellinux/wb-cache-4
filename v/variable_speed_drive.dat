40|$|Chillers {{consume more}} than 40 {{of the total}} energy used in the {{commercial}} and industrial buildings for space conditioning. In this paper, energy consumption by chillers and chilled water pumps, condenser pumps and fan motors has been estimated using data collected by a walkthrough energy audit for the 16 faculties of the University of Malaya. It {{has been estimated that}} chillers and motors and pumps used in chillers consume 10, 737 MWh (i. e. 51 of total energy consumption) of electric energy for different percentage of loadings. As chillers are major energy users, <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> are applied in chillers to reduce their energy consumption. It has been estimated that about 8368 MWh annual energy can be saved by using efficient chillers at different loadings. It has also been found that about 23, 532 MWh annual energy can be saved for chilled water supply pumps, condenser pumps and cooling tower fan motors by matching required <b>speeds</b> using <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> for 60 of speed reduction. About 1, 274, 692 kg of CO 2 emission could be avoided for using energy efficient chillers at 50 load.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> used in Blow Molding {{have changed}} {{little in the}} last 20 years or more even though {{substantial}} technology advances {{have taken place in}} other areas of the Blow Molding process. A new <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> technology has become available in the last 5 years and several blow molding manufacturers and users have taken advantage of this advancement and are using Brushless D.

This paper addresses the advantages this new Brushless technology brings to <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> in general and Blow Molding Machines in particular. Areas specifically addressed include efficiency, accuracy, power factor, size, harmonics, and speed range. A basic description of how Brushless D.

50|$|As {{the years}} went by, {{applications}} of the interrupted screw design were expanded beyond slippery and slimy materials. This took place because competing continuous screw presses worked best only under conditions of constant feed, at constant consistency. If either the consistency or the flow rate diminished, squeezing would diminish until it was inadequate for proper moisture removal. At the same time, if the consistency increased, the press could jam. To counteract these tendencies {{it was necessary to}} build a very heavy press, frequently with an expensive <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an {{alternative}} screen solution for cables with <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>drives.</b> The higher switching speeds {{of the modern}} AC <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> motor <b>drives</b> generate more EMI.

To reduce the coupling between the circuits and radiated noise, screening techniques are introduced. A cable with a screen provides an excellent shield for the high frequency pulses being transmitted to the motor. On this basis, the different screening techniques are investigated for cable design issues. 1...|$|R
50|$|Harmonic {{voltages}} and {{currents in}} an {{electric power system}} {{are a result of}} non-linear electric loads. Harmonic frequencies in the power grid are a frequent cause of power quality problems.

50|$|Speed Variation - All of the {{fan types}} {{described}} above {{can be used in}} conjunction with a variable speed driver. This might be an adjustable frequency AC controller, a DC motor and drive, a steam turbine driver, or a hydraulic <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> unit ("fluid drive"). Flow control by means of variable speed is typically smoother and more efficient than by means of damper control. Significant power savings (with reduced cost of operation) are possible if variable speed fan drives are used for applications that require reduced flow operation for {{a significant portion of the}} system operating life.|$|E
5000|$|Fans {{and pumps}} consume {{a large part}} of the energy used by {{industrial}} electrical motors. Where fans and pumps serve a varying process load, a simple way to vary the delivered quantity of fluid is with a damper or valve in the outlet of the fan or pump, which by its increased pressure drop, reduces the flow in the process. However, this additional pressure drop represents energy loss. Sometimes it is economically practical to put in some device that recovers this otherwise lost energy. With a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>drive</b> on the pump or fan, the supply can be adjusted to match demand and no extra loss is introduced.|$|E
