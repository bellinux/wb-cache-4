5|$|However, {{there is}} {{continued}} interest in <b>vascular</b> brachytherapy for persistent restenosis in failed stents and vein grafts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, the first <b>vascular</b> plant was found growing on the {{northern}} shore of Surtsey, mosses became visible in 1967, and lichens were first found on the Surtsey lava in 1970. Plant colonisation on Surtsey has been closely studied, the <b>vascular</b> plants in particular {{as they have been}} of far greater significance than mosses, lichens and fungi in the development of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Reused {{deep fried}} cooking oil may in {{addition}} cause blood pressure elevation and <b>vascular</b> hypertrophy.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} also implicated {{warfarin}} use in valvular and <b>vascular</b> calcification. No specific treatment is available, but some modalities are under investigation.|$|E
5|$|The flora of Scotland is an {{assemblage}} of native plant species including over 1,600 <b>vascular</b> plants, more than 1,500 lichens and nearly 1,000 bryophytes. The total number of <b>vascular</b> species is low by world standard but lichens and bryophytes are abundant and the latter form a population of global importance. Various populations of rare fern exist, although the impact of 19th-century collectors threatened the existence of several species. The flora is generally typical of the north west European part of the Palearctic ecozone and prominent features of the Scottish flora include boreal Caledonian forest (much reduced from its natural extent), heather moorland and coastal machair. In addition to the native varieties of <b>vascular</b> plants there are numerous non-native introductions, now believed to make up some 43% of the species in the country.|$|E
25|$|According to the cladogram, {{the genus}} Rhynia {{illustrates}} two {{steps in the}} evolution of modern <b>vascular</b> plants. Plants have <b>vascular</b> tissue, albeit significantly simpler than modern <b>vascular</b> plants. Their gametophytes are distinctly smaller than their sporophytes (but have <b>vascular</b> tissue, unlike almost all modern <b>vascular</b> plants).|$|E
25|$|General {{surgeons}} {{can perform}} <b>vascular</b> surgery if they receive special {{training and certification}} in <b>vascular</b> surgery. Otherwise, these procedures are performed by <b>vascular</b> surgery specialists. However, general surgeons are capable of treating minor <b>vascular</b> disorders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vascular</b> {{anomalies}} â€“ <b>vascular</b> malformations, hemangiomas, {{and rare}} <b>vascular</b> tumors. Not only do <b>vascular</b> anomalies have often prominent interior bodily effects; they manifest themselves physically as well. For this reason, {{the involvement of}} multiple specialties in coordinating care is of utmost importance. Specialists involve in <b>vascular</b> anomalies and hemangioma care often hail from the disciplines of general surgery, <b>vascular</b> anomalies research, plastic surgery, dermatology, cardiology, hematology/oncology, neurology/neurosurgery, maxillofacial surgery, and otolaryngology. The child needs treatment not only to minimize the physical side effects of a hemangioma or <b>vascular</b> anomalies, but also help in finding out why the tumor is present (if {{it is in fact}} a tumor), and developing a course of treatment if necessary.|$|E
25|$|Diclofenac {{consumption}} {{has been}} associated with significantly increased <b>vascular</b> and coronary risk in a study including coxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen. Upper gastrointestinal complications were also reported. Major <b>vascular</b> events were increased by about a third by diclofenac, chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events. Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to diclofenac for a year, three more had major <b>vascular</b> events, one of which was fatal. <b>Vascular</b> death was increased significantly by diclofenac.|$|E
25|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}} from <b>vascular</b> {{disease is}} usually seen only amongst elderly {{individuals who have}} atherosclerosis. <b>Vascular</b> disease is common in individuals who have diabetes, peripheral <b>vascular</b> disease, hypertension and those who smoke. Any time {{blood flow to the}} penis is impaired, erectile dysfunction is the end result.|$|E
25|$|Replacement of {{the damaged}} section of aorta with a sutureless <b>vascular</b> ring {{connector}}-reinforced Dacron graft: The <b>vascular</b> ring connector is a titanic ring {{used as a}} stent in the <b>vascular</b> graft to achieve a quick, blood-sealed, and sutureless anastomosis. Two furrows {{on the surface of}} the ring are for fixation of the <b>vascular</b> graft and the aorta. The tapes used to tie against the ring provide a larger contact surface area than the traditional stitches, thus it provides stronger anastomosis and better surgical results.|$|E
25|$|Other {{theories}} {{point to}} a possible primary endothelial dysfunction. The importance of <b>vascular</b> misbehaviour in MS pathogenesis has also been independently confirmed by seven-tesla MRI. It is reported {{that a number of}} studies have provided evidence of <b>vascular</b> occlusion in MS, which suggest the possibility of a primary <b>vascular</b> injury in MS lesions or at least that they are occasionally correlated.|$|E
25|$|Polysporangiophytes, {{also called}} polysporangiates or {{formally}} Polysporangiophyta, are plants {{in which the}} spore-bearing generation (sporophyte) has branching stems (axes) that terminate in sporangia. The name literally means many sporangia plant. The clade includes all land plants (embryophytes) except for the bryophytes (liverworts, mosses and hornworts) whose sporophytes are always unbranched. While the definition is independent {{of the presence of}} <b>vascular</b> tissue, all living polysporangiophytes also have <b>vascular</b> tissue, i.e., are <b>vascular</b> plants or tracheophytes. Fossil polysporangiophytes are known that have no <b>vascular</b> tissue, and so are not tracheophytes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>vascular</b> cambium {{produces}} new {{layers of}} secondary xylem annually. The xylem vessels are dead at maturity but {{are responsible for}} most water transport through the <b>vascular</b> tissue in stems and roots.|$|E
25|$|Stem usually {{consist of}} three tissues, dermal tissue, ground tissue and <b>vascular</b> tissue. The dermal tissue covers the outer {{surface of the}} stem and usually {{functions}} to waterproof, protect and control gas exchange. The ground tissue usually consists mainly of parenchyma cells and fills in around the <b>vascular</b> tissue. It sometimes functions in photosynthesis. <b>Vascular</b> tissue provides long distance transport and structural support. Most or all ground tissue may be lost in woody stems. The dermal tissue of aquatic plants stems may lack the waterproofing found in aerial stems. The arrangement of the <b>vascular</b> tissues varies widely among plant species.|$|E
25|$|His {{scientific}} {{activity was}} firstly {{addressed to the}} <b>Vascular</b> Diagnostics non-invasive, especially {{to the use of}} Continuous wave Doppler Velocimetry in <b>Vascular</b> Pathology, and he published several scientific works both in Italian and foreign languages.|$|E
25|$|ICD-9-CM Diagnosis Codes > Diseases of the {{circulatory system}} (390-459) > Diseases of arteries, arterioles, and {{capillaries}} (440-449) > Other peripheral <b>vascular</b> disease (443) > Other specified peripheral <b>vascular</b> disease (443.8) > Erythromelalgia (443.82).|$|E
25|$|SEMS {{are also}} {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} <b>vascular</b> system, usually in the aorta and peripheral <b>vascular</b> system. In the past they {{have been used for}} saphenous vein graft and native coronary artery percutaneous coronary interventions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vascular</b> malformation, {{including}} aorto-enteric fistulae. Fistulae {{are usually}} secondary to prior <b>vascular</b> surgery and usually {{occur at the}} proximal anastomosis at {{the third or fourth}} portion of the duodenum where it is retroperitoneal and near the aorta.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vascular</b> remodelling is {{a process}} which begins at day 21 of human embryogenesis, when an {{immature}} heart begins contracting, pushing fluid through the early vasculature. This first passage of fluid initiates a signal cascade based on physical cues including shear stress and circumferential stress, which {{is necessary for the}} remodelling of the <b>vascular</b> network, arterial-venous identity, angiogenesis, and the regulation of genes through mechanotransduction. This embryonic process is necessary for the future stability of the mature <b>vascular</b> network.|$|E
25|$|Acetylcholine in the serum exerts {{a direct}} effect on <b>vascular</b> tone by binding to muscarinic receptors present on <b>vascular</b> endothelium. These cells respond by {{increasing}} production of nitric oxide, which signals the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, leading to vasodilation.|$|E
25|$|Siphonosteles have {{a region}} of ground tissue called the pith {{internal}} to xylem. The <b>vascular</b> strand comprises a cylinder surrounding the pith. Siphonosteles often have interruptions in the <b>vascular</b> strand where leaves (typically megaphylls) originate (called leaf gaps).|$|E
25|$|Low-growing {{herbaceous}} {{flowering plants}} and bryophytes {{are the major}} vegetation components. The <b>vascular</b> flora comprises the smallest number of species of any major subantarctic island group, reflecting its isolation, small ice-free area and severe climate. Twelve <b>vascular</b> species are known from Heard Island, of which five have also been recorded on McDonald Island. None of the <b>vascular</b> species is endemic, although Pringlea antiscorbutica, Colobanthus kerguelensis, and Poa kerguelensis occur only on subantarctic islands in the southern Indian Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The {{vegetative}} (somatic) {{structures of}} <b>vascular</b> plants include two major organ systems: (1) a shoot system, composed of stems and leaves, and (2) a root system. These two systems {{are common to}} nearly all <b>vascular</b> plants, and provide a unifying theme {{for the study of}} plant morphology.|$|E
25|$|He {{has also}} {{recorded}} {{radio and television}} public service announcements {{for a number of}} causes, including NBC/Ad Council's The More You Know in 2009 and <b>Vascular</b> Cures (formerly the Pacific <b>Vascular</b> Research Foundation) in Redwood City, California (based on the health experiences of his wife, Virginia Madden).|$|E
25|$|Human ALOX15 {{can also}} convert the peroxy PUFA {{intermediate}} to a cyclic ether with a three-atom ring, i.e. an epoxide intermediate that is {{attacked by a}} water molecule to form epoxy-hydrpoxy PUFA products. Eoxins stimulate <b>vascular</b> permeability in an ex vivo human <b>vascular</b> endothelial model system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vascular</b> {{disease of}} the neck and leg arteries.|$|E
25|$|When Raynaud's {{phenomenon}} {{is limited to}} one hand or one foot, it {{is referred to as}} Unilateral Raynaud's. This is an uncommon form, and it is always secondary to local or regional <b>vascular</b> disease. It commonly progresses within several years to affect other limbs as the <b>vascular</b> disease progresses.|$|E
25|$|Woody dicots {{and many}} nonwoody dicots have {{secondary}} growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the <b>vascular</b> cambium and the cork cambium or phellogen. The <b>vascular</b> cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the <b>vascular</b> bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The <b>vascular</b> cambium cells divide to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the periderm, which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely packed cells in the periderm that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.|$|E
25|$|In an adult, the phloem originates, {{and grows}} {{outwards}} from, meristematic {{cells in the}} <b>vascular</b> cambium. Phloem is produced in phases. Primary phloem is laid down by the apical meristem and develops from the procambium. Secondary phloem is laid down by the <b>vascular</b> cambium {{to the inside of}} the established layer(s) of phloem.|$|E
25|$|These {{result from}} {{injury to the}} <b>vascular</b> endothelium.|$|E
25|$|Hip {{fractures}} rarely {{result in}} neurological or <b>vascular</b> injury.|$|E
25|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that <b>vascular</b> remodelling in the embryo {{is a process}} distinct from vasculogenesis; however these two processes are inextricably linked. Vasculogenesis occurs prior to <b>vascular</b> remodelling, but is a necessary step {{in the development of}} the blood vessel network and has implications on the identification of vessels as either arterial or venous. Once contraction of the heart begins, <b>vascular</b> remodelling progresses via the interplay of forces resulting from biomechanical cues and fluid dynamics, which are translated by mechanotransduction to changes at cellular and genetic levels.|$|E
25|$|Western Australia has 10,252 native <b>vascular</b> {{plant species}} from 1,543 genera within 211 families, which is {{half of the}} {{identified}} plant species in Australia. There are an estimated 150,000 Cryptogam species or non <b>vascular</b> plants which include Lichens, and Fungi although only 1,786 species have been published, with 948 Algae and 672 lichen the majority.|$|E
