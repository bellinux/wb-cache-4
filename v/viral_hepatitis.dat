40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{occurrence}} of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitises</b> by clients in Psychiatric Hospital Červený Dvůr between 2000 and 2009. In my beachelor thesis was covered years from 2000 to 2004. Now I continue with this diploma thesis where I want the 10 year results join together {{to show how the}} situation is developing. The intravenous drug users are the aimed group. These drug users belong to a high-risk group in which hepatitises types A, B or C are spread the most thanks to their high-risk behaviour. These days researches and epidemiologic researches show that the intravenous drug users belong among the main high-risk groups endangered by infectious disease. <b>Viral</b> <b>hepatitises</b> represent a serious problem, mainly hepatitis type C, because {{there is no way of}} protection. This hepatitis is occuring without any symptoms of this disease by 50 ? 70 % people. By 70 ? 80 % it passes into a chronic stadium. It is possible to protect yourself by hepatitis type A vaccination. This hepatitis doesn´t change into a chronic stadium. It is easily spread by infected water or food. In our republic there occured several epidemics. Hepatitises started to spread among drug users and then they spread also among the rest of population. The last epidemic occured in 2008. Hepatitis type B represents high risks for the perceptive population. There is a vaccine and population have a chance to protect against it. In the Czech Republic there is vaccination carried out within special vaccination of people who have high-risk job, for example in health service. Children of HBsAg positive mothers are vaccinated after they are born. From 2001 hepatitis vaccination was put into regular vaccination of children aged under 1 year in our republic. Also 12 year old children are vaccinated from 2001. Hepatitis type B often becomes chronic and the mortality is 1 ? 2 %. Intravenous using of drug is important high-risk factor. It is one of the ways of transfering hepatitises type B and C. Next monitored indicators are the age of the clients, achieved level of education, basic drug, the age of the first usage of any drug, the age of intravenous application of drug and occurrence of hepatitises type A, B, C by clients. According to my research I used quantitative research which allows me to analyse problem of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitises</b> by clients from Psychiatric Hospital in Červený Dvůr. The gained information was worked out by secondary analysis of medical data. The monitored group has 2499 clients in years 2000 ? 2009. The aim of this thesis is to get general knowledge about prevalence of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitises</b> by clients of Psychiatric Hospital in Červený Dvůr from 2000 to 2009 and to consider their progress. The methodical procedure: there will be used a content analysis of medical data given by Psychiatric Hospital in Červený Dvůr. The result of this thesis is that it indicates and covered the develop of drug scene. Concerning the age the main group consists of 20 ? 24 year old men and women, next large group consists of clients aged 25 ? 29. The monitored group is also changing according to achieved level of education. In the first five years of research there dominated vocational school, but in the last five years there it changed into basic school. Among women there happened no change. There basic school still dominates. Concerning the drugs there also changed something. At the beginning there dominated clients using heroin, in the middle there meth dominated. Hepatitis type A in acute stadium was revealed by only two clients. Hepatitis type B noticed a slight increase. Hepatitis type C also noticed a sligh increase, but it is probably a sign of increase of clients with chronic form of this hepatitis...|$|R

40|$|Present report gives a {{brief and}} {{consolidated}} review of insulin resistance developed in chronic liver diseases. Insulin resistance remains an {{important feature of}} chronic liver diseases and progresses disease towards fibrogenesis. Of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>viral</b> infections, <b>hepatitis</b> C virus (HCV) {{was reported to have}} a significant role in inducing insulin resistance. Both viral particles as such, as well its structural components induce insulin resistance. Hepatitis C virus core protein, specially, causes insulin resistance via its direct action on insulin signaling cascade as well as by inducing over expression of certain cytokines including TNF-a. Insulin resistance has a direct relation with liver steatosis and oxidative stress. Both steatosis and oxidative stress enhances insulin resistance and vice-a-versa. Insulin resistance has widespread implications on metabolism and needs its correction before planning therapeutic regimen in liver diseases...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hepatitis C virus {{infection}} {{is the main}} cause of mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. The disease expression of mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is variable, ranging from mild clinical symptoms (purpura, arthralgia) to fulminant life-threatening complications (glomerulonephritis, widespread vasculitis). Treatment of hepatitis C virus-mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis may target either the <b>viral</b> trigger (<b>hepatitis</b> C virus) or the downstream B-cell arm of autoimmunity. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the treatment of hepatitis C virus-mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Aggressive antiviral therapy with Peg-IFNalpha and ribavirin should be considered as induction therapy for hepatitis C virus-mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis with mild to moderate disease severity and activity. In patients presenting with severe disease, an induction phase of immunosuppression is often necessary while awaiting the generally slow response to antiviral treatments. Combination therapy with rituximab and Peg-IFNalpha plus ribavirin appears logical as it may target both the <b>viral</b> trigger (<b>hepatitis</b> C virus) and cryoglobulin-producing B-cells. SUMMARY: Antiviral therapy and rituximab are the main therapeutic options in hepatitis C virus-mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. Further studies are needed to better define the therapeutic strategy...|$|R

25|$|Recombinant IFNα2 (α2a and α2b) has {{demonstrated}} efficiency {{in the treatment}} of patients diagnosed with some viral infections (such as chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> B and hepatitis C) or some kinds of cancer (melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and various hematological malignancies). Yet, patients on therapy with IFNα2 suffer from adverse effects which often require to reduce or even stop the treatment. These adverse effects include flu-like symptoms such as chills, fever, joint and muscle pain, depression with suicidal ideation, and a {{reduction in the number of}} blood cells. Thereby, IFNα2 has been progressively replaced by better tolerated drugs, such as antiviral agents or targeted antitumor therapies. Chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> C is the main indication for which IFNα2 remains widely used. Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence that endogenous type I IFNs plays a role in the induction of an immune antiviral response and that they can enhance the antitumor activity of chemotherapies, radiotherapies and some targeted therapies. Therefore, an important future goal for scientists is to modify IFNα2 in order to obtain an active molecule to be used in the clinic that does not exert adverse effects.|$|E
