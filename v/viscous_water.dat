More precisely our smallness assumption on the initial data is supercritical for the scaling of the equations. It allows us to give a first kind of answer {{to the problem of}} the existence of global strong solution with large initial energy data in dimension N= 2. To do this, we introduce the notion of quasi-solutions which consists in solving the pressureless <b>viscous</b> shallow <b>water</b> system. We can obtain such solutions at least for irrotationnal data which exhibit regularizing effects both on the velocity and also on the density. This smoothing effect is purely non linear and is crucial in order to build solution of the <b>viscous</b> shallow <b>water</b> system as perturbations of the "quasi-solutions". Indeed the pressure term remainder becomes small in high frequencies for the scaling of the equations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to derive rigorously the so called <b>viscous</b> shallow <b>water</b> {{equations}} given for instance page 958 - 959 in [A. Oron, S. H. Davis, S. G. Bankoff, Rev. Mod. Phys, 69 (1997), 931 – 980]. Such a system of equations is similar to compressible Navier-Stokes equations for a barotropic fluid with a non-constant viscosity. To do that, we consider a layer of incompressible and Newtonian fluid which is relatively thin, assuming no surface tension at the free surface. The motion of the fluid is described by 3 d Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity and free surface. We prove that for a set of suitable initial data (asymptotically close to “shallow water initial data”), the Cauchy problem for these equations is well-posed, and the solution converges to the solution of <b>viscous</b> shallow <b>water</b> equations. More precisely, we build the solution of the full problem as a perturbation of the strong solution to the <b>viscous</b> shallow <b>water</b> equations.

30|$|A kind of micro-bubbles {{system with}} a special {{structure}} named Colloidal Gas Aphron (CGA) is prepared by stirring a surfactant-xanthan gum solution at high speeds (above 4000  rpm, for example). The average bubble diameter of CGA can be about 10 – 100  μm; the behavior {{is that of a}} colloidal dispersion of a gas in a liquid (Ivan et al. 2002). Unlike ordinary foam bubbles, CGA has a unique thin aqueous protective shell. The CGA is a gaseous inner core encapsulated by an inner and outer surfactant shell. There is a <b>viscous</b> <b>water</b> layer located between these two surfactant layers, and the <b>viscous</b> <b>water</b> layer is important to CGA stability.

An important property of AX is their ability to form highly <b>viscous</b> <b>water</b> solutions; this peculiarity has {{a significant impact on}} the technological characteristics of wheat and determines the physiologically positive influence in consumption. Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var durum), the raw material for pasta production, is one of the most important crops in Italy.

Particular attention was addressed to identify the best suited genotypes for the production of innovative types of pasta with enhanced functional and organoleptic properties. The objective of the present study was to investigate the genetic variability of AX by examining a group of durum wheat genotypes collected at two localities in Italy for two consecutive years.

40|$|Gels equilibrated with aqueous {{solutions}} of impermeant solutes {{reached a}} steady state in which, {{in the absence}} of a pressure difference, the activity of water in the pores of the gel was higher than that of water in the external solution. The chemical potential of water in the gel/polymer solution slurry was higher than that in the supernatant polymer solution removed from the gel. Water in the pores of the gel decreased in density to 0. 96 as increasing osmotic stress was applied. It is argued that at constant temperature and pressure water can equilibrate between two compartments of unequal osmolality only by adjusting its molar volume. Experiments showed that when gel water had a higher activity than external water it was K+ selective; when it had a lower activity it was Na+ selective. It is proposed that a continuous spectrum of water structures can exist in these two compartment systems from dense, reactive, weakly-bonded water which selects highly hydrated ions, to expanded, stretched, unreactive, <b>viscous</b> <b>water</b> which is strongly hydrogen bonded and selects K+ and univalent anions. These findings are related to the state and properties of cytoplasmic water which is probably held under osmotic stress by the activity of the sodium pump...|$|E
