40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} component of many data mining projects is finding a good classification algorithm, a process that requires <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> thought <b>about</b> experimental design. If not done very carefully, comparative studies of classification {{and other types of}} algorithms can easily result in statistically invalid conclusions. This is especially true when one is using data mining techniques to analyze very large databases, which inevitably contain some statistically unlikely data. This paper describes several phenomena that can, if ignored, invalidate an experimental comparison. These phenomena and the conclusions that follow apply not only to classification, but to computational experiments in almost any aspect of data mining. The paper also discusses why comparative analysis is more important in evaluating some types of algorithms than for others, and provides some suggestions about how to avoid the pitfalls suffered by many experimental studies...|$|R

In contrast, Hoang was far more relaxed and commanded a high degree of confidence from the soldiers of the 261st Battalion. Thus, due to his strong leadership skills and popularity, Hoang was selected to take command of Viet Cong forces for operations in Ap Bac.

40|$|Almost all {{methods for}} the {{analysis}} of multiway data assume that the comparison of any two entries in the data array under study reflects or represents meaningful content-specific information. This is especially the case if one wants the data analysis to yield insight into the real mechanisms underlying the data. Violation of this assumption may imply data-analytic results that are of doubtful quality at best and worthless in the worst-case scenario. In the present paper, we first clarify why comparability is a key assumption in most methods for multiway data analysis. Next, we list a number of reasons why this assumption is very often violated in practice. We then review a few possible approaches that have been advanced to deal with problems of comparability, and discuss their advantages and shortcomings. We conclude by clarifying that any satisfactory solution to comparability problems requires a <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> reflection <b>about</b> the data collection and the ultimate goal of the data analysis...|$|R

We used a questionnaire dealing with alimentary habits, lifestyle and health status of the elderly individuals. Additionally, anthropometric measurements were taken of each subject relative to height and weight in order to calculate the BMI.

Around 217, when Liu Bei was planning to launch a campaign to seize control of Hanzhong Commandery from his rival Cao Cao, he consulted Zhou Qun {{and asked him to}} predict the outcome.

[...] At the time, Zhang Yu, another diviner serving under Liu Bei, also said, [...] "If you attack Hanzhong, your army will suffer a defeat." [...] Liu Bei ignored their advice and proceeded with the campaign. Just as Zhou Qun predicted, Liu Bei defeated Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign and captured the territories but not its people because they had already migrated elsewhere. During the campaign, Liu Bei also ordered Wu Lan (吳蘭) and Lei Tong (雷銅) to lead a detachment of troops from his main army to attack Wudu Commandery (武都郡; around present-day Longnan, Gansu), but, as Zhou Qun warned him, this detachment ended up being completely destroyed by Cao Cao's forces.|$|E
40|$|Context: The {{prevalence}} of occupational health hazards and mortality {{has been reported}} to be unusually high among people of India. Although developed countries are <b>very</b> much <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> the health in occupations it is quite neglected in the developing countries like India. Aims: To record PEFR in asymptomatic male workers exposed to chemical fumes for more than 2 years and compare the results with age matched unexposed, healthy male controls. Methods and Material: This was a comparative study between 50 asymptomatic male workers exposed to chemical fumes for more than 2 years in various industries located at Jeedimetla Industrial Area and 50 unexposed healthy male individuals from general population. The sampling was done by simple random sampling (lottery method). The data was collected in the Research Laboratory of Physiology. Anthropometry like weight, height, was measured and the PEFR test was performed in the standing position by taking a deep inspiration and then blowing out as hard and as quickly as possible with their nose closed. Data was analyzed by using SPSS package and was expressed in terms of mean ± SD. Results: It was observed that mean PEFR was statistically highly significant in cases (p = 0. 0001), and PEFR decreased with increase in duration of exposure. Conclusions: Thus, it can be concluded that apparently healthy individuals may also have abnormal PEFR findings. Hence, a regular check on these parameters will help them in reducing the chances of its manifestation at a future date...|$|R

In Greece co-unitholders, which are persons participating in the same units of M/F have exactly {{the same rights as}} the unitholder (according to the Law for the deposits in common account 5638/1932). The unitholders have to sign and accept the document which describes the purpose of the Mutual Fund, how it operates, and anything concerning the Fund. This document is the regulation of the M/F. The property of each M/F by law have to be under the control of a bank legally operating in Greece (Greek or foreign). The bank is the custodian of the M/F and except of the custody of the fund also controls the lawfulness of all movements of the management company. The Supervisory and Regulatory Body of M.F.
