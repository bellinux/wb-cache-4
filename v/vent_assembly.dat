40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis/Critical Items List (FMEA/CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. The independent analysis results corresponding to the Orbiter Atmospheric Revitalization and Pressure Control Subsystem (ARPCS) are documented. The ARPCS hardware was categorized into the following subdivisions: (1) Atmospheric Make-up and Control (including the Auxiliary Oxygen Assembly, Oxygen Assembly, and Nitrogen Assembly); and (2) Atmospheric Vent and Control (including the Positive Relief <b>Vent</b> <b>Assembly,</b> Negative Relief <b>Vent</b> <b>Assembly,</b> and Cabin <b>Vent</b> <b>Assembly).</b> The IOA analysis process utilized available ARPCS hardware drawings and schematics for defining hardware assemblies, components, and hardware items.

40|$|New {{infrared}} absorption spectra, thermo-gravimetric analyses and optical-and {{scanning electron microscopy}} of shock-recovered specimens of antigorite serpentine (Mg_ 3 Si_ 2 O_ 5 (OH) _ 4) from the pressure range between 25 to 59 GPa are reported. The infrared spectra show systematic changes in absorption peaks related to structural and molecular surface absorbed water. H_ 2 O absorption peaks increase {{at the expense of}} OH peaks with increasing shock pressure. Changes in SiO bond vibrational modes with increasing shock pressure parallel those seen for other, non-hydrous minerals. Thermogravimetric analyses of shock-recovered samples determine the amount of shock-induced water loss. For samples shocked in <b>vented</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the data define a relation between shock-induced water loss versus shock pressure. Results for samples shocked in sealed assemblies demonstrate a dependence of water loss on shock pressure and target confinement. For the <b>vented</b> <b>assembly</b> samples, a linear relation between shock pressure and both the length of dehydration interval and the effective activation energy for releasing post-shock structural water in antigorite is found. Optical and scanning electron miscroscopy of shocked antigorite reveal a number of textures thought to be unique to shock loading of volatile-bearing minerals. Gas bubbles, which probably are the result of shock-released H_ 2 O appear to be injected into zones of partial melting. This process may produce the vesicular dark veins which are distributed throughout heavily shocked samples. The present observations suggest several criteria which may constrain possible shock histories of the hydrous matrix phases of carbonaceous condrites. A model is proposed for explaining hydrous alteration processes occurring on carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies {{in the course of their}} accretion. We speculate that shock loading of hydrous minerals would release and redistribute free water in the regoliths of carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies giving rise to the observed hydrous alterations...|$|R

The overall performance of the TEM- 5 components and test equipment was nominal. Dissembly inspection revealed that joint putty was in contact with the inner groove of the inner primary seal of the ignitor adapter-to-forward dome (inner) joint gasket; this condition had not occurred on any previous static test motor or flight RSRM.

Each <b>vent</b> valve <b>assembly</b> includes a cantilever spring that is flat in an unstressed condition and that has a free end portion. The cantilever spring is secured to an exterior surface of the airbag housing and flexed to cause the second free end portion of the cantilever spring to be pressed, with a preset force, against a vent port or a closure covering the vent port to seal the vent port until inflation gas pressure within the airbag reaches a preselected value determined by the preset force whereupon the free end portion of the cantilever spring is lifted from the vent port by the inflation gases within the airbag to vent the inflation gases from within the airbag. The resilience of the cantilever spring maintains a substantially constant pressure within the airbag during a ride-down portion of an energy absorbing event by causing the cantilever spring to vent gases through the vent port whenever {{the pressure of the}} inflation gases reaches the preselected value and by causing the cantilever spring to close the vent port whenever the pressure of the inflation gases falls below the preselected value...|$|R
40|$|Decontamination cover forming {{cracks and}} <b>vent</b> cup <b>assembly</b> leaks through the {{decontamination}} covers were early manufacturing problems. The decontamination cover total manufacturing process yield was {{as low as}} 55 %. Applicable tooling and procedures were examined. All manufacturing steps from foil fabrication to final assembly leak testing were considered as possible causes or contributing factors to these problems. The following principal changes were made to correct these problems: (1) the foil annealing temperature was reduced from 1375 {degrees} to 1250 {degrees}C, (2) the decontamination cover fabrication procedure (including visual inspection for surface imperfections and elimination of superfluous operations) was improved, (3) the postforming dye penetrant inspection procedure was revised for increased sensitivity, (4) a postforming (prewelding) 1250 {degrees}C/ 1 h vacuum stress-relief operation was added, (5) a poststress relief (prewelding) decontamination cover piece-part leak test was implemented, (6) the hold-down fixture used during the decontamination cover-to-cup weld was modified, and concomitantly, and (7) the foil fabrication process was changed from the extruding and rolling of 63 -mm-diam vacuum arc-remelted ingots (extrusion process) to the rolling of 19 -mm-square arc-melted drop castings (drop cast process). Since these changes were incorporated, the decontamination cover total manufacturing process yield has been 91 %. Most importantly, more than 99 % of the decontamination covers welded onto <b>vent</b> cup <b>assemblies</b> were acceptable.

40|$|A {{total of}} 68 quench tests were {{conducted}} in a <b>vented</b> bomb <b>assembly</b> (VBA). Designed to simulate full-scale motor operating conditions, this laboratory apparatus uses a 2 -inch-diameter, end-burning propellant charge and an insulated disc of consolidated hydrated aluminum sulfate along with the explosive charge necessary to disperse the salt and inject it onto the burning surface. The VBA was constructed to permit variation of motor design parameters of interest; i. e., weight of salt per unit burning surface area, weight of explosive per unit weight of salt, distance from salt surface to burning surface, incidence angle of salt injection, chamber pressure, and burn time. Completely satisfactory salt quenching, without re-ignition, occurred in only two VBA tests. These were accomplished with a quench charge ratio (QCR) of 0. 023 lb salt per square inch of burning surface at dispersing charge ratios (DCR) of 13 and 28 lb of salt per lb of explosive.

50|$|Copper is {{used for}} roofing because it offers {{corrosion}} resistance, durability, long life, low maintenance, radio frequency shielding, lightning protection, and sustainability benefits.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of a <b>vented</b> inverted fuel <b>assembly</b> for a sodium-cooled fast reactor. The inverted geometry has been previously investigated for application in Gas-cooled Fast Reactors since it improves thermal-hydraulic and neutronic performance of those reactors. Venting is a concept studied during the past and its major past application in sodiumcooled fast reactors was in the Dounreay Fast Reactor in the United Kingdom. In this work the inverted assembly approach was adopted because it allows high fuel volume fraction, reduction of the coolant void reactivity, less neutron leakage, {{the reduction of the}} enrichment and lower pressure drop for the same channel length because grids nor wire wraps are no longer necessary. However all results of this work apply also to venting of conventional fuel pins. Performance criteria for <b>vented</b> fuel <b>assemblies</b> in term of materials, thermalhydraulics and venting systems have been investigated in order to set design goals. In particular, for the materials, a limit for maximum cladding surface temperature, cladding and other core internal structure fluence and maximum fuel temperature in the hot channel has been identified. For the thermal-hydraulic analysis, the goals are increasing fuel volume fraction, keeping the fuel and the cladding surface temperature as low as possible compared with those of a similar power rating core and minimizing core pressure drops. Regarding the venting system the design goals are retaining as much 137 Cs in an upper plenum and keeping the overall assembly height within the values of current technology for a reactor of similar size. Therefore the height of an upper plenum (which must contain sodium bond volume expelled due to fuel thermal expansion, sodium bond volume due to its thermal expansion and the cesium volume of a single assembly if the cesium is completely released into the plenum) has been determined. Investigation of physical and chemical behavior of volatile fission products in sodium is presented, {{in order to determine the}} maximum activity inventory which would eventually be released into the primary sodium. Assumptions for the simplified approach adopted are discussed. Results of this analysis show that the most troublesome radionuclides in terms of propensity to escape from the venting system (due to their half-life being longer than a threshold time chosen based on physical behavior of escaping fission products: bubbling out for gases and pure diffusion for other volatile elements) are noble gases (85 Kr and 133 Xe), cesium (134 Cs and 137 Cs) and tritium (3 H). For the thermal-hydraulic analysis a comparison between a pin-type fuel assembly and three inverted fuel assemblies with different parameters has been made, in order to demonstrate benefits of such a concept and to determine the best configuration. In particular attention is on core pressure drop, fuel and cladding temperature given the mass flow rate and assembly power. The results show that the best configuration has the same core pressure drop and hence pumping power and the same total active fuel length of a similar performance pin-type core. A final <b>vented</b> inverted fuel <b>assembly</b> design is proposed, which meets all the design goals. Such a configuration lets volatile radionuclides with short enough half-lives completely decay before release or be released in a negligible quantity after an infinite time of diffusion in sodium. Longer lived fission products will be released into the coolant, while fission gases will be vented first into the sodium and eventually to the cover gas after bubbling up through the sodium itself. Methods for purifying cover gas and coolant from vented radionuclides are proposed as well as storage systems for radioactive materials from the purification process. Results show that charcoal is the best absorber for noble gases whereas cold traps can be usefully used to remove cesium and tritium from primary sodium. Noble gases are produced in a (conservatively estimated) quantity of 38 m 3 /year (at STP) at core end-of-life and can be stored in adsorbent packed cylinders. Materials in cold traps are chemically treated to obtain liquid waste. Hence they can be converted into a solid and then stored in Pyrex glass. Finally a review of materials with regard to increasing the coolant core outlet temperature is given: in particular HT 9 cladding and various ex-core structural materials. It has been shown that, with regard to cladding material limits, venting can provide at least a 20 °C increase in the core outlet temperature since venting decreases mechanical stress on the cladding due to fission gas pressure. Also, based on current designs and experience high-chromium steels are very promising candidates for ex-core structural material (e. g piping), together with ODS (if their chemical compatibility with liquid sodium and weldability are verified) : the latter can operate at about 600 °C still keeping a margin of 100 °C from the upper temperature limit. Based on the present analysis is that the ex-core structural material limit is a more limiting factor than the cladding material limit with regard to increasing the coolant core outlet temperature. In conclusion it has been demonstrated that the <b>vented</b> inverted fuel <b>assembly</b> configuration is an interesting and valuable concept to take into account for future investigation in order to improve the performance of sodium-cooled fast reactors...|$|R
40|$|An overall plant {{design was}} {{developed}} for a gas-cooled fast reactor employing a direct supercritical Brayton power conversion system. The most important findings were that (1) the concept could be capital-cost competitive, but startup fuel cycle costs are penalized by the low core power density, specified {{in large part to}} satisfy the goal of significatn post-accident passive natural convection cooling; (2) active decay heat removal is preferable as the first line of defense, with passive performance in a backup role; (3) an innovative tube-in-duct fuel <b>assembly,</b> <b>vented</b> to the primpary coolant, appears to be practicable; and (4) use of the S-Co 2 GFR to support hydrogen production is a synergistic application, since sufficient energy can be recuperated from the product H 2 and 02 to allow the electrolysis cell to run 250 C hotter than the reactor coolant, and the water boilers can be used for reactor decay heat removal.

40|$|Analysis {{has been}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} utilization of fuel <b>assembly</b> <b>venting</b> in the reference design of the gas-cooled fast reactor under study {{as part of the}} larger research effort at MIT under Gen-IV NERI Project No. 05 - 044, "Optimized Competitive Supercritical-CO₂ Cycle GFR for Gen-IV Service. " The focus of this work is on selection and optimization of a fuel assembly configuration best suited for venting, assessment of the radionuclide release of such an assembly design, and identification of plant systems which must be altered in order to support fuel venting. The innovative tube-in-duct design of the reference GFR fuel assembly is particularly well suited to venting, allowing fission products to diffuse into a common header before being routed along a vent path and eventually being released to the primary coolant system. A set of equations were developed which model the transport of fission products from fuel to vent path to primary coolant inventory and then into the containment atmosphere, with emphasis on conservatism in calculations of coolant impurity levels. Using these equations in a computer code, the lengthy list of radioactive and chemically volatile fission products for study was reduced to only fifteen species of any great concern. Of these, 85 Kr and 137 Cs were considered conservative bounding cases on the behavior of the other nuclides. The chemistry of the fission products released to the coolant was explored. In particular, reactions between fission products and their surroundings were identified, and estimates of deposition of both compounds and free atoms on steel surfaces were made. Investigation of reactions between fission products and CO₂ revealed that the formation of stable oxides would lead to deposition of most volatile species within the fuel assembly's debris trap. (cont.) The radioactive volatiles which remain in the primary comprise only tritium, two isotopes of iodine, two isotopes of tellurium, and three isotopes of cesium. These species deposit on primary surfaces to a great enough degree to preclude hands-on primary system maintenance. In addition, techniques for removal of volatile and radioactive species from the primary coolant were identified, and a scheme for purification of the primary coolant volume was selected. The analysis confirms that primary coolant activity can be maintained at acceptable levels when purification of the primary coolant volume occurs once per hour. The response of the vent system to changes in primary system pressure was also investigated. In particular, the small periodic pressure transients known as breathing were studied, as were loss-of-coolant type scenarios. Both cases were investigated using hand calculations and computational techniques, and the radiological consequences of each were addressed. The analysis demonstrated the ability of the <b>vented</b> fuel <b>assembly</b> to quickly equalize pressure {{in the event of a}} sudden drop in operating pressure, and also showed the ability of a succession of plena to prevent the expulsion of much of the activity inventory of the plena during a breathing transient. Conversely, the use of a single plenum results in reduced activity release during a LOCA. After consideration of both results, a two-plenum approach, with a large lower annular plenum following a small upper axial plenum, was selected as the final design. by Stephanie A. McKee. Thesis (S.

40|$|VMS {{deposits}} of the South Urals developed within the evolving Urals palaeo-ocean between Silurian and Late Devonian times. Arc-continent collision between Baltica and the Magnitogorsk Zone (arc) in the south-western Urals effectively terminated submarine volcanism in the Magnitogorsk Zone {{with which the}} bulk of the VMS deposits are associated. The majority of the Urals VMS deposits formed within volcanic-dominated sequences in deep seawater settings. Preservation of macro and micro vent fauna in the sulphide bodies is both testament to the seafloor setting for much of the sulphides but also the exceptional degree of preservation and lack of metamorphic overprint of the deposits and host rocks. The deposits in the Urals have previously been classified in terms of tectonic setting, host rock associations and metal ratios in line with recent tectono-stratigraphic classifications. In addition to these broad classes, it is clear that in a number of the Urals settings, an evolution of the host volcanic stratigraphy is accompanied by an associated change in the metal ratios of the VMS deposits, a situation previously discussed, for example, in the Noranda district of Canada. Two key structural settings are implicated in the South Urals. The first is seen in a preserved marginal allochthon west of the Main Urals Fault where early arc tholeiites host Cu–Zn mineralization in deposits including Yaman Kasy, which is host to the oldest macro <b>vent</b> fauna <b>assembly</b> known to science. The second tectonic setting for the South Urals VMS is the Magnitogorsk arc where study has highlighted the presence of a preserved early forearc assemblage, arc tholeiite to calc-alkaline sequences and rifted arc bimodal tholeiite sequences. The boninitc rocks of the forearc host Cu–(Zn) and Cu–Co VMS deposits, the latter hosted in fragments within the Main Urals Fault Zone (MUFZ) which marks the line of arc-continent collision in Late Devonian times. The arc tholeiites host Cu–Zn deposits with an evolution to more calc-alkaline felsic volcanic sequences matched with a change to Zn–Pb–Cu polymetallic deposits, often gold-rich. Large rifts in the arc sequence are filled by thick bimodal tholeiite sequences, themselves often showing an evolution to a more calc-alkaline nature. These thick bimodal sequences are host to the largest of the Cu–Zn VMS deposits. The exceptional degree of preservation in the Urals has permitted the identification of early seafloor clastic and hydrolytic modification (here termed halmyrolysis sensu lato) to the sulphide assemblages prior to diagenesis and this results in large-scale modification to the primary VMS body, resulting in distinctive morphological and mineralogical sub-types of sulphide body superimposed upon the tectonic association classification. It is proposed that a better classification of seafloor VMS systems is thus achievable using a three stage classification based on (a) tectonic (hence bulk volcanic chemistry) association, (b) local volcanic chemical evolution within a single edifice and (c) seafloor reworking and halmyrolysis. <br/...|$|R
