Control of aphids with insecticide application is the only means of managing this problem in production years that are highly favorable for aphids.|$|R

2500|$|Proliferation {{risk from}} {{reprocessing}} - Effective reprocessing implies a proliferation risk. LFTRs {{could be used}} to handle plutonium from other reactors as well. However, as stated above, plutonium is chemically difficult to separate from thorium and plutonium cannot be used in bombs if diluted in large amounts of thorium. In addition, the plutonium produced by the thorium fuel cycle is mostly Pu-238, which produces high levels of spontaneous neutrons and decay heat that make it impossible to construct a fission bomb with this isotope alone, and extremely difficult to construct one containing even <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentages</b> of it. The heat production rate of 567W/kg means that a bomb core of this material would continuously produce several kilowatts of heat. The only cooling route is by conduction through the surrounding high explosive layers, which are poor conductors. This creates unmanageably high temperatures that would destroy the assembly. The spontaneous fission rate of 1204kBq/g is over twice that of Pu-240. Even <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentages</b> of this isotope would reduce bomb yield drastically by [...] "predetonation" [...] due to neutrons from spontaneous fission starting the chain reaction causing a [...] "fizzle" [...] rather than an explosion. Reprocessing itself involves automated handling in a fully closed and contained hot cell, which complicates diversion. Compared to today's extraction methods such as PUREX, the pyroprocesses are inaccessible and produce impure fissile materials, often with large amounts of fission product contamination. While not a problem for an automated system, it poses severe difficulties for would-be proliferators.|$|R

However, forests in this state have been historically depleted with species such as holm oak, pine and oyamel in danger of extinction. The lack of forest cover has led to erosion and other environmental problems. Most forestry products come from pine and holm oak, with most being harvested in the area around the city of Guanajuato.|$|E
25|$|The opsins (photopigments) {{present in}} the L and M cones are encoded on the X chromosome; {{defective}} encoding of these leads to the two most common forms of color blindness. The OPN1LW gene, which codes for the opsin {{present in the}} L cones, is highly polymorphic (a recent study by Verrelli and Tishkoff found 85 variants {{in a sample of}} 236 men). A <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> of women may have an extra type of color receptor because they have different alleles for the gene for the L opsin on each X chromosome. X chromosome inactivation means that while only one opsin is expressed in each cone cell, both types occur overall, and some women may therefore show a degree of tetrachromatic color vision. Variations in OPN1MW, which codes the opsin expressed in M cones, appear to be rare, and the observed variants have no effect on spectral sensitivity.|$|E

Grouped with Argentina and Brazil, Mexico is part of a region which is third in cheese production, behind Europe and the US. Cheese sales in Mexico were 218,000 tons in 2003, with fresh (not aged) cheeses making up over one-third of the market, the largest segment. Only 126,200 tons of the cheese consumed in the country that year were produced domestically, with the rest imported. About 10% of the milk production in the country is dedicated to the making of dairy products, most of which is cheese. The overwhelming majority of cheese is made with cows’ milk. While a number of cheeses are made with goats’ milk, they are not as popular and have gotten more difficult to find in markets. Shepherding, though, historically has never been a major commercial activity nationwide, efforts to since the 1980s to promote sheep milk and meat have resulted in a significant {{rise in the number of}} sheep being raised.

Thirdly, it records the results obtained in conjunction with an optical examination of the heavy minerals separated from various quartzites occurring in certain areas of Malaya. The diagnostic feature of the data determined by this preliminary investigation indicate the possibilities of utilizing heavy mineral characteristics, as analternative to fossil evidence, for the differentiation or correlation of these quartzites. ...|$|R
40|$|Uranium is an alpha-emitting, radioactive, {{heavy metal}} that occurs {{naturally}} in the earth’s crust {{at an average}} concentration of about 2 ppm (approximately 1 pCi/g). Uranium exists in several isotopic forms. The most toxicologically important forms are anthropogenic 232 U and 233 U and naturally occurring 234 U, 235 238 238 U, and U. Uranium isotopes decay by alpha emission. U decays through 16 radioactive progeny, including 234 U, to reach stable lead- 206 (206 Pb), while 235 U decays through 13 radioactive progeny to reach stable 207 Pb. Uranium is present in nearly all rocks and soils; {{some parts of the}} United States, particularly the West, has higher-than-average uranium levels due to natural geological formations. Anthropogenic sources of uranium include uranium mining and milling, uranium conversion and enrichment, uranium fuel fabrication, nuclear weapons production, production of phosphate fertilizers from phosphate rocks containing uranium, and the improper disposal of uranium mine tailings.
