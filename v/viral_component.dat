40|$|Individuals who are chronically {{infected}} with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) are highly heterogeneous with respect to serum levels of HBV DNA, HBV particles and viral proteins. Since circulating leukocytes, such as monocytes, are constantly exposed to these <b>viral</b> <b>components,</b> {{it is likely that}} the functionality of these cells is affected. However, at present, little information is available on the consequences of the interaction between monocytes and <b>viral</b> <b>components.</b> Therefore, we examined the in vitro effects of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) on monocytes and evaluated whether these effects were reflected in vivo. We observed that in vitro HBsAg exposure of monocytes induced robust production of IL- 6 and TNF. However, between chronic HBV patients with distinct levels of serum HBsAg, HBV early antigen (HBeAg), and HBV DNA, TLR-induced monocyte cytokine production did not differ. Importantly, HBsAg-induced cytokine production by monocytes was similar between patients and healthy controls showing that earlier in vivo exposure to HBsAg does not affect the in vitro response. Additionally, we show that IL- 10 is able to inhibit cytokine production by HBsAg-induced monocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that monocytes can recognize and respond to HBsAg, resulting in vigorous pro-inflammatory cytokine production in vitro. However, phenotype and function of the monocyte compartment in chronic HBV patients are not influenced by differences in levels of serum <b>viral</b> <b>components,</b> suggesting that regulatory mechanisms are active to avoid excessive in vivo monocyte activation...|$|R

50|$|The viral eukaryogenesis {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} eukaryotes {{are composed of}} three ancestral elements: a <b>viral</b> <b>component</b> that became the modern nucleus; a prokryotic cell (originally thought to be very primitive but more probably an archaeon according to Eocyte hypothesis) that donated the cytoplasm and cell membrane of modern cells; and another prokaryotic (bacterial) cell that, by endocytosis, became the modern mitochondrion or chloroplast. Molecular homology suggests that all life shares a single common ancestor, and evidence, alongside the fossil record, {{can be found in}} the evolution of prokaryotes, and Archaea prior to the eukaryotes. The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis points to the cell cycle of eukaryotes, particularly sex and meiosis, as evidence. Little is known about DNA or the origins of reproduction in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. It is thus possible that viruses were involved in the creation of Earth's first cells.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{research}} suggests that cultivating positive emotions, such as gratitude, may also facilitate prosocial behavior. A study by Bartlett & DeSteno examined the ability of gratitude to shape costly prosocial behavior, demonstrating that gratitude increases efforts to assist a benefactor even when such efforts are costly (i.e., hedonically negative), and that this increase is qualitatively different from efforts given from just general positive affective state. They also show that gratitude can increase assistance provided to strangers, not just close social ties. Awe is another positive emotional state that has been closely linked to inspiring generosity and prosocial behavior. Piff et al. studied this phenomenon through experiments using economic and ethical-decision making games and explain, [...] "When people experience awe {{they really want to}} share that experience with other people, suggesting that it has this particularly <b>viral</b> <b>component</b> to it... awe binds people together—by causing people to want to share their positive experiences collectively with one another." ...|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} ways to target {{integrase}} but strand transfer inhibition is the most intuitively obvious and readily pursued to date. Other targets include, for example, the protein domains beyond the active site of IN. The domains interact with viral or host DNA and are important for binding to the enzyme. It is possible to hamper functions of the enzyme by disrupting or removing these bindings. PIC is a multimeric protein structure inside the host cell, composed of both viral and host proteins. Integrase is a part of PIC‘s <b>viral</b> <b>component.</b> PIC‘s viral and host proteins are believed to modulate intrinsic activity of the enzyme, shuttle PIC to the nucleus and direct integration of viral DNA into a transcriptionally active region of the host genome. If it were possible to exclude certain proteins from the PIC it would block the ability of the virus to integrate into the host genome. The process where the retroviral RNA is transcribed to DNA and then integrated into the host cell's genome is shown in figure 2.|$|E

40|$|The matrix (M) protein of {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus (VSV) {{expressed in the}} absence of other <b>viral</b> <b>components</b> causes many of the cytopathic effects of VSV, including an inhibition of host gene expression and the induction of cell rounding.

To test this hypothesis, host gene expression and cell rounding were analyzed after the transfection of M mRNA into HeLa cells stably overexpressing Bcl- 2 (HeLa-Bcl- 2 cells). We have shown previously that Bcl- 2 inhibits M-protein-induced apoptosis. Here, we show that activation of the apoptotic pathways downstream of Bcl- 2 is not required for the inhibition of host gene expression by M protein. In contrast, overexpression of Bcl- 2 inhibited cell rounding induced by M protein, indicating that apoptotic pathways downstream of Bcl- 2 are required for the cell-rounding activities of M protein...|$|R

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) infection {{alters the}} expression of many cellular genes, including IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [Zhu, H., Cong, J. -P., Mamtora, G., Gingeras, T. & Shenk, T. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 14470 – 14475]. By using high-density cDNA microarrays, we show that the HCMV-regulated gene expression profile in fibroblasts does not differ substantially from the response generated by IFN. Furthermore, we identified the specific <b>viral</b> <b>component</b> triggering this response as the envelope glycoprotein B (gB). Cells treated with gB, but not other herpesviral glycoproteins, exhibited the same transcriptional profile as HCMV-infected cells. Thus, the interaction of gB with its as yet unidentified cellular receptor is the principal mechanism by which HCMV alters cellular gene expression early during infection. These findings highlight a pioneering paradigm for the consequences of virus–receptor interactions...|$|E
40|$|Human {{rhinovirus}} 39 (HRV 39) {{is blocked}} in nonpermissive L cells at both adsorption and intracellular replication steps.

40|$|Undoubtedly, {{mast cells}} {{play a central}} role in {{allergic}} processes. Specific allergen cross-linking of IgE bound to the high affinity receptors (FcεRI) on the mast cell surface leads to the release of preformed mediators and newly synthesized mediators, i. e. metabolites of arachidonic acid and cytokines. More and more data indicate that bacteria and viruses can influence FcεRI-dependent mast cell activation. Some bacterial and <b>viral</b> <b>components</b> can reduce the surface expression of FcεRI. There are also findings that ligation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by bacterial or viral antigens can affect IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation and preformed mediator release as well as eicosanoid production. The synergistic interaction of TLR ligands and allergen can also modify cytokine synthesis by mast cells stimulated via FcεRI. Moreover, data suggest that specific IgE for bacterial or viral antigens can influence mast cell activity. What is more, some bacterial and <b>viral</b> <b>components</b> or some endogenous proteins produced during viral infection can act as superantigens by interacting with the VH 3 domain of IgE. All these observations indicate that bacterial and viral infections modify the course of allergic diseases by affecting FcεRI-dependent mast cell activation. ...|$|R
40|$|When {{a helper}} T-cell (TH) clone {{specific}} for the hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, matrix protein, or nucleoprotein of influenza strain A/PR/ 8 / 34 is adoptively transferred to athymic mice 1 day after virus infection the anti-viral antibody {{response of the}} mouse is enhanced. This response is directed predominantly to the hemagglutinin and requires associative T-cell-B-cell interactions. Delaying transfer of the TH clone has three consequences: (i) {{the onset of the}} anti-hemagglutinin antibody response is delayed; (ii) the titer of the anti-hemagglutinin response is reduced; and (iii) the titer of the antibody in the response against the internal proteins, matrix protein and nucleoprotein, is enhanced upon transfer of matrix protein- or nucleoprotein-specific, but not hemagglutinin- or neuraminidase-specific, TH clones. Thus, there is a hierarchy of help: B cells recognizing <b>viral</b> surface <b>components,</b> hemagglutinin or neuraminidase, can receive help from TH clones specific for any of the major structural viral proteins. In contrast, B cells responding to internal <b>viral</b> <b>components,</b> matrix protein or nucleoprotein, are restricted to receiving help almost exclusively from TH clones with the same protein specificity. These observations suggest that, upon B-cell surface immunoglobulin-antigen interaction and uptake of intact virus, B cells specific for viral surface proteins process and present all major structural viral antigens, enabling the B cells to interact with TH clones specific for any virion protein. B cells recognizing internal <b>viral</b> <b>components,</b> which may be accessible to interaction with B-cell immunoglobulin receptors mainly as free proteins, would present only the protein for which they are specific and, thereby, receive help only from the TH clones of the same protein specificity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMorphogenesis of {{influenza}} virus {{is a complex}} multistep process involving transport of all <b>viral</b> <b>components</b> as either individual or subviral components to the specified assembly site and interaction among the <b>viral</b> <b>components</b> in an ordered fashion to initiate the budding process. Envelope glycoprotein(s) {{is believed to be}} the major determinant in selecting the viral budding site since the majority of the viral glycoproteins are directed to the budding site independent of other <b>viral</b> <b>components.</b> Influenza viruses bud from the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells and all three envelope proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and M 2, are also targeted independently to the apical surface. Since HA is the major viral envelope protein, we decided to test whether basolaterally expressed HA can make the virus bud from the basolateral surface. Accordingly, we introduced the tyrosine-based basolateral-sorting signal to the cytoplasmic tail of HA by changing Cys 561 → Tyr 561 and generated a transfectant virus by reverse genetics. Compared to the parent WSN virus, the mutant virus (HAtyr virus) contained less HA on its envelope. While the wild-type (wt) HA was > 95 % apical, the mutated HA (HAtyr) was approximately 60 % basolateral in both transfected and virus-infected polarized MDCK cells. Also, HAtyr protein exhibited a much higher rate of endocytosis than the wt HA, in both apical and basolateral surface of transfected as well as virus-infected cells. However, the HAtyr virus, similar to wt WSN virus, was seen to bud almost exclusively (> 99 %) from the apical side of polarized MDCK cells. This finding was confirmed by using neuraminidase to facilitate virus release, by treating the collected virus particles with trypsin to cleave HA 0 → HA 1 and HA 2, by protein analysis of released virus particles, and finally, by electron microscopy. Therefore HA, the major glycoprotein alone, does not determine the budding site, and other factor(s), possibly both viral and host, is responsible for selecting the budding site {{of influenza}} virus...|$|R

Enveloped nucleocapsids consisted of 15 structural proteins ranging in molecular weight from 12, 600 to 97, 300. Five of these proteins, having approximate molecular weights of 17, 800, 39, 700, 42, 400, 48, 200, and 97, 300, were identified as envelope proteins by surface radioiodination of the enveloped nucleocapsids.

40|$|International audienceViruses {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} parasites on earth and they have been found to infect animals, plants and bacteria. However, different types of viruses can only infect a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific. Herpesviruses constitute a large family of DNA viruses that cause diseases in animals, including humans and that are known to undergo lytic or latent infections. Consequently, they developed numerous strategies to counteract host antiviral responses to escape immune surveillance. Innate immune response constitutes the first line of host defence that limits the viral spread and also {{plays an important role in}} the activation of adaptive immune response. <b>Viral</b> <b>components</b> are recognized by specific host Pathogen Recognition Receptors (PRRs) which trigger the activation of IRF 3, NF-κB and AP- 1, three regulators of IFN-β expression.
