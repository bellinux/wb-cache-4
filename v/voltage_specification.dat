One such application of the SET that has attracted much research attention is its use in detecting quantum phenomena at deep cryogenic temperatures. The sensitivity of an SET can reach its theoretical limit and therefore holds immense potential as a readout device for future solid state quantum computers.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 36) The California State University of Northridge CubeSat, code named CSUNSat, {{will test}} a new low-temperature capable, battery/ultra capacitor power {{system with a}} low voltage/low power spacecraft bus. The spacecraft bus ranges from 3 V to 4. 2 V with a max power of 5 W. The requirements demanded a custom power system design with two isolated but switchable battery sources; the low temp battery, and an industry standard lithium ion battery. A simplistic topology is desired to minimize cost, area, and risk of design problems. The spacecraft uses an unregulated direct energy transfer (DET) system with a shunt regulated bus. The power system is comprised of three sub-systems; the Shunt Regulator, Battery Controller, and Power Processing Unit. The Shunt Regulator shunts the excess energy of the spacecraft bus to prevent the bus voltage from exceeding the maximum <b>voltage</b> <b>specification</b> of either battery. The Battery Controller controls the switching between the two batteries. And the Power Processing Unit provides regulated 3. 3 V, 5 V, and 12 V supplies for the spacecraft.

40|$|The {{progress}} {{to date on}} the analysis and design of a high power, digitally controlled spacecraft power system is described. Several battery discharger topologies were compared for use in the space platform application. Updated information has been provided on the battery <b>voltage</b> <b>specification.</b> Initially it was thought to be in the 30 to 40 V range. It is now specified to be 53 V to 84 V. This eliminated the tapped-boost and the current-fed auto-transformer converters from consideration. After consultations with NASA, it was decided to trade-off the following topologies: (1) boost converter; (2) multi-module, multi-phase boost converter; and (3) voltage-fed push-pull with auto-transformer. A non-linear design optimization software tool was employed to facilitate an objective comparison. Non-linear design optimization insures that the best design of each topology is compared. The results indicate that a four-module, boost converter with each module operating 90 degrees out of phase is the optimum converter for the space platform. Large-signal and small-signal models were generated for the shunt, charger, discharger, battery, and the mode controller. The models were first tested individually according to the space platform power system specifications supplied by NASA. The effect of battery voltage imbalance on parallel dischargers was investigated with respect to dc and small-signal responses. Similarly, the effects of paralleling dischargers and chargers were also investigated. A solar array and shunt model was included in these simulations. A model for the bus mode controller (power control unit) was also developed to interface the Orbital replacement Unit (ORU) model to the platform power system. Small signal models were used to generate the bus impedance plots in the various operating modes. The large signal models were integrated into a system model, and time domain simulations were performed to verify bus regulation during mode transitions. Some changes have subsequently been incorporated into the models. The changes include the use of a four module boost discharger, and a new model for the mode controller, which includes the effects of saturation. The new simulations for the boost discharger show the improvement in bus ripple that can be achieved by phase-shifted operation of each of the boost modules...|$|E

However, within these vehicles, the relatively harsh electrical environment that exists can often contain multiple sources of transient electrical phenomena, which can {{give rise to}} false and potentially fatal activation of the aforementioned safety devices. The need for effective and reliable yet inexpensive built-in microelectronic based transient protection against such occurrences therefore remains key. Historically, automotive microelectronic based transient protection schemes have largely been based upon a technique known as „level-triggered transient protection‟ (LTTP). More recently, the work of Cahill et al. has managed to improve upon the aforementioned approach through use of a technique known as „level-triggered timed shut-off transient protection‟ (LTSOTP). However, from an industrial perspective, all of the advancements reported have remained somewhat unattractive; predominately due to manufacturing complexity, reliability and cost associated issues.

(Therefore, it is possible that an output can actually drive more inputs than specified by fan-out, even of devices within the same family, if the particular devices being driven sink and/or source less current, as reported on their data sheets, than a [...] "standard" [...] device of that family.) Ultimately, whether a device has the fan-out capability to drive (with guaranteed reliability) a set of inputs is determined by adding up all the input-low (max.) source currents specified on the datasheets of the driven devices, adding up all the input-high (max.) sink currents of those same devices, and comparing those sums to the driving device's guaranteed maximum output-low sink current and output-high source current specifications, respectively. If both totals are within the driving device's limits, then it has the DC fan-out capacity to drive those inputs on those devices as a group, and otherwise it doesn't, regardless of the manufacturer's given fan-out number. However, for any reputable manufacturer, if this current analysis reveals that the device cannot drive the inputs, the fan-out number will agree.|$|R

An operational amplifier with a feedback resistor from output to the inverting input is the most straightforward implementation of such a TIA. However, even this simple TIA circuit requires careful trade-offs among noise gain, offset voltage, bandwidth, and stability. Clearly stability in a TIA is essential for good, reliable performance. This application note explains the empirical calculations for assessing stability and then shows how to fine-tune {{the selection of the}} feedback phase-compensation capacitor. A similar version of this article appeared in the October 28, 2011 issue of EDN magazine. Wild Oscillations: Why Do They Happen? Figures 1 to 3 show some basic TIA circuits.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} for design verification of power electronics systems subject to bounded uncertain inputs. In this method, the power electronics system, {{which consists of}} the power electronics converter circuit and the associated controller, is described by a switched-linear state-space representation, where {{some or all of}} the inputs may vary without control over some bounded range (e. g. load current, source voltage). The method relies on the solution to the reachability problem associated with this system, which is the computation of the set of all possible system trajectories that arise from different initial conditions, uncontrolled inputs, and inherent switching. The system design verification problem is solved by verifying that this set, called the reach set, remains within a region of the state-space defined by performance requirements (e. g. output <b>voltage</b> tolerance <b>specifications,</b> component <b>voltage</b> and current limits). Algorithms to solve the reachability problem for power electronics converters operating under both open-loop and closed-loop control are provided. The application of this method is illustrated through buck and boost converter simulation examples. Experimental validation of the method is carried out in a buck converter. Existing power electronics system design verification methods rely heavily on time-domain simulations. For each simulation, the set of possible inputs is randomly sampled to obtain a particular operating condition. A very large number of simulations are required in order to verify the behavior of the system for all possible operating conditions. These simulation-based methods also typically rely on the small-signal average model of the power electronics system. This model ignores the effects of switching and is only valid for small perturbations around the nominal operating point of the system. With the proposed methodology, it is only necessary to solve one set of matrix differential equations to account for all possible operating conditions. Furthermore, the proposed method uses a switched-linear model of power electronics systems, which is capable of capturing the full large-signal behavior of the system. Thus, the proposed methodology aims to produce a complete and computationally tractable solution to the power electronics system design verification problem...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposed}} {{an approach to}} study the power system voltage coordinated control using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). First, the hybrid Automata model for power system voltage control was given, and a hierarchical coordinated voltage control framework was described in detail. In the hierarchical control structure, the high layer is the coordinated layer for global voltage control, and the low layer is the power system controlled. Then, the paper introduced the LTL language, its specification formula and basic method for control. In the high layer, global <b>voltage</b> coordinated control <b>specification</b> was defined by LTL specification formula. In order to implement system voltage coordinated control, the LTL specification formula was transformed into hybrid Automata model by the proposed algorithms. The hybrid Automata in high layer could coordinate the different distributed voltage controller, and have constituted a closed loop global voltage control system satisfied the LTL specification formula. Finally, a simple example of power system voltage control include the OLTC controller, the switched capacitor controller and the under-voltage shedding load controller was given for simulating analysis and verification by the proposed approach for power system coordinated voltage control. The results of simulation showed that the proposed method in the paper is feasible...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the principles and}} characteristics of a novel bidirectional superposed dual active bridge dc-dc converter with an ac-link transformer, which has a mechanism formed from two bridge-type converters that are linked through superposition in additive polarity in series. Conventionally, for an isolated dual active bridge dc-dc converter, the rated voltage of its switching elements is decided according to the dc power source voltage and load current. Therefore, as the <b>voltage</b> and current <b>specifications</b> of a dc-dc converter become higher, physical size becomes larger, conduction and switching losses increase and power efficiency reduces. To solve this problem, the authors devised the proposed dc-dc converter capable of lowering the rated voltage of switching elements, by means of sharing dc power source voltage and load current between two converters. Further, {{the capacity of the}} high frequency transformer becomes small, making the dc-dc converter more efficient and smaller. We designed and constructed a 1 kW dc-dc converter prototype, and conducted performance evaluation testing. As a result, a conversion efficiency of 96. 6 % at a rated output of 1 kW was obtained. A detailed analysis of power flow was also carried out, to identify the characteristics of the converter developed. 2 nd International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems, PEDG 2010; Hefei; 16 June 2010 through 18 June 201...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the principles and}} characteristics of a novel ac-link bidirectional DC-DC converter with synchronous rectifier, which has a mechanism formed from two bridge-type DC converters that are linked through superposition in additive polarity in series. For an isolated dual active bridge DC-DC converter, which has been studied for many years, the rated voltage of its switching elements is decided according to DC power source voltage and load current. Therefore, as the <b>voltage</b> and current <b>specifications</b> of a converter become higher, physical size becomes larger, conduction and switching losses increase and power efficiency reduces. To solve this problem, the authors devised a unique converter capable of lowering the rated voltage of switching elements, by means of sharing DC power source voltage and load current between two converters. The capacity of the high frequency transformer becomes small, making converter downsizing possible. In addition, further efficiency improvement is facilitated by using MOSFET as switching elements, which have the feature of synchronous rectification. We designed and constructed a 1 kW converter system in which these advancements were incorporated, and conducted evaluation testing to verify the conversion efficiency and transient property. The results of testing demonstrated that this DC-DC converter had a conversion efficiency of 98. 2 % at the rated 1 kW, as well as very stable transient operation. A detailed analysis of power flow was also carried out, to identify {{the characteristics of the}} converter developed.
