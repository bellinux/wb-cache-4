The test is used extensively in the concrete industry for assessing concrete quality and is now being included in concrete specification documents. Because the underlying physics of the test are fairly well understood, {{it is possible to}} create a <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> that mimics the real world physical test. This paper presents a prototype <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> that includes prediction of the conductivity of the cementitious binder pore solution and the total charge passed during an ASTM C 1202 RCPT.

40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> for {{assessing}} occupant pelvis injury in vehicle frontal crash, {{in order to provide}} relevant biomechanical parameters for occupant safety design. Accordingly, based on the anatomical structure information of a 50 th percentile American male and using LS-DYNA code, a relatively refined finite element model for occupant lower extremity is created with its effectiveness verified by the simulation tests of side impact on pelvis and axial impact on knee-thigh-hip complex. Then a series of <b>virtual</b> <b>tests</b> are conducted on the model to investigate the influence of hip posture with different flexion angles and abduction angles on the failure force of pelvis. The results show that the pelvis fracture location and failure force under axial impact on knee depend on hip posture due to the different strength of various loaded points on acetabulum wall. With the increase of thigh flexion and abduction angles, pelvis fracture location shifts from ilium to acetabulum. The failure force of pelvis goes up with the increase of thigh flexion angle, while it goes up first and then falls down with the rise of thigh abduction angle. The findings of this study provide a reference basis for pelvis injury assessment in vehicle frontal crash safety design...|$|R

However, the complete-mixing air model fails to consider the impact of non-uniform air temperature stratifications. This paper presents a CFD-based <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> for control and optimization of indoor environment by combining a ventilated room with a ventilation control system. The ventilated room and its dynamic ventilation control system are represented by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and models of the temperature sensor, PID controller and actuator and VAV damper model respectively. The ventilation and its control system are programmed using the user defined function program and interfaced with the CFD model. A space temperature offset model is developed to improve the accuracy of temperature measurement and control at the occupied zone as a virtual sensor.

40|$|The {{usage of}} the {{seatbelt}} {{as a part of}} the vehicle protection system has immensely promoted occupant safety. However, recent accident investigation shows that it is necessary to increase the chest injury protective e_ciency in frontal impact condition. This study aims to investigate the influence of seatbelt system design variables on occupant chest injury related physical parameters at varying impact conditions, especially concerning with the chest deflection and distribution of rib stress/strain. The study is conducted by using human body FE model in combination with post mortem human subjects tests. An FE model of the belted occupant is therefore established by using a baseline human body FE model (GHBMC), which is validated according to detailed experimental data regarding kinematics, seatbelt force and chest deflection. A parameter study is implemented in terms of seatbelt position, seatbelt angle and impact speed to determine the influence of seatbelt utilization on occupant thoracic injury in frontal impact. The results show that the influence of seatbelt position on chest deflection and distribution of rib stress/strain is greater than that of the seatbelt angle. Meanwhile, the trends of chest deflections are the same with the trends of the rib stress/strain responses while the changes of seatbelt design variables. This study provides a <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> on investigation of the chest injury biomechanics related to the seatbelt design variables. Furthermore, the results from this study of chest injury mechanism will also provide a reference for optimizing of the occupant restraint system. © 2017, Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

Combining a theoretic road-tyre dynamic model with some real vehicle design parameters, the responses of the wheel axle under different non-structural road conditions were estimated conveniently. The responses can be taken as inputs for a virtual test-rig simulation, and the responses of every part on the test object are obtained separately.

Comparing with the real road-driving <b>test,</b> the <b>virtual</b> fatigue <b>test</b> <b>method</b> above can significantly reduce the <b>test</b> period.

40|$|Abstract—The {{process for}} {{designing}} digital controls for power electronics is typically quite convoluted and affords many oppor-tunities for errors to occur. We present here {{a new and}} complete method for rapid prototyping of digital controls that allows rapid realization of new designs. The approach uses a collection of tools that include both software (the <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> bed (VTB) and Matlab/Simulink) and hardware (dSpace DSP). An example application of the methodology completes the discussion. Index Terms—Digital controls, dSpace DSP, power electronics, rapid prototyping, <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> bed. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the HUMAN project is to develop <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> pilots for cockpit systems, {{in order to improve}} the human error analysis during cockpit system design. <b>Virtual</b> <b>test</b> pilots should supplement simulator-based testing of new cockpit systems with human pilots, by providing the possibility to simulate human behavior in early design phases. In this paper we will present how we modeled and tested four relevant basic capabilities, necessary for the simulation of pilot behavior, namely crew coordination, sophisticated perception, reactive behavior and multitasking...|$|R
