Therein, edge energies are drawn from a disorder distribution that allows for positive and negative energies.

Upon changing the subtleties of the distribution, the scaling of the minimum energy path length exhibits a transition from self-affine to self-similar. We analyze the precise scaling of the path length and the associated ground-state energy fluctuations in the <b>vincinity</b> of the disorder critical point, using a decimation procedure for huge graphs.

40|$|Exocytosis is {{a process}} used by many cells to move {{material}} out of the cell. This process is used by nerve cells to {{communicate with one another}} at synapses. This communication is achieved in part by the release of neurotransmitters at the nerve terminal into the extracellular space. Neurotransmitters are contained in membrane bound organelles called vesicles. These vesicles dock and fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, where a fusion pore is created to allow for the diffusion of neurotransmitters into the extracellular space. The study of exocytosis has led to the identification of the SNARE proteins, located on the vesicle (v-SNARE) and on the plasma membrane (t-SNARE). The v-SNARE and the t-SNARE form a tight complex that holds the vesicle close to the cell plasma membrane. However, it is unclear whether the SNARE proteins also participate in the creation the fusion pore. In this thesis, the role of the v-SNARE protein, synaptobrevin- 2 is explored, in particular the role of its transmembrane domain which is embedded into the vesicle membrane. It turns out that the formation of the SNARE complex formed by the association of the vSNARE and the t-SNARE pulls the C-terminus of synaptobrevin into the vesicle lipid membrane, and with this movement, it disrupts the membrane continuity leading the formation of the fusion pore. In addition, the transmembrane domain of synaptobrevin- 2 is located at the <b>vincinity</b> of the fusion pore during the fusion pore expansion...|$|E
40|$|In {{their role}} as second messengers, cyclic {{nucleotides}} such as cAMP {{have a variety of}} intracellular effects. These complex tasks demand a highly organized orchestration of spatially and temporally confined cAMP action which should be best achieved by compartmentalization of the latter. A great body of evidence suggests that cAMP compartments may be established and maintained by cAMP degrading enzymes, e. g. phosphodiesterases (PDEs). However, the molecular and biophysical details of how PDEs can orchestrate cAMP gradients are entirely unclear. In this paper, using fusion proteins of cAMP FRET-sensors and PDEs in living cells, we provide direct experimental evidence that the cAMP concentration in the vicinity of an individual PDE molecule is below the detection limit of our FRET sensors (< 100 nM). This cAMP gradient persists in crude cytosol preparations. We developed mathematical models based on diffusion-reaction equations which describe the creation of nanocompartments around a single PDE molecule and more complex spatial PDE arrangements. The analytically solvable equations derived here explicitly determine how the capability of a single PDE, or PDE complexes, to create a nanocompartment depend on the cAMP degradation rate, the diffusive mobility of cAMP, and geometrical and topological parameters. We apply these generic models to our experimental data and determine the diffusive mobility and degradation rate of cAMP. The results obtained for these parameters differ by far from data in literature for free soluble cAMP interacting with PDE. Hence, restricted cAMP diffusion in the <b>vincinity</b> of PDE is necessary to create cAMP nanocompartments in cells...|$|E
40|$|Ocean Island Basalts (OIB) {{erupted in}} the <b>vincinity</b> of Mid-Ocean Ridges (MOR) provide {{important}} information on melting processes, melt movement and composition of the Earth's mantle. In particular the major element, trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope ratios allow for constraints on the distinct melting behaviour of enriched and depleted mantle sources, their along and across axis distribution and potential changes in melting depth and melting temperatures. While the flow of melts into the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the Azores and Iceland {{has been the subject}} of several studies, both plumes exhibit active volcanism on the western side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge away from the proposed plume locality. Such off-axis volcanism beneath the North-American plate is comparable for the two OIB settings in terms of trace element and isotopic source composition relative to the main plume centre. Incompatible trace element ratios of Nb/Zr, Ta/Hf and La/Sm are elevated by similar factors in the off-axis (western) lavas when compared to the lavas from the plume centre. We compare the melting dynamics (i. e. P-T conditions of basalt generation) underneath the Snaefelsness peninsula (Iceland) with those underneath Flores and Corvo islands (Azores); both examples of unusual off-axis and "off-plume" magmatism. We demonstrate that Iceland and the Azores exhibit comparable excess temperatures, but that melting underneath the western Azores islands is initiated deeper. The sources in the Azores are more enriched and degrees of partial melting are slightly lower than compared to Snaefellsness. This implies that for both cases melting dynamics are largely controlled by the geochemical composition of the source and possibly lithosphere thickness rather than upwelling rate. The differences between eastern and western (i. e. plume related vs. "off-plume") sources may reflect different proportions of enriched melts during binary mixing with depleted MORB mantle (DMM) sources. 1 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} aiming to investigate a large number and {{a wide variety of}} mosquitoes from various regions of Germany for the presence of defined groups of parasites. Accordingly, during three successive years between 2010 and 2012, more than 140. 000 mosquitoes, trapped at various sites in Germany, were characterized and analysed. The selected trapping sites, most of them located in southwest and northeast Germany, are known tor their abundant occurrence of mosquitoes, such as the foodplains of the river Isar. In addition, some of them represent important stepping stones for migrating birds, such as the Lake Chiemsee or the Lake Constance. The mosquitoes were characterized on the basis of morphological criteria. The results indicated, that the main autochthonous species generally present in Germany were trapped, in particular abundant species such as Aedes vexans and Culex pipiens s. l [...] As morphological criteria do not allow the discrimination of members of the Culex pipiens complex or between females of Culex pipiens and Culex torrentium, a multiplex real-time PCR was developed for the rapid genetic differentiation of the various Culex species and biotypes. Using this method, hybrids of Cx. pipiens pipiens biotype pipiens and biotype molestus were detected in Germany for the first time. These hybrids are known as important bridge vectors for the transmission of West Nile virus from birds to humans. To fascilitate the detection of parasites in such a large number of mosquio samples within a reasoonable period of time, further multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed to allow analyses of respective microbial DNAs by high-throughput screening. The results indicated that a considerable number of German mosquitoes are carrying filariae. In this context, a new filarial species was detected, occuring primarily in southern Germany. The reservoir of this new filarial species is probably birds, as it was detected mainly in ornithophilic mosquitoes. Studies on Dirofilaria immitis, Dirofilaria repens as well as Onchocerca lupi, three zoonotic filarial species endemis in southern Europe and pathofenic for humans, revealed the detection of a focus of stable transmission of D. repens in the federal state of Brandenburg.

Fundamental interference phenomena are observed and discussed {{in the framework of}} ”X-ray Raman Scattering Theory”. For C 1 s→π* core-excited CO higher vibrational levels, which are difficult to discerne in a total yield photoabsorption spectrum, are revealed. For N 1 s→π* core-excited N 2 the interaction of the B 2 Σ+u final state with the neighbouring C 2 Σ+u state leads to breakdown of the commonly used ”participator” and ”spectator” classification. For negative photon frequency detuning with respect to the same resonance, an interference quenching of a certain vibrational line in the X 2 Σ+g final state of N+ 2 has been observed and analysed, showing a novel way to determine the equilibrium bond distance of the core-excited state. The duration time concept for the scattering process is refined in terms of partial and mean duration time, explaining detuning asymmetries for the X 2 Σ+g, A 2 Πu and B 2 Σ+u final states of N+ 2. The role of monochromator stray-light on the formation of electron spectra has been investigated in the <b>vincinity</b> of the N 1 s→π* resonance of N 2, a method to drastically reduce undesired ”Stokes spectral features” is demonstrated. The decay of a triply-excited intermediate state in N 2, located above the N 1 s ionisation threshold, has been studied, revealing a ”double spectator” type mechanism. In HCl the decay to the 4 σ- 1 inner valence region upon excitation to the ultrafast dissociative Cl 2 p- 16 σ* intermediate state exhibits a novel type of interference involving ”atomic” and ”molecular” decay channels, giving rise to a ”continuum-continuum interference hole” in the electron spectrum.

Direct photoelectron spectroscopy on free, neutral Ar, Kr and Xe clusters has been performed and changes in the electronic structure upon cluster formation has been investigated. Band structure formation for some of the inner valence levels is encountered, making a description of these orbitals in the sense of localised or delocalised difficult.

40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} {{investigations of}} laminar natural convection and interfacial heat flux distributions in pure water-ice systems are presented. The main goals are: (i) Resolution of several {{issues related to}} steady, two-dimensional, laminar natural convection in pure water near its density inversion temperature; and (ii) development, testing, and demonstration of a nonintrusive experimental/numerical method for the determination of interfacial heat flux distributions in steady, two-dimensional, pure water-ice systems. Attention was found on pure water and water-ice systems contained in a long cylindrical enclosure of square cross-section. One wall was maintained at a constant temperature equal to or less than $ 0 sp circ$C; the opposite wall was maintained at a constant temperature above the density inversion temperature of water; the other two walls of the cross-section were essentially adiabatic. Several angles of inclination, $ Theta,$ of the hot and cold walls, {{with respect to the}} gravitational acceleration vector, were considered: $ Theta = 0 sp circ, 30 sp circ, 45 sp circ,$ and ${-} 45 sp circ. $ For these conditions, the natural convection in water is governed by three nondimensional parameters: the Rayleigh number, Ra; a density inversion parameter, R; and the Prandtl number, Pr. The following ranges of these parameters were investigated: $ 10 sp 3 le Ra le 3. 37 times 10 sp 7; 0. 1 le R le 0. 9;$ and $ 6. 74 le Pr le 12. 4. $A complete rig was designed and constructed. The water-ice interface positions were obtained using shadowgraphy and computer-aided image processing techniques. In the complementary numerical work, a staggered-grid finite volume method (FVM) and a co-located, equal-order, control-volume finite element method (CVFEM) were formulated and used. In the first investigation, variable- and constant-property models (VPM and CPM) were used. Results of the VPM and CPM were found to be similar, except when the values of R are in the vicinity of 0. 5, where significant differences in the flow patterns, but only minor changes in the overall Nusselt number, $ overline{Nu},$ were observed. It was demonstrated that the fluid flow is extremely sensitive to changes in the value of R in the <b>vincinity</b> of 0. 5. A correlation that gives the $ overline{Nu}$ as a function of Ra and R has been proposed for the vertical enclosure $(Theta = 0 sp circ). $In the proposed experimental/numerical technique to determine the interfacial heat flux distributions, the interface position obtained by the shadowgraphy and image processing techniques was used as an input to the CVFEM. The CVFEM was then used to solve the heat conduction problem in the ice and obtain the interfacial heat flux distribution. It was found that if the raw digitized interface position data are directly inputted to the CVFEM simulations of heat conduction in the ice, the interfacial heat flux distributions exhibit physically untenable fluctuations. The reasons for this difficulty were identified and successfully overcome using appropriate data filtering techniques. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
