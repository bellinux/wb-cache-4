40|$|To {{understand}} the dynamic mechanisms {{of the mechanical}} milling process in a <b>vibratory</b> <b>mill,</b> {{it is necessary to}} determine the characteristics of the impact forces associated with the collision events. However, it is difficult to directly measure the impact force in an operating mill. This paper describes an inverse technique for the prediction of impact forces from acceleration measurements on a vibratory ball mill. The characteristics of the <b>vibratory</b> <b>mill</b> have been investigated by the modal testing technique, and its system modes have been identified. In the modelling of the system vibration response to the impact forces, two modal equations have been used to describe the modal responses. The superposition of the modal responses gives rise to the total response of the system. A method based on an optimisation approach has been developed to predict the impact forces by minimising the difference between the measured acceleration of the vibratory ball mill and the predicted acceleration from the solution of the modal equations. The predicted and measured impact forces are in good agreement. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

The aims of the conducted investigation were, also, increasing of the reactivity of the comminuted raw material and establishing of the optimal activation period. The properties of the activated talc induced by mechanical force were expressed in form of the grain inertia change which was measured by means of automatic grain counter. Mechanically activated grains are the most convenient mineral form for physical concentration since the energy change of the mill-material system is recorded on them. The effect of dry grinding on the structure, particle size and shape of talc was studied by means of XRD, DTA and SEM/EDS methods. Activation of talc produced an increase of the starting surface area value progressively from 4. 5 m 2 /g up to a maximum of 108. 5 m 2 /g achieved at 30 min.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} treatment of solids {{is one of}} the most common and widely used operations with which man has been concerned from the very beginnings of history of civilization. At the present, mechanical activation has a wide range of application potential. Mechanical activation processes are used to modify the properties of materials, enhance the reactivity of materials and produce advanced materials. When materials are subjected to intensive grinding, the structure and microstructure characters of material change widely. These structural changes determine the reactivity of materials and/or minerals and may play an important role in a proper subsequent process. The use of X-ray diffraction line broadening measurements has been proved to be useful in the characterization of microstructure and structural characteristics. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of the milling operation variables on the microstructure and structural changes of natural hematite. The influence of the three variables, mill type, grinding time and media surface, through an experimental design was investigated using different methods of characterization by XRD line profile analysis (LPA). The results revealed that mechanical activation of hematite brings about great changes in geometrical and microstructural characteristics with increased the grinding intensity, whatever milling methods are applied. The measurements of the BET surface area, granulometric surface area and particle size show a tendency of the particles to form agglomerates during prolonged milling; in particular with grinding under higher media surface. The agglomeration stage of particles appears to be related to the milling operation conditions. The results indicated that the pores of the agglomerates remain accessible for Nitrogen gas, which addresses the formation of relatively weaker (soft) agglomerates. With a first approximation, the <b>vibratory</b> <b>mill</b> yielded the maximum BET specific surface area, accounting for 18. 4 m 2 /g after 9 hours of milling with higher media surface. The expansions of hematite lattice and volume cell, especially in the initial stages of milling, were identified. The Williamson-Hall method confirms its merit for a rapid overview of the line broadening effects and possible understanding of the main causes. The anisotropic character of line broadening for deformed hematite as a function of grinding variables was revealed. From the Williamson-Hall plots, it was understood that strain and size contributions exist simultaneously in the milled samples. It was found that the hematite crystal is ‘soft' between (024) and other reflections. As seen by the Warren-Averbach method, the planetary mill products yield the smallest crystallites and the maximum root mean square strain (RMSS) (with the exception of the ground sample within one hour and low media surface). The final products contain crystallites sizes between 73. 5 and 5. 6 nm and its lattice strain (RMSS) at L= 10 nm varies from 0. 06 up to 5. 32, depending on the milling performance. With a first approximation, the products of the <b>vibratory</b> <b>mill</b> yielded lower X-ray amorphization degree with regard to the grinding time and media surface variables. The approximation of the energy contribution to the long- lived defects demonstrated that the amorphization character is the most important energy carrier in the activated hematite, accounting for more than 93 % of overall stored energy in hematite. For a given stress energy, the activated hematite in the tumbling mill contains the largest excess energy and has in <b>vibratory</b> <b>mill</b> the smallest amount of excess energy. Generally, the <b>vibratory</b> <b>mill</b> brings about less distortion in the hematite than other mills for the same level of stress energy. However, to produce an identical stress energy in different mills, the planetary mill is needed a specific energy input much higher than the other mills. To investigate the influence of other milling variables in detail, more investigations are recommended, especially as the experiment design and progress in the knowledge nowadays provide possibilities to use advanced methods for the characterization. In our opinion, the investigation of the effect of various defects formed during mechanical activation on the reactivity of the minerals are now only at the beginning of their development. Systematic investigations are recommended to explore what defects are formed under various types of mechanical action in the crystal of the substances of different types and how these defects influence reactivity.

Finally, wafer-polishing perfor-mance of the prepared silica slurries was considered by measuring the polishing (or removal) rate, and RMS (root mean square) roughness of the polished wafer surface. For the polishing, MEA (monoethanolamine) and TMAH (tetramethy-lammonium hydroxide) were used as polishing accelerators. The polishing result showed that the removal rate was nearly independent of the concentrations of MEA and TMAH {{in the range of}} 0. 3 - 0. 5 wt % and 100 - 500 ppm, respectively. One of the most interesting features is that hydrothermal treatment of the prepared silica slurries in autoclave increased the removal rate as high as ten times. Although the removal rate was increased by the increased size of the abrasive particle, surface roughness of the polished wafer surface was deteriorated...|$|E
40|$|Various biotic and abiotic agents {{affect the}} {{performance}} of wood products. Chemicals, thermal energy, radiation, as well as different organisms {{have the potential to}} alter the optical, haptic and functional performance of wood. These effects come along with a change of structural integrity of wood, which in turn affects its strength properties. Therefore, a test was developed to quantify the structural integrity of wood in terms of its Resistance to Impact Milling (RIM). In a High-Energy Multiple Impact (HEMI) - test, steel balls were used in a heavy <b>vibratory</b> <b>mill</b> for crushing wood samples. Thousands of single events were captured by analyzing the fragments. Based on the degree of integrity and the percentage of fine fragments (< 1 mm), an indicator has been defined to detect structural changes on cell wall level with high sensitivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the variation of structural integrity within and between ten different wood species in comparison with some strength properties according to standardized test protocols and in dependence of wood density. HEMI-tests, bending tests, and impact bending tests were performed with matched specimens. Wood density turned out to have only a subsidiary effect on structural integrity, but is dominanting standard strength properties. Thus, RIM was found to be only slightly correlated with the impact bending strength (IBS) and bending strength (MOR). On the other hand, the method shows clear insensitivity to natural variation in anatomy of wood...|$|E
40|$|Mechanochemical {{reduction}} of ilmenite concentrate (FeTiO 3) with elemental aluminum powder {{was performed by}} high-energy milling in an industrial eccentric <b>vibratory</b> ball <b>mill</b> ESM 656 - 0. 5 ks (Siebtechnik, Germany). The mechanochemically reduced ilmenite with various times of milling was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, which confirmed {{the presence of the}} Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 Ti phases after 120 min of milling. Thermal analysis evidenced the completion of a mechanochemical reduction during milling. After 360 min of milling, the Fe 2 Ti phase decom-posed to α-(Fe,Ti) alloy, which was proven by 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy detected the amorphous TiO phase in product after mechanochemical reduction, which is in accordance with ther-modynamic prediction. Decreasing of specific surface area after 60 min of milling resulted from growing layers of the solid products of FeTiO 3 mechanochemical reduction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We have {{presented}} {{the first example}} of the synthesis of macromonomers by mechanochemical reaction of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and maleic anhydride (MA). The mechanochemical reaction of PMMA and MA {{was carried out by}} <b>vibratory</b> ball <b>milling</b> under anaerobic condition. The ESR spectrum of the fractured sample of PMMA and MA showed a broad singlet, which was apparently different from the spectrum of PMMA mechanoradical. Therefore, PMMA mechanoradical would react with MA. We underwent the UV-labeling of the fractured samples of PMMA and MA to confirm the formation of macromonomers. The gel permeation chromatograms of UV-labeled compounds derived from this fractured sample showed a broad peak in a polymer region with refractive index detector and UV detector, which indicates that macromonomers bounding MA would be produced. This method seems to be applicable {{for a wide variety of}} polymers to synthesize macromonomers possessing MA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this work, the {{preparation}} of anorthite based ceramics using a modified milling system and 80 wt% kaolin (DD 2 type) and 20 wt% calcium oxide extracted from CaCO 3 is shown. The choice of these raw materials was dictated by their natural abundance. Previous {{studies have shown that}} a simple and <b>vibratory</b> multidirectional <b>milling</b> system using a bimodal distribution of highly resistant ceramics can be successfully used for obtaining fine powders. The prepared samples were sintered at different temperatures ranging between 800 and 1100 °C. It has been found that the relative density of samples sintered at 900 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min was about 96 % of the theoretical density of anorthite (2. 75 g/cm 3). Finally, the prepared samples were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy...|$|R
