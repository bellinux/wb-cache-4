The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London's discount market.

The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts.

40|$|Recent {{concern about}} the {{difficulty}} of obtaining structurally stable models of money demand combined with the removal of capital controls have drawn attention {{to the theory of}} currency substitution (CS). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine whether CS is a relevant factor in the demand for currency. A number of different theories are considered. The traditional approach to the demand for money focuses on the domestic holding. In contrast CS is concerned with both domestic and foreign holding of domestic currency, and with the substitutability between domestic and foreign currencies. Often it is not realized that there are various CS theories and they give different predictions. CS theories can be supplemented by the theory of <b>vehicle</b> <b>currencies</b> which emphasizes the use of a currency in international transactions by third-party countries. In this paper all of these theories are tested using alternative definitions of money, including both resident and non-resident holding, for data on the US dollar, the yen and the deutschmark. The evidence provides support for both CS and vehicle-currency effects but more in non-resident than resident currency holdings.

None of the models is able to describe Sweden’s bilateral trade flows systematically for the period between February 1995 and October 2011.

5|$|As part of {{the first}} {{amendment}} to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called special drawing rights (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major <b>vehicle</b> <b>currencies</b> of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{available}} evidence and previous research on potential effects of financial globalization, that is, the international integration of financial markets. In particular, we address the questions: Has financial globalization materially increased the influence of external developments on domestic monetary conditions? And, has it reduced the influence of central banks over financial and economic conditions in their own country? We find that central banks with floating currencies retain the ability to independently determine short-term interest rates and thus influence broader financial conditions and macroeconomic performance in their economies. However, domestic financial conditions appear to have become more vulnerable {{to a wide range}} of external shocks, complicating the task of making appropriate monetary policy decisions. Moreover, the financial crisis has highlighted the importance of cross-border channels for the transmission of liquidity and credit shocks.

40|$|The paper's {{thesis is}} that the US dollar, despite the {{inevitable}} erosion of market share that it will suffer {{at the hands of}} the euro, will remain the most important international currency. The transaction domain of an international currency depends on its ability to lower transaction costs relative to alternative currencies. The EMU financial markets will not be as integrated, and thus as liquid, as the US financial markets for quite some time, thus favoring the use of the dollar as a medium of exchange. Inertia and reputational considerations further favor the dollar. The future value of the exchange rate dollar-euro will depend on economic fundamentals more than on portfolio shifts. Portfolio shifts argue for an appreciation of the euro; but fundamentals can swamp the effects of portfolio shifts. Should the EMU fundamentals reflect the spirit of the Maastricht Treaty and the Growth and Stability Pact, the chances for a euro appreciation will increase. Some caution, however, is in order because the ECB is a new and untested central bank where consensus for a conservative policy may be harder to achieve than can be gleaned from a literal reading of the Maastricht Treaty.

40|$|Although {{currency}} invoicing {{in international}} trade transactions {{is central to the}} transmission of monetary policy, the forces motivating the choice of currency have long been debated. We introduce a model wherein agents involved {{in international trade}} can invoice in the exporter's currency, the importer's currency, or a third-country <b>vehicle</b> <b>currency.</b> The model is designed to contrast the contribution of macroeconomic variability with that of industry-specific features in the selection of an invoice currency. We show that producers in industries with high demand elasticities are more likely than producers in other industries to display herding in their choice of currency. This industry-related force is more influential than local macroeconomic performance in determining producers' choices. Drawing on data on invoice currency use in exports and imports for twenty-four countries, we document that the dollar is the currency of choice for most transactions involving the United States. The dollar is also extensively used as a <b>vehicle</b> <b>currency</b> in international trade flows that do not directly involve the United States. Consistent with the results of our model, this last finding is largely attributable to international trade in reference-priced and organized-exchange traded goods. Although the magnitude of business-cycle volatility matters for invoicing of more differentiated products, it is less central for invoicing nondifferentiated goods. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} why the choice of invoice currency under exchange rate uncertainty depends not only on expectations but also on history. The analysis is motivated by the fact that the U. S. dollar has historically been the dominant <b>vehicle</b> <b>currency</b> in developing countries. The theoretical analysis is based on an open economy model of monopolistic competition. When the market is competitive enough, the exporting firms tend to set their prices not to deviate from those of the competitors. As a result, a coordination failure can lead the third currency to be a less efficient equilibrium invoice currency. The role of expectations is important in selecting the equilibrium in the static framework. However, in the dynamic model with staggered price-setting, the role of history becomes another key determinant of the equilibrium currency pricing. The role of history may dominate the role of expectations when the firms are myopic, particularly in the competitive local market. It also becomes dominant in the staggered price setting when a small fraction of the new price setters are backward-looking. The result suggests the importance of history in explaining why the firm tends to choose the US dollar as <b>vehicle</b> <b>currency.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Stability in {{exchange}} rates {{has been the}} objective of several international monetary agreements since the early twentieth century. Thus the par value of currencies was determined {{in terms of a}} specified amount of gold, under the gold standard, whilst, the Bretton Woods agreement and the Smithsonian agreement defined the value of each currency in terms of the dollar, where the dollar was defined in terms of gold. Nevertheless, all these various systems have failed to eliminate the arguments between the proponents and the opponents of flexible and fixed exchange rate regimes. Although the major industrial countries have adopted a relatively flexible exchange rate regime, most developing countries have held their currencies pegged to the currency of a major industrial country, or a basket of currencies, with the aim of meeting a particular macroeconomic criterion. The choice of pegs tends to be influenced by trade shares, however, adopted according to the objective function the domestic authorities aim to fulfil. The literature has defined several macroeconomic objectives of a peg but found no particular peg to be universally adopted by all developing countries. An examination of the contract invoicing literature shows that, international trade involves incurring of risk by firms, exporters and importers. This risk is partly determined by the choice of currency denomination of contracts, which firms are expected to seek means of minimizing. With respect to currencies used to invoice contracts, there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it is the currency of the exporter which tends to be used to denominate trade contracts. However, on an ad hoc basis, certain commodities and raw materials were found to be invoiced in <b>vehicle</b> <b>currencies,</b> such as the dollar. Moreover, the choice of currency invoicing is found to be influenced by many factors. In particular, inflation differentials were essential. Low inflation currencies are generally preferred by trading partners. A major issue of concern discussed in the literature is the potential effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the volume of international trade. The evidence on this has gone both ways. Some have argued that these fluctuations are of less concern because firms can use the forward market as means of reducing their impact. The analytical framework presented in the present thesis deals with an important issue for the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). These economies depend on oil revenues as the main source of income. Consequently, both government and private spending rely heavily on the oil sector. However, analyzing this invoicing policy without considering the behavior of the exchange rates between the currencies of these countries and those of their major trading partners, would be misleading. Thus, the present model adopts an integrative approach aimed at choosing a currency or a basket of currencies for invoicing oil, and determining how the choices of the same arrangements or alternative arrangements adopted for pegging the domestic currencies can affect the welfare function adopted for the choice of currency(s) for invoicing oil. This welfare function, as it is argued in the thesis, is based on stabilizing the real, rather than the nominal, value of oil revenues. The historical perspective has demonstrated close correlations between inflation rates, money growth rates and oil revenues in the GCC economies. Moreover, the dependence of these economies on oil revenues as the major source of income, has been argued to be the decisive factor that has resulted in their currencies being pegged to the dollar. The results from the estimation, however, do not support a peg to the dollar, nor invoicing oil in dollars. Nonetheless, other single currencies have failed to fulfill the optimality condition, thus favoring pegging to a trade-weighted basket of currencies, and an invoicing scheme for oil which is based on a basket of currencies. Trade shares prove to be important, since deviations from purchasing power parity are passed via them. Despite the different levels of stability resulting from alternative combinations of peg and invoice choices, statistical evidence concludes that there are no significant differences amongst the resulting variances of the real value of oil revenues in terms of the domestic currencies of the GCC member states. Accordingly, it may be argued that if the sole objective of the authorities in these countries is to stabilize the real value of oil revenues, any choice of the alternatives considered in the present thesis would yield the same result in terms of stability...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a widely}} held {{perception}} that the UN is unable to challenge {{the increasing number of}} global issues {{due to the lack of}} funding. Consequently, there has for some time, been a discussion of alternative ways of financing UN activities. This is also the case for activities under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The level of global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is lower than the declared willingness of many countries to invest in such actions. Given this point of departure, one must anticipate that time is ripe to search for mechanisms that may close this mismatch. We believe that such funding schemes must relate to specific international agreed needs, not distort market conditions, and reflect a fair burden-sharing between countries. If the system also may be close to “painless” for individuals, industry and countries, that is, if the charge is regarded as a fair payment for the service rendered, we may have an interesting proposal at our hand. The report mention some global financing schemes discussed over the last years. Most of these earlier suggestions for automatic financing schemes have not possessed the above mentioned characteristics, and thus failed to meet universal support. We focus, however, on two alternatives for “automatic” financing, as possible sources and systems of funding. The funds will be for the benefit of developing countries and countries that are undergoing the process of transition to a market economy, to fight global environmental problems, specifically in the area of climate change. One of these, an international charge on civil aviation will, in addition to its revenues, also contribute directly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will initially, albeit in a small scale, reduce demands for air traffic and may, dependent upon the chosen base for taxation, also contribute to development of better energy saving technologies etc. The other alternative, an internationally agreed tax on foreign currency transactions, may in addition to its revenues also discourage currency speculation. This alternative has been discussed as a possible source of funding in a more general financing context within the United Nations system. This report concludes that a small charge on aviation seems to meet most of the criteria mentioned above for a possible successful mechanism for financing UN activities in the area of climate change. It seems right in a “polluter pays” context, in a north-south context, and as a practical, fair and almost painless solution with small side-effects. It seems also to be relatively easy to collect and control. The tax base may be related to the number of passengers, the number of passenger kilometre, the number of flights or as a fuel tax. This issue as well as the level of the tax may be agreed through negotiations between countries, Parties to the Climate Convention, or through other chosen international organisations. What seems most challenging is to initiate protocol negotiations under the Climate Convention, were an agreement would have to be ratified by the governments to create legally binding commitments. To establish a fund with an illustrative figure of 10 billion USD revenue per year, one would need about 9 USD as an average charge per passenger (departure tax), or about 0. 5 US cent per passenger kilometre, or a tax on an average flight of about 650 USD. Both a fuel tax and a tax on passenger-kilometres might be preferred as it is close to taxing emissions of carbon dioxide. However, as a fuel tax will discriminate those countries and companies with older and less energy-efficient air-planes, one might concentrate on the passenger related charge, either passenger/kilometres tax or a passenger/departure tax. The latter may be preferred for environmental reasons, as short journeys are more polluting because of the high energy intensity of the start and landing phases. A combined solution may be considered, for instance to charge according to standard intervals of flight distance of 380 kilometres. Several studies on a possible international tax on foreign currency transactions have voiced considerable scepticism. This scepticism is shared by the authors of this report for several reasons. First, a currency tax will only to a limited extent curb speculation. Secondly, there are significant legal and administrative problems when introducing a global transaction tax, and the effectiveness of the tax would be greatly reduced if some governments decided against it. Finally, it is reasonable to assume that financial innovations and use of <b>vehicle</b> <b>currencies</b> would make tax evasion easy. Due to these weaknesses, we conclude that other funding alternatives might be more attractive to pursue...|$|R
