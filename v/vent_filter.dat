The report by Fauske & Associates, An Experimental Study of the Stability of Vessel-Spanning Bubbles in Cylindrical, Annular, Obround and Conical Containers, is included in Appendix A. Results from the experiments confirm that the gravity yield parameter, Y{sub G}, correctly includes container size and {{can be applied to}} full-scale containers to predict the possibility of the formation of a stable vessel spanning bubble. The results also indicate that a vessel spanning bubble will likely form inside the STSC for KE, KW, and Settler sludges if the shear strengths of these sludges exceed 1820, 2080, and 2120 Pa, respectively. A passive mechanism installed in the STSC is effective at disrupting a rising sludge plug and preventing the sludge from plugging the <b>vent</b> <b>filter</b> or being forced out of the container. The Sludge Treatment Project for Engineered Container and Settler Sludge (EC/ST) Disposition Subproject is being conducted in two phases. Phase 1 of the EC/ST Disposition Subproject will retrieve the radioactive sludge currently stored in the K West (KW) Basin into Sludge Transport and Storage Containers (STSCs) and transport the STSCs to T-Plant for interim storage. Phase 2 of the EC/ST Disposition Subproject will retrieve the sludge from interim storage, treat and package sludge for disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The STSC is a cylindrical container; similar to previously used large diameter containers. A STSC (Figure 1) with a diameter of 58 inches will be used to transport KE and KW originating sludge (located in Engineered Containers 210, 220, 240, 250, and 260) to T-Plant. A STSC with an annulus (Figure 2) will be used to transport Settler Tank sludge, located in Engineered Container 230. An obround small canister design was previously considered to retrieve sludge from the basin. The obround design was selected in Small Canister Design Selection, PRC-STP- 00052. However, the small canister was not selected for transporting the sludge.

40|$|Over {{the past}} year the Nuclear Thermal Rocket Element Environmental Simulator (NTREES) has been {{undergoing}} a significant upgrade beyond its initial configuration. The NTREES facility is designed to perform realistic non-nuclear testing of nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) fuel elements and fuel materials. Although the NTREES facility cannot mimic the neutron and gamma environment of an operating NTR, it can simulate the thermal hydraulic environment within an NTR fuel element to provide critical information on material performance and compatibility. The {{first phase of the}} upgrade activities which was completed in 2012 in part consisted of an extensive modification to the hydrogen system to permit computer controlled operations outside the building through the use of pneumatically operated variable position valves. This setup also allows the hydrogen flow rate to be increased to over 200 g/sec and reduced the operation complexity of the system. The second stage of modifications to NTREES which has just been completed expands the capabilities of the facility significantly. In particular, the previous 50 kW induction power supply has been replaced with a 1. 2 MW unit which should allow more prototypical fuel element temperatures to be reached. The water cooling system was also upgraded to so as to be capable of removing 100 % of the heat generated during. This new setup required that the NTREES vessel be raised onto a platform along with most of its associated gas and vent lines. In this arrangement, the induction heater and water systems are now located underneath the platform. In this new configuration, the 1. 2 MW NTREES induction heater will be capable of testing fuel elements and fuel materials in flowing hydrogen at pressures up to 1000 psi at temperatures up to and beyond 3000 K and at near-prototypic reactor channel power densities. NTREES is also capable of testing potential fuel elements with a variety of propellants, including hydrogen with additives to inhibit corrosion of certain potential NTR fuel forms. Additional diagnostic upgrades included in the present NTREES set up include the addition of a gamma ray spectrometer located near the <b>vent</b> <b>filter</b> to detect uranium fuel particles exiting the fuel element in the propellant exhaust stream to provide additional information any material loss occurring during testing. Other aspects of the upgrade included reworking NTREES to reduce the operational complexity of the system despite the increased complexity of the induction heating system. To this end, many of the controls were consolidated on fewer panels. As part of this upgrade activity, the Safety Assessment (SA) and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for NTREES were extensively rewritten. The new 1. 2 MW induction heater consists of three physical units consisting of a transformer, rectifier, and inverter. This multiunit arrangement facilitated increasing the flexibility of the induction heater by more easily allowing variable frequency operation. Frequency ranges between 20 and 60 kHz can be accommodated in the new induction heater allowing more representative power distributions to be generated within the test elements...|$|E
40|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of protecting a containment vessel of light water reactor and suppressing the diffusion of radioactive materials from a light water reactor, {{it is important to}} develop the device which allows a <b>filtered</b> <b>venting</b> of contaminated high pressure gas. In the <b>filtered</b> <b>venting</b> system that used in European reactors, so called Multi Venturi scrubbers System is used to realize <b>filtered</b> <b>venting</b> without any power supply. This system is able to define to be composed of Venturi scrubbers (VS) and a bubble column. In the VS, scrubbing of contaminated gas is promoted by both gas releases through the submerged VS and gas-liquid contact with splay flow formed by liquid suctioned through a hole provided by the pressure difference between inner and outer regions of a throat part of the VS. However, the scrubbing mechanism of the self-priming VS including effects of gas mass flow rate and shape of the VS are understood insufficiently in the previous studies. Therefore, we started numerical and experimental study to understand the detailed two-phase flow behavior in the VS. In this paper, to understand the VS operation characteristics for the <b>filtered</b> <b>venting,</b> we performed numerical simulations of two-phase flow behavior in the VS. In the first step of this study, we perform numerical simulations of supersonic flow by the TPFIT to validate the applicability of the TPFIT for high velocity flow like flow in the VS.

40|$|As {{revealed}} by Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, countermeasures against severe accidents in {{nuclear power plants}} are an urgent need. In particular, {{from the viewpoint of}} protecting containment and suppressing diffusion of the radioactive materials, it is most important to install <b>filtered</b> <b>venting</b> devices to release high pressure contaminated gas to the atmosphere with elimination radioactive materials in the gas. A Multi Venturi Scrubber System (MVSS) is one of the <b>filtered</b> <b>venting</b> devices, and used in European reactors [1, 2]. One of the main components of the MVSS is a Venturi Scrubber (VS). It is considered that a dispersed or dispersed annular flow is formed in the VS by a self-priming phenomena. In the self-priming phenomena, the liquid was suctioned from a surrounding region of the VS {{to the inside of the}} VS. And a part of the radioactive materials are eliminated through the gas-liquid interface of the dispersed or annular dispersed flow. Therefore, to consider the MVSS operation characteristics, it is important whether to occur the self-priming or not and the liquid flow rate of the self-priming of the VS. The objective of this paper is to understand the self-priming phenomena of the VS for the <b>filtered</b> <b>venting.</b> And theoretical analysis and experiment were conducted. By comparing these results, we discussed about the mechanism of the self-priming phenomena.

40|$|Vent blocking, the {{covering}} of the filter ventilation zone on a cigarette during smoking, is a potentially {{important aspect of}} smoking behavior. Various techniques {{have been used to}} assess the incidence of vent blocking, and widely different views have been expressed on its importance. Studies relevant to <b>filter</b> <b>vent</b> blocking have been reviewed with two overall objectives: to examine critically the evidence on the occurrence of vent blocking and to assess the effects of vent blocking on the smoke yield to the smoker. The reviewed studies fall into four main categories: (1) measurements of the incidence of <b>filter</b> <b>vent</b> blocking among smokers; (2) the observed effects of vent blocking on cigarette ventilation and machine smoke yields; (3) the effect of experimentally blocking vents on human smoke yields; and (4) simultaneous determination of vent blocking and smoke yield under human smoking conditions. Direct observation indicates that only 4 % of smokers have their fingers in direct contact with the cigarette during puffing. Estimates of vent blocking incidence by lips during smoking range from 15 - 24 % (saliva-staining technique) to up to 50 % ('tar’ staining pattern technique) of smokers. For those smokers who do block the ventilation zone, a mean of 27 % of the vents are blocked, and a maximum of about 50 %. When the cigarettes are machine-smoked, the smoke yield increases in a highly non-linear manner as the blocked portion of the filter ventilation zone increases. This effect is also more pronounced at higher original filter ventilation levels. In contrast, smoking behavior monitoring techniques have shown that when the experimenter deliberately blocks the vent zone, the human smoker adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. The blocked filter affects the yields of smoke components to the smoker less than it does smoking-machine measured yields. It is concluded that the incidence of vent zone blocking by fingers is quite low and relatively insignificant. The most reliable estimate for lip blocking is that up to 25 % of smokers may cover the vent zone during at least one puff and for most smokers the coverage is partial. Ventilation zone blocking as it occurs in practice has only a relatively minor effect on human smoke yields compared to other smoker behavior factors. When a human smoker inadvertently partially or completely blocks the filter ventilation zone during smoking, he/she adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. Because of these changes in puffing behavior during human smoking, predictions of the effects of <b>filter</b> <b>vent</b> blocking on smoke yields based solely on smoking machine yields are deceptive...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{awareness and}} knowledge of cigarette filter ventilation in a national probability sample of smokers of Ultra-light, Light, and regular cigarettes. DESIGN: Random-digit-dialling and computer-assisted telephone interviewing was used on a probability sample of daily cigarette smokers (ages 18 and above). SUBJECTS AND SETTING: 218 Smokers of Ultra-light cigarettes, 360 smokers of Light cigarettes, and 210 smokers of Regular cigarettes living in the continental United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of respondents indicating knowledge {{of the presence of}} <b>filter</b> <b>vents</b> and the consequences of behavioural blocking of vents. RESULTS: Many smokers had not heard about or seen the filter holes: 43 % (95 % CI = 36 to 50 %) of smokers of Ultra-lights, 39 % (95 % CI = 34 to 44 %) of smokers of Lights, and 47 % (95 % CI = 40 to 54 %) of smokers of Regulars. About two in three smokers either did not know of the existence of rings of small holes on the filters of some cigarettes, or did not know that blocking increases tar yields: 69 % (95 % CI = 63 to 75 %) of Ultra- lights, 66 % (95 % CI = 61 to 71 %) of Lights, and 69 % (95 % CI = 63 to 75 %) of Regulars. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers are generally unaware of the presence and function of filter vents-a major design feature subject to behavioural blocking by smokers and now present on most cigarettes in the United States. Smokers and policy-makers need to be informed about the presence of <b>filter</b> <b>vents</b> and how vent blocking increases tar and nicotine yields from ostensibly very low-yield cigarettes. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 In {{the wake}} of nuclear {{accidents}} such as Three Mile Island Unit 2 and Fukushima, the nuclear power industry’s safety record is scrutinized. Today the main concerns lies with hydrogen production in a nuclear reactor core when the zirconium fuel cladding reacts with the water coolant during an accident, creating combustible hydrogen gas. This concern is being addressed with new technologies for new nuclear power plants {{and the development of}} hydrogen mitigation techniques for currently operating plants. This study looks at a few potential safety upgrades including hydrogen mitigation upgrades such as hydrogen ignitors and Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PARs). As well as some radionuclide release mitigation safety upgrades, <b>filtered</b> <b>vents</b> and hardened vents. Using event tree/fault tree analysis to obtain probabilities and consequences of accidents and a newly developed “Economic Safety Factor (ESF) ” has been proposed.

While the ESF is not the only mechanism a utility or regulator will consider when evaluating plant changes, it can give a good indication of whether or not a safety upgrade, or another type of upgrade is a good idea.

Microbiological evaluation of filters, skin at the site of cannulation immediately prior to removal of cannulae, and cannula tips was performed.

The efficacy of the filter in reducing phlebitis was most pronounced when intravenous antimicrobial agents, especially the cephalosporins, were administered. Micro-organisms were isolated from 13 % (28 / 209) of filters which originated from 31 % (16 / 32) of infusions with filters in-line.

A mixture of hydrated aluminum oxide bound with a clay was used to model the aluminum corrosion product and sediment expected in these Department of Energy (DOE) owned fuel types. Previous studies demonstrated that the current drying procedures are adequate for removal of free water inside the storage canister and for transfer of this fuel to a vented dry storage facility. However, using these same drying procedures, the simulated corrosion product {{was found to be}} difficult to dry completely from between the aluminum clad plates of the fuel. Another related set of experiments was designed to ensure that the fuel would not be damaged during the drying process. Aluminum plate fuels are susceptible to pitting damage on the cladding that can result in a portion of UAl{sub x} fuel meat being disgorged. This would leave a water-filled void beneath the pit in the cladding. The question was whether bursting would occur when water in the void flashes to steam, causing separation of the cladding from the fuel, and/or possible rupture.

In this paper, the applicability of CFVS is examined for OPR 1000, a 1000 [*]MWe PWR with large dry containment in Korea. Thermohydraulic analysis results show that a filtered discharge flow rate of 15 [*][kg/s] at 0. 9 [*][MPa] is sufficient to depressurize the containment against representative containment overpressurization scenarios. Radiological release to the environment is reduced to 10 - 3 considering the decontamination factor. Also, this cyclic venting strategy reduces noble gas release by 50 % for 7 days. The probability of maintaining the containment integrity in level 2 probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) initiating events is improved twofold, from 43 % to 87 %. So, the CFVS can further improve the containment integrity in severe accident conditions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the thermal hydraulic issues in the Containment <b>Filtered</b> <b>Venting</b> System (CFVS) for a long operating time using the MELCOR computer code. The modeling of the CFVS, including the models for pool scrubbing and the filter, {{was added to the}} input file for the OPR- 1000, and a Station Blackout (SBO) was chosen as an accident scenario. Although depressurization in the containment building as a primary objective of the CFVS was successful, the decontamination feature by scrubbing and filtering in the CFVS for a long operating time could fail by the continuous evaporation of the scrubbing solution. After the operation of the CFVS, the atmosphere temperature in the CFVS became slightly above the water saturation temperature owing to the release of an amount of steam with high temperature from the containment building to the scrubbing solution. Reduced pipe diameters at the inlet and outlet of the CFVS vessel mitigated the evaporation of scrubbing water by controlling the amount of high-temperature steam and the water saturation temperature...|$|R
