40|$|Long-sized oligogalacturonides (OGs) are {{plant cell}} wall {{fragments}} involved in defence responses and developmental processes. A hormone/OG interaction {{in the control}} of different organogenic processes is known. However, hormones also modulate polyamine (PA) effects on organogenesis. Furthermore, OGs are known to affect mitotic activity leading to specific morphogenic events, and PAs are known to affect mitotic activity leading to xylogenesis. Thus, it may be {{reasonable to assume that}} OGs and PAs affect mitotic activity in the same cell types, and in the same hormone-induced morphogenic processes, e. g., xylogenesis. To gain further insight into this aspect, the effects of OGs, and of putrescine (Put) and spermidine (Spd), on auxin (indoleacetic acid, IAA) plus benzyladenine (BA) -induced morphogenesis in tobacco leaf explants were investigated histologically. The effect of PA biosynthetic inhibitors in the culture medium was also monitored, as well as the combined application of the inhibitor with the corresponding PA. Results show that vascular mitoses consistently occurred in the control (IAA+BA-treated) explants, leading exclusively to xylogenic nodule formation. The application of OGs resulted in an inhibition of vascular mitoses, and into a strong reduction of <b>vascular</b> <b>nodule</b> formation. By contrast, Spd enhanced both vascular mitoses and nodule formation, and Put was less effective than Spd on both events. Taken together, the results reveal a new biological activity of OGs and Spd in morphogenesis, obtained under the same hormonal conditions, and in the same tissue (i. e., the vascular parenchyma), namely the inhibition of xylogenesis by OGs, and its promotion by Spd. The fact that the effects of Spd and OGs on this morphogenic event may involve a different relationship with auxin is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Kaposi sarcoma is a {{vascular}} neoplasm {{composed of}} endothelium-lined vascular spaces and spindle-shaped cells. It often manifests with multiple <b>vascular</b> <b>nodules</b> {{on the skin}} and other organs. Kaposi sarcoma is rare in HIV negative patients and it is associated with HHV- 8 infection.

Objective: The aim {{of this article is}} to present two cases of Kaposi sarcoma in the hard palate of HIV/AIDS male patients. Case report and Conclusion: Kaposi sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any AIDS patient who presents with bluish, smooth, firm, nonpulsatile macule or nodule in the region of the hard palate.

40|$|The {{fuzzy degree}} of lung nodule {{boundary}} {{is the most}} important cue to judge the lung cancer in CT images. Based on this feature, the paper proposes a novel lung cancer detection method for CT images based on the super-pixels and the level set segmentation methods.

The super-pixels method and a level set method are used to segment the suspected lung cancer lesion region simultaneously. Finally, the cancer is determined by the difference between results of the two segmentation methods. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a high accuracy for lung cancer detection in CT images.

On the other hand, the following tissue organizations were correlated to growth rate (summerized in Table 1). High growth rate calli showed a loose intercellular contact and formed no dermal tissue, whereas low growth rate calli formed tight tissues covered with dermal tissues. All calli formed <b>vascular</b> <b>nodules</b> which were categorized into three types, i. e. circular, linear and continuous types. The first one was predominant in high growth rate calli, the frequency of the second one increased as the growth rate became lower, and the third one was formed in the calli which grew extreamly slow.

40|$|Callus was {{initiated}} from Eucalyptus grandis x urophylla axillary bud segments and cultured on a callus induction medium to regenerate shoots. At the gross morphological level {{two types of}} callus were described; a crystalline callus and compact glassy callus (yellow, white and brown) that gradually became nodular. A red callus was also identified in the late stages of development (between days 43 and 57). The crystalline and compacted callus sometimes formed dark spots on the surface which were possibly {{an indication of the}} accumulation of tannins. Histologically callus developed two types of cells; small compact morphogenic cells and loosely arranged large nonmorphogenic cells.

40|$|Bean callus was induced to form roots (tissue differentiation) and <b>vascular</b> <b>nodules</b> (cell differentiation) by {{lowering}} the ratio of auxin to cytokinin in the growth medium. Both types of differentiation were inhibited {{by the addition of}} abscisic acid (at concentrations greater than 1 fiM) to induction medium. Initiation of differentiation was inhibited, but its subsequent development was not, and the inhibition was not affected by the addition of gibberellic acid. Addition of gibberellic acid (GA) alone to induction medium stimulated tissue differentiation, although cell differentiation was unaffected (30 /tM GA) or inhibited (45 /tM GA) and its onset was delayed at both concentrations. Root initiation was also stimulated by gibberellic acid (0 - 1 - 45 / tM) at an auxin-to-kinin ratio 10 times that normally optimal for cell differentiation. The phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity of the calluses was closely correlated with the amount of cell differentiation which had occurred, and measurement of this confirmed that gibberellic acid delayed the initiation of cell differentiation.

40|$|Among the {{earliest}} {{and most important}} stages during tumorigenesis is the activation of the angiogenic process, an event that is termed the “switch to the angiogenic phenotype. ” We have developed an in vivo system that can reliably recapitulate the stages in tumor development that represent this transition. Using this model, we have harvested and studied tumor nodules that can be distinguished from {{each other on the}} basis of their degree of vascularization. Angiogenic tumor nodules were characterized by the presence of capillary vessels as determined by factor VIII immunohistochemistry, and both angiogenic and proteolytic activities in vitro. In contrast, preangiogenic nodules were devoid of microvessels and showed little angiogenic or proteolytic activity in vitro. Addition of a specific metalloproteinase inhibitor resulted in the abrogation of both angiogenic and proteolytic activities of the angiogenic nodules in vitro. Comparative substrate gel electrophoresis detected the presence of a prominent matrix metalloproteinase (MMP- 2) in the angiogenic nodules when compared with the preangiogenic ones. Suppression of MMP- 2 activity by antisense oligonucleotides in the <b>vascular</b> <b>nodules</b> resulted in the loss of angiogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Moreover, this suppression of MMP- 2 activity in angiogenic nodules inhibited tumor growth in vivo by approximately 70 %.

In this study, the roles of auxin in nodule development in Lotus japonicus have been demonstrated using molecular genetic tools and auxin inhibitors. The expression of an auxin-reporter GH 3 fused to β-glucuronidase (GUS) was analyzed in L. japonicus roots, and showed a strong signal in the central cylinder of the root, whereas upon rhizobium infection, generation of GUS signal was observed at the dividing outer cortical cells during the first nodule cell divisions. When nodules were developed to maturity, strong GUS staining was detected in <b>vascular</b> tissues of <b>nodules,</b> suggesting distinct auxin involvement in the determinate nodule development. Numbers and the development of nodules were affected by auxin transport inhibitors (1 -naphthylphthalamic acid, NPA and triindobenzoic acid, TIBA), and by a newly synthesized auxin antagonist, α-(phenyl ethyl- 2 -one) -indole- 3 -acetic acid (PEO-IAA). The common phenotypical alteration by these auxin inhibitors was the inhibition in forming lenticel which is normally developed on the nodule surface from the root outer cortex. The inhibition of lenticel formation was correlated with the inhibition of <b>nodule</b> <b>vascular</b> bundle development.

40|$|The term extranasopharyngeal angiofibroma {{has been}} applied to <b>vascular,</b> fibrous <b>nodules</b> {{occurring}} outside the nasopharynx. The maxillary sinus is the most common site involved, while the nasal septum represents an extremely rare localization. Computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging are used to determine the tumour site and its extension. Surgical excision of the mass is the treatment of choice, and recurrence is rare. Typically, clinical characteristics of extranasopharyngeal angiofibromas do not conform with that of nasopharyngeal angiofibromas and, for this reason, these tumours must be regarded as a separate entity. Due to these different features, extranasopharyngeal angiofibromas can present a diagnostic challenge and a meticulous evaluation with a high index of suspicion is essential in establishing the correct diagnosis and treatment. We report the case of a 57 -year-old female with a 1 -year history of a slowly progressing right nasal obstruction due to the presence of a whitish mass adhering to the posterior nasal septum.

40|$|Introduction. Primary {{fallopian tube}} {{carcinoma}} is extremely rare, making 0. 3 - 1. 6 % of all female genital tract malignancies. Although the etymology of this tumor is unknown, {{it is suggested}} {{to be associated with}} chronic tubal inflammation, infertility, tuberculous salpingitis and tubal endometriosis. High parity is considered to be protective. Cytogenetic studies show the disease to be associated with over expression of p 53, HER 2 /neu and c-myb. There is also some evidence that BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutations have a role in umorogeneis. Clinical features. The most prevailing symptoms with fallopian tube carcinoma are abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal discharge/bleeding and the most common finding is an adnexal mass. In many patients, fallopian tube carcinoma is asymptomatic. Diagnosis. Due to its rarity, preoperative diagnosis of primary fallopian tube carcinoma is rarely made. It is usually misdiagnosed as ovarian carcinoma, tuboovarian abscess or ectopic pregnancy. Sonographic features of the tumor are non-specific and include the presence of a fluid-filled adnexal structure with a significant solid component, a sausage-shaped mass, a cystic mass with papillary projections within, a cystic mass with cog wheel appearance and an ovoid-shaped structure containing an incomplete separation and a highly <b>vascular</b> solid <b>nodule.</b> More than 80 % of patients have elevated pretreatment serum CA- 125 levels, which is useful in follow-up after the definite treatment.

40|$|Nodules on {{the roots}} of legume plants host nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium bacteria. Several lines of {{evidence}} indicate that nodules are evolutionarily related to roots. We determined whether developmental control of the Medicago truncatula nodule meristem bears resemblance to that in root meristems through analyses of root meristem-expressed PLETHORA genes. In nodules, MtPLETHORA 1 and 2 are preferentially expressed in cells positioned at {{the periphery of the}} meristem abutting <b>nodule</b> <b>vascular</b> bundles. Their expression overlaps with an auxin response maximum and MtWOX 5, which is a marker for the root quiescent center. Strikingly, the cells in {{the central part of the}} nodule meristem have a high level of cytokinin and display MtPLETHORA 3 and 4 gene expression. Nodule-specific knockdown of MtPLETHORA genes results in a reduced number of nodules and/or in nodules in which meristem activity has ceased. Our nodule gene expression map indicates that the nodule meristem is composed of two distinct domains in which different MtPLETHORA gene subsets are expressed. Our mutant studies show that MtPLETHORA genes function redundantly in nodule meristem maintenance. This indicates that Rhizobium has recruited root developmental programs for nodule formation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Sarcoidosis is a multi-systemic {{disorder}} of unknown origin and most commonly affects the lungs. Diagnosis {{relies on the}} presence of non-caseating granulomas on histologic specimens. In high-resolution computed tomography, the most characteristic findings are peribronchovascular thickening, perilymphatic nodular distribution, and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Confluent nodular opacities or large masses are rare manifestations of the disease. It is well recognized that sarcoidosis can mimic infectious, malignant, and granulomatous conditions. Here, we report a case with a high initial index of suspicion for lung malignancy in terms of clinical, lung imaging, and endoscopic findings. Case presentation A 65 -year-old Caucasian woman, lifelong non-smoker with an unremarkable medical history, presented with a 10 -month history of progressive breathlessness, dry cough, fatigue, arthralgias, and mild weight loss. The only significant clinical finding was bilateral enlargement of auxiliary lymph nodes. High-resolution computed tomography revealed a soft tissue density mass at the right hilum which was surrounding and narrowing airways and <b>vascular</b> components, <b>nodules</b> with <b>vascular</b> distribution, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and pericardial effusion. Our patient underwent a bronchoscopy, which revealed the presence of submucosal infiltration and narrowing of the right upper bronchus. Endobronchial biopsies showed non-caseating granulomas. As local sarcoid reactions with non-caseating granulomas can be observed near tumors, our patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy and surgical removal of an auxiliary lymph node, both of which confirmed the presence of non-caseating granulomas and the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She was treated with steroids with improvement of clinical and imaging findings. However, while on a maintenance dose, she presented with a pleural effusion, which, after the diagnostic work-up, proved to be sarcoidosis-related. Treatment with initially high doses of steroids plus a steroid-sparing agent led to resolution of the effusion. Conclusions We report a case with a high initial index of suspicion for lung malignancy. Clinicians should always be aware that sarcoidosis enters the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with a lung mass that encases and narrows bronchial and vascular structures with associated pericardial effusion. Rarely, pleural effusion can be the presenting symptom of disease relapse despite maintenance treatment. </p...|$|R

40|$|Leguminous {{plants are}} able to grow under nitrogen-limiting {{conditions}} by establishing an endosymbiotic interaction with diazotrophic soil bacteria known as rhizobia. This interaction results in root structures, nodules, where rhizobia are differenciated to bacteroids and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) occurs (Van de Velde et al., 2006). Key enzymes involved in SNF require metals as cofactor {{to carry out their}} catalytic activity such as nitrogenase, leghemoglobin, cytochrome oxidase and superoxide dismutase. Previous results in Medicago truncatula showed that metals have to be provided to the bacteroids by the host legume, being released to the apoplast of zone II (infection/maturation zone) of the nodule (Rodriguez- Haas et al., 2013). It is known that Yellow Stripe-like (YSL) transporters mediate metal trafficking from the root to sink organs, however, no information of the role of these transporters in the context of SNF is available. Medicago truncatula YSL 1 is a good candidate to mediate this transport, since it reaches an expression peak in these organs.

MtbHLH 1 is also expressed in root tips, lateral root primordia cells and root VBs, and induced upon auxin treatment. Altering MtbHLH 1 function led to an unusual phenotype, with a modified patterning of nodule VB development and a reduced growth of aerial parts of the plant, even though the nodules were able to fix atmospheric N. Several putative MtbHLH 1 regulated genes were identified, including an asparagine synthase and a LOB (lateral organ boundary) transcription factor. Our results suggest that the MtbHLH 1 gene is involved in the control of nodule vasculature patterning and nutrient exchanges between nodules and roots...|$|R
40|$|Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an {{adenocarcinoma}} {{that arises}} from the bile duct epithelium and is observed in the entire biliary tree (intrahepatic, hilum, and extrahepatic distal). The staging of this tumor differs depending on location. The role of imaging in the staging of hilar CCA is to assess the extent of ductal involvement by the tumor, hepatic artery, or portal venous involvement, the functional status and volumetric assessment of the underlying liver, and the regional or distant tumor extension. Complete assessment is done by combining magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography and multidetector computed tomography (CT). Multidetector CT, in particular, is accurate for resectability and the negative predictive value (patients with disease classified as unresectable and in whom unresectability has been confirmed) is quite high: 85 – 100 %. The role of imaging in the staging of intrahepatic CCA is to evaluate resectability based on the tumor itself, vascular involvement, regional and distal extension, and volumetric assessment of the contralateral liver, and to determine the prognostic factors. These factors are mainly: tumor size, the presence of satellite <b>nodules,</b> <b>vascular</b> involvement, and lymph nodes. CT and MR imaging (MRI) are keys and their results are comparable. In distal extrahepatic CCA due to tumor location, staging is focused mainly on the adjacent vessels (portal vein and hepatic artery), the hepatoduodenal ligament, the proximal and distal biliary extent, and pancreatic invasion. CT and MRI are mandatory...|$|R
40|$|A {{model to}} {{estimate}} survival in ambulatory hepatocellular carcinoma patients (MESIAH) {{is useful for}} estimating patient prognosis but needs improvement for Korean patients, {{most of whom have}} a hepatitis B virus. We aimed to modify the MESIAH for better prognostication through enhancing calibration for Korean patient population (K-MESIAH). Utilizing a cohort of 1, 969 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients from the National Cancer Center of Korea between 2004 and 2009, a survival prediction model was developed using the Cox proportional hazards model. The model's performance was evaluated using C-statistical and χ 2 -statistical analyses. External validation was performed using an independent cohort of 328 patients from the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. To develop the K-MESIAH, etiology was added to the original risk factors (age, Model for Endstage Liver Disease, albumin, size of the largest nodule, number of tumor <b>nodules,</b> <b>vascular</b> invasion, metastasis, and alpha fetoprotein) in the MESIAH. From the internal validation study, the C-statistics and χ 2 -statistics for one-, three-, and five-years of survival were 0. 83 (95 % Confidence Interval: 0. 82 - 0. 85), 49. 07; 0. 81 (95 % Confidence Interval: 0. 79 - 0. 82), 28. 95; and 0. 80 (95 % Confidence Interval: 0. 79 - 0. 81), 20. 93, respectively. The K-MESIAH also showed a high prediction ability for the external validation cohort. A survival prediction model for Korean HCC patients was developed and validated to have a high level of performance. This K-MESIAH may be more useful in clinical practice and personalized care in a hepatitis B virus endemic area...|$|R
40|$|The {{beta-glucuronidase}} (GUS) activity expressed {{from the}} soybean early nodulin ENOD 2 (B) gene promoter was localized histochemically in nodules of Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens. In both the determinate Lotus nodules and the indeterminate Trifolium nodules, activity {{was found in}} the parenchyma cells and especially in cells close to the <b>vascular</b> tissue of <b>nodules.</b> The characteristic cell-specific expression of the soybean ENOD 2 gene was therefore maintained by the ENOD 2 (B) promoter in the two developmentally different nodule types. Important DNA elements recognized in transgenic nodules were identified by deletion and hybrid promoter analysis in Lotus corniculatus. An indispensable positive element (PE) and a possible tissue specific element was defined between positions - 1792 and - 1582 from the transcription start site. Another qualitative control element located between - 380 and - 53 conferred the ENOD 2 characteristic cell type expression on hybrid promoters. This element contains the conserved nodulin gene sequences CTCTT and AAAGAT. In contrast to the ENOD 2 (B) promoter a chimeric leghemoglobin Ibc 3 -GUS gene was expressed in the infected cells of both types of nodules. In the indeterminate nodules expression was restricted to the interzone II-III and the active nitrogen-fixing zone III. Interchange of the distal strong positive element (SPE) of Ibc 3 and the ENOD 2 positive element resulted in an expression pattern different from that observed for the Ibc 3 and ENOD 2 genes, indicating that different interactions of trans-acting factors are required for regulation of early as well as late nodulin genes...|$|R
