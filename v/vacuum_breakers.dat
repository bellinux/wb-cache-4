40|$|The {{function}} of the suppression-chamber-to-drywell <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers</b> is to relieve vacuum in the drywell. There are four <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers</b> located outside the primary containment which form {{an extension of the}} primary containment boundary. The vacuum relief valves are mounted in special piping between the drywell and the suppression chamber, which allow air and steam flow from the suppression chamber to the drywell when the drywell is at a negative pressure with respect to the suppression chamber. Therefore, suppression chamber-to-drywell <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers</b> prevent an excessive negative differential pressure across the wetwell drywell boundary. Each vacuum breaker is a self actuating valve with one vacuum breaker in each line. Manual isolation valves are located on each side of each vacuum breaker. A negative differential pressure across the drywell wall is caused by rapid depressurization of the drywell. Events that cause this rapid depressurization are cooling cycles, inadvertent drywell spray actuation, and steam condensation from sprays or subcooled water reflood of a break {{in the event of a}} primary system rupture. Cooling cycles result in minor pressure transients in the drywell that occur slowly and are normally controlled by heating and ventilation equipment. Spray actuation or spill of subcooled water out of a break results in more significant pressure transients and becomes important in sizing the <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers.</b> In the event of a primary system rupture, steam condensation within the drywell results in the most severe pressure transient. Following a primary system rupture, air in the drywell is purged into the suppression chamber free airspace, leaving the drywell full of steam. Subsequent condensation of the steam can be caused in two possible ways, namely, Emergency Core Cooling Systems flow from a recirculation line break, or drywell spray actuation following a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). These two cases determine the maximum depressurization rate of the drywell...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Switching {{transients}} {{associated with}} circuit breakers {{have been observed}} for many years. With the widespread applica-tion of <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers</b> for transformer switching, recently, this phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} a significant number of trans-former failures. Vacuum circuit breaker switching of electric arc furnace and ladle melt furnace (LMF) transformers raises concern because of their inductive currents. High-frequency transients and overvoltages result when the vacuum breaker exhibits virtual current chop and multiple re-ignitions. This paper will present a detailed case study of vacuum breaker switching of a new LMF transformer involving current chopping and restrike simulations using the electromagnetic transients program. A technique that involves a combination of surge arresters and snubbers will be applied to the LMF to show that the switching transients can be successfully mitigated. Additionally, some practical aspects of the physical design and installation of the snubber will be discussed.

In this report <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> in small-scale hydropower stations with {{the rated power}} 4 MVA and below has been studied. Models of the stations are modeled and analyzed in PSCAD/EMTDC to study the high voltage transients that are created after current chopping with <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker.</b> <b>Vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> may chop the current before it reaches zero value, which means that high voltage transients can be created. The equipment of the stations can be destroyed by high voltage transients. The purpose of this thesis {{is to examine the}} use of <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> in small-scale hydropower stations and the risk for high voltage transients from current chopping. According to the results there is a risk of high voltage transients after current chopping with small synchronous generators in stations with the operating voltages 0. 4 kV and 3. 6 kV. When the <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> is placed on the high voltage side of the transformer the risk increases of high voltages transients and reignitions due to the low capacitance of the transformer. The conclusions is that high voltage transients occurs when the <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> chops the current at a high chopping level in stations where the synchronous generator rated power is low, high rated voltage and a small capacitance. The risks of high voltage transients in small-scale hydropower stations can be reduced with surge arrester, RC-circuits or protective capacitors. The report is written in Swedish...|$|R
40|$|The {{stagnation}} {{of water}} in two of four hospital hot-water storage tanks found to contain Legionella pneumophila was reduced by keeping the two tanks continually on-line for 1 year. L. pneumophila colony counts in these two tanks fell quickly to low levels, whereas the organisms persisted in the two tanks that were not in use. L. pneumophila continued to be isolated from 50 to 100 % of the hospital showerheads which were sampled during this period. We also examined aerators and other hospital faucet fixtures which obstruct water flow. L. pneumophila was isolated from 22 of 30 faucet aerators and 2 of 16 <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers</b> but not from 26 nonobstructed faucets or 6 backflow preventers. Over a 7 -month period, after nine faucet aerators were sterilized, 10 of 60 surveillance cultures revealed L. pneumophila, despite the inability to isolate the organism from the potable-water tanks in use. These data suggest that prevention of stagnation in hot-water tanks may be effective in reducing L. pneumophila concentrations in potable-water systems serving high-risk populations. We have also shown that faucet aerators, by providing a surface for L. pneumophila to colonize, can become secondary reservoirs for the organism in hospital plumbing...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum interrupters {{occasionally}} show unexpected (late) breakdown after current interruption. As a result, the interrupter conducts briefly, {{carrying a}} high-frequency current {{due to the}} discharge of various (stray) capacitances {{in the vicinity of}} the interrupter. Thanks to the capability of vacuum interrupters to interrupt such high-frequency current, the conduction period is normally very short (normally in the order of 10 µs). In the discussion around the assessment of such late breakdowns (often termed nonsustained disruptive discharges in the standardization literature) regarding the possibility of generation of overvoltage in capacitive circuits, the duration of the conductive period is an important parameter. Experiments were carried out, in which discharges of various single frequencies (72 kHz- 1. 1 MHz) were generated following breakdown (spontaneous breakdowns as well as prestrike) of two commercial <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers.</b> It is demonstrated that the duration of the discharge depends strongly on the discharge current frequency. At higher frequencies, the duration of the discharge tends to be shorter than at lower frequencies. For practical circuits, allowing simultaneous discharge from various circuit parts, it was observed that the highest frequency component determines the arc duration. Duration of up to 15 µs was observed. This duration is too short to allow significant overvoltages to develop in standard capacitive power delivery circuits...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 18 months Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), El Camino Real Engineering, Inc. (CRE), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) {{have worked on}} the {{development}} of disturbance-free power at the medium voltage substation level. The work resulted in the Secure Bus concept, a system in which a medium voltage bus in a substation is immune to power outages and voltage sags on the utility source. The Secure Bus voltage is also immune to voltage sags resulting from faults on any distribution feeder connected to the bus. The Secure Bus concept originated from work conducted to improve power quality for large high-tech manufacturing facilities, in particular for large semiconductor manufacturing plants. For the demands on quality power of a modern facility conventional equipment is not adequate for protecting the end user. For example, the operation of conventional <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers</b> during short circuit conditions on a feeder circuit, requiring 3 to 5 cycles for breaker opening, does not allow for fast enough current interruption to avoid a voltage dip on the main bus. A sever voltage sag could result in a shut down of sensitive equipment being supplied by the other feeder circuits, which are connected to the main bus. The circumvent the problem, a fast breaker was introduced which interrupts the short circuit before the current causes a significant voltage disturbance. To make the bus immune also to power disturbances caused by power outages, energy storage is introduced to provide the necessary energy back-up in case the primary source is not available...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Winding {{failures}} in induction machines {{have been a}} major concern in the past several years, and more so recently with the addition of variable speed drives (VSDs). Both the introduction of the vacuum breaker, and the use of pulse width modulation (PWM) drives, utilizing fast switching IGBT’s, have resulted in an increase in winding {{failures in}} induction machines. Two mechanisms that cause winding failures are steep-fronted surges, like those caused during the opening and closing of <b>vacuum</b> <b>breakers,</b> and transient overvoltages caused by impedance mismatch between the cable and load during VSD operation. There has been a fair amount of work done to date on the propagation of vacuum breaker induced steep-fronted surges in the windings of the induction machine. More recently, work has been progressing on overvoltages at the machine terminals as a result of VSD’s operating with long cables connecting drive and machine. However the propagation of these surges down the coils and the interference of these PWM surges with each other in the coils as well as the coupling between turns and coils have not been thoroughly investigated. Such an investigation would allow more benign PWM strategies to be developed, which do not build up in the machine to unacceptably high levels. To this end, this paper presents a measurement technique which can be used to study PWM generated surges and their propagation within the coil, considering each turn at a time. This requires the inclusion of the differences in the surge impedances in each section of the coil. Detailed parameter measurements are made of each turn section (slot vs. overhang), which are then used to determine the surge impedance of each section. Reflection and refraction coefficients are calculated, then used to map, via lattice diagrams, the propagation of surges within the turns of one coil...|$|E

This research was conducted to gain a better understanding of the filling process in closed pipes and thus try to optimize the filling operations and minimize the risk of damages. An experimental investigation was performed to characterize the inflow front and assess the validity of the vertical front assumption. In these experiments, the upstream reservoir head and the pipe slope were varied, and the inflow front was measured and characterized with the aid of digital camcorders. A piezo-resistive pressure transducer was also used to record the pressure during the filling process. Among other findings, this investigation demonstrated that inflow fronts do not always close the pipe cross-section, invalidating the vertical interface assumption even when proposed criteria for this assumption to be applicable have been satisfied. Two different numerical models, based on the rigid column analysis proposed by Liou and Hunt (1996) and the shock-capturing technique developed by Vasconcelos et al. (2006) were used in this investigation to assess their predictive abilities in simulating the rapid filling of empty pipes. This assessment showed that while the rigid column model reproduces certain aspects of the observed flow, the shock-capturing model was capable of resolving more of the essential features of the flow...|$|E
