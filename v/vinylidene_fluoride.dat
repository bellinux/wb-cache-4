50|$|Fluoroelastomers are {{categorized}} {{under the}} ASTM D1418 & ISO 1629 designation of FKM. This class of elastomers {{is a family}} comprising copolymers of hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (VDF or VF2), terpolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (VDF) and hexafluoropropylene (HFP) as well as perfluoromethylvinylether (PMVE) containing specialties. The fluorine content {{of the most common}} grades varies between 66 and 70%.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, vinylidenes are {{compounds}} {{with the}} functional group C=CH2. An example is 1,1-dichloroethene (CCl2=CH2) commonly called vinylidene chloride. It and <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> are precursors to commercially useful polymers.|$|E
50|$|Type 1 FKMs are {{composed}} of <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (VDF) and hexafluoropropylene (HFP). Copolymers are the standard type of FKMs showing a good overall performance. Their fluorine content typically ranges around 66 weight percent.|$|E
5000|$|... 1,1-Difluoroethylene {{also known}} as <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride,</b> is a hydrofluoroolefin. It is a {{flammable}} gas. Global production in 1999 was approximately 33,000 metric tons. [...] It is primarily used {{in the production of}} fluoropolymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride.|$|E
5000|$|The {{easiest way}} of synthesizing PVDF is the radical {{polymerization}} of <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (VF2), however, the polymerization {{is not completely}} regiospecific. The asymmetric structure of VF2 leads to the orientation isomers during the polymerization. The configuration of the monomer in the chain can be either [...] "head to head" [...] or [...] "head to tail".|$|E
50|$|In {{the radical}} telomerization of {{fluorotelomer}} molecules, {{a variety of}} fluorinated alkenes can serve as unsaturated taxogens including tetrafluoroethylene, <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride,</b> chlorotrifluoroethylene, and hexafluoropropene. However, many fluorotelomers, such as fluorotelomer alcohols, are fluorocarbon-based because they are synthesized from tetrafluoroethylene. In addition to alcohols, synthetic products include fluorotelomer iodides, olefins, and acrylate monomer. Polymerized acrylate from iodide and alcohol monomers represent >80% of the global manufacture and use of fluorotelomer-based products.|$|E
50|$|Fluoro{{elastomers}}, {{like other}} elastomers (artificial rubbers), consist of disordered polymer chains connected in three dimensions. The main challenges in making fluorelastomers are cross-linking (reacting the unreactive polymers), {{as well as}} removing the HF formed during curing. There are three main families of fluoroelasters. VDF/HFP is a copolymer system of <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> and (at least 20%) hexafluoropropylene. TFE/propylene is another copylymer system with better chemical resistance to some solvents. TFE/PMVE (perfluoromethylvinyl ether) is a copolymer system which creates a perfluorinated fluoroelastomer.|$|E
5000|$|In organic chemistry, a vinyl halide is a {{compound}} with the formula CH2=CHX (X = halide). The term vinyl {{is often used}} to describe any alkenyl group. For this reason, alkenyl halides with the formula RCH=CHX are sometimes called vinyl halides. From the perspective of applications, the dominant member of this class of compounds is vinyl chloride, which is produced on the scale of millions of tons per year as a precursor to polyvinyl chloride. [...] Polyvinyl fluoride is another commercial product. Related compounds include vinylidene chloride and <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{ferroelectric}} property exhibits polarization-electric-field-hysteresis loop, {{which is}} related to [...] "memory". One application is integrating ferroelectric polymer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films with semiconductor technology to produce nonvolatile ferroelectric random-access memory(NV-FRAM or NV-FeRAM) and data-storage devices. Recent research with LB films and more conventional solvent formed films shows that the VDF copolymers(consisting of 70% <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (VDF) and 30% trifluoroethylene (TrFE)) are promising materials for nonvolatile memory applications. The device is built {{in the form of}} the metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS) capacitance memory. The results demonstrated that LB films can provide devices with low-voltage operation.|$|E
50|$|FKM (by ASTM D1418 standard) (equivalent to FPM by ISO/DIN 1629 standard) is the {{designation}} for about 80% of fluoroelastomers {{as defined in}} ASTM D1418. Other fluorinated elastomers are perfluoro-elastomers (FFKM) and tetrafluoro ethylene/propylene rubbers (FEPM). All FKMs contain <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> as a monomer. Originally developed by DuPont (Viton), FKMs are today also produced by Daikin Chemical (Dai-El), 3M's Dyneon (Dyneon Fluoroelastomers), Solvay Specialty Polymers (Tecnoflon), HaloPolymer (Elaftor) and several Chinese manufacturers. Viton is now manufactured by Chemours. Fluoroelastomers are more expensive than neoprene or nitrile rubber elastomers. They provide additional heat and chemical resistance. FKMs {{can be divided into}} different classes on the basis of either their chemical composition, their fluorine content or their crosslinking mechanism.|$|E

40|$|In this investigation, Infrared Spectroscopic Ellipsometry {{has been}} used {{for the first time to}} probe {{diffusion}} at the polymer/polymer interface of two compatible polymers, poly (<b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride)</b> and poly (methyl methacrylate). Diffusion at the interface between two polymers is important in industrial applications, including welding and adhesion. At the polymer interface, the molecules of poly (<b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride)</b> and poly (methyl methacrylate) interdiffuse as a result of a concentration difference. This effect was observed in the infrared spectrum as loss peaks in poly (methyl methacrylate) at 1142 cm- 1, 1165 cm- 1 and the C=O doublet at 1720 cm- 1 and 1739 cm- 1 and gain peaks in poly (<b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride)</b> at 1180 cm- 1, 1219 cm- 1, 1380 cm- 1 and 1423 cm- 1. Using an infrared ellipsometer, measurements were taken of the individual polymer layers followed by the bi-layers before and after annealing. Changes at the interface were detected through careful analysis of the bi-layer after annealing at 190 ˚C. At 190 ˚C, the rate of diffusion occurred too quickly to observe as a function of time.

40|$|Male Sprague-Dawley rats (225 ? 250 g) {{were exposed}} to the thermal {{degradation}} products from four fluoropolymers. The three polymers containing <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> and hexafluoropropene (VF 2 /HFP) were pyrolyzed at 550 ? and 800 ?C, whereas polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was pyrolyzed at 625 and 800 ?C. At the lower temperatures, the pyrolysate from the copolymer of <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> and hexafluoropropene (VF 2 /HFP) was less toxic than the pyrolysates from either the terpolymer of vinyidene fluoride, hexafluoropropene, and tetrafluoroethylene (VF 2 /HFP/TFE) or the copolymer of <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> and hexafluoropropene with ?additives? (VF 2 /HFP-A). However, the pyrolysates from the VF 2 /HFP-containing materials produced less toxic products than the pyrolysate from PTFE at 625 ?C. When the pyrolysis temperature was increased to 800 ?C, very little difference was noted between the pyrolysis toxicity for any of the VF 2 /HFP-containing polymers with the most toxic pyrolysate again produced by PTFE. Carbon monoxide levels were all sublethal. No correlation could be established between hydrolyzable fluoride levels and the lethality of the pyrolysates. Death following exposure occurred within 48 hr due to acute pulmonary edema and hemorrhage. Survival of this acute phase was followed by alveolar lymphocytic infiltration and peribronchial tissue proliferation...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between ferroelectric polymer films with different transition temperatures {{is evident in}} the effect of layer thickness on the ferroelectric– paraelectric phase transition in multilayer films, as revealed by x-ray diffraction and dielectric measurements. The multilayer samples consisted of alternating Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of two different copolymers of <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> with trifluoroethylene, one with 80 % <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> and a ferroelectric– paraelectric transition temperature on heating of 133 ± 4 °C and the other with 50 % <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> and a transition temperature of 70 ± 4 °C. Samples with a repeat period of 20 LB layers (10 contiguous layers of each composition) exhibited two distinct phase transitions, indicative of minimal {{interaction between}} the two materials. Films with a repeat period of 2, or films made from an equal mixture of the two copolymers, exhibited composite behavior, with an intermediate transition temperature and suppression of the transitions associated with the individual compositions. Films with a repeat period of 10 exhibit cross-over behavior. These results imply that the ferroelectric interaction length along the (110) direction, which is perpendicular to the film plane, is approximately 11 nm...|$|E

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for measuring the volatile gas <b>vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (VDF) {{in the blood of}} rats during nose-only exposure. Blood was sampled via a jugular cannula constructed from silastic tubing. The silastic cannula was sutured and glued to the vein and was passed subcutaneously {{to the back of the}} rat's neck, where it was externalized and anchored in the same manner. Securing the cannula at these two sites stabilized its position in the vein. A strip of Velcro sutured to the skin of the animal's back sewed to protect and store the external part of the cannula. VDF in blood was measured by headspace sampling and gas chromatography. The gas chromatograph was equipped with a packed column and a flame ionization detector.
