In acrylate/vinyl ester systems, the acrylate groups polymerize {{faster than the}} vinyl ester groups resulting in an overall conversion of 80 % for acrylate double bonds in the acrylate/vinyl ester system relative to only 50 % in the bulk acrylate system. In the methacrylate/vinyl ester systems, the difference in reactivity is even more pronounced resulting in two distinguishable polymerization regimes, one dominated by methacrylate polymerization and a second dominated by vinyl ester polymerization. A faster polymerization rate and higher overall conversion of the methacrylate double bonds is thus achieved relative to polymerization of the pure methacrylate system. The methacrylate conversion in the methacrylate/ vinyl ester system is near 100 % compared to only ~ 60 % in the pure methacrylate system.

40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) and 13 C {{solid state}} {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectroscopy were used to study dextrin structural changes occurring upon hydrogel formation by <b>vinyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (VA) grafting and subsequent free radical polymerization. The degrees of VA substitution (DS) and polymerization (DP) were quantified up to 40 %VA by FTIR intensity measurements and partial least squares (PLS) /FTIR, the latter being a faster and less error-prone method. Above 40 %VA, both parameters are underestimated by FTIR. A spin counting NMR experiment showed high carbon observabilities for hydrogels and improved PLS/NMR models were achieved for DS and DP determination. Alternative NMR integration methods are hindered by the broad VA peaks and need for area correction, due to their CP dynamics. NMR changes in C 1 profile showed that a single helical conformation predominates at lower %VA, being replaced by disordered conformations as %VA increases. Furthermore, a correlation FTIR/NMR study indicated that ring conformations are significantly affected in hydrogels, compared to unpolymerized dextrin.

The degree of substitution (DS, defined {{as the amount of}} acrylate groups per 100 inulin fructofuranoside residues) with acrylate moieties can be controlled by varying the molar ratio of VA to inulin. Reasonable yields were obtained (44 − 51 %, 2 days) using a two-step purification methodology. Inulin derivatized with VA (Inul-VA) was characterized by gel permeation chromatography, and its structure was established by 1 H, 13 C, and 1 H− 1 H correlation spectroscopy and 1 H− 13 C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence NMR. The main positional isomer was at the 6 position of the fructofuranoside residue and two other minor isomers were observed at the 3 and 4 positions.

It involves the trans-esterification of <b>vinyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> with (R,S) -sec-(2 -naphthyl) ethyl alcohol catalyzed by Subtilisin Carlsberg in tert-amyl-alcohol as a solvent. Only the S ester is produced. The other product, vinyl alcohol, converts spontaneously to acetaldehyde, thus shifting the equilibrium towards production of the desired product. The scaled up reaction was run under various conditions in order to identify the controlling factors. We have been able to scale up successfully the trans-esterification reaction from 5 ml to 75 ml. By varying the immobilization and reaction conditions, we increased the initial rate of the reaction by two orders of magnitude and the conversion from 20 % to 100 %. We have isolated several grams of the S-sec-(2 -naphthyl) ethyl acrylate product. It contains two minor impurities, none of which is the R enantiomer. This and other chiral acrylic monomers could be polymerized to form polymers with special optical properties. In our dry enzymatic trans-esterification system, we found that two factors dominate the observed Subtilisin activity: Iyoprotection and water control. This is in agreement with other reports.

Using a lipase catalyzed inter-esterification reaction as a model, we studied the controlling factors when water content in the organic solvent is such that a micro-aqueous phase is formed. In such an environment it was found that support particle aggregation is the major cause for decline in enzyme activity.

40|$|Tese de Doutoramento em Engenharia Química e BiológicaTissue {{engineering}} (TE) {{has emerged}} as a promising approach to circumvent the limitations of the existing therapies for the treatment of tissue loss or organ failure. In a parallel route, continuous advances in biotechnology led to the availability of complex natural molecules for the treatment of the 20 th Century diseases, such as AIDS, Alzheimer and cancer. These molecules, far more challenging to deliver than the classical therapeutic agents, were the driven force {{for the development of a}} new frontier research – the controlled drug delivery (CDD). TE and CDD have soon become interdisciplinary branches of science, gathering concepts from engineering, material and life sciences to develop new generations of biomedical tools which allowed overcoming clinical limitations such as donor scarcity, immunological rejection or drawbacks associated with surgery, thereby increasing patient compliance. The development of biomedical devices has focused on the design of three-dimensional structures made from natural or synthetic materials, termed scaffolds. Hydrogels are a class of hydrophilic polymeric scaffolds, with appealing features from the perspective of biological mimicking. They have a good biocompatibility, degradability and appropriate mechanical properties, allowing for a favorable controlled interaction with living systems. Hydrogels can be used in TE, as scaffolds to support and promote tissue regeneration, and as attractive systems for the controlled release of pharmaceutically active molecules. The goal of this thesis was to functionalize the biomaterial – Dextrin – to produce a hydrogel, as a potential alternative to the commonly used polymers for biomedical applications, namely as controlled release devices. Dextrin is a polymer composed of -(1 4) D-glucose units, produced by partial hydrolysis of starch. The transesterification of dextrin with <b>vinyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (VA) was carried out in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), being C 2 and C 3 the preferred acylation positions, as revealed by solid state-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) analysis. Different degrees of substitution (DS) ranging from ca. 10 to 70 % were obtained by controlling the molar ratio of VA to dextrin and gels were obtained by free radical polymerization of aqueous solutions of dextrin-VA. A preliminary analysis on the potential of these hydrogels for the controlled release of bioactive molecules was carried out. The protein (bovine serum albumin-BSA) diffusion coefficients on the hydrogels were calculated using the lag-time analysis. Values in range 10 - 7 cm 2 /s were obtained for DS 20 and DS 40 and a smaller value of 10 - 8 cm 2 /s arised upon DS increasing to 70 %, revealing the dependence of the diffusivity on the crosslinking density. Further investigation has shown that the degradation is very slow under physiological conditions. However, the hydrogels could be rendered degradable through the incorporation of the enzyme amyloglucosidase, which prove to be an effective route to modulate the release profiles. Nevertheless, an alternative approach, which included the functionalization of the polymer with a methacrylate ester (HEMA), was also performed. It was possible to obtain hydrogels with distinct mechanical properties, resulting in more desirable degradation kinetics, as revealed through a rheologic analysis of the viscoelastic behavior. Finally, the biocompatibility of the hydrogels has been evaluated in vitro, using mouse embryo fibroblasts. The adhesion, proliferation and morphology of the cells on the hydrogel were studied. The extracts obtained from the hydrogels, only slightly reduced the proliferation of fibroblasts (~ 15 %). It was possible to observe that the direct seeding of the cells onto the hydrogels surfaces resulted in a reduction in the proliferation rate, as compared to tissue culture polystyrene plate. However, the results show that, although with a delay, cells are effectively able to grow, indicating that no deleterious effects are produced by dextrin hydrogels. Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide on Earth. Its hydrolysis is handled by a variety of different enzymes, known as cellulases. Cellulases, hemicellulases and other polysaccharide-degrading enzymes are widely used in a variety of applications, namelly in pulp and paper industries. Despite its wide utilization, several drawbacks result from enzyme utilization. Taking the paper treatment as an example, the drawbacks include the extensive hydrolysis of polysaccharides that leads to a reduction of both fiber strength and mass. In this context, the application of carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) allows overcoming the limitations associated with the enzyme technology. CBMs are non-catalytic modules present in several cellulases and hemicellulases. Several studies indicated that treatment of cellulose fibers with CBMs alters the interfacial properties of the fibers. In this work, the effect of recombinant cellulose-binding domains (CBD) on the properties of secondary paper fiber was evaluated. Two recombinant family 3 CBDs, from Clostridium thermocellum scaffoldin protein CipA (CBDCipA) and Cellobiohydrolase A (CbhA) were used. The CbhA CBD was used either alone (CBDCbhA) or fused with the internal fibronectin (FN 31, 2) module (FN 31 -FN 32 -CBDCbhA). Additionally, the CBDs were chemically conjugated with an activated polyethylene glycol (PEG). The data showed that the CBDCipA-PEG conjugate leads to a change on the properties of secondary fibers, as revealed by the improvement in both pulp drainage (Shopper-Riegler degree (ºSR) decreased up to 15 %) and paper tensile strength. This effect is attributed to the presence of the PEG molecule, since CBDs lacking PEG were unable to modify pulp and paper properties. It is suggested that PEG mimetizes the glycosidic fraction of fungal CBDs, which is absent in the highly purified bacterial modules used here. It is concluded that the improved drainability of the pulp is attributed to the hydration and stabilization of the fibers. A engenharia de tecidos (TE) surgiu como uma forma promissora de contornar as limitações das terapias existentes, utilizadas no tratamento do mau funcionamento ou perda total de funções de um órgão ou tecido. Numa linha de investigação paralela, os contínuos avanços biotecnológicos, conduziram ao aparecimento de uma vasta gama de moléculas complexas para o tratamento de emergentes doenças do Século XX, tais como SIDA, Alzheimer e cancro. A forma de libertação destas novas moléculas no organismo constituiu um desafio, que acabaria por ser a força impulsionadora de uma nova fronteira de investigação – a libertação controlada de fármacos (CDD). TE e CDD cedo se tornaram ramos científicos interdisciplinares. Aplicando conceitos de engenharia e ciências da vida, uniram esforços no sentido de desenvolver novas gerações de produtos biomédicos que permitissem ultrapassar alguns dos urgentes problemas associados à prática clínica, como a escassez de dadores, a rejeição imunológica ou as desvantagens da cirurgia, melhorando os cuidados de saúde. O desenvolvimento dos novos produtos biomédicos foi direccionado no sentido da produção de estruturas tridimensionais a partir de materiais naturais ou sintéticos, denominados scaffolds. Neste contexto surgem os hidrogéis, como uma classe de scaffolds poliméricos e hidrofilicos, com características apelativas da perspectiva do mimetismo de condições biológicas naturais, das quais se destacam a biocompatibilidade, a degradabilidade e as propriedades mecânicas, permitindo uma interacção favorável e controlada com os sistemas vivos. Os hidrogéis são utilizados em TE como suportes para promover a regeneração de tecidos, podendo também ser usados como atractivos sistemas de libertação controlada de fármacos. Um dos principais objectivos deste trabalho consistia na funcionalização de um biomaterial – Dextrino – para a produção de um hidrogel, como alternativa aos polímeros actualmente utilizados em aplicações biomédicas, nomeadamente como sistema de libertação controlada. O dextrino é um polímero de unidades de -(1 4) D-glucose, produzido pela hidrólise parcial do amido. A sua transesterificação com vinil acrilato (VA) foi efectuada em dimetilsulfoxido anidro (DMSO), sendo as posições C 2 e C 3, os locais preferenciais de acilação, revelados por ressonância magnética nuclear (NMR) de sólidos. Diferentes graus de substituição (DS) (entre 10 e 70 %) foram obtidos através da alteração da razão molar VA/dextrino e os hidrogéis foram obtidos por polimerização radicalar de soluções aquosas de dextrino- VA. A avaliação preliminar do potencial destes hidrogéis como sistemas de libertação controlada, foi efectuada utilizando a proteína albumina sérica de bovino (BSA), tendo os coeficientes de difusão sido calculado por análise do lag-time. Valores na ordem de 10 - 7 cm 2 /s foram obtidos para géis DS 20 e DS 40. Verificou-se, no entanto, uma diminuição para 10 - 8 cm 2 /s, aquando do aumento do DS para 70 %, assinalando a dependência da difusão na densidade de reticulação do hidrogel. Apesar de investigação subsequente ter revelado que a degradação dos hidrogéis ocorre de forma lenta em condições fisiológicas, foi possível torná-los degradáveis através da incorporação da enzima amiloglucosidase, sendo uma forma efectiva de modular os perfis de libertação. Não obstante, foi realizada uma abordagem alternativa, passando pela utilização do ester metacrilato (HEMA) na funcionalização do polímero. A avaliação reológica do comportamento visco-elástico revelou ser possível a obtenção de hidrogéis com propriedades mecânicas distintas, resultando em cinéticas de degradação mais apropriadas. Finalmente, a biocompatibilidade dos hidrogéis foi avaliada in vitro, em fibroblastos embrionários de rato, através da análise da adesão, proliferação e morfologia celulares. Os resultados demonstraram que os extractos obtidos a partir dos hidrogéis induziram apenas uma ligeira redução da proliferação celular (~ 15 %). Foi ainda possível observar que o cultivo directo das células na superfície dos hidrogéis, resulta numa redução na taxa de proliferação quando comparada com a cultura controlo. No entanto, foi demonstrado que as células são efectivamente capazes de crescer, indicando que a presença do hidrogel não produz efeitos deletérios. A celulose é o polissacarídeo mais abundante na Terra. A sua hidrólise é levada a cabo por diferentes enzimas, conhecidas como celulases. As celulases, hemicelulases e outras enzimas responsáveis pela degradação de polissacarídeos, têm uma vasta aplicação, nomeadamente na indústria de polpa e papel. Apesar de amplamente utilizadas, vários inconvenientes resultam da acção das enzimas. No caso do tratamento de papel destaca-se a hidrólise extensiva dos polissacarídeos, que resulta numa redução de massa e resistência das fibras. Neste contexto, a aplicação de módulos de ligação a carbohidratos (CBMs), surge como uma alternativa viável, evitando as desvantagens da tecnologia enzimática. Os CBMs consistem em módulos não-catalíticos, presentes em várias celulases e hemicelulases. Vários estudos indicam que o tratamento de fibras de celulose com CBMs provoca alterações nas propriedades interfaciais das mesmas. Neste trabalho foi avaliado o efeito de domínios de ligação a celulose (CBDs) recombinantes nas propriedades de fibras de papel secundárias. Foram utilizados dois CBDs (família 3) recombinantes de Clostridium thermocellum, pertencentes a dois complexos enzimáticos: scaffoldin protein A (CipA/CBDCipA) e Cellobiohydrolase A (CbhA/CBDCbhA). O CBDCipA foi utilizado isolado ou em fusão com o módulo interno de fibronectina (FN 31 -FN 32 -CBDCbhA). Procedeu-se ainda à conjugação química dos CBDs com uma molécula activada de polietileno glicol (PEG). Os resultados obtidos demonstraram que o conjugado CBDCipA-PEG provoca alterações nas fibras secundárias, que resultam no melhoramento da drenabilidadedas polpas (diminuição do grau de Shopper-Riegler (ºSR) até 15 %), bem como da resistência à tensão do papel. Este efeito é atribuído à presença da molécula de PEG, uma vez que na ausência deste, os CBDs isolados não são capazes de provocar alterações nas propriedades da polpa e do papel, sugerindo que a molécula de PEG mimetiza o efeito da fracção glicosídica dos CBDs fungícos, que está ausente nos módulos bacterianos puros. Conclui-se que o melhoramento na drenabilidade da polpa está relacionado com a hidratação e estabilização das fibras.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{hydrophilic}} polymer {{surface with}} low friction has been devel-oped. A coating can be attached by {{the reaction of}} an epoxy containing poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) with the polyamino compound formed {{on the surface of}} the substrate. The epoxy containing poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) was obtained by the copolymerization of <b>vinyl</b> pyrrolidone, glycidyl <b>acrylate,</b> and <b>vinyl</b> acetate. A molecular weight of 400, 000 or more is essential to achieve low surface friction. Polyurethane catheters in rabbit models, both with and without the hydro-philic low friction coating, were evaluated for surface friction coefficient and blood compatibility. The coated catheters produced no lesions of the intima of the blood vessels and no thrombus formation on the catheter surface, while the non-coated catheters injured the intima of the blood vessels and severe throm-bus formation was found on their surfaces...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} online conversion and polymer composition through sound velocity measurements, {{a mathematical model}} for calculating sound velocity in emulsion polymerization has been developed. With respect to previous modeling approaches, its main features are as follows: (1) the application to three-phase, reacting systems of Urick equation (usually adopted for estimating sound velocity in multiphase, dispersed, unreacting systems, such as emulsions and suspensions); and (2) {{the development of an}} empirical relationship for estimating particle compressibility as a function of conversion during the reaction. The model has been validated through several sets of experimental data of batch and semibatch homo- and copolymerizations involving styrene, butyl <b>acrylate,</b> <b>vinyl</b> acetate, and methyl methacrylate. In most of the examined cases, the performances of the calibration model are satisfactory. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R

All NIR spectra were collected online with a transflectance probe immersed into the reaction medium. The spectral range used for the NIR monitoring was from 9 500 to 13 000 cm(- 1), where the absorbance of the chemical components present is minimal and {{the changes in the}} NIR spectrum can be ascribed to the effects of light scattering by the polymer particles. Off-line measurements of the average diameter of the polymer particles by DLS were used as reference values {{for the development of the}} multi-variate NIR calibration models based on partial least squares. Results indicated that, in the spectral range studied, it is possible to monitor the evolution of the average size of the polymer particles during emulsion polymerization reactions. The inclusion of an additional spectral range, from 5 701 to 6 447 cm(- 1), containing information on absorbances (""chemical information"") in the calibration models was also evaluated.

40|$|A {{well-defined}} poly(ethylene glycol) based hyperbranched thermoresponsive copolymer {{with high}} content of <b>acrylate</b> <b>vinyl</b> groups was synthesized via a “one-pot and one-step” deactivation enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization approach, which provided an injectable and in situ crosslinkable system via Michael-type thiol-ene reaction with a thiol-modified hyaluronan biopolymer.

The silica coating increases the Eu 3 + absolute emission quantum yields from 0. 51 to 0. 86 (255 nm excitation) and decay times from 1. 43 to 1. 80 ms (394. 4 nm excitation).

40|$|Taking Pd di-imine {{catalysts}} as an example, we use {{first principles}} density functional theory (B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G*) {{to investigate the}} chain propagation steps for polymerization of polar monomers. We start with the complex formed from insertion of ethylene into the polymer chain and consider insertion into the Pd−C bond for each of four polar monomers:[*] methyl <b>acrylate,</b> <b>vinyl</b> acetate, vinyl chloride, and acrylonitrile. We find 2, 1 -insertion is favored in each case (by 3 to 5 kcal/mol), resulting in a product with a strong interaction of the polar group for the growing polymer chain with the metal. Next, we insert another unit of the same polar monomer or an ethylene unit (except for acrylonitrile). We optimize the structures for all important intermediates and transition states using a continuum dielectric to account for solvation effects. These studies pinpoint the critical difficulties in designing catalysts to polymerize polar monomers...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene {{copolymers}} {{with different}} polar comonomers, such as <b>vinyl</b> acetate, methyl <b>acrylate,</b> glycidyl methacrylate, and maleic anhydride, {{were used for}} the preparation of polymer/clay nanocomposites by statically annealing their mechanical mixtures with different commercial or home-made organically modified montmorillonites containing only one long alkyl tail. The nanostructure of the products was monitored by X-ray diffraction, and the dispersion of the silicate particles within the polymer matrix was qualitatively evaluated through microscopic analyses. The effect of the preparation conditions on the structure and the morphology of the composites was also addressed through the characterization of selected samples with similar composition prepared by melt compounding. In agreement with the findings reported in a previous paper for the composites filled with two-tailed organoclays, intercalation of the copolymer chains within the tighter galleries of the one-tailed clays occurs easily, independent of the application of a mechanical stress. However, the shear-driven break-up of the intercalated clay particles into smaller platelets (exfoliation) seems more hindered. A collapse of the organoclay interlayer spacing was only observed clearly for a commercial one-tailed organoclay – Cloisite® 30 B – whereas the same effect was almost negligible for a home-made organoclay with similar structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} {{production of}} high-strength concrete which meets the desired strength and durability {{is dependent on}} optimising its rheological (or flow) properties and reducing its loss of workability during the transportation, placing and compaction stages. The research presented in this thesis aimed to: 1. Determine whether mix stability and compactability can be adequately described by the two Bingham parameters of yield value and plastic viscosity. 2. Reduce the uncertainties in material selection {{with regards to the}} performance of superplasticizers and cement replacement materials. 3. Examine how the two Bingham parameters vary at different degrees of compaction by vibration. 4. Determine how these influence the strength development characteristics in the hardened state. 5. An additional aim was to carry out any modifications to the test apparatus and methods which experience makes necessary. Measurements with Tattersall's MH two-point workability test apparatus indicated that mix stability correlates more closely with the yield value than with plastic viscosity, whilst the opposite is true with respect to compactability under self-weight. The performance of conventional and new-generation superplasticizers (based on SMF, SNF, MLS, <b>Vinyl</b> and <b>Acrylate</b> polymers) was evaluated with different dosages, mixing procedures and cements. The SNF superplasticizer produced slightly lower initial workabilities than the Acrylate superplasticizer, but the longest workability retentions of the superplasticizers tested. Partial cement replacements by CSF in binary blends produced lower superplasticizer dosage demands, higher initial workabilities and longer workability retentions than those due to PFA and GGBS. When used in ternary blended cements, CSF enhanced the performance of mixes containing PFA or GGBS at w/b ratios of 0. 30 - 0. 22. A novel method developed to assess the vibration response of fresh concretes has, for the first time, demonstrated that both the yield value and plastic viscosity decrease during compaction. The method has also demonstrated that the maximum compressive strengths and densities of concretes compacted for different vibration durations/amplitudes coincide with the attainment of zero yield value. Continuous reductions in plastic viscosity during vibration mainly reduced the homogeneity of concrete compacted in short columns...|$|R
