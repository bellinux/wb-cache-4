5|$|Her husband {{announced}} {{his campaign for}} President of the United States in mid-1999, something that she agreed to. She did say, however, {{that she had never}} dreamed that he would run for office. The Bush campaign worked to assure <b>voters</b> <b>that</b> as First Lady, she would not seek to emulate then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. When asked who she would be like out of the past First Ladies, she insisted it would be herself.|$|E
5|$|After meeting Fannie Lou Hamer in {{the summer}} of 1964 and hearing her {{experiences}} in the civil rights movement, Blackwell decided to join the SNCC. As a project director for the SNCC, she organized voter registration drives across Mississippi. Later that year, she became a member on the executive committee of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), which provided a party for <b>voters</b> <b>that</b> SNCC had been registering to vote. In late August she and 67 other activists left Mississippi to represent the MFDP at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in an attempt to get the MFDP seated as delegates. They were unsuccessful in getting seats, but the move brought the party and the Mississippi civil rights movement into the public eye.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing <b>voters</b> <b>that</b> he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, she ran {{again for}} city council, and was successful. The {{election}} {{was the first}} held under the city's new charter, which had {{been approved by the}} <b>voters</b> <b>that</b> April, designed to shift power away from city council to a strong mayor, something reformers believed would produce a system that would be more efficient and less susceptible to corruption. It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs be filled by merit selection rather than patronage. In the November elections, Democrats won control of city government from Republicans {{for the first time in}} 67 years. After narrowly winning a primary race against labor lawyer Harry Galfand, Dallas was elected as a part of that wave, winning 54% of the vote in the new 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, Germantown, and Roxborough) over incumbent Republican councilman Robert S. Hamilton (the new charter did away with multi-member council districts).|$|E
5|$|She {{used her}} access {{to form a}} {{coalition}} of leaders from black organizations called the Federal Council of Negro Affairs, but which {{came to be known}} as the Black Cabinet. It served as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing black people in America. It was composed of numerous talented blacks, mostly men, who had been appointed to positions in federal agencies. This was the first collective of black people working in higher positions in government. It suggested to <b>voters</b> <b>that</b> the Roosevelt administration cared about black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes. Although as advisers they did not directly create public policy, they were a respected leadership among black voters; they influenced political appointments and disbursement of funds to organizations that would benefit black people.|$|E
5|$|Hancock and the Democrats {{expected}} {{to carry the}} Solid South, {{while much of the}} North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states, including New York {{and a few of the}} Midwestern states (national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there). Practical differences between the major party candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern <b>voters</b> <b>that</b> the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets, the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} scenario, {{there is a}} {{three-way}} tie for first place. This happens because the expected winner, Memphis, was the Condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any <b>voter</b> <b>that</b> did not rank it first.|$|R

5|$|McKinley was a noted protectionist, and was {{confident}} of winning an election fought on that question. But it was free silver {{that became the}} issue of the day, with Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the gold standard. Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the <b>voters</b> <b>that</b> free silver would be harmful, and once that had its effect, even more were printed on protectionism. McKinley stayed at home in Canton, running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of the speeches he gave to organized groups of people. This contrasted with Bryan, who toured the nation by rail in his campaign. Supported by the well-to-do, urban dwellers, and prosperous farmers, McKinley won a majority of the popular vote and an easy victory in the Electoral College. McKinley's systemized approach to gaining the presidency laid the groundwork for modern campaigns, and he forged an electoral coalition that would keep the Republicans in power most of the time until 1932.|$|E
5|$|The black {{nationalist}} movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites {{during the late}} 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage and intimidation of potential black <b>voters</b> <b>that</b> characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the Bulawayo trade unionist Joshua Nkomo, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and {{by the start of}} 1962 was called the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land Apportionment Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU of prospective black voters impeded the UFP's efforts to win their support, and much of the white community saw Whitehead as too radical, and soft on what they saw as black extremism. In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian election, the UFP was defeated by the Rhodesian Front (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by Winston Field and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|To gain {{political}} power in favor of prohibition legislation, a state Prohibition Party was formed in 1884; however, it {{was never able to}} effectively mobilize a significant force of voters within the state. Many temperance advocates continued to work within the more established political parties. The liquor issue pitted wets and drys in stable uncompromising coalitions that formed a main theme of Hoosier politics into the 1930s. One legislative success occurred in 1895, when the state legislature passed the Nicholson law, a local option law authored by S. E. Nicholson, a Quaker minister who served in the state legislature and was a leader of the national Anti-Saloon League. The League became a {{political power}}house, mobilizing pietistic Protestant <b>voters</b> (<b>that</b> is, members of the major denominations except Lutherans and Episcopalians) to support dry legislation. The Nicholson law allowed voters in a city or township to file a remonstrance that would prevent an individual saloon owner from acquiring a liquor license. Additional legislative efforts to extend the Nicholson law and achieve statewide prohibition in Indiana would not occur until the early twentieth century. One of the leading supporters for the temperance movement in Indiana was Emma Barrett Molloy, who was {{an active member of the}} WCTU and lectured across the country to promote the ban of alcohol. Through her vocal activism in temperance and prohibition, Molloy also entered into the women's suffrage sphere as a strong supported for women's rights, particularly freedom of speech.|$|E
50|$|A donkey vote is {{a ballot}} cast in an {{election}} that uses a preference voting system, where a voter is permitted or required to rank candidates on the ballot paper, and ranks them based on the order they appear on the ballot paper.

50|$|The median voter theorem {{rests on}} two main assumptions, with several others {{detailed}} below. First, the theorem assumes <b>that</b> <b>voters</b> can place all election alternatives along a one-dimensional political spectrum. It seems plausible <b>that</b> <b>voters</b> {{could do this}} if they can clearly place political candidates on a left-to-right continuum, but this is often not the case as each party will have its own policy on each of many different issues. Similarly, {{in the case of}} a referendum, the alternatives on offer may cover more than one issue. Second, the theorem assumes that voters' preferences are single-peaked, which means <b>that</b> <b>voters</b> choose the alternative closest to their own view. This assumption predicts that the further away the outcome is from the voter's most preferred outcome, the less likely the voter is to select that alternative. It also assumes <b>that</b> <b>voters</b> always vote, regardless of how far the alternatives are from their own views. The median <b>voter</b> theorem implies <b>that</b> <b>voters</b> have an incentive to vote for their true preferences. Finally, the median voter theorem applies best to a majoritarian election system.|$|R
25|$|Democratic nominee John McKeithen {{at first}} warned <b>voters</b> <b>that</b> they were {{required}} to vote for him as the party standard-bearer because their participation in a party primary carried with it a loyalty oath to the eventual nominee.

40|$|Objective. This article {{examines}} {{public opinion on}} the effectiveness and consequences of voter identification laws, focusing on the core issue in the Supreme Court's reasoning in the 2008 case that upheld an Indiana photo-ID law, Crawford v. Marion County Election Board. Method. We use a unique survey from New Mexico, where voter identification policies have recently undergone important changes. Questions in the survey examine whether <b>voters</b> think <b>that</b> ID laws protect against fraud and prevent legitimate participation, which point of view voters find more compelling, and whether attitudes toward voter identification are related to voter confidence. Results. Most <b>voters</b> think <b>that</b> <b>voter</b> ID laws prevent fraud, but many <b>voters</b> think <b>that</b> ensuring access to the polls {{is more important than}} preventing fraud. Among other variables that explain differences among individuals, partisanship plays an important role. Conclusion. The framing of voter identification policies {{plays an important role in}} how such laws are interpreted by the public and Republicans are especially concerned about fraud in elections...|$|R
