5|$|Jolin was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for the architectural and aesthetic preservation of the capital, as is written in his draft for a pamphlet called Mot strömmen (Against the Tide). According to him, Stockholm had become an ugly town, by insensitive mixing of styles, densification, and centuries of eager renovation. Jolin wanted {{to bring out the}} beautiful and the genuine in the cityscape, as well as restore, what he considered to be distorted parts of the city, to their former glory. According to Palmgren, perhaps it was that dream Jolin expressed in his depictions of Stockholm. At the end of the 19th century, and during some decades into the 20th century, artists depicted Stockholm in a variety of ways, each according to his own mind and individualism. Traditionalists worked side by side with Modernists, old with young, seasoned pursuers of the established <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and young enthusiastic individuals, such as Jolin. By the middle of the 20th century, his focus shifted from the cityscape to other motifs such as chinoiserie settings, but in his youth, he and his friends from his years in Paris found inspiration in Stockholm and its surroundings.|$|E
