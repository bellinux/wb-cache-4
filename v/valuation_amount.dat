In South Africa various {{financial}} institutions and independent vendors have developed residential property valuation models to estimate the current value of historically traded properties. A natural extension to these models has been to develop historical property price indices. In this dissertation, {{three of the four}} approaches to developing property price indices will be examined. Through back–testing and other statistical methods, the most accurate and robust approach will be determined. The four major approaches available are the mean valuation per suburb, the median valuation per suburb, the repeat sales approach and hedonic regression. The mean valuation per suburb approach can be biased because of outliers in property prices. However, outliers in property prices will not influence the median valuation per suburb approach, but in cases where property values in a suburb have a skewed distribution, the <b>valuation</b> <b>amount</b> could be distorted. Neither of the above mentioned shortcomings influences the repeat sales or the hedonic regression approach. To follow the hedonic regression approach, the characteristics of the property need to be known. In South Africa, however, the available property data lacks detailed characteristics of traded properties. This dissertation will therefore focus on the first three methods. The repeat sales approach measures the growth in property prices by applying a generalized linear model to properties that have traded more than once. This approach is only possible if there is a representative amount of repeat sales able to fit a model. The focus of this project will be on the repeat sales approach, but all three the approaches discussed will be analysed to prove that the repeat sales approach is the most accurate in developing a property price index for properties in South Africa.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{models of}} equity valuation {{which are based}} on accounting data of equity book value, net income, and residual earnings. Research is focused on the problem of validity of different analytical models which is defined by the ability of a model to produce fundamental valuations closely connected with market valuations of equity. This paper investigates versions of residual income model (RIM) under different modifications of linear information dynamics (LID). All models developed in this paper are tested on the data of Russian stock market from 2000 to 2005 year, which was booming during this period. Results showed that accounting-based valuation models have good explanation characteristics on Russian emerging market. The version of RIM which rests on assumption that investors base their expectations about future amounts of net income totally on current net incomes gives highest correlation between fundamental and market <b>valuations</b> of equity <b>amounted</b> to R-square 0, 83. The version of RIM which rests on assumption that investors base their expectations about future amounts of residual earnings totally on current residual earnings gives correlation between fundamental and market <b>valuations</b> of equity <b>amounted</b> to R-square 0, 78. These results could prove a hypothesis about opacity of emerging markets: on these markets investors base their expectations mainly on current information which is available and relevant for forecasting. ...|$|R

Since both the liquidation recovery and the final going-concern auction premium are observable, the overbidding theory is testable. We perform a large-sample, cross-sectional analysis where overbidding is picthed against asset-fire sale arguments. The latter hold that auctions tend to produce lower going-concern premiums when taking place during industry-wide financial distress, or when the firm is sold back to old owners or to industry outsiders. The evidence is strongly consistent with overbidding but provides little support for asset fire-sale arguments...|$|R

50|$|According to the Landsbanki Receiverships initial {{interpretation}} of the Icelandic law, the creditor claims in foreign currency towards a liquidated Icelandic financial company in receivership, should only be repaid by an ISK-equivalent amount as per the currency exchange rate registered on the date when winding-up proceedings were initiated; which was as per 22 April 2009 for the Landsbanki receivership. Moreover, it was believed the creditors had no legal right to claim compensation towards the Landsbanki receivership for any potential losses they may suffer, because of exchange rate fluctuations after 22 April 2009. On 26 September 2013, the Icelandic Supreme Court however ruled against this initial law {{interpretation of}} the Landsbanki Receivership, concluding all creditors should be fully repaid with currency amounts equal to the denoted local currency of their claim; meaning that when repaid with other currencies, then <b>valuation</b> of this <b>amount</b> should be calculated by converting it to the claims denoted currency, according to the foreign currency exchange rates registered by the Icelandic Central Bank on the repayment date. Thus ensuring that all creditors bare no currency exchange risks, with these risks -and potential financial burdens- instead to be upheld solely by the receivership.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} I attempt to model and investigate the housing decisions of Spanish-speaking migrants. I use methods developed by Bajari and Kahn (2002) to obtain {{willingness to pay}} measurements for the migrant groups in samples drawn from three major California cities. I then apply these results to several hypotheses that attempt to describe current migration patterns of Hispanics into increasingly segregated communities characterized by high levels of crowding, low educational attainment, {{and high levels of}} Spanish speakers. This research finds that spoken language plays a significant role in a migrant’s decision process. Spanish-speaking migrants demonstrate a significant preference for locating in communities with higher levels of Spanish speakers. They demonstrate a large relative distaste for living neighborhoods with high levels of human capital – as measured by the percentage of college graduates, as well as significantly lower <b>valuations</b> for the <b>amount</b> of space in a housing unit – measured by the number of rooms. The spatial assimilation hypothesis finds significant support within the results, indicating that more assimilated Spanish speakers will continue to emigrate from language enclaves.

40|$|Preference {{reversals}} (PRs) {{occur when}} one’s preferences {{over the same}} items change depending upon how one is asked to construct a preference. PRs are a robust phenomenon that lead to suboptimal real-world decision making. Despite this, it remains unclear why PRs occur. This study investigated whether biological procedural invariance (i. e., different procedures are associated with different underlying mechanisms) could elucidate why PRs occur. Seventeen participants were scanned via functional MRI (fMRI) while (a) expressing preferences between 2 probabilistic wins or 2 probabilistic losses (1 high and 1 low magnitude) and, (b) reporting a monetary <b>amount</b> (<b>valuation)</b> according to how much they wanted to sell a potential winning gamble for or how much they would pay to forgo a potential loss. Participants’ valuations closely followed expected value. Choice behavior, however, was more prone to bias because of unequal weighting of either magnitude or probability. Preference formation during both valuation and choice was associated with fronto-parietal neural activity. Within this system, valuation was associated with greater activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudal anterior cingulate cortex, while choice was associated with greater activity in the insula, horizontal inferior parietal sulcus, posterior cingulate cortex, and somatosensory cortex. The combination of behavioral and neuroimaging data may suggest that participants used a mathematical approach to formation of valuations but choices were subject to emotional influence. These findings may provide support for a biological procedural invariance view of gambling preference reversal. These findings are difficult to accommodate within explanations that rely on modifications to expected utility and prospect theory...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} investigates the <b>valuation</b> of <b>amounts</b> {{for the purpose}} of inclusion in gross income. Because the gross income definition in section 1 of the Income Tax Act includes "amounts in cash or otherwise", valuations are often required in order to establish a value in money terms for amounts received or accrued in a form otherwise than in cash. The basis on which these valuations are made can vary and the courts have frequently been called upon to decide on the correct method of valuation. There has been an ongoing debate in the courts as to whether a strict objective approach or a more flexible subjective approach should be adopted when valuing an amount in a form other than cash, which was finally settled in the decision by the Supreme Court of Appeal in CIR v Brummeria Renaissance (Pty) Ltd, which held that an objective approach must be followed. The {{present research}} will demonstrate how the strict rule of interpretation tends to result in purely objective valuations as it requires that the ordinary grammatical meaning of words be applied and does not allow the court to consider the purpose of the legislation or introduce any subjectivity based on the circumstances of each individual taxpayer and the facts of each particular case, which a purposive interpretation approach does. The purposive approach to interpretation is therefore more closely aligned with the subjective approach to valuation. Both the objective and subjective approaches to valuation have advantages and disadvantages, which are addressed in the research. The need for certainty in taxation was articulated as early as 1776 by Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations. The objective approach appears to create a level of consistency as all income received by a taxpayer is effectively taxed as if received by a third party in an arm’s length transaction. The approach has led to unfair decisions at odds with economic reality and generally accepted accounting principles, which could be challenged {{on the basis of a}} lack of equity and fairness as required by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. The research demonstrates that an objective method of valuation is neither fully objective nor appropriate in certain circumstances, while a subjective approach may be more appropriate as it ensures that each taxpayer’s individual rights are protected. Although the subjective approach successfully addresses the issue of fairness, it threatens to introduce an unacceptable level of inconsistency and is, in reality, not always administratively feasible. The present research concludes that a trade-off between fairness and consistency is often necessary. ...|$|R
60|$|Trade {{is carried}} on with the natives {{by means of a}} {{standard}} valuation, called {{in some parts of the}} country a castor. This is to obviate the necessity of circulating money, of which there is little or none, excepting in the colony of Red River. Thus, an Indian arrives at a fort with a bundle of furs, with which he proceeds to the Indian trading-room. There the trader separates the furs into different lots, and, valuing each at the standard <b>valuation,</b> adds the <b>amount</b> together, and tells the Indian (who has looked on the while with great interest and anxiety) that he has got fifty or sixty casters; at the same time he hands the Indian fifty or sixty little bits of wood in lieu of cash, so that the latter may know, by returning these in payment of the goods for which he really exchanges his skins, how fast his funds decrease. The Indian then looks round upon the bales of cloth, powder-horns, guns, blankets, knives, etcetera, with which the shop is filled, and after a good while makes up his mind to have a small blanket. This being given him, the trader tells him that the price is six castors; the purchaser hands back six of his little bits of wood, and selects something else. In this way he goes on till all his wooden cash is expended; and then, packing up his goods, departs to show his treasures to his wife, and another Indian takes his place. The value of a castor is from one to two shillings. The natives generally visit the establishments of the Company twice a year--once in October, when they bring in the produce of their autumn hunts; and again in March, when they come in with that of the great winter hunt.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and modeling {{study was conducted}} to assess the ground-level atmospheric ozone impacts of several types of consumer product compounds Environmental chamber experiments were carried out for the representative amines 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol (AMP), ethanolamine, isopropyl amine and t-butyl amine and also for d-limonene. AMP and t-butyl amine were found to inhibit ozone formation, but the others enhanced ozone, and most were found to significantly enhance formation of secondary particle matter (PM). Methods to estimate mechanisms for amines that were qualitatively consistent with the chamber data were developed. However, the amine chamber data were not useful for quantitative <b>valuation</b> because the <b>amount</b> of amine available for gas-phase reaction could not be measured, and appeared to be significantly less than the amount injected. Estimates of atmospheric ozone impacts for the amines are also very uncertain because the amount of amines removed by reaction with HNO 3 in the atmosphere cannot be predicted. The chamber data obtained for d-limonene were well simulated by the existing d-limonene mechanism. Representations of the atmospheric reactions of for 15 amines and 30 other types of consumer product VOCs were added to the SAPRC- 07 mechanism and its MIR and other reactivity scale tabulations, which are included with this report. ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND DISCLAIMERS This work was funded by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) through contract number 06 - 408.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to: (1) compare the cost-loss ratio of selected Indiana school corporations in physical property insurance coverage; (2) review the established self-insurance funds that provide protection for public school property; (3) form a hypothetical self-insurance fund {{for the protection of the}} physical property of Indiana school corporations; and (4) to determine if a program of self-insurance by means of a funded reserve was feasible as an alternative for the protection of physical property. The method of investigation included the gathering of data by means of a developed questionnaire from selected Indiana school corporations having 10, 000 students or more during the years 1969 - 70 through 1973 - 74. Evaluation was done by computing cost-loss ratios from the data. A review of operating self-insurance programs was made and a model plan of self-insurance for the public schools of Indiana was presented based on criteria of the operating funds and the experiences of the Indiana school corporations. The data were reported under the following divisions: 1. The money expended for insurance premiums for the protection of physical property. 2. The appraised value of the property insured. 3. The method used to arrive at the <b>valuation.</b> 4. The <b>amount</b> of money received from insurance companies as indemnity for loss of physical property. 5. The difficulty encountered in obtaining insurance coverage for the school property. 6. The method used for purchasing school physical property insurance. The data were treated normatively using percentages and tables. The findings of the study are as follows: 1. The ratio of claims paid to the premium costs of insurance was 15. 22 per cent for the five-year period. 2. Twenty-nine per cent of the school corporations used the insurance company engineer to appraise the value of public school property; 29 per cent used the professional appraisal company; 17 per cent made use of architects; and 13 per cent used a committee to determine the insurable value of the physical property. 3. Seventy-five per cent of the administrators reported that competitive bids were used for purchasing insurance. However, 25 per cent used other methods of placing the school property insurance. 4. Most of the administrators, 87. 50 per cent, reported having no difficulty in placing the coverage for the protection of their physical property; however, 12. 50 per cent experienced difficulty in finding a company willing to insure the property. The findings of the study support the following conclusions: 1. A considerable cash reserve would be available for educational purposes, other than the payment for insurance premiums, if the school corporations in the study had formed a selfinsurance fund during the 1969 - 70 school year and maintained the fund for the five-year period. 2. All of the state self-insurance funds are operating with sufficient reserves to meet operating expenses and pay loss claims as they occur. 3. Insurance costs for the public schools in states with operating self-insurance funds varied from no costs to 68 per cent of insurance bureau rates. 4. Economically, a self-insurance fund would be feasible for the public schools of Indiana. The findings and conclusions of the study support the following recommendations: 1. A self-insurance fund modeled after the one presented in this study should be developed and presented for consideration by the Indiana General Assembly. 2. The General Assembly should provide a reserve for the fund during the first years of operation to insure solvency. 3. The fund should operate on sound insurance principles and should be free from political pressures. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
