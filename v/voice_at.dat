5|$|Paul Oscar rediscovered his <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> {{the age of}} 18, singing bass {{with the}} Hamrahlíð college choir for two years. In 1990 he won a talent contest for his college; later that year {{at the time of}} his graduation, he played Frank-N-Furter to great success in the college's {{production}} of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Around the same time, he began appearing in drag shows at a notorious Reykjavík nightclub. After the club closed, he became a radio jockey on independent radio station FM 90,9.

5|$|The term 'bomber mafia' {{came from}} the {{sometimes}} bitter debates between United States Army staff and Air Corps men who observed, and argued with, the insistence by instructors and students of the ACTS that heavy bombers were the new primary weapon of war, and that a separate air arm was required to command them. For the first few years, the strongest <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> ACTS against the bomber doctrine was Captain (later General) George C. Kenney who called {{for the use of}} air power to attack enemy fighting units on the ground. He advocated the close coordination of air and ground forces, with an emphasis on medium bombers and fighter bombers. Kenney left ACTS in 1929, and heavy bomber doctrinarians filled the vacancy. The doctrine also ran counter to the theories of Billy Mitchell himself, who espoused that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations.|$|E

5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible for}} an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or <b>voice.</b> <b>At</b> about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E

25|$|The abolishment of the Catholic {{section of}} the Prussian Ministry of ecclesiastical and {{educational}} affairs, deprived Catholics of their <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> the highest level. The system of strict government supervision of schools was applied only in Catholic areas; the Protestant schools were left alone. The school politics also alienated Protestant conservatives and churchmen.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1870s and early 1880s, several appeals {{were made by}} Metis people to be better {{represented}} in government. The treaties established with aboriginal groups in the area gave a sense of <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> that time, and territorial government was dominated by the euro-Canadian minority, referring to themselves as 'white' {{in contrast to the}} Metis majority in many regions. In April 1883, a local council voted against a proposition to send a delegation to Ottawa to demand their rights, and instead supported an effort to bring Louis Riel back to Canada.|$|E

25|$|Orlando de Lassus {{was born}} in Mons in the County of Hainaut, Habsburg Netherlands (modern-day Belgium). Information about his early years is scanty, {{although}} some uncorroborated stories have survived, {{the most famous of}} which is that he was kidnapped three times because of the singular beauty of his singing <b>voice.</b> <b>At</b> the age of twelve, he left the Low Countries with Ferrante Gonzaga and went to Mantua, Sicily, and later Milan (from 1547 to 1549). While in Milan, he made the acquaintance of the madrigalist Spirito l'Hoste da Reggio, a formative influence on his early musical style.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of 2012, Morissette auditioned for Repertory Philippines' Disney's Camp Rock: The Musical and scored the lead role of Mitchie Torres - a smart, talented, passionate girl who fights for what she {{believes}} in. She starred alongside Markki Stroem, who played Shane Gray. The musical play was held at Onstage, Greenbelt 1, Makati City from November 16 until December 16. Amon enjoyed this first stint in theater thoroughly, but using her <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> full tilt during rehearsals and the play itself took its toll. She started losing her voice after performances, prompting consultation with a doctor who diagnosed her with vocal cord nodules.|$|E
25|$|During 1986 {{the series}} became {{dominated}} by Den and Angie's storylines {{and the focus}} of the programme was very much concentrated on their combustible relationship. The emphasis began early in 1986 with the arrival of Den's mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How). Jan had been a powerful off-screen presence for the first year, a menacing <b>voice</b> <b>at</b> the end of the telephone, which severely affected the mood of both Den and Angie and kept the audience on edge every time the phone rang. Jan's physical arrival at the Vic in January 1986 was one of the show's dramatic highlights. Her invasion of Angie's territory was a springboard to future emotional fireworks and a precursor to Angie's further dependence on alcohol and her attempted suicide.|$|E
