40|$|BACKGROUND: Major {{neurological}} handicaps and neuropsychological disturbances {{are more}} common in ex-preterm children than their counterparts born at term. OBJECTIVE: To establish in a prospective study whether a characteristic neuropsychological profile exists in ex-preterm children who do not exhibit neurodevelopmental deficits on routine clinical examination. METHODS: Thirty intellectually normal children born preterm (30 - 34 weeks gestation) without major neurological disabilities and a control group of term children matched for age, sex, and parental educational and occupational status were assessed at 3 - 4 years of age to obtain a complete neuropsychological profile. Intellectual ability, language comprehension and expression, perceptual and <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function,</b> working memory, and attention and behavioural problems were investigated. RESULTS: Even {{in the absence of}} major neurological signs, children born preterm achieved lower mean scores than controls on the Stanford-Binet intelligence scale (110. 8 v 121, p 0. 001), visual perception test (33. 8 v 42. 7, p 0. 001), visual motor integration test (42. 6 v 47. 4, p = 0. 049), memory for location test (8. 4 v 9. 5, p = 0. 007), sustained attention test (41. 6 v 51. 5, p = 0. 009), and the picture vocabulary test (33. 3 v 44. 7, p = 0. 021). CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychological abnormalities can be detected early in childhood in apparently normal ex-preterm children and are consistent with a growing body of evidence that prematurity may be associated with long term neuropsychological morbidity in childhood and adolescence...|$|E
40|$|We trained {{three groups}} of rats, young (Y; 3 months {{at the start of}} study), middle aged (MA; 15 months), and aged (AG; 22 months), in the serial five-choice serial {{reaction}} time task, a test of attention. There were clear age-related differences in task acquisition: Y acquired the task quicker than MA rats, which learned faster than AG rats. A subgroup of AG rats [AG(I) ] could not reach criterion (> 80 % correct, < 20 % omissions under standard conditions of 0. 5 set stimulus duration, 5 set limited hold). Accordingly, they were tested under conditions of 1 set stimulus duration. Having acquired the task, under standard conditions both MA and AG groups were slower to make a correct response but not to collect the food reward. Furthermore, parameter changes, particularly reductions in stimulus duration and intensity, revealed further age-related changes in accuracy. Following completion of these studies, animals were trained in a simpler one-choice task. Importantly, reducing stimulus duration/intensity in this task revealed no differences between Y and MA/AG groups, although AG(I) rats were impaired. This dissociation between MAlAG impairments in the one- and five-choice task suggests that these animals may show attentional deficits compared with Y rats, which are independant of changes in sensory (<b>visual),</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function,</b> or motivation. Finally, the MA deficit in attention was partially reversed by tacrine pretreatment (3 mglkg). Also scopolamine (0. 01 - 0. 075 mg/ kg) and mecamylamine (0. 3 - 5 mg/kg) pretreatment impaired choice accuracy of MA but not Y rats. Taken together, the drug studies imply that the attentional deficits may at least be partially due to changes in cholinergic function.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increased}} interest in early intervention approaches for children who lack readiness skills for kindergarten. Effectively identifying young children who are potentially at risk will aid in determining early intervention programs. It has been cited in the literature that early intervention is of great value in the prevention and treatment of learning difficulties. In addition, behavioral problems and emotional problems that may arise secondarily to these difficulties may be prevented (Kelly 2 ̆ 6 Peverly, 1992). Although standardized screening tests are often used to identify children at risk for school failure, these measures have produced conflicting evidence in identifying children at risk for failure (Agostin and Bain, 1997). ^ This research study used the Kindergarten Screening Inventory as the measure used to identify children 2 ̆ 7 s skills before they enter kindergarten.

40|$|The {{effects of}} low {{exposure}} to inorganic mercury on psychological performance was investigated: the study groups included eight chronically exposed workers and 20 who were only occasionally exposed. These {{were compared with}} a control group of 22 subjects from the same plant who were not exposed to mercury. All subjects were administered the WHO test battery to detect preclinical signs of central nervous system impairment: the battery includes the Santa Ana (Helsinki version) test, simple reaction time, the Benton test, and the Wechsler digit span and digit symbol. In addition, the Gordon {{test was used to}} study personality profiles and the clinical depression questionnaire. Urinary mercury was used as indicator for internal dose. To this effect, urinary mercury observed in workers examined from 1979 to 1987 was evaluated. Of the pyschic functions explored by behavioural tests, only short term auditory memory was found to be impaired in the chronically exposed workers (p less than 0. 05 compared with the controls). The chronically exposed workers were also found to be more depressed than those in the two other groups. No changes of <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> <b>functions</b> were observed. The personality of the occupationally exposed workers was found to be considerably changed compared with that of the control group. On the basis of the results obtained and in view of urinary mercury mean concentrations in the exposed group which were 30 - 40 micrograms/l over the years, it is suggested that the TLV-TWA for mercury should be lowered to 0. 025 mg/m 3 and that the biological urinary exposure indicator for biological monitoring should be 25 micrograms/l...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Women who {{suffered}} preeclampsia and eclampsia may report subjective cognitive difficulties in daily life, {{the interpretation of}} which is cumbersome, because these are affected by emotional factors. Previous studies only included preeclamptic women investigated shortly after pregnancy. We aimed to determine whether these subjective reports of cognitive difficulty {{could be interpreted as}} reflecting objective cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, cognitive functioning was assessed using standardized neurocognitive tests in both preeclamptic and eclamptic women several years following the index pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Forty-six formerly eclamptic, 51 formerly preeclamptic, and 48 control women who had normotensive pregnancies, age-matched, participated in this study. Average elapsed time since index pregnancy was 7 years. Neurocognitive tests were divided into 6 domains; <b>visual</b> perception, <b>motor</b> <b>functions,</b> working memory, long-term memory, attention, and executive functioning. Subjective cognitive functioning was measured by the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire and anxiety/depression by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Both preeclamptic and eclamptic women performed worse on the <b>motor</b> <b>functions</b> domain (P <. 05), without differences on the other domains. They scored worse on the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (P <. 01), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety (P <. 01), and depression (P <. 05) subscales. CONCLUSION: Women {{who suffered}} eclampsia and/or preeclampsia demonstrate no objective cognitive impairment as compared with controls. Contrary to the well-structured test setting, both groups do report more cognitive failures, which are thought to reflect neurocognitive dysfunction in complex, stressful daily-life situations.

These tests assessed motor performance (Purdue Pegboard test), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson test) and cognitive function (verbal version of Symbol Digit Modalities Test). Adding time since diagnosis for the PD group increased sensitivity to 90. 9 % and specificity to 71. 4 %.

40|$|Background: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a {{surgical}} procedure to remove atherosclerotic plaque {{from one of}} the carotid arteries in patients with severe stenosis. The purpose is to prevent future cerebral ischemic attacks. Whether patients, in addition, improve in cognitive functions and quality of life (QoL) was investigated in this study. Methods: Patients with severe carotid stenosis were assessed on cognitive functions one day before and three months after CEA. The test battery included tests of memory, attention, psychomotor function, and laterality. Besides, the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, the RAND 36 -item Health Survey, and a mood questionnaire were administered. A comparison group was composed of patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery of comparable duration and anesthesia. Results: So far, CEA patients showed significant postoperative cognitive improvement on a few tests, namely of short-term memory (Digit span forward), verbal laterality (Dichotic listening), attentional switching (<b>Visual</b> elevator), <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> (Finger tapping, <b>Motor</b> planning), and a trend for delayed verbal recall (15 Words). Peripheral vascular patients showed slight improvements on tasks of visual memory (Doors B), attention (Trailmaking B, Dichotic listening), and <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> (<b>Motor</b> planning). Concerning QoL, CEA patients showed postoperative improvements in physical functioning, mental health, and health perception, while peripheral vascular patients reported positive changes for physically related scales only. Furthermore, CEA patients noticed less fatigue, anger and tension, but these changes already existed on the day before surgery. Peripheral patients only reported less fatigue. Conclusions: This study suggests that, in addition to its medical aim, CEA improves subjective physical and mental QoL and negative mood states in severe atherosclerotic patients.

Main Outcome Measures: Off-road cognitive, <b>visual,</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>functions,</b> as well as 13 specific driving skills. These skills were categorized into hierarchic clusters of operational, tactical, visuo-integrative, and mixed driving.

Results: Visuospatial function (P=. 002), inhibition (P=. 008), binocular acuity (P=. 04), vertical visual field (P=. 02), and stereopsis (P=. 03) best determined variance in total on-road score (unadjusted R 2 =. 37). Attentional shift (P=. 0004), stereopsis (P=. 007), glare recovery (P=. 047), and use of assistive devices (P=. 03) best predicted the operational cluster (unadjusted R 2 =. 28). Visuospatial function (P=. 002), inhibition (P=. 002), reasoning (P=. 003), binocular acuity (P=. 04), and stereopsis (P=. 005) best determined the tactical cluster (unadjusted R 2 =. 41). The visuo-integrative model (unadjusted R 2 =. 12) comprised binocular acuity (P=. 007) and stereopsis (P=. 045).

NC decreased the firing rate in 60 % of thalamic neurons. This decrease in firing rate was accompanied by a significant {{reduction in the number of}} high threshold bursts. In about 20 % of the neurons NC increased the firing rate. In most cells NC-induced increases in discharge rate could be blocked by the GABAA receptor antagonists bicuculline and SR 95531.

All these peptides inhibited NC-induced changes in firing rate. In addition, in some neurons where NC inhibited firing, [Nphe 1]NC(1 - 13) NH 2 and Ac-RYYRIK-NH 2 elicited per se an increase in firing rate, suggesting the existence of tonic innervation of thalamic neurons by NC-containing fibres.

The mixed evidence from the existing studies has led to contradictions in the literature regarding the bilingual advantage. Moreover, fMRI evidence on the neural basis of interference control mechanisms with the Simon task is limited. Previous work by our team showed that equivalent performance on the Simon task was associated with different activation maps in elderly bilinguals and monolinguals. This study aims {{to provide a more}} in-depth perspective on the neural bases of performance on the Simon task in elderly bilinguals and monolinguals, by adopting a network perspective for the functional connectivity analysis. A node-by-node analysis led to the identification of the specific topology that characterized the bilingual and monolingual functional networks and the degree of connectivity between each node across groups. Results showed greater connectivity in bilinguals in the inferior temporal sulcus, which plays a role in visuospatial processing. On the other hand, in monolinguals, brain areas involved in <b>visual,</b> <b>motor,</b> executive <b>functions</b> and interference control were more connected to resolve the same task. In other words, in comparison to the monolingual brain, the bilingual brain resolves visuospatial interference economically, by allocating fewer and more clustered regions. These results demonstrate a larger global efficiency in task performance in bilinguals as compared to monolinguals. Also, the provided evidence filters out the task-specific so-called bilingual advantage discussed in the literature and posits that bilinguals are strategically more efficient in a given performance than monolinguals, thus enhancing our understanding of successful aging...|$|R

Abnormal MABC- 2 Total or component scores occurred in 23 - 36 % of VP/VLBW children.

5000|$|Cortical {{patterning}} is a {{field of}} developmental neuroscience which aims {{to determine how the}} various functional areas of the cerebral cortex are generated, what size and shape they will be, and how their spatial pattern {{across the surface of the}} cortex is specified. Early brain lesion studies indicated that different parts of the cortex served different cognitive functions, such as <b>visual,</b> somatosensory, and <b>motor</b> <b>functions,</b> beautifully assimilated by Brodmann in 1909. [...] Today the field supports the idea of a 'protomap', which is a molecular pre-pattern of the cortical areas during early embryonic stages. [...] The protomap is a feature of the cortical ventricular zone, which contains the primary stem cells of the cortex known as radial glial cells. A system of signaling centers, positioned strategically at the midline and edges of the cortex, produce secreted signaling proteins that establish concentration gradients in the cortical primordium. [...] This provides positional information for each stem cell, and regulates proliferation, neurogenesis, and areal identity. After the initial establishment of areal identity, axons from the developing thalamus arrive at their correct cortical areal destination through the process of axon guidance and begin to form synapses. Many activity-dependent processes are then thought to play important roles in the maturation of each area.|$|R

The ageing process brings changes in both perceptual and motor abilities, yet little is known about how these changes may affect the ability to accurately interpret other people 2 ̆ 7 s actions. Here we investigated the effect of ageing on the ability to discriminate the weight of objects based on the movements of actors lifting these objects. Stimuli consisted of videos of an actor lifting a small box weighing 0. 05 - 0. 9 kg or a large box weighting 3 - 18 kg. In a four-alternative forced-choice task, younger and older participants reported the perceived weight of the box in each video. Overall, older participants were less sensitive than younger participants in discriminating the perceived weight of lifted boxes, an effect that was especially pronounced in the small box condition. Weight discrimination performance was better for the large box compared to the small box in both groups, due to greater saliency of the visual cues in this condition. These results suggest that older adults may require more salient visual cues to interpret the actions of others accurately. We discuss the potential contribution of age-related changes in <b>visual</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> on the observed effects and suggest that older adults 2 ̆ 7 decline in the sensitivity to subtle visual cues may lead to greater reliance on visual analysis of the observed scene and its semantic contex...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{popularity}} of MRI in clinical settings and the innovative applications in e. g. MRI guided surgery has resulted in more frequent, longer {{and higher levels of}} exposure to the stray magnetic fields for employees. Especially the use of stronger field strengths in MRI has been associated with unwanted sensory stimulation and difficulties in task performance. In experimental studies as described in this thesis we investigated the effects of exposure to MRI-related stray static magnetic fields (SMF) and movement-induced low-frequency time-varying magnetic fields (TVMF) on behavioral changes in cognitive functions and vestibular related functions of postural stability and oculomotor performance. In addition, possible underlying mechanisms have been suggested. In two experimental studies, healthy volunteers were exposed to a 1. 0 Tesla (T) SMF in the stray fields of a 7 T MRI scanner. In some of the exposed conditions an additional TVMF of 2. 4 T/s was initiated before every task by performance of head movements. A broad range of tasks was assessed testing cognitive and vestibular performance. The subjects’ test results were compared to their performance outside the magnetic field (sham condition). Exposure to MRI-related magnetic fields seemed to decrease cognitive and vestibular related performance. In particular domains including attention and concentration, verbal memory and <b>visual</b> (<b>motor)</b> <b>functions,</b> and postural stability have been (repeatedly) identified. An important role of the vestibular system in evoking these effects has been suggested. Therefore, a mediating role for the vestibular system was investigated. Responsiveness of the vestibular system did not modify cognitive and oculomotor test performance upon exposure to MRI-related magnetic fields. However, a weak but significant indication was demonstrated for a modified postural stability by vestibular asymmetry upon exposure. Moreover, we demonstrated that behavioral response patterns on cognitive, postural and oculomotor tasks during exposure to an MRI-related stray magnetic field did not resemble those after direct stimulation of the vestibular organ by galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). Therefore, we cannot confirm nor exclude that the vestibular system plays a (mediating) role in MRI-related magnetic field induced behavioral changes. Several hypotheses for endpoint-specific underlying mechanisms have been generated; magnetic field induced Lorentz forces in the vestibular organ, movement-induced electromagnetic induction when present in the magnetic fields, sensory conflict/weighting theory between received visual and vestibular information, and limited information processing capacity following an overflow of information to be processed. These proposed underlying mechanisms are specific for different behavioral endpoints. In conclusion, the magnitude of the found changes in behavioral performance by magnetic field of 1. 0 T and 2. 4 T/s is small but of serious significance. Given the trend of scanning at ultrahigh field strengths (7 T and higher) exposure of personnel working with and around MRI scanners is supposed to further increase in the coming years. This can have serious consequences for employees, and especially for those employees who need to maintain a high level of precision and concentration e. g. surgeons performing MRI guided operations. Therefore, the knowledge as presented in this thesis should among others be used as a basis for the design of relevant control measures and policies to lower exposure and reduce the occurrence of behavioral changes for individuals employed under these conditions...|$|R

40|$|Visually guided, {{goal-directed}} reaching requires encoding action {{distance and}} direction from attributes of visual landmarks. We identified a cognitive mechanism that seemingly performs <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> extension before action initiation and replicated and extended previous results that identified {{a mechanism for}} <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> mental rotation. We find that humans systematically delay action onset while newly planning increasingly distant arm movements beyond a visual landmark, consistent with an internal representation for <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> extension. Onset times also changed systematically during concurrent mental rotation and <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> extension computations required to process new directions and distances. <b>Visual</b> <b>motor</b> extension associated with reaching slowed when participants needed to Appearance of a visual landmark often triggers a temporally and spatially distributed cascade of preparatory neural and cognitive events leading to purposeful actions. For visually guided reaching, human observers compute a plan incorporating {{the location of the}} landmark into the distance and direction of an action. Evolving behavioral contexts, such as actual or predicted changes in the location of a visual landmark, often require rapid updates to action strategies (for example, Soechting and Lacquaniti, 1983; Port et al., 1997). Proper formulation of these decisions likely involves a precise spatiotemporal sequence of neural (Georgopoulo...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To characterize, {{compare the}} related <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> {{integration}} and handwriting performance of Brazilian students of elementary schools. A total of 50 {{students from the}} 1 st to 5 th grade level of elementary school partici- pated in this study. The students were divided into: Group I (GI) : 10 {{students enrolled in the}} 1 st grade; Group II (GII) : 10 students enrolled in the 2 nd grade; Group III (GIII) : 10 students enrolled in the 3 th grade; Group IV (GIV) : 10 students enrolled in the 4 th grade and Group V (GV) : 10 students enrolled in the 5 th grade. After the sign of consent form by parents, the stu- dents were submitted to the application of <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> integration test and handwriting assessment. Results: The results showed that there was perfor- mance alteration of the GI, GII, GIII, GIV and GV students in <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> integration, <b>visual</b> perception and <b>motor</b> coordination; showed the presence of dysgraphia in all groups; and found that the students of GI and GV were the students with the greatest impairment in <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> integration and in the quality of hand- writing.

Implicit motor imagery ability and <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> imagery ability improved significantly at 6 weeks compared to 3 weeks poststroke. Conclusion. Our study shows that motor imagery can recover in the first weeks after stroke. This indicates that a group of patients who might not be initially selected for mental practice can, still later in the rehabilitation process, participate in mental practice programs. Moreover, our study shows that mental imagery modalities can be differently affected in individual patients and over time...|$|R
40|$|Background: Down's {{syndrome}} {{is one of}} the most common genetic disorders characterized by generalized muscular hypotonia and deficits in motor skills. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of perceptual motor exercises on perceptual <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> and drawing skills of children with Down's syndrome. Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was conducted using an available sample based on single-system design (AB design). The participants in this study were evaluated twice a week in the baseline phase. After core stability assessment, they were trained with perceptual motor exercise in the treatment phase for 1. 5 months every 3 sessions per week for 60 minutes. To investigate the changes in baseline and treatment phases, the C statistic and Bayesian analysis were used. Results: The obtained results revealed that perceptual motor exercises had a moderate to strong effect on perceptual <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> in only one of the participants and had a weak effect on drawing skills in two of the participants, very strong effect in two of the participants and moderate effect in one of the participant and also these exercises had a very strong effect on <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> coordination in four participants and strong to very strong effect in one of them. Conclusion: The findings show that perceptual motor exercises can be an effective intervention to improve visual-motor coordination and subsequently drawing skills in children with Down's syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Many {{athletes with}} an {{anterior}} cruciate ligament tear do not return to their original sport level after reconstruction, in spite of good results on clinical tests. After an {{anterior cruciate ligament}} tear, knee joint proprioception is shown to be decreased. This leads {{to the use of}} compensatory mechanisms, such as cognitive and <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> control, which are not automated. A decrease in dependency on cognitive and <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> control indicates restoration of knee joint proprioception, and thereby functional recovery. Athlete dependency on cognitive and <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> control can be measured by manipulating visual information and cognitive load while athletes are required to complete a motor task. In the current work, participants were required to complete a balance task and a figure-eight sprinting task while visual ability was constrained and a concurrent cognitive task was asked of them. Dependency on cognitive and <b>visual</b> <b>motor</b> control of healthy athletes was shown to be measurable for both motor tasks.

40|$|Introduction: In {{the early}} years of {{schooling}} fine and gross <b>motor</b> <b>functioning</b> is involved in overall child’s well-being influencing his/her general participation in play, social acceptance from peers, and willingness to take part in social activities in general. Moreover, recent longitudinal studies have shown that fine motor skills in kindergarten children are a predictive factor for later school achievement. The present study examined the similarity of parents and teachers ratings on kindergarteners’ <b>motor</b> <b>functioning</b> with children’s actual motor tasks performancesMethod: A sample of 57 children attending the final year of kindergarten (M= 65. 42; SD= 4. 5; range= 57 to 78 months) completed 8 motor tasks of the Movement Assessment Battery of Children (MABC- 2; age band 3 - 6) and the <b>Visual</b> <b>Motor</b> Integration Test (VMI). Parents’ and teachers’ estimations of children’s motor developmental status were obtained using the Motor Skill Scale of the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS-II). Paired-samples t-tests were used to assess parents’ and teachers’ differences in evaluating children’s fine and gross motor abilities, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to investigate informants’ ability to rate kindergarteners’ <b>motor</b> <b>functioning.</b> Results: Consistent with most previous studies, our results indicated that parents estimated their children’s motor development higher than teachers in the Motor Skills Scale (t(56) = 5. 397, p=. 0001) and in the Fine Motor Subscale (t(56) = 5. 139, p=. 0001) of the VABS-II. Teachers’ ratings of children’s motor skills measured with VABS-II were positively correlated with fine motor tasks performances at the MABC- 2 (r’s range from. 28 to. 54), whereas parents’ estimations of kindergarteners’ motor development were found positively correlated with children’s manual dexterity performances (r’s range from. 28 to. 34). Gross motor skills assessed with ball and balance tasks of the MABC- 2 showed weak positive correlations both with parents’ and with teachers’ estimations of children’s <b>motor</b> <b>functioning</b> with the VABS- 2. No statistically significant relationships have been found between VMI Test scores with parents’ and teachers’ estimations of children’s fine motor development. Conclusions: The results highlight that both parents’ and teachers’ estimations of children gross motor development were not associated with kindergarteners’ motor tasks performances, whereas familial and non familial caregivers’ ratings {{have been found to be}} reliable regarding children’s fine motor developmental status. Considering the fact that developmental psychology relies on data collected from multiple informants such as parents and teachers, further attention should be paid to the ability to observe and assess children’s gross <b>motor</b> <b>functioning...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rebuilding {{the damaged}} <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> caused by {{spinal cord injury}} {{is one of the}} most serious {{challenges}} in clinical neuroscience. The function of the neural pathway under the damaged sites can be rebuilt using functional electrical stimulation technology. In this study, the locations of <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> sites in the lumbosacral spinal cord were determined with functional electrical stimulation technology. A three-dimensional map of the lumbosacral spinal cord comprising the relationship between the <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> sites and the corresponding muscle was drawn. Based on the individual experimental parameters and normalized coordinates of the <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> sites, the <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> sites that control a certain muscle were calculated. Phasing pulse sequences were delivered to the determined <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> sites in the spinal cord and hip extension, hip flexion, ankle plantarflexion, and ankle dorsiflexion movements were successfully achieved. The results show that the map of the spinal cord <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> sites was valid. This map can provide guidance for the selection of electrical stimulation sites during the rebuilding of <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> after spinal cord injury...|$|R
