50|$|A <b>vision</b> <b>chip</b> is an {{integrated}} circuit having both image sensing circuitry and image processing circuitry {{on the same}} die. The image sensing circuitry may be implemented using charge-coupled devices, active pixel sensor circuits, or any other light sensing mechanism. The image processing circuitry may be implemented using analog, digital, or mixed signal (analog and digital) circuitry. One area of research {{is the use of}} neuromorphic engineering techniques to implement processing circuits inspired by biological neural systems. The output of a <b>vision</b> <b>chip</b> is generally a partially processed image or a high level information signal revealing something about the observed scene. Although there is no standard definition of a <b>vision</b> <b>chip,</b> the processing performed may comprise anything from processing individual pixel values to performing complex image processing functions and outputting a single value or yes/no signal based on the scene.|$|E

50|$|An {{optical flow}} sensor is a vision sensor capable of {{measuring}} optical flow or visual motion and outputting a measurement based on optical flow. Various configurations of optical flow sensors exist. One configuration {{is an image}} sensor chip connected to a processor programmed to run an optical flow algorithm. Another configuration uses a <b>vision</b> <b>chip,</b> which is an integrated circuit having both the image sensor and the processor on the same die, allowing for a compact implementation. An {{example of this is}} a generic optical mouse sensor used in an optical mouse. In some cases the processing circuitry may be implemented using analog or mixed-signal circuits to enable fast optical flow computation using minimal current consumption. One area of contemporary research is the use of neuromorphic engineering techniques to implement circuits that respond to optical flow, and thus may be appropriate for use in an optical flow sensor. Such circuits may draw inspiration from biological neural circuitry that similarly responds to optical flow.|$|E

Hotz has built a working self-driving 2016 Acura ILX, which he demonstrated on the I-280 in a video. The video prompted a cease and desist letter from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Hotz wants to sell his technology to Tesla Motors and he has reported to have talked to CEO Elon Musk and is working on proving his technology to be superior to that of Mobileye, which, at the time, was used for Tesla Autopilot. [...] Hotz claims that Musk offered him $12 million (minus $1 million for every month it took Hotz to work on the task) to create a driving system that could replace the MobilEye solution currently used in Tesla vehicles.Tesla later released a statement on their website citing corrections to the Bloomberg article, stressing that their autopilot system was developed in-house, with a <b>vision</b> <b>chip</b> component from MobilEye, instead of one separate autopilot system manufactured by MobilEye, as suggested by Hotz in the interview with Bloomberg.
