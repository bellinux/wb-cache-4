We observed two angiographic {{changes in the}} diameter of cor-onary arteries: 1) spasm, which was characterized by occlusion or marked (> 85 %) focal or diffuse vessel narrowing, or 2) relatively mild and diffuse vessel narrowing, which was interpreted as the normal phar-macologic response to the drug. Serial bolus injections of 0. 05 mg, 0. 10 mg and 0. 25 mg of ergonovine maleate produced diffuse narrowing of the diameter of coronary arteries of 10 ± 1. 5 %, 16 ± 1. 4 % and 20 ± 1. 3 % (mean ± SEM), respectively, in the 72 patients with anginal syndromes who did not develop coronary spasm. The degree of coronary arterial narrowing was the same in heart transplant recipients and in patients with nor-mally innervated hearts who did not develop coronary spasm.

Methods and resultsConsecutive 231 patients with documented coronary vasospasm by ergonovine provocation test but with a normal-appearing coronary angiogram were divided into two groups, <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> (VAP) patients (group I; n= 202, 49. 5 ± 11. 1 years) and AMI patients (group II; n= 29, 47. 4 ± 11. 2 years). Matched control patients were 84 AMI patients with significant stenosis (> 50 %) (group III; n= 84, 61. 2 ± 11. 8 years). Although, the incidence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking were lower in group I than in group III, there was no difference between group II and III (diabetes, 7. 9 % vs. 13. 8 % vs. 29. 8 %; hypertension, 19. 8 % vs. 24. 1 % vs. 41. 7 %; smoking 48 % vs. 48. 3 % vs. 61. 9 %; respectively, p< 0. 01). Measured high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and fibrinogen level were higher (respectively, p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001) in groups II and III (group II, 1. 88 ± 2. 9 mg/dl, 317. 5 ± 51. 2 mg/dl; group III, 2. 92 ± 3. 9 mg/dl, 326. 8 ± 107. 7 mg/dl) than those in group I (0. 68 ± 1. 5 mg/dl, 263. 2 ± 70. 3 mg/dl).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether coronary vasospasm in patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> (VAP) may produce focal organic lesions at the site of vasospasm that would contribute to disease progression. Background. Recent clinical angiographic and experimental studies have demonstrated the potential role of vasospasm in the worsening of organic coronary stenosis. Methods. We studied histologically the coronary plaques obtained at atherectomy in 202 patients with moderate to severe coronary stenosis. This population included 22 patients with VAP, 100 patients with chronic stable angina and 80 patients with restenosis following angioplasty or atherectomy. Diagnosis of VAP was based on both the clinical feature of angina at rest associated with ST elevation and a positive response to acetylcholine provocation test. Results. The most common histological appearance in 92 % of patients with stable angina was hypocellular fibroatheromatous plaques, whereas neointimal hyperplasia was the characteristic feature of the plaque observed in 90 % of patients with restenosis. The coronary specimens at the site of spasm in 15 of the 22 patients (68 %) with VAP demonstrated intimal injuries such as neointimal hyperplasia (15), thrombus formation (2), and intimal hemorrhage (3). Neointimal hyperplasia was significantly more common in the patients with VAP as compared with those with stable angina (68 % vs. 8 %; p < 0. 0001). A rapid progression of organic stenosis within three years was angiographically found in 5 of the 22 patients with variant angina. In all five cases, neointimal hyperplasia was the main contributor to the worsening of the organic lesion at the site of spasm. These histological findings in patients with VAP extremely resembled those in restenosis. Except for vasospasm, no factors significantly predicted the presence of neointimal formations in primary coronary lesions. Conclusions. Coronary vasospasm may provoke vascular injury that leads to the formation of neointima in VAP patients similar to that seen with restenosis. Coronary spasm may thus {{play a key role in}} the rapid coronary stenosis progression in certain patients with VAP...|$|E

40|$|Background. A <b>variant</b> form of <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> (VAP) {{is caused}} by {{coronary}} vessel spasm and occures in patients with and without varying degrees of obstructive coronary artery disease. Although the prognosis of VAP without significant organic stenosis is generally good, multivessel spasm {{is associated with a}} high risk of life-threatening abnormalities of rhythm and conduction. Patient and methods. We describe a patient who presented with prolonged chest pain, associated with hypotension, lost of consciousness, complete AV block and widespread ST segment elevations consistent with inferoanterior acute myocardial infarction. Urgent selective coronary angiography revealed spasms in right coronary artery and in left circumflex artery that were relieved by intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin. All coronary arteries were otherwise patient, without signs of atherosclerosis. The patient was treated with diltiazem and nitrates. She made a complete recovery and resumed her normal activities. Conclusions. Simultaneous multiple spasms of native coronary arteries represent a rare syndrome characterized by significantly higher incidence of potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. Less commonly, prolonged coronary spasm may mimic acute myocardial infarction. Modern management of acute coronary syndromes, including urgent coronarography, enables a prompt differentiation between prolonged coronary spasm and atherosclerotic coronary disease, warranting different treatment strategies. Medical treatment with nitrates and calcium channel blockers in most cases prevents recurrence of vasospasms and arrhythmias. </p...|$|R

Methods In our Swedish prospective cohort study of 1676 randomly selected subjects followed-up for 26 years. In 1985 all subjects underwent clinical oral examination and answered a questionnaire assessing background variables such as socio-economic status and pack-years of smoking. By {{using data from the}} Center of Epidemiology, Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden we analyzed the association of oral health parameters with the prevalence of in-hospital verified <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> classified according to the WHO International Classification of Diseases, using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 1676 subjects, 51 (28 women/ 23 men) had been diagnosed with <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> at a mean age of 59. 8 +/- 2. 9 years. No difference was observed in age and gender between patients with <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> and subjects without. Neither was there any difference in education level and smoking habits (in pack years), Gingival index and Plaque index between the groups. <b>Angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> patients had significantly more often their first maxillary molar tooth extracted (d. 16) than the other subjects (p = 0. 02). Patients also showed significantly higher dental calculus index values than the subjects without <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> (p = 0. 01). Multiple regression analysis showed odds ratio 2. 21 (95 % confidence interval 1. 17 - 4. 17) in the association between high calculus index and <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> (p = 0. 015). Conclusion Our study hypothesis was confirmed by showing {{for the first time that}} high dental calculus score indeed associated with the incidence of <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> in this cohort study...|$|R

40|$|A {{patient with}} Shy-Drager {{syndrome}} who presented with severe <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> is described. Special investigations of his {{autonomic nervous system}} showed sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction with supersensitive end-organ response. Sympathetic dysfunction manifested as labile hypertension, severe postural hypotension, and inadequate heart rate response to atropine and the Valsalva manoeuvre. These changes in blood pressure were accompanied by severe disabling <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris.</b> Selective coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries. It is suggested that <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> resulted from the inadequate circulatory response and is another clinical manifestation of the Shy-Drager syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Unstable <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> is a {{clinical}} syndrome with multiple underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. This presentation {{is concerned with}} primary <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> exclusively. In {{the majority of cases}} a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and an intracoronary thrombus are responsible for instable angina. The practitioner's role is to identify those patients who will develop complications with the aid of clinical parameters. Prinzmetal's angina is also instable, occurs at rest and leads to ST-segment elevation. It is most likely due to coronary spasm, developing in disease-free and atherosclerotic coronary segments alike. This <b>variant</b> of unstable <b>angina</b> is treated most successfully with calcium antagonists. The recognition of the responsible pathophysiologic mechanism permits adjustment of treatment of every patient taking into consideration the seriousness of his prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{interest}} in silent angina deals {{in a sense}} with a double unknown since the pathogenesis of <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> remains unexplained. In this report, we present evidence from two human postmortem studies and from experiments conducted in eleven awake dogs which supports a hypothesis that <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> may be mediated by an intracardiac chemoreceptor receiving its primary blood supply from the proximal coronary circulation. The clinical events and the postmortem findings in both human subjects supported the hypothesis. The somatic responses observed in the awake dogs resembled those of humans with <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris.</b> Because the cardiogenic hypertensive chemoreflex in dogs is maximally elicited by serotonin normally carried by the platelets and released during their aggregation, <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> as well as numerous other clinical events observed during acute myocardial ischemic episodes could be similarly explained as consequences of the activation of a coronary chemoreceptor in man. Thus, at least some and possibly most examples of <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> may be mediated via the coronary chemoreceptor and vagal afferents to the brain, and injury or destruction of this chemoreceptor could interdict the perception of anginal pain...|$|R
