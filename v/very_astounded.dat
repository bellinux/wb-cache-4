60|$|So that, you see, out of somewhere about 120 {{orders of}} animals, taking them altogether, you will not, {{at the outside}} estimate, find above ten or a dozen extinct. Summing up all the order of animals which have left remains behind them, you will not find above ten or a dozen which cannot be {{arranged}} {{with those of the}} present day; that is to say, that the difference does not amount to much more than ten per cent.: and the proportion of extinct orders of plants is still smaller. I think that that is a <b>very</b> <b>astounding</b> a most astonishing fact: seeing the enormous epochs of time which have elapsed during the constitution of {{the surface of the earth}} as it at present exists, it is, indeed, a most astounding thing that the proportion of extinct ordinal types should be so exceedingly small.|$|R
60|$|The Sultan was <b>very</b> much <b>astounded,</b> {{and wished}} {{to see this}} marvel for himself. So he sent for the {{fisherman}}, {{and asked him to}} procure four more fish. The fisherman asked for three days, which were granted, and he then cast his nets in the lake, and again caught four different coloured fish. The sultan was delighted to see he had got them, and gave him again four hundred gold pieces.|$|R

"The surprise, {{it is easy}} to understand, would {{arise from}} the {{inability}} to interpret aright the signs which experience (a thing mysterious in itself) makes to our understanding and emotions. For it is never more than that. Our experience never gets into our blood and bones. It always remains outside of us. That's why we look with wonder at the past. And this persists even when from practice and through growing callousness of fibre we come to the point when nothing that we meet in that rapid blinking stumble across a flick of sunshine--which our life is--nothing, I say, which we run against surprises us any more. Not at the time, I mean. If, later on, we recover the faculty with some such exclamation: `Well! Well! I'll be hanged if I ever...' it is probably because this very thing {{that there should be a}} past to look back upon, other people's, is <b>very</b> <b>astounding</b> in itself when one has the time, a fleeting and immense instant to think of it..." ...|$|R
6000|$|And now we won't {{be serious}} any longer. Dear mother was <b>very</b> much <b>astounded</b> by your tumultuous midnight arrival, and equally {{precipitate}} departure next morning. Dear old boy, {{it was so}} nice of you! But you won't ever have horrid black humours and think miserable things any more, will you? But if you must have dark days, now is your time, for I can't possibly permit any after the 30th.-- Ever your own ...|$|R
60|$|Credited {{with every}} excess by the tongue of his stepmother, too active- minded not {{to indulge in}} freakish sports and {{experiments}} in life <b>very</b> <b>astounding</b> to commonplace minds, sometimes when in dire distress even helping himself to his unpaid allowance from his father's mails, and always with buoyant high spirits and unfailing drollery that scandalized the grave seniors of the Court, there is full proof that Prince Hal ever kept free from the gross vices which a later age has fancied inseparably connected with his frolics; and though always in disgrace, the vexation of the Court, and a by-word for mirth, he was true to the grand ideal he was waiting to accomplish, and never dimmed the purity and loftiness of his aim. That little band of princely youths, who sported, studied, laughed, sang, and schemed in the glades of Windsor, were strangely brought together--the captive exiled King, the disinherited heir of the realm, and {{the sons of the}} monarch who held the one in durance and occupied the throne of the other; and yet their affection had all the frank delight of youthful friendship. The younger lads were in more favour with their father than was the elder. Thomas was sometimes preferred to him in a mortifying manner, John's grave, quiet nature prevented him from ever incurring displeasure, and Humfrey was the spoilt pet of the family; but nothing could lessen Harry's large-minded love of his brothers; and he was the idol and hero of the whole young party, who implicitly believed in his mighty destinies as a renovator of the world, the deliverer of Jerusalem, and restorer of the unity and purity of the Church.|$|R
6000|$|Mr Pinch, however, was so <b>very</b> much <b>astounded</b> by this (to him) inexplicable deportment, that he at once openly {{declared}} {{there must}} be some mistake, and that he had been entrusted with no commission whatever having any reference to Mr Tigg or to his friend, either. Mr Tigg received this declaration with a grave request that Mr Pinch would have the goodness to make it again; and on Tom's repeating it in a still more emphatic and unmistakable manner, checked it off, sentence for sentence, by nodding his head solemnly at the end of each. When it had come to a close for the second time, Mr Tigg sat himself down in a chair and addressed the young men as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|Since {{this class}} was not {{apparent}} in masses {{in the relatively}} static, relatively less eliminatory, society of former times, its appearance {{has given rise to}} a belief that the least desirable section of the community has become unprecedentedly prolific, that there is now going on a [...] "Rapid Multiplication of the Unfit." [...] But sooner or later, as every East End doctor knows, the ways of the social abyss lead to death, the premature death of the individual, or death through the death or infertility of the individual's stunted offspring, or death through that extinction which moral perversion involves. It is a recruited class, not a breeding multitude. Whatever expedients may be resorted to, to mitigate or conceal the essential nature of this social element, it remains in its essence wherever social progress is being made, the contingent of death. Humanity has set out {{in the direction of a}} more complex and exacting organization, and until, by a foresight to me at least inconceivable, it can prevent the birth of just all the inadaptable, useless, or merely unnecessary creatures in each generation, there must needs continue to be, in greater or less amount, this individually futile struggle beneath the feet of the race; somewhere and in some form there must still persist those essentials that now take shape as the slum, the prison, and the asylum. All over the world, as the railway network has spread, in Chicago and New York as vividly as in London or Paris, the commencement of the new movement has been marked at once by the appearance of this bulky irremovable excretion, the appearance of these gall stones of vicious, helpless, and pauper masses. There seems every reason to suppose that this phenomenon of unemployed citizens, who are, in fact, unemployable, will remain present as a class, perishing individually and individually renewed, so long as civilization remains progressive and experimental upon its present lines. Their drowning existences may be utilized, the crude hardship of their lot may be concealed or mitigated,[24] they may react upon the social fabric that is attempting to eliminate them, in <b>very</b> <b>astounding</b> ways, but their presence and their individual doom, it seems to me, will be unavoidable--at any rate, for many generations of men. They are an integral part of this physiological process of mechanical progress, as inevitable in the social body as are waste matters and disintegrating cells in the body of an active and healthy man.|$|R
6000|$|I {{looked into}} this tree and that, {{suddenly}} {{to have my}} gaze arrested by a threshing commotion in {{the very top of}} a lofty spruce. I saw a dark form moving against a background of blue sky. Instantly I thought it must be a lynx and was about to raise my rifle when a voice as from the <b>very</b> clouds utterly <b>astounded</b> me. I gasped in my astonishment. Was I dreaming? But violent threshings and whacks from the tree-top absolutely assured me that I was neither dreaming nor out of my head. [...] "I get you--whee!" [...] shouted the voice. There was a man up in the swaying top of that spruce and he was no other than Takahashi. For a moment I could not find my voice. Then I shouted: ...|$|R
