5|$|In 1973, the tambalacoque, {{also known}} as the dodo tree, was thought to be dying out on Mauritius, to which it is endemic. There were {{supposedly}} only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old. Stanley Temple hypothesised that it depended on the dodo for its propagation, and that its seeds would germinate only after passing through the bird's digestive tract. He claimed that the tambalacoque was now nearly coextinct because of the disappearance of the dodo. Temple overlooked reports from the 1940s that found that tambalacoque seeds germinated, albeit very rarely, without being abraded during digestion. Others have contested his hypothesis and suggested that the decline of the tree was exaggerated, or seeds were also distributed by other extinct animals such as Cylindraspis tortoises, fruit bats or the broad-billed parrot. According to Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke, two experts in the ecology of the Mascarene Islands, the tree, while rare, has germinated since the demise of the dodo and numbers several hundred, not 13 as claimed by Temple, hence discrediting Temple's <b>view</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the dodo and the tree's sole survival relationship.|$|E

500|$|Italy Film {{acquired}} the rights from Diaboliks publisher Astorina for 20 million lire, and proposed a distribution deal with Dino De Laurentiis. This deal would involve 100 million lire in advance, {{in exchange for}} the distribution rights for the film in perpetuity. De Laurentiis advanced 70 million lire, and put together a co-production deal between Italy, France (Les Films Marceau-Cocinor), and Spain (A.S. Film Produccion and Impala). The first drafts of the film were written by comic book writers Pier Carpi and Corrado Farina, who also worked in television advertising. These drafts were later revised by screenwriters Giampiero Bona and Fabrizio Onofri, who were told to tone down the violence. Onofri and Bona's screenplay also added an emphasis on comedy that was present in the Fantomas films. The film was initially going to be shot by British director Seth Holt, with French actor Jean Sorel chosen to play Diabolik. Other roles included Elsa Martinelli as Eva Kant and George Raft as Diabolik's enemy, Richness. Principal photography began on September 20, 1965, in Malaga, Spain, but halted when Raft became sick on set and was replaced with Gilbert Roland. The film finished shooting on November 13. After viewing Holt's footage, De Laurentiis temporarily aborted the film's production, stating that the footage shot [...] "was of a level so low, both from an artistic and commercial point of <b>view,</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> make us clearly understand that to continue on that path meant heading toward disaster." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gary Chan has {{commented that}} if a {{statement}} is only made to {{a small group of}} people, the confidence of the public at large in the administration of justice may not be shaken.

2500|$|The ethno-linguistic {{definition}} {{is the most}} prominent and accepted <b>view</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> who {{is and is not}} a Pashtun. Generally, this most common view holds that Pashtuns are defined within the parameters of having mainly eastern Iranian ethnic origins, sharing a common language, culture and history, living in relatively close geographic proximity to each other, and acknowledging each other as kinsmen. Thus, tribes that speak disparate yet mutually intelligible dialects of Pashto acknowledge each other as ethnic Pashtuns and even subscribe to certain dialects as [...] "proper", such as the Pukhto spoken by the Yousafzais in Peshawar and the Pashto spoken by the Durranis in Kandahar. These criteria tend to be used by most Pashtuns in Pakistan and Afghanistan.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, in Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon {{thought that}} there was a real {{difference}} between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, suspicion suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. Reasonable suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, likelihood points towards something being likely, and real suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue {{is the degree to which}} a particular event is not likely or possible. Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in Gough and Phang J.C. in Tang Kin Hwa in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was [...] "a very significant point of departure". The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice. As of September 2011, the Court of Appeal of Singapore had not yet expressed a <b>view</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> whether the position taken in Tang Kin Hwa or Shankar Alan is preferable.|$|E
