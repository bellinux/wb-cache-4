40|$|The {{effects of}} a single oral dose of the {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibitor <b>velnacrine</b> maleate on word and object recognition memory and regional uptake of 99 mTc-exametazime were examined in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Word recognition memory was marginally improved 2 h after 75 mg <b>velnacrine.</b> With the same dose of <b>velnacrine</b> a relative increase in superior frontal uptake of 99 mTc-exametazime was shown with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This suggests increased regional perfusion and metabolism {{as a consequence of}} cholinergic stimulation. The effect did not co-vary with the degree of memory improvement, but, instead, more cognitively impaired patients showed a greater increase in tracer uptake after <b>velnacrine,</b> suggesting cholinergic hypersensitivity in the brains of Alzheimer patients...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest {{cause of}} {{dementia}} affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in relevant {{parts of the}} brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. <b>Velnacrine</b> is a derivative of tacrine. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of <b>velnacrine</b> for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. SEARCH STRATEGY: The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 8 January 2004 using the terms velnacr* and 'HP 029 '. The CDCIG SR is regularly updated and contains records from all major health care databases and a great many ongoing trial databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials in which treatment with <b>velnacrine</b> was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for more than two weeks and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One reviewer (JSB) applied study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials, involving 899 participants, were included. Cutler 1990 reported only the adverse events, and omitted the results for the placebo group. Medication was stopped for all in the highest dose group after the fourth day because one member suffered a tonic seizure. It is not possible to report any comparisons with placebo. Antuono 1995 reported benefit for <b>velnacrine</b> at endpoint for the CGI-C, and the Physical Self-maintenance Scale (PGIR), but not for the Carers Assessment of Time Activity (CATS). These results could not be checked because the relevant information was not reported, and we cannot assess the effect on the results of the higher number of non-completers from the <b>velnacrine</b> group. Treatment was discontinued because of safety reasons in 135 patients, mostly due to an abnormal liver function tests. There was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the combined treatment group for the number with an abnormal liver function test before the end of treatment at 24 weeks [105 / 297 vs 4 / 152, OR = 20. 23, 95 % CI 7. 29 to 56. 18, p< 0. 00001]. There was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the combined treatment group for the number of withdrawals before the end of treatment at 24 weeks [130 / 297 vs 39 / 152, OR = 2. 26, 95 % CI 1. 47 to 3. 47, p= 0. 0002]. Results are available for the dose replication phases of Zemlan 1996 a and Zemlan 1996 b. All the patients had taken <b>velnacrine</b> within two weeks prior to this phase and were identified as responders to <b>velnacrine</b> defined by improvement on the ADAS-Cog. Both studies reported a significant benefit for <b>velnacrine</b> compared with placebo for the ADAS-cog, but the results could not be checked because the relevant information was not reported. Neither study reported any benefit for <b>velnacrine</b> for the other efficacy measures. There was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the treatment group for the number with elevated liver transaminases before the end of treatment at 6 weeks [45 / 153 vs 29 / 156, OR = 1. 82, 95 % CI 1. 07 to 3. 11, p= 0. 03]. There was a significant difference in favour of placebo compared with the treatment group for the number of withdrawals before the end of treatment at 6 weeks [68 / 211 vs 47 / 215, OR = 1. 70, 95 % CI 1. 10 to 2. 62, p= 0. 02]. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: There has been no research into the use of <b>velnacrine</b> as a cognitive enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease since 1994. The FDA peripheral and CNS drug advisory board voted unanimously against recommending approval. This review shows the toxic nature of <b>velnacrine,</b> and provides no evidence of efficacy. There are no grounds for further research into <b>velnacrine...</b>|$|E

(3) : triclinic, P 1 -, a = 7. 349 (2), b = 9. 417 (3), c = 12. 557 (4) angstrom, alpha = 109. 62 (2), beta = 98. 12 (2), gamma = 101. 18 (2) -degrees. (4) : monoclinic, P 2 (1) /n, a = 8. 513 (6), b = 18. 74 (1), c = 13. 401 (6) angstrom, beta = 91. 21 (5) -degrees. Final R factors for compounds (1) -(4) are 0. 047, 0. 057, 0. 057, 0. 11, respectively. The overall {{arrangement of the}} common aminotetrahydroacridine skeleton looks similar in all derivatives. However, whereas enantiomerization of the unsubstituted cyclohexenyl rings occurs in (1) and (2), only quasi-axially hydroxyl substituted diastereomers are found for (3) and (4). This is presumably due to the different propensities for hydrogen bonding of axially vs. equatorially disposed hydroxyl groups with the hydrogenmaleate anions. Empirical and semiempirical calculations were performed to examine the conformational behavior of the four compounds, both in vacuo and in solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} tacrine (9 -amino- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroacridine), <b>velnacrine</b> (HP 029, 9 -amino- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroacridin- 1 -ol maleate), {{suronacrine}} (HP 128, 9 -benzylamino- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroacridin- 1 -ol maleate), and 3, 4 -diaminopyridine on neuromuscular transmission were compared on isolated nerve-muscle preparations. 2. Tacrine, HP 029, and 3, 4 -diaminopyridine augmented responses of chick biventer cervicis preparations to nerve stimulation, with tacrine and HP 029 increasing responses to exogenously applied acetylcholine. HP 128 blocked responses to nerve stimulation and to carbachol, but increased responses to acetylcholine. 3. In mouse diaphragm preparations that were partially paralysed by tubocurarine or low calcium solutions, tacrine, HP 029, and 3, 4 -diaminopyridine reversed the twitch block. HP 128 deepened the block. 4. In mouse triangularis sterni preparations, tacrine and HP 029 prolonged the decay phase of endplate potentials and miniature endplate potentials, {{but had no}} effect on quantal content at 36 degrees C; above 10 microM, they reduced endplate potential amplitude. 3, 4 -Diaminopyridine increased quantal content without affecting the time course of the endplate potentials. HP 128 (1 - 10 microM) {{had no effect on}} amplitude or time course of endplate potentials, but reduced their amplitude at higher concentrations. 5. Extracellular recording of nerve terminal currents from triangularis sterni preparations revealed that 3, 4 -diaminopyridine and HP 128 had a selective blocking action on the waveform associated with K+ currents, tacrine reduced and prolonged the K(+) -related waveform, and HP 029 had nonselective blocking actions only seen at high concentrations. 6. Tacrine and HP 029 behave predominantly as anticholinesterase agents, while HP 128 has weaker anticholinesterase actions that are masked by cholinoceptor blockade. Tacrine and HP 128, but not HP 029, have some blocking actions on K+ currents of mouse motor nerve terminals...|$|E
