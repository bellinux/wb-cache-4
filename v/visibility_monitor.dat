40|$|Dramatic {{visibility}} {{reduction in}} the Paso del Norte Airshed (PdNA) region occurs frequently in winter, particularly during inversions and severe sandstorms. A novel methodology to determine and quantify visual deterioration of a scenic vista has been developed and presented in this paper. Using this technique, {{we have found that}} the image quality is reproducible and useful for quantitative analysis of visibility conditions in the PdNA. Regions of Interest (ROI) were selected in images along viewing paths of interest and values for a contrast variable of interest, typically the Coefficient of Variation (CV) or Contrast Ratio (CR) for discrete targets, were computed. Both these indices are bounded at zero and one and are scaled to the “clean day” maxima for a given date, time, and selected viewing path. This produces a relative visibility index for various view paths. With the siting of a Belfort (6230 A) <b>visibility</b> <b>monitor</b> at a central location in the PdNA, it has been possible to initiate contrast analysis of various targets in current and archived camera images obtained near this monitor.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{application}} of satellite data to the evaluation of aerosol extinction and visibility, for {{a better understanding of}} the spatio-temporal variation of local air quality in urban areas. A new analytical model based on aerosol microphysics and non-linear exponential fitting was applied to the analysis of aerosol extinction using aerosol optical thickness (AOT, τa) data retrieved from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), over one of the largest global megacities: Seoul, Korea. The relationship between the MODIS τa and ground-based aerosol measurements of particulate matter mass concentration, extinction, and surface visibility was assessed over Seoul, Korea, during eight intensive observation periods in 2007 – 2009. The results clearly demonstrate that satellite-derived τa is a good surrogate for monitoring aerosol extinction and visibility over this study area. In particular, it is found that MODIS-estimated visibility values have a closer relation to the observed values than traditionally assumed Koschemeider's relation.

A new algorithm at 10 -km resolution developed by Kim (JGR, 2007) has recently been tried out. The performance of the three algorithms in retrieving AOD near the south China coast is studied in this paper by comparing their outputs with the measurements of a hand-held sun photometer at the Hong Kong International Airport.

The slope of the best-fit straight line for the data points between the AOD outputs of Kim’s algorithm and the sun photometer measurements is the closest to unity and the correlation coefficient is high (above 0. 9). Moreover, the AOD values so determined have good correlation with the AERONET AOD data.

The supply chain strategic management as a simultaneous local and global value chain is a collaborative/cooperative organization of stakeholders, many times in co-opetition, to perform a service to the customers respecting the time, place, price and quality levels. The transportation, like other logistics operations must add value, which is achieved in this case through compression lead times and order fulfillments.

40|$|Hong Kong's surface {{visibility}} has decreased {{in recent years}} due to air pollution from rapid social and economic development in the region. In addition to deteriorating health standards, reduced visibility disrupts routine civil and public operations, most notably transportation and aviation. Regional estimates of visibility solved operationally using available ground and satellite-based estimates of aerosol optical properties and vertical distribution may prove more effective than standard reliance on a few existing surface <b>visibility</b> <b>monitoring</b> stations. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} such satellite measurements correlate well with near-surface optical properties, despite these sensors do not consider range-resolved information and indirect parameterizations necessary to solve relevant parameters. By expanding such analysis to include vertically resolved aerosol profile information from an autonomous ground-based lidar instrument, this work develops six models for automated assessment of {{surface visibility}}. Regional visibility is estimated using co-incident ground-based lidar, sun photometer, visibility meter, and MODerate-resolution maging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth data sets. Using a 355 nm extinction coefficient profile solved from the lidar, MODIS AOD (aerosol optical depth) is scaled down to the surface to generate a regional composite depiction of surface visibility. These results demonstrate the potential for applying passive satellite depictions of broad-scale aerosol optical properties together with a ground-based surface lidar and zenith-viewing sun photometer for improving quantitative assessments of visibility in a city such as Hong Kong. The study presents methods to estimate surface level visibility using remote sensing techniques, thus reducing the cost and effort required to estimate visibility at regional level. This helps to address environmental and health effects of ambient air pollution related to visibility for areas with no existing air quality monitoring stations. Policy regulation and hazard assessments impacting transportation and navigation can be improved by integrating the remotely estimated surface visibility with a real-time environmental data network.

40|$|Different {{aspects of}} {{visibility}} degradation problems in Brisbane were investigated through concurrent <b>visibility</b> <b>monitoring</b> and aerosol sampling programs {{carried out in}} 1995. The relationship between the light extinction coefficients and aerosol mass/composition was derived by using multiple linear regression techniques. The visibility properties at different sites in Brisbane {{were found to be}} correlated with each other on a daily basis, but not correlated with each other hour by hour. The cause of scattering of light by moisture (bsw) was due to sulphate particles which shift to a larger size under high-humidity conditions. The scattering of light by particulate matter (bsp) was found to be highly correlated with the mass of fine aerosols, in particular the mass of fine soot, sulphate and non-soil K. For the period studied, on average, the total light extinction coefficient (bext) at five sites in Brisbane was 0. 65 ױ 0 - 4 m- 1, considerably smaller than those values found in other Australian and overseas cities. On average, the major component of bext is bsp (49 % of bext), followed by bap (the absorption of light, mainly by fine soot particles, 28 %), bsg (Rayleigh scattering, 20 %) and bsw (3 %). The absorption of light by NO 2 (bag) is expected to contribute less than 5 % of bext. On average, the percentage contribution of the visibility degrading species to bext (excluding bag) were: soot (53 %), sulphate (21 %), Rayleigh scattering (20 %), non-soil K (2 %) and humidity (3 %).
