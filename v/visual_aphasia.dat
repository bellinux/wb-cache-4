40|$|The {{writing and}} reading {{disorders}} in stroke patients (alexias, agraphias and acalculias) are more frequent than verified in routine exam, {{not only in}} the less developed but also in large neurological departments. Alexia is an acquired type of sensory aphasia where damage to the brain causes a patient to lose the ability to read. It is also called word blindness, text blindness or <b>visual</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Alexia refers to an acquired inability to read caused by brain damage and must be distinguished from dyslexia, a developmental abnormality in which the individual is unable to learn to read, and from illiteracy, which reflects a poor educational back-ground. Most aphasics are also alexic, but alexia may occur in the absence of aphasia and may occasionally be the sole disability resulting from specific brain lesions. There are different classifications of alexias. Traditionally, the alexias are divided into three categories: pure alexia with agraphia, pure alexia without agraphia, and alexia associated with aphasia ("aphasic alexia"). Agraphia is defined as the disruption of previously intact writing skills by brain damage. Writing involves several elements - language processing, spelling, visual perception, visual-spatial orientation for graphic symbols, motor planning, and motor control of writing. A disturbance of any of these processes can impair writing. Agraphia may occur by itself or as association with aphasias, alexia, agnosia and apraxia. Agraphia can also result from "peripheral" involvement of the motor act of writing. Like alexia, agraphia must be distinguished from illiteracy, where writing skills were never developed. Acalculia is a clinical syndrome of acquired deficits in mathematical calculation, either mentally or with paper and pencil. This language disturbances can be classified differently, but there are three principal types of acalculia: acalculia associated with language disturbances, including number paraphasia, number agraphia, or number alexia; acalculia secondary to visual-spatial dysfunction with malalignment of numbers and columns, and a primary anarithmetria entailing disruption of the computation process...|$|E
40|$|Posterior {{cortical}} atrophy (PCA) {{is a neurodegenerative}} syndrome, usually due to Alzheimer's disease. The first symptoms are progressive impairment of visuo spatial (Balint's and Gertsmann's syndromes) or visuo perceptive (visual agnosia, alexia) function. Episodic memory and executive function are spared until later stages. We report two males aged 51 and 55 years and three females aged 50, 54 and 56 years, with posterior {{cortical atrophy}}. Ophthalmologic study was normal in all. Presenting signs and symptoms were visual ataxia, simultagnosia, agraphia, acalculia, spatial disorientation and unilateral neglect (Balint's and Gerstmann's syndromes). Apperceptive <b>visual</b> agnosia, <b>aphasia,</b> apraxia and alexia were also observed. One female had cortical blindness. Structural images were inconclusive, but PET scan and SPECT disclosed functional impairments in occipitotemporal or occipitoparietal areas...|$|R
40|$|Pure motor hemiplegia' is {{a common}} stroke {{syndrome}} defined by Fisher as paralysis of face, arm, and leg on one side, unaccompanied by sensory signs, <b>visual</b> field defect, <b>aphasia,</b> or apractognosia. It occurs almost exclusively in hypertensive patients and carried a good prognosis. We report {{a case of a}} normotensive patient in whom pure motor hemiplegia was the presenting feature, not of a cerebrovascular syndrome, but of a pontine glioblastoma. We note that brain-stem tumours may masquerade as brain-stem strokes...|$|R
40|$|What {{happens to}} visual artists with neuropsychological deficits? This review will examine artistic {{production}} in {{individuals with a}} variety of syndromes including achromatopsia, neglect, <b>visual</b> agnosia, <b>aphasia,</b> epilepsy, migraine, dementia and autism. From this review it appears that artists are not spared visual–motor deficits despite their special graphic abilities. Rather their talents allow them to express visual deficits with particular eloquence. By contrast, the effects of aphasia on art are variable. In addition to deficits, neuropsychological syndromes may be associated with positive phenomena. Such phenomena induced by epilepsy or migraines can serve to inspire artists. This review also makes clear that artists with neuropsychological deficits do not necessarily produce art of lesser quality. Rather, their art may change in content or in style, sometimes in surprising and aesthetically pleasing ways. The neuropsychology of visual art also touches on a few central questions about the nature of artistic expression itself. For example, what forms can artistic representations take? How are visual features used descriptively and expressively? What roles do knowing and seeing play in depiction...|$|R
40|$|Finding {{words in}} an assistive {{communication}} device {{can be challenging}} and time-consuming for individuals with lexical access disorders like those caused by aphasia. These users have persistent difficulties accessing and retrieving words due to impaired semantic links in their mental lexicon. As a result, they can easily get lost in a vocabulary hierarchy or become confused and discouraged if extensive browsing of large word collections is required. We describe {{the design of the}} <b>Visual</b> Vocabulary for <b>Aphasia</b> (ViVA) which attempts to provide effective word finding by organizing words in a dynamic semantic network where links between words reflect word association measures, human judgments of semantic similarity, and past vocabulary usage. We present results from preliminary evaluation of ViVA and discuss the challenges inherent to evaluating adaptive assistive communication tools...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulties}} of navigating vocabulary in an assistive com-munication device are exacerbated {{for individuals with}} lexi-cal access disorders like those due to aphasia. We present the design and implementation of a vocabulary network based on WordNet, a resource that attempts to model human se-mantic memory, that enables users to find words easily. To correct for the sparsity of links among words, we augment WordNet with additional connections derived from human judgments of semantic similarity collected in an online exper-iment. We evaluate the resulting system, the <b>visual</b> vocabu-lary for <b>aphasia</b> (ViVA), and describe its potential {{to adapt to a}} user’s profile and enable faster search and improved navigation.

5000|$|People {{who survive}} {{electrical}} trauma may suffer {{a host of}} injuries including loss of consciousness, seizures, <b>aphasia,</b> <b>visual</b> disturbances, headaches, tinnitus, paresis, and memory disturbances. [...] Even without visible burns, electric shock survivors may be faced with long-term muscular pain and discomfort, fatigue, headache, problems with peripheral nerve conduction and sensation, inadequate balance and coordination, among other symptoms. Electrical injury can lead to problems with neurocognitive function, affecting speed of mental processing, attention, concentration, and memory. The high frequency of psychological problems is well established and may be multifactorial. As with any traumatic and life-threatening experience, electrical injury may result in post traumatic psychiatric disorders. There exist several non-profit research institutes that coordinate rehabilitation strategies for electrical injury survivors by connecting them with clinicians that specialize in {{diagnosis and treatment of}} various traumas that arise as a result of electrical injury.|$|R
40|$|Caloric {{stimulation}} induced {{a transient}} reversal of multimodal hemispatial cognitive deficits in an 81 -year-old {{woman with an}} acute left cerebral hemisphere stroke. The patient had unawareness of her right hand (asomatognosia), right-sided <b>visual</b> unawareness (hemineglect), <b>aphasia</b> and right-sided weakness (hemiplegia) prior to the stimulation. Transient improvements in impaired sensory, motor, linguistic and cognitive function developed within 30 s following application of the caloric stimulus and onset of horizontal nystagmus. The effect persisted for 3 min and ceased completely after 5 min. While several recent reports have described the capacity of caloric stimulation to transiently improve or reverse {{a wide range of}} attentional, cognitive and motor impairments, most examples are in right-hemisphere-damaged patients with long-standing brain injury. Typically, patients have been tested several months or years after the onset of the deficit. A possible mechanism for the temporary reintegration of multiple cognitive functions in this patient is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Small {{subcortical}} infarctions of {{basal ganglia}} {{can be divided}} into either lacunes or striatocapsular infarctions by size of lesion. However, there are some controversies concerning the size criteria of lacune and striatocapsular infarction. To better understand differences among these patients, we elucidated clinical and other properties of deep small basal ganglia infarctions (DSBIs), which could not be clearly classified as either lacunes or striatocapsular infarction by their sizes only. Methods: We analyzed 27 patients with acute ischemic lesion of basal ganglia with which the size varying from 1. 5 cm to 3 cm in their maximal diameters. We assessed clinical features, laboratory data, stroke risk factors, and radiologic findings such as MRI and MR angiography. Results: These patients could be largely divided into two distinct groups, either with or without associated cortical symptoms and signs. The most common clinical feature was motor weakness that was found in all but one patient. Sensory disturbances, altered deep tendon reflexes, and positive Babinski signs were also commonly found. Ten of the 27 patients showed cortical manifestations such as eyeball deviation, <b>visual</b> field defect, <b>aphasia</b> and neglect. Eight of the 10 patients with cortical manifestations showed MCA or ICA stenotic lesions. Conclusions: We found that many patients with 1. 5 cm to 3 cm sized DSBIs could have the feature...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review {{discusses}} {{recent studies}} that have implications for potential neuropharmacological interventions which target cognitive deficits resulting from traumatic brain injury or stroke. RECENT FINDINGS: An important new study concerning the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors after brain injury reveals that previous influential hypotheses about an increase in glutamate triggering neuronal death {{may need to be}} revised. Furthermore, the study suggests that cognitive function may be best preserved by stimulation of NMDA receptors with agonists rather than by the use of antagonists, as previously believed. Investigations of animal models of stroke and traumatic brain injury have further demonstrated the possibility of intervening in the acute and sub-acute stages to protect specific brain systems, such as preservation of the cholinergic system (via cholinesterase inhibitors) and hippocampal neurons (via a D 2 agonist). Clinical trials in humans indicate it is also possible to target these neurotransmitter systems to enhance cognitive performance in patients with chronic deficits. In particular, recent studies demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} ameliorate the effects of two common cognitive syndromes, <b>visual</b> neglect and <b>aphasia.</b> SUMMARY: Cognitive deficits are an extremely common consequence of either traumatic brain injury or stroke. Recent studies demonstrate the potential for using neuropharmacological intervention after acquired brain injury to prevent or ameliorate the effects of cognitive impairments. These treatments, however, are still in their preliminary stages and further research is required to identify the most effective compounds...|$|R
40|$|Background: Co-speech {{gestures}} {{are part}} of nonverbal communication during conversations. They either support the verbal message or provide the interlocutor with additional information. Furthermore, they prompt as nonverbal cues the cooperative process of turn taking. In the present study, we investigated the influence of co-speech gestures on the perception of dyadic dialogue in aphasic patients. In particular, we analysed the impact of co-speech gestures on gaze direction (towards speaker or listener) and fixation of body parts. We hypothesized that aphasic patients, who are restricted in verbal comprehension, adapt their visual exploration strategies. Methods: Sixteen aphasic patients and 23 healthy control subjects participated in the study. Visual exploration behaviour was measured {{by means of a}} contact-free infrared eye-tracker while subjects were watching videos depicting spontaneous dialogues between two individuals. Cumulative fixation duration and mean fixation duration were calculated for the factors co-speech gesture (present and absent), gaze direction (to the speaker or to the listener), and region of interest (ROI), including hands, face, and body. Results: Both aphasic patients and healthy controls mainly fixated the speaker’s face. We found a significant co-speech gesture x ROI interaction, indicating that the presence of a co-speech gesture encouraged subjects to look at the speaker. Further, there was a significant gaze direction x ROI x group interaction revealing that aphasic patients showed reduced cumulative fixation duration on the speaker’s face compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: Co-speech gestures guide the observer’s attention towards the speaker, the source of semantic input. It is discussed whether an underlying semantic processing deficit or a deficit to integrate audio-visual information may cause aphasic patients to explore less the speaker’s face.

30|$|However, lack of {{accessible}} rehabilitation {{facilities and}} {{high cost of}} rehabilitation at the well-equipped clinics are current challenges in India which usually lead to high-dropout of individuals from rehabilitation therapy following stroke. Such de-conditioned chronic stroke survivor will need to recondition themselves with a gradual increase in the intensity (number of hours per day) and frequency (number of days per week) over {{the duration of the}} FES-assisted gait therapy. In fact, about 20 % of stroke survivors suffer muscle atrophy which underlie worsening metabolic fitness in the chronic phase of stroke including gross muscular atrophy, altered muscle molecular phenotype, increased intramuscular area fat, elevated tissue inflammatory markers, and diminished peripheral blood flow dynamics [44]. EMG-triggered FES-assisted gait training may alleviate these debilitating conditions where increased intensity and frequency of rehabilitation may help [40]. In fact recent studies in India on therapeutic benefits of FES-assisted gait training in conjunction with conventional physiotherapy have shown the additive effects of FES on reducing spasticity, improving dorsiflexor strength, improving walking ability, and improving metabolic fitness [41, 42]. However, stroke presents with heterogeneous patient-specific impairments in motor, sensory, tone, <b>visual,</b> perceptual, cognition, <b>aphasia,</b> apraxia, coordination, and equilibrium. Therefore, the functional limitations following stroke are varied, including gait dysfunction, fall risk, limited activities of daily living, difficulties in swallowing, reduced upper extremity function, altered communication, besides others. Based on the residual function of a stroke survivor, the number of muscles that can serve as EMG command source [31], the number of muscles that need FES assistance, intensity, frequency, and duration of the EMG-triggered FES-assisted gait training need to be decided. The ability of a stroke survivor to undergo FES-assisted gait therapy also depends on their cardiovascular and neuromuscular capacity besides psychological factors such as motivation. Also, the FES-assisted gait training should be started as soon as the patient becomes clinically stable since early intervention has shown better functional outcomes, survival rates, and reduced length of required therapy [43]. Therefore, we are currently investigating a home-based rehabilitation model where stroke survivors can use a low-cost EMG-triggered FES device daily. However, the efficacy of such home-based models in affecting therapeutic benefits needs to be validated with neurophysiological testing with advanced computational tools like RQA where parameters like %Rec and %Det can non-invasively monitor changes in muscle properties due to NMES-assisted gait training during rehabilitation.|$|R
