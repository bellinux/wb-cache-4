The 707B and 707A proved the design's <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> gave confidence in the delta planform. A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they played no part in the 698's development.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{represents the}} unbiasedness hypothesis, {{which states that}} the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Given strong evidence that CIRP holds, the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis {{can serve as a}} test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the forward rate and spot rate to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold). Evidence for the <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the author {{addresses}} {{the history of}} reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> in qualitative research as this method of inquiry has progressed through various paradigms. The importance of the concepts of reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> in research findings is traced from the traditional era, where {{there was only a}} modest distinction between qualitative and quantitative researchers involving their definitions of research reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity,</b> through the current era, where some researchers question the need to be restricted in their research by attempting to control for or account for the reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> of their research findings. The author rejects a strict need for reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> as traditionally defined in quantitative research and outlines a less restrictive approach to ensuring reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> in qualitative research...|$|R

40|$|Although {{reliability}} <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> are {{characteristics of}} test data, social scientists often attribute reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> erroneously to the tests themselves. To {{determine the extent}} to which this problem exists, 150 reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> studies selected from 3 prominent social science measurement journals over a 3 -year period were analyzed for common errors in terminology and categorized according to methodology types used in assessing reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity.</b> Results indicate over 50 percent of the articles contained more than one inappropriate statement concerning reliability or validity. It is suggested that professional journal reviewers and editors could improve research practice by catching and correcting a larger percentage of these errors. In the educational research classroom, it is recommended that teachers emphasize that reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> are properties of data, model correct language about score characteristics while discussing reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> in th...|$|R
