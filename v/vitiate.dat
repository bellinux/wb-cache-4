2500|$|Other than recent drinking, {{the most}} common source of mouth alcohol is from belching or burping. This causes the liquids and/or gases from the stomach—including any alcohol—to rise up into the soft tissue of the {{esophagus}} and oral cavity, where it will stay until it has dissipated. The American Medical Association concludes in its Manual for Chemical Tests for Intoxication (1959): [...] "True reactions with alcohol in expired breath from sources other than the alveolar air (eructation, regurgitation, vomiting) will, of course, <b>vitiate</b> the breath alcohol results." [...] For this reason, police officers are supposed to keep a DUI suspect under observation for at least 15 minutes prior to administering a breath test. Instruments such as the Intoxilyzer 5000 also feature a [...] "slope" [...] parameter. This parameter detects any decrease in alcohol concentration of 0.006g per 210L of breath in 0.6second, a condition indicative of residual mouth alcohol, and will result in an [...] "invalid sample" [...] warning to the operator, notifying the operator {{of the presence of}} the residual mouth alcohol.

2500|$|In Western cultures, {{other than}} the age of consent, the issue of consent is also {{considered}} of fundamental importance and, {{if it is not}} freely given, it can prevent a valid marriage from ever coming into existence: see nullity. In Canada, [...] "common law marriages" [...] do not require consent to be recognized and often a stipulated [...] "passage of time in eligible cohabitation" [...] is the only requisite to becoming a formally recognized [...] "marriage". The [...] "capacity to marry" [...] includes the fundamental a priori reasoning that both persons must not be married to others (the exception is Saskatchewan Canada). The only stipulation to this rule of thumb is that both partners must be eligible to marry in the first place. [...] In Islamic law, a nikah contract is not valid if the parties do not consent, although there are differences in juristic opinion about exactly how the consent can be manifested. This supposed lack of clarity has led some Western cultures to question the general morality of [...] "arranged marriages", often stigmatizing the system as being open to abuse and sometimes leading to forced marriages.

2500|$|Not all {{the reviews}} were bad. Vincent Canby in The New York Times, for example, {{expressed}} [...] "great reservations" [...] {{about the film}} and Ball's close-ups, but noted that the film is [...] "as determined to please in its way as Mame is in hers" [...] and that the opening credits, [...] "which look like a Cubist collage in motion, are so good they could be a separate subject." [...] Canby went on to praise Ball as well: [...] "When the character of Lucy, an inspired slapstick performer, coincides with that of Auntie Mame, the Big-Town sophisticate, 'Mame' is marvelous. I think of Lucy's turning a Georgia fox hunt into a gigantic shambles, or of her bringing the curtain down on a New Haven first-night when, as a budding actress, she falls off a huge cardboard moon. I even treasure her prying loose the fingers of a sloshed Beatrice Arthur who won't give up her martini glass." [...] Variety reported in its February 27, 1974 review that Ball was “showcased, coiffed, made-up and ably guided from almost television-like slapstick to character sincerity with loving care.” Molly Haskell in The Village Voice was [...] "pro-Ball but anti-'Mame'" [...] and felt that Lucy made the character of Mame—someone [...] "you'd walk a mile to avoid" [...] in real life—palatable. In the March 18, 1974 issue of New York magazine, Judith Crist was similarly displeased with the film but supportive of its star: [...] "Lucille Ball is – and no 'still' about it – a first-rate entertainer, supplementing her superb comedic sense with a penetrating warmth and inner humor. She is without peer in making a hung-over stagger from bed to bathroom an exercise in regal poise, in using her slightly crooked smile to <b>vitiate</b> the soppiness of an overly sentimental sequence, in applying her Goldwyn Girl chorine know-how to a dash of song and dance." [...] Milton Krims, the film critic for The Saturday Evening Post, wrote (in the magazine's March 1974 issue) a breathless paean to Lucille Ball and the film, concluding that [...] "Mame is Lucille Ball and Lucille Ball is Mame." ...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} lifted spray flames in a coflow of hot, <b>vitiated</b> gases is presented. The <b>vitiated</b> coflow burner is a spray flame that issues into a coaxial flow of hot combustion products from a lean, premixed H 2 /Air flame. The spray flame in a <b>vitiated</b> coflow emulates the combustion {{that occurs in}} many advanced combustors without the detailed fluid mechanics. Two commercially available laser diagnostic systems are used to characterize the spray flame and to demonstrate the <b>vitiated</b> coflow burner's amenability to optical investigation. The Ensemble Particle Concentration and Size (EPCS) system is {{used to measure the}} path-average droplet size distribution and liquid volume fraction at several axial locations while an extractive probe instrument named the Real-time Fuel-air Analyzer (RFA) is used to measure the air to fuel ratio downstream of the spray nozzle with high temporal and spatial resolution. The effect of coflow conditions (stoichiometry) and dilution of the fuel with water was studied with the EPCS optical system. As expected, results show that water retards the evaporation and combustion of fuels. Measurements obtained by the RFA extractive probe show that while the Delavan manufactured nozzle does distribute the fuel over the manufacturer specified spray angle, it unfortunately does not distribute the fuel uniformly, providing conditions that may result in the production of unwanted NOx. Despite some limitations due to the inherent nature of the experimental techniques, the two diagnostics can be readily applied to spray flames in the <b>vitiated</b> coflow environment...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical investigation is presented of a H 2 /N 2 turbulent jet flame burner {{that has a}} novel <b>vitiated</b> coflow. The <b>vitiated</b> coflow emulates the recirculation region of most combustors, such as gas turbines or furnaces. Additionally, since the <b>vitiated</b> gases are coflowing, the burner allows for exploration of recirculation chemistry without the corresponding fluid mechanics of recirculation. Thus the <b>vitiated</b> coflow burner design facilitates the development of chemical kinetic combustion models without the added complexity of recirculation fluid mechanics. Scalar measurements are reported for a turbulent jet flame of H 2 /N 2 in a coflow of combustion products from a lean ((empty set) = 0. 25) H 2 /Air flame. The combination of laser-induced fluorescence, Rayleigh scattering, and Raman scattering is used to obtain simultaneous measurements of the temperature, major species, as well as OH and NO. Laminar flame calculation with equal diffusivity do agree when the premixing and preheating that occurs prior to flame stabilization is accounted for in the boundary conditions.
