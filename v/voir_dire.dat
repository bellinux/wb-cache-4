5|$|The {{trial judge}} has an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> {{on the subject of the}} juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E
5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5000|$|On August 4, despite {{precautions}} {{taken by the}} court, Manson flashed the jury a Los Angeles Times front page whose headline was [...] "Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares". This was {{a reference to a}} statement made the previous day when U.S. President Richard Nixon had decried what he saw as the media's glamorization of Manson. <b>Voir</b> <b>dired</b> by Judge Older, the jurors contended that the headline had not influenced them. The next day, the female defendants stood up and said in unison that, in light of Nixon's remark, {{there was no point in}} going on with the trial.|$|R
40|$|In {{striking}} down {{the use of}} victim impact evidence (VIE) during the penalty phase of a capital trial, the Supreme Court in Booth v. Maryland and South Carolina v. Gathers argued that such testimony would appeal to the emotions of jurors with the consequence that death sentences would not be based upon a reasoned consideration of the blameworthiness of the offender. After a change in personnel, the Court overturned both decisions in Payne v. Tennessee, decided just two years after Gathers. The majority in Payne were decidedly less concerned with the emotional appeal of VIE, arguing that it would only present a “quick glimpse of the life” taken by the offender, and that such testimony would provide the sentencer with a fuller account of the harm done by the offense and therefore a more accurate picture of the offender’s culpability. In this paper we present {{the results of an}} experiment using potential jurors selected from a jury registration list of a large city. Subjects were “death qualified” and <b>voir</b> <b>dired</b> so that they would be eligible for jury service in a capital case, provided with a written summary of a real murder case involving the killing of a police officer, and randomly assigned to watch a videotape of the actual capital penalty trial. All subjects then completed a questionnaire which among other things asked them what sentence they would have imposed in the case if they were a juror. We found that those who viewed the victim impact testimony were more likely to feel empathy and sympathy for the victim and victim’s family, were more likely to state that empathy and sympathy for the victim and victim’s family were important considerations in their sentence, more likely to believe that the victim’s family was coping poorly with their loss, more likely to believe that a death sentence would provide comfort and closure for the family, and more likely to impose a sentence of death...|$|R
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited <b>voir</b> <b>dire.</b>|$|E

25|$|James Kirkland Batson was an African American man {{convicted of}} {{burglary}} and receipt of stolen goods in a Louisville, Kentucky circuit court {{by a jury}} composed entirely of white jurors. The key part of his appeal {{was based on the}} jury selection, or <b>voir</b> <b>dire,</b> phase of the trial. During this phase potential jurors are examined by the Court, the prosecution, and the defense, to determine their competence, willingness, and suitability to hear, deliberate and decide a case put to them to render a verdict. During <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> the judge can dismiss jurors and both the prosecution and the defense have a limited number of peremptory challenges, which are accepted on their face, as the right of the party making the challenge and which they use to excuse any juror for any reason which the particular side believes will help their case.|$|E

25|$|Roger Touhy {{and three}} of his top aides went on trial for the John Factor {{kidnapping}} on January 15, 1934. Several eyewitnesses proved remarkably unreliable during the trial, and later evidence showed that many prosecution witnesses perjured themselves {{in the attempt to}} convict Touhy. At least one juror refused to report for duty midway through the trial, while another juror admitted he had perjured himself during <b>voir</b> <b>dire.</b> A mistrial was declared on February 2.|$|E
25|$|Pickton's {{trial began}} on January 30, 2006 in New Westminster. Pickton {{pleaded not guilty}} to 27 charges of first-degree murder in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> phase of the trial took most of the year to {{determine}} what evidence might be admitted before the jury. Reporters were not allowed to disclose any of the material presented in the arguments. On March 2, one of the 27 counts was rejected by Justice James Williams for lack of evidence.|$|E
25|$|In {{another case}} in which the {{defendant}} was apparently at fault for filing a motion to exclude expert testimony one week before the trial date, the district court denied the motion on that ground, but it advised the defendant that it might conduct its own <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> of the expert in question before he testified. The district court preliminarily found that defendant's motion was predicated on a ruling made almost three months earlier by a district court in another state, and that defendant had shown no good cause for waiting to file the motion. The defendant ultimately lost that case, following the admission of the disputed expert testimony, and ultimately failed in its appeal.|$|E
25|$|Jury {{selection}} {{began on}} October 25. As <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> continued, Darrow became increasingly {{concerned about the}} outcome of the trial. He felt J. B. could not be relied on as a witness and would break down under cross-examination. On October 15, he learned that the prosecution had acquired masses of evidence to support 21 separate charges. On October 18, he learned that U.S. Attorney General George W. Wickersham had obtained enough evidence on his own to secure, with President William Howard Taft's approval, a federal subpoena against the McNamaras. The first panel of jurors was exhausted on October 25, forcing the court to order an additional panel of jurors to appear. The jury was finally seated on November 7.|$|E
25|$|Initial jury {{selection}} began on March 21, {{and saw a}} total of 204 prospective jurors subjected {{to the process of}} <b>Voir</b> <b>dire</b> selection before, in June, 16 jurors considered satisfactory by both counsels had been selected. Upon completion of {{jury selection}} process, Bonin's attorney renewed his motion that the trial should be moved to a jurisdiction outside of Orange County due to pretrial publicity tainting the jury pool; this motion was again rejected by Judge Lae, who again ruled that the 16 members of the jury selected from Orange County by this date and considered satisfactory by both counsels would serve as jurors throughout the trial, as no likelihood existed of Bonin receiving an unfair trial. Judge Lae ruled that the trial would begin on June 14.|$|E
25|$|The retry of Deck’s penalty phase {{began on}} April 29, 2003, {{where he was}} brought into court wearing shackles. The defense objected to Deck being visibly restrained, stating that Deck’s {{behavior}} did not justify shackles. The defense stated the only justification for shackling Deck {{would have been if}} he caused a disturbance in the courtroom. However, he did not. The defense also suggested other measures that the court could have taken to ensure safety instead of shackling Deck. These measures included adding extra security guards to the courtroom, and having the people who wanted to sit in the gallery walk through metal detectors. However, the defense’s objections were overruled. Deck’s attorneys once again objected during <b>voir</b> <b>dire.</b> Deck’s defense thought that asking jurors if the shackles biased them was not enough to ensure that Deck would receive reliable sentencing. The court overruled the objection again, stating “The objection that you’re making will be overruled. He has been convicted and will remain in legirons and belly chain.” The jury once again sentenced Deck to death.|$|E

500|$|A {{total of}} 408 {{potential}} jurors were questioned during the <b>voir</b> <b>dire,</b> which concluded on February 14. All of the 15 jurors—ten women and five men—were white, and most were under thirty years old. Five jurors had personal ties to State Troopers (one girlfriend, two nephews, and two friends). A sixteenth female juror was removed {{before the trial}} formally opened, when {{it was determined that}} Sheriff Joseph DeMarino of Middlesex County, while a private detective several years earlier, had worked for a lawyer who represented the juror's husband. Judge Appleby repeatedly denied Kunstler's requests for DeMarino to be removed from his responsibilities {{for the duration of the}} trial [...] "because he did not divulge his association with the juror." ...|$|E
500|$|Seventeen amicus curiae ("friend of the court") briefs {{were filed}} in the appeal.

2500|$|After each {{prospective}} juror has {{answered the}} general slate of questions the attorneys may ask follow-up questions of {{some or all}} prospective jurors. [...] Each side in the trial is allotted {{a certain number of}} challenges to remove prospective jurors from consideration.

[...] Any prospective jurors not thus impaneled return to the jury pool room.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Douglas also {{referenced}} Aldridge {{and concluded}} that the goal of <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> was to disclose “prejudices of a serious character”. He then associated hair growth with prejudice of a serious character. [...] He points out that “hair growth is symbolic to many of rebellion against traditional society and disapproval of the way the current power structure handles social problems,” and he further acknowledged that for some “people, nonconventional hair growth symbolizes an undesirable lifestyle characterized by unreliability, dishonesty, lack of moral values, communal (communist) tendencies, and the assumption of drug use.” [...] Douglas concluded that denying a petitioner the right to examine this aspect of prejudice was to also deny him an effective means of <b>voir</b> <b>dire.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Ham v. South Carolina, , was a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} concerning {{examinations of}} prospective jurors during <b>voir</b> <b>dire.</b> The Court {{held that the}} trial court's failure to [...] "have the jurors interrogated {{on the issue of}} racial bias" [...] violated the petitioner's due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment. [...] This right does not extend to any question of bias, but it does not preclude questions of relevant biases.|$|E
2500|$|Once the {{physician}} {{has been indicted}} (and sanctioned) he or she then {{has the right to}} request a hearing. At the hearing, counsel is allowed.

2500|$|Justice Marshall {{took care}} to caution that a party {{should not be allowed}} to ask any and every {{possible}} question. Nor should a party be given an unlimited opportunity to conduct preliminary <b>voir</b> <b>dire.</b> He recognized the countervailing interests of the state with regard to speedy trials and the avoidance of jury intimidation. [...] Nonetheless, in Justice Marshall’s opinion, the additional fifteen minutes needed to ask the petitioner's questions concerning racial bias would not have greatly burdened the trial court, and thus the trial court abused its discretion.|$|E
2500|$|Gene Ham was a {{black man}} who was arrested on May 15, 1970, in Florence, South Carolina, due to four {{outstanding}} warrants that charged him with possession of drugs. After his arrest, police took Ham to the Florence city jail and searched him. [...] This search produced marijuana, but Ham claimed that police had framed him because of his involvement with the civil rights movement. [...] Nonetheless, Ham was subsequently charged with a fifth arrest warrant. [...] Before Ham's trial, during <b>voir</b> <b>dire,</b> Ham sought to ask the following four sets of questions of the potential jurors: ...|$|E
2500|$|Turning to the {{particulars}} of Ham's case, the Court noted that <b>voir</b> <b>dire,</b> although subject to the Fourteenth Amendment, is governed by {{the discretion of the}} trial court. [...] As such, the trial judge was not required to put the question of racial bias in any particular form or to ask potential jurors any number of questions. [...] For example, the Court addressed the jury instruction concerning beards and determined that such a question was well within the trial court's discretion to allow or disallow. [...] However, given the context of the case, the Court found that the questions regarding racial prejudice were appropriate and necessary.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Ham decision, {{two cases}} have further {{clarified}} {{the adequacy of}} federal <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> {{when there is a}} heightened risk of racial bias: Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U.S. 589 (1976), and Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U.S. 182 (1981). [...] Ristaino revealed that Hams constitutional rule is narrow in scope. [...] It held that the [...] "mere fact that the victim of the crimes alleged was a white man and the defendants were Negroes" [...] did not constitutionally compel an examination of racial bias. Rosales-Lopez has since clarified the federal standard. The plurality in Rosales-Lopez held that in federal court, refusal to pose questions submitted by the defendant would be [...] "reversible error only where the circumstances of the case indicate that there is a reasonable possibility that racial or ethnic prejudice might have influenced the jury." ...|$|E
2500|$|Miles v. United States (1880) also {{rejected}} several {{challenges to}} a polygamy conviction. The Court held that bigamy could be proved by testimony (as opposed to, for example, a wedding certificate); {{that the question}} of whether the evidence established guilty beyond a reasonable doubt could not be raised de novo in the Supreme Court; that the judge could exclude jurors for-cause who believed polygamy was compelled by God; that it was too late post-conviction to complain for the first time that the wives were not named in the indictment; that there was no invalid variance from the indictment between the names [...] "Caroline Owens" [...] and [...] "Caroline Owen Maile"; that wearing a wedding dress and attending a church known for polygamous weddings were competent evidence of marriage; that incompetent testimony (proof of the first marriage given by the second wife) could be given at the <b>voir</b> <b>dire.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Ham appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court of South Carolina in State v. Ham, 256 S.C. 1 (1971). One {{of the twelve}} issues that Ham raised on appeal was that the trial judge erred by refusing to ask Ham’s proposed <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> questions. The South Carolina Supreme Court determined that the three basic questions asked were in compliance with South Carolina state law, S.C. § 38-202 (1962) at the time. The court stated that Ham failed to carry his burden of showing that other questions should {{have been asked to}} assure a fair and impartial jury. The court also found that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial judge. [...] Ham then petitioned the United States Supreme Court to review of the decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court, and the United States Supreme Court, 404 U.S. 1057, 92 S. Ct. 744, 30 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1972), granted certiorari.|$|E
2500|$|In 1898 the Supreme Court {{held that}} the jury must be {{composed}} of at least twelve persons, although this was not necessarily extended to state civil jury trials. In 1970, however, the Supreme Court {{held that the}} twelve person requirement was a [...] "historical accident", and upheld six-person juries if provided for under state law in both criminal and civil state court cases. There is controversy over smaller juries, with proponents arguing {{that they are more}} efficient and opponents arguing that they lead to fluctuating verdicts. In a later case, however, the court rejected the use of five-person juries in criminal cases. Juries go through a selection process called <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> in which the lawyers question the jurors and then make [...] "challenges for cause" [...] and [...] "peremptory challenges" [...] to remove jurors. [...] Traditionally the removal of jurors based on a peremptory challenge required no justification or explanation, but the tradition has been changed by the Supreme Court where the reason for the peremptory challenge was the race of the potential juror. [...] Since the 1970s [...] "scientific jury selection" [...] has become popular.|$|E
2500|$|Selection of jurors from a jury pool {{occurs when}} a trial is {{announced}} and juror names are randomly selected and called out by the jury pool clerk. [...] Depending {{on the type of}} trial—whether a 6-person or 12 person jury is needed, in the United States—anywhere from 15 to 30 prospective jurors are sent to the courtroom to participate in <b>voir</b> <b>dire,</b> pronounced [...] in French, and defined as the oath to speak the truth in the examination testing competence of a juror, or in another application, a witness. Once the list of prospective jurors has assembled in the courtroom the court clerk assigns them seats in the order their names were originally drawn. [...] At this point the judge often will ask each prospective juror to answer a list of general questions such as name, occupation, education, family relationships, time conflicts for the anticipated length of the trial. [...] The list is usually written up and clearly visible to assist nervous prospective jurors and may include several questions uniquely pertinent to the particular trial. [...] These questions are to familiarize the judge and attorneys with the jurors and glean biases, experiences, or relationships that could jeopardize the proper course of the trial.|$|E
6000|$|But this {{partiality}} in a biographer, {{though to}} be allowed and even commended as a quickener of insight, should not {{be strong enough to}} warp his mind from its judicial level. While we think that Mr. Forster is mainly right in his estimate of Swift's character, and altogether so in insisting on trying him by documentary rather than hearsay evidence, it is equally true that he is sometimes betrayed into overestimates, and into positive statement, where favorable inference would have been wiser. Now and then his exaggeration is merely amusing, as where he tells us that Swift, [...] "as early as in his first two years after quitting Dublin, was accomplished in French," [...] the only authority for such a statement being a letter of recommendation from Temple saying that he [...] "had some French." [...] Such compulsory testimonials are not on their <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> any more than epitaphs. So, in speaking of Betty Jones, with whom in 1689 Swift had a flirtation that alarmed his mother, Mr. Forster assumes that she [...] "was an educated girl" [...] on the sole ground, so far as appears, of [...] "her mother and Swift's being cousins." [...] Swift, to be sure, thirty years later, on receiving some letters from his old sweetheart, [...] "suspects them to be counterfeit" [...] because [...] "she spells like a kitchen-maid," [...] and this, perhaps, may be Mr. Forster's authority. But, as the letters were genuine, the inference should have been the other way. The [...] "letters to Eliza," [...] by the way, which Swift in 1699 directs Winder, his successor at Kilroot, to burn, were doubtless those addressed to Betty Jones. Mr. Forster does not notice this; but that Swift should have preserved them, or copies of them, is of some consequence, as tending to show that they were mere exercises in composition, thus confirming what he says in the remarkable letter to Kendall, written in 1692, when he was already off with the old love and on with a new.|$|E
5000|$|In Canada, {{the case}} of Erven v. The Queen holds that {{testimony}} on a <b>voir</b> <b>dire</b> cannot influence the trial itself.
