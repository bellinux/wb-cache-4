2500|$|Numerous smaller {{modifications}} {{were introduced}} during the testing phase {{and the production}} run.

[...] Later additions were a periscope sight, an exhaust pipe, and speaking tubes for internal communications. In 1917, to provide some modicum of communication with higher command levels and accompanying tanks or infantry, a hinged metal shield was attached to the rear of the hull skylight roof. Its back was painted in a conspicuous horizontal tricolour red-white-red scheme. When lifted by means of a steel cable operable from the inside via a grooved small <b>vertical</b> <b>plate</b> located on the front of the skylight roof, it indicated the position of the tank to friendly observers from behind. Several versions of this system existed, differing in the precise location of the shield and its shape. It was especially intended to signal to the infantry that it was safe to advance after the tank had neutralised all enemy machine-gun positions.|$|E
40|$|Natural {{convection}} is {{an important}} mode of heat transfer. Natural convective heat transfer is a common phenomenon {{in most of the}} heat transfer cases. This paper presents the natural convective heat transfer and the effect of different variables on heat transfer in the square enclosure of two V-corrugated parallel <b>vertical</b> <b>plates.</b> An experiment has been performed to investigate the effect of mass flow rate of cooling water, input heat energy and inlet water temperature on natural convective heat transfer in the square enclosure of two V-corrugated parallel <b>vertical</b> <b>plates.</b> The air inside the V-corrugated parallel <b>vertical</b> <b>plates</b> was the main media to transfer heat from the hot V-corrugated plate to cold V-corrugated plate. Mass flow rate and the inlet temperature of cooling water are considered to vary the cold plate temperature. The increase in mass flow rate of water and the input heat energy increases the heat transfer rate. On the other hand, the decrease in inlet water temperature increases the heat transfer rate. So, there is an influence of different variables on natural convective heat transfer through V-corrugated <b>vertical</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R
