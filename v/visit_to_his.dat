5|$|A {{change in}} the {{location}} of his job meant that Headley moved to the Lucas Cricket Club in 1929. He visited America and played some exhibition matches for the Jamaican Athletic Club in New York, scoring a century against a touring team from Bermuda; his parents had moved to America by then, which enabled Headley to combine the cricket with his first <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> parents in ten years.|$|E

5|$|Edward Martyn was a {{neighbour}} of Lady Gregory, and it {{was during}} a <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> home, Tullira Castle, in 1896 that she first met W. B. Yeats.

His attacker was prosecuted for the incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Stowe's {{writings}} about Florida were duly noted by authorities. Her brother Charles purchased his own land upon her recommendation, not in Mandarin but in Newport near Tallahassee. During a <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> home in 1874, {{she and a}} few Northern investors had an audience with Governor Marcellus Stearns. They were met by his cabinet and staff {{on the steps of}} the state capitol building—which was festooned with greenery and a large welcome sign for the occasion—and they gave Stowe a round of loud and exuberant cheers.|$|E

5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} {{reconstruct}} Ukraine, but also desired {{to complete the}} interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur. As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and 750,000men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the Red Army. Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine. Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with {{only a third of}} the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown. Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 January, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary arrested 32-year-old Dutch {{engineer}} Vincent Tabak, who lived with his girlfriend in the flat next door to Yeates. However, authorities declined to reveal additional details while the suspect was being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of Jefferies' arrest, which had breached the rules governing what can be reported when an individual is arrested. The Tabak arrest followed an anonymous tip from a female caller, shortly after a televised appeal by Yeates' parents on Crimewatch. Canynge Road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around Yeates' home; and officers sealed off Tabak's adjacent flat. Investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend, where Tabak was {{believed to have been}} staying, about a mile away. Tabak had previously been ruled out as a suspect during an earlier stage of the investigation, and had returned to Britain from a holiday <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> family in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|The French and American armies {{marched through}} Philadelphia from September 2 to the 4th, where the American {{soldiers}} announced {{they would not}} leave Maryland until they received one month's pay in coin, {{rather than in the}} worthless Continental paper currency. General Rochambeau generously loaned Washington half of his supply of gold Spanish coins. This would be the last time the men would be paid. It significantly strengthened French and American relations On September 5, Washington learned of the arrival of de Grasse's fleet off the Virginia Capes. De Grasse debarked his French troops to join Lafayette, and then sent his empty transports to pick up the American troops. Washington made a <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> home, Mount Vernon, on his way to Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|The Major Crimes Unit {{learns that}} Stringer has been buying {{real estate and}} {{developing}} it to fulfill his dream of being a successful legitimate businessman. Believing that the bloody turf war with Marlo is poised to destroy everything the Barksdale crew had worked for, Stringer gives Major Colvin information on Avon's weapons stash. Brother Mouzone returns to Baltimore and tracks down Omar to join forces. Mouzone tells Avon that his shooting must be avenged. Avon, remembering how Stringer disregarded his order which resulted in Stringer's attempt to have Brother Mouzone killed, furious over D'Angelo's murder to which Stringer had confessed, and fearing Mouzone's ability to harm his reputation outside of Baltimore, informs Mouzone of Stringer's upcoming <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> construction site. Mouzone and Omar corner him and shoot him to death.|$|E
5|$|In March 1909, Boyce {{embarked}} on a two-month trip to Europe, which included a <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> daughters, who were in Rome. On returning to America, Boyce organized a photographic expedition to Africa with the innovative aerial photographer George R. Lawrence. Boyce met with safari organizers and outfitters and provisioned his expedition in London and Naples. His son Benjamin and Lawrence's son Raymond {{were part of the}} expedition. Cartoonist John T. McCutcheon joined the expedition while they were sailing from Naples to Africa. The group disembarked at Mombasa, Kenya, and was in Nairobi by September. After hiring local porters and guides, the entire expedition totaled about 400 people, about three-fourths of whom were servants. It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the expedition was going to explore near Kijabi and Lake Victoria. The expedition was a failure because a telephoto lens was neither brought nor subsequently procured, the hot air balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of East Africa, and the cameras were so large and noisy to move into position that the animals were scared away. The members of the expedition had to resort to buying photographs of big game animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi. The expedition did manage to successfully hunt several species of big game animals.|$|E
