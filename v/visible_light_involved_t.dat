40|$|AbstractIn this study, laponite and {{montmorillonite}} clays {{were found}} to be able to decompose rhodamine B upon <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Very interestingly, it was found that rhodamine B on laponite underwent a stepwise N-deethylation and its decomposition was terminated once rhodamine 110, as a decomposition product, was formed, whereas the same phenomenon was not observed for rhodamine B on montmorillonite, whose decomposition involved chromophore destruction. Mechanistic study revealed that the different photodecomposition behaviors of rhodamine B on laponite and montmorillonite were attributed to the oxidation by different reactive oxygen species, with laponite involving 				HO 2 /O 2 - while montmorillonite involving OH. It was also found that the degradation pathway of rhodamine B on laponite switched from N-deethylation to chromophore destruction when solution pH was changed from 7. 0 to 3. 0, which was attributed to a much higher fraction of 				HO 2 relative to 				O 2 - under pH 3. 0 than under pH 7. 0. Based on the results, a mechanism of rhodamine dye decomposition on clay under <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> was proposed, <b>involving</b> the clay as an electron acceptor, electron relay between the adsorbed dye molecules and oxygen molecules, and subsequent reactions between the generated dye radical cations and different reactive oxygen species.
