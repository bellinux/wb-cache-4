A contributing element to these savings {{is to have a}} homogeneous bituminous surface structure. For example, load changes, at low temperatures, can create a heterogeneous surface structure that gives rise to premature maintenance needs. Established methods or <b>macro</b> <b>texture</b> <b>measurement</b> models are not currently available in Sweden. Other countries have made advances in this field but they have not yet had an impact in Sweden. An objective of this project is to maximize the possible use of existing measurement technology, quality and techniques associated with road surface measurement carried out by survey vehicles. In some cases, after a new surface has been laid, 9 ̆ 1 object measurement 9 ̆ 2 is carried out by a survey vehicle. These measurements can be used to approve the surfacing contractor's performance in terms of longitudinal and transverse smoothness. A similar method, with specified values for homogeneous surface structures, will be developed in this project. An object is designed to provide a safe road surface throughout its design life expectancy. In {{order to be able to}} achieve this, it is important to discover surface shortcomings such as material separation. Four different models were tested in the project - all of which show promising results. Generally, all the models were able to identify the worst test surface. However, the actual "failed" road surface length of the object varied between models. This, above all, is a question of calibrating the models' limits. However, there is also potential to improve the model itself...|$|R
40|$|Ths skid {{resistance}} of the road surface {{is one of the}} parameters that influence the active vehicle safety and consequently the traffic safety. Up till now, in the Netherlands {{skid resistance}} has been evaluated by means of of a statistical relation between the skid resistance value and accident risk. In {{order to be able to}} fulfil the demands of a more detailed evaluation an approach is suggested with the focus on the physical description of mechanisms in traffic safety. This approach is innovative and quite different from standard solutions in traffic safety research. One of the major challenges in this approach is to integrate a wide range of disciplines, i. e. road technology, tyre-road interaction, vehicle dynamics and human factors for the prediction of the braking performance of vehicle from specified road characteristics. In this way, the braking performance model supports a better mutual understanding between the governments, road constructors and vehicle manufacturers. One of the crucial elements in the model is the accurate description of the tyre-road interaction. The Magic Formula tyre model is a general accepted model to describe interaction forces within the automotive industry. This paper focuses on the extension of the Magic Formula tyre model with speed dependent friction for especially the wet conditions and also the scaling of the Magic Formula parameters based on standard road-skid resistance and road <b>macro</b> <b>texture</b> <b>measurements.</b> This extended model is valid for dry and wet surfaces.

The intensity of Nb 3 Sn textures decreases from green compact sample to sintered sample, probably due to the mechanism of recovery – recrystallisation following the Nb-Sn inter-diffusion process during sintering...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} objectives for transportation engineers is to understand pavement surface properties and their positive and negative effects on the user. This can improve the design of the infrastructure, adequacy of tools, and consistency of methodologies that are essential for transportation practitioners regarding macrotexture characterization. Important pavement surface characteristics, or tire-pavement interactions, such as friction, tire-pavement noise, splash and spray, and rolling resistance, are significantly influenced by pavement macrotexture. This dissertation compares static and dynamic macrotexture measurements and proposes and enhanced method to quantify the macrotexture. Dynamic measurements performed with vehicle-mounted lasers have the advantage of measuring macrotexture at traffic speed. One drawback of these laser devices is the presence of “spikes ” in the collected data, which impact the <b>texture</b> <b>measurements.</b> The dissertation proposes two robust and innovative methods to overcome this limitation.

However, there appear to be large discrepancies between <b>texture</b> <b>measurements</b> obtained by these different techniques. This research is aimed at evaluating the relationship between several well-known <b>texture</b> <b>measurement</b> techniques. Apple fruits of two cultivars, Jonagold and Kanzi (different softening behaviour) were harvested at commercial maturity, stored at 1 or 4 °C under optimal controlled atmosphere conditions, at high or low relative humidity. At the end of 6 months storage, the fruits were placed under shelf life conditions for 3 weeks, during which texture and weight loss were measured. Furthermore, <b>texture</b> <b>measurements</b> were compared with changes in the water soluble pectin (WSP) fraction, cell morphology and loss in cell turgor potentials. The acoustic firmness (stiffness) decreased throughout storage and shelf life. However, the firmness obtained by the Magness Taylor puncture test increased during the first week of shelf life exposure. Further analysis of the force-deformation curves at this time point showed that failure was possibly due to cell separation, rather than cell breakage. Textural changes in apples seems to be governed principally by pectin degradation (evident by increased in WSP) and moisture losses. Texture attributes were more related to the acoustic firmness measurements during shelf life, and to the Magness Taylor firmness during storagestatus: publishe...|$|R
