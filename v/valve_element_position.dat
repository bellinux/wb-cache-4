5000|$|As the {{pneumatic}} operation of valves, compared to motorised operation, has cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation {{is still an}} industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4-20 mA is generated by the controller, but {{enables the use of}} pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers. These are usually located locally to the control valve and convert 4-20 mA to 3-15 psi (or (0.2 - 1.0 bar).This signal is then fed to the valve actuator or more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. This is a dedicated controller with a pneumatic nozzle and flapper arrangement and a mechanical linkage to sense the valve actuator movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the <b>valve</b> control <b>element</b> moves to the desired position, by comparing the actual <b>valve</b> regulating <b>element</b> <b>position</b> against the desired value; hence the name [...] "positioner". As a mechanical linkage is used for this, the positioner has to be mounted on the valve body. A positioner also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation, which is particularly useful with cylinder type valve actuators.|$|R

The arrangement is such that the <b>valve</b> <b>element</b> is held closed against the seat member by the full differential in fluid pressures acting {{on both sides of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>element</b> until the seat member is moved away from the <b>valve</b> <b>element</b> to thus insure positive closing of the <b>valve</b> <b>element</b> until the seat member is moved out of engagement with the <b>valve</b> <b>element</b> by excess pressure differential...|$|R

5000|$|The basic {{structure}} of a shuttle valve is like a tube with three openings; one on each end, {{and one in the}} middle. A ball or other blocking <b>valve</b> <b>element</b> moves freely within the tube. When pressure from a fluid is exerted through an opening on one end it pushes the ball towards the opposite end. This prevents the fluid from traveling through that opening, but allows it to flow through the middle opening.

30|$|Perfect {{frequency}} increments {{are often}} assumed in existing literatures [20]. However, {{in an actual}} array system, there will have imperfect errors including <b>element</b> <b>position</b> errors, mutual coupling, phase errors, and frequency increment errors [21 - 24]. Some results have been reported about the impacts of <b>element</b> <b>position</b> error, mutual coupling and phase error on beampattern, and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation performances. Since FDA beampattern has similar properties with conventional phased array for the impacts of <b>element</b> <b>position</b> errors, mutual coupling, and phase errors, this paper considers only the impacts of frequency increment errors on FDA beampattern. Since FDA beampattern {{is dependent on the}} angle and range, it has a potential for target localization, which is different from traditional time-of-arrival (TOA) and angle-of-arrival (AOA)-based localization [25 - 28]. The contributions can be summarized as follows. (i) More tighter bounds of FDA beampattern deviation are derived. (ii) Statistical analysis of FDA beampattern in terms of expectation value, variance, and probability density function (PDF) are provided.|$|R
40|$|Null {{steering}} in adaptive arrays by <b>element</b> <b>position</b> perturbations {{has been}} investigated. The {{results showed that}} it is possible to steer array nulls in the directions of interfering signals by perturbing the <b>element</b> <b>positions</b> of linear arrays, provided that the number of interfering signals is less than half the number of array elements. Arrays with different number of elements and various illumination functions were investigated. The main advantage of using this technique over the other commonly used methods is that the amplitudes and phases of the array elements can be used mainly to steer the main beam towards the desired signal.

The array comprises a signal processor, digital control algorithm (PID), stepper motors, shaft encoders, actuators and multiplexers.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a methodology to predict the reactivity impact as a function of outage time between cycles of 3 He, 6 Li, and other poisons in the High Flux Isotope Reactor s (HFIR) beryllium reflector. The reactivity worth at startup of the HFIR has been incorrectly predicted in the past after the reactor has been shut-down for long periods of time. The incorrect prediction was postulated to be due to the erroneous calculation of 3 He buildup in the beryllium reflector. It is necessary to develop a better estimate of the start-of-cycle symmetric critical control <b>element</b> <b>positions</b> since if the estimated and actual symmetrical critical control <b>element</b> <b>positions</b> differ by more than $ 1. 55 in reactivity (approximately one-half inch in control <b>element</b> startup <b>position),</b> HFIR is to be shutdown and a technical evaluation is performed to resolve the discrepancy prior to restart. 3 He is generated and depleted during operation, but during an outage, the depletion of 3 He ceases because it is a stable isotope. 3 He is born from the radioactive decay of tritium, and thus the concentration of 3 He increases during shutdown. SCALE, specifically the TRITON and CSAS 5 control modules including the KENO V. A, COUPLE, and ORIGEN functional modules were utilized in this study.
