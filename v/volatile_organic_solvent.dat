The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} in an empirical manner whether the phenomenon of hearing loss due to the exposure to <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> was present in the gasification plants of a petrochemical factory. The experimental groups included unexposed (N= 20) workers, workers (N= 20) exposed to noise and workers (N= 19) exposed to noise and <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents.</b> The following assessments were made: diagnostic audiometry for the assessment of hearing thresholds; biological monitoring of ortho-cresol and hippuric acid for the biological markers of toluene; passive air sampling and noise measurements. Questionnaires were completed by the three groups to collect information about age, ethnicity, smoking habits, alcohol consumption and work history regarding the exposure to ototoxic substances as well as the period of employment. There were no statistically significant differences between the average ages of the three groups, but more of the workers in the noise group were from a higher age group. This age composition and the work history of the noise group were considered as possible influences on the results of this hearing study. The results of the passive air sampling show that the levels of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> were lower than the occupational exposure limits on the day of sampling. The biological monitoring shows that the markers, namely hippuric acid and o-cresol, were lower than the biological exposure indices. The noise group was exposed to sound pressure levels of 79 - 90 dB(A) and the noise + hydrocarbon group to levels of 85 - 88 dB(A). The average hearing thresholds of the noise group were at most of the frequencies (0. 5 - 8 kHz) significantly higher (p≤ 0, 05) than that of the noise + hydrocarbon group. The average hearing thresholds of the control group were overall lower than the noise group's hearing thresholds, but on average a little higher than the noise + hydrocarbon group's hearing thresholds. No relationship was found in this study between the exposure to <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> (for example toluene that was used as marker in this study) and the elevation of hearing thresholds of workers at the gasification plants of the petrochemical factory.

30|$|To prevent {{limonene}} volatilizing and {{to extract}} {{it from the}} culture medium, a two-phase culture system composed of n-hexadecane was adopted in this study. Hexadecane was chosen for its high hydrophobicity (log PO/W, 8.8) for the extraction of limonene, and low volatility, which prevents loss due to evaporation. A ratio of 1 / 50 (Vorg/Vaq, 2  mL of hexadecane was layered over 100  mL of culture broth) was adopted in this two-phase culture system. Limonene was extracted into the hexadecane phase, and negligible amounts of limonene were detected in the cell mass and culture broth (data not shown). As a result, limonene production was measured only from the hexadecane phase.

Therefore, stringent environmental policies will have to be practiced to reduce the use of harmful chemicals in wood preservatives, as practiced under Biocidal Products Directives within European Union (Hingston et al. 2001) and restricted pesticidal use of three primary heavy duty wood preservatives (“HDWPs”) under Environmental Protection Agency, USA in 2008 (Tomasovic 2012).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this review}} paper is to compare the {{potential}} of various techniques developed for production of homogenous, stable liposomes. Traditional techniques, such as Bangham, detergent depletion, ether/ethanol injection, reverse-phase evaporation and emulsion methods, were compared with the recent advanced techniques developed for liposome formation. The major hurdles for scaling up the traditional methods are the consumption of large quantities of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent,</b> the stability and homogeneity of the liposomal product, {{as well as the}} lengthy multiple steps involved. The new methods have been designed to alleviate the current issues for liposome formulation.
