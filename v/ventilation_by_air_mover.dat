There is presented selected industrial hall and its HVAC systems concept. The computer simulation using ESP-r software for different rates of <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> outdoor <b>air</b> helped to design an air-conditioning system, which comprises of daytime top cooling and night <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> outdoor <b>air</b> combined with accumulation of cold in building constructions. Capacity of mechanical cooling was decreased to more that 50 % comparing to original design based on manual calculation for peak loads. The importance of internal gains measurements and investigation for industrial halls is presented as well...|$|R
40|$|The need of {{optimization}} for {{the mechanical}} night cooling system was discussed in many cases. The paper {{deals with the}} use of computer simulations both for the design support of a new building and HVAC system development and for the optimization of the system control strategy in the finished building. In early design of a new commercial building in Prague computer simulations were carried out to prove possible effects of night cooling ventilation. Predictions of the indoor environment and energy consumption for optional solutions regarding cooling capacities and different rates of <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> outdoor <b>air</b> helped to design an air-conditioning system, which comprises of daytime top cooling and night <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> outdoor <b>air</b> combined with accumulation of cold in building constructions. Long-time monitoring and further computer simulations were performed in order to optimize the control strategy for the top cooling system...|$|R

In all except desert and high-altitude climates, the annual dehumidification load for ventilation air exceeds the annual cooling load for <b>ventilation</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> a factor of 2 to 5.|$|R
50|$|The {{knowledge}} of the urban climatology i.e. the wind around the buildings is crucial when evaluating the air quality and thermal comfort inside buildings as air and heat exchange depends on the wind pressure on facades. As we {{can see in the}} equation (1), the air exchange depends linearly on the wind speed in the urban place where the architectural project will be built. CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) tools and zonal modelings are usually used to design naturally ventilated buildings. Windcatchers are able to aid wind driven <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> directing <b>air</b> in and out of buildings.|$|R
500|$|The Panzerkampfwagen 35(t) was {{assembled}} from {{a framework}} of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams to which the armour plates were riveted. A [...] firewall separated the engine compartment from the crew. It had several mesh-covered openings to allow access to the engine and improve <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> drawing <b>air</b> in through the commander's hatch. This {{had the advantage of}} rapidly dispersing gun combustion gases when firing, but several disadvantages. The constant draft generated by the engine greatly affected the crew during cold weather, the danger of an engine fire reaching the crew compartment was increased and the engine noise and heat increased crew fatigue.|$|R

50|$|CPR {{involves}} chest compressions {{for adults}} between 5 cm and 6 cm deep {{and at a}} rate of at least 100 to 120 per minute. The rescuer may also provide artificial <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> either exhaling <b>air</b> into the subject's mouth or nose (mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) or using a device that pushes air into the subject's lungs (mechanical ventilation). Current recommendations place emphasis on early and high-quality chest compressions over artificial ventilation; a simplified CPR method involving chest compressions only is recommended for untrained rescuers. In children, however, only doing compressions may result in worse outcomes.|$|R

50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> systems {{serve the}} same purpose as blower systems at a lower cost. However, this type of system can only be used when {{there is little or}} no back {{pressure}} because they generate lower pressure and airflow. <b>Air</b> <b>mover</b> functionality is based on the Venturi effect. A small amount of high velocity air connected to the side of the casting passes out through a nozzle, creating venturi action. This effect causes a large volume of low velocity air to flow through the venturi and out of the air diffuser. The ratio of air supplied depends on the design of the <b>air</b> <b>mover’s</b> physical structure.|$|R
50|$|Synthetic jet <b>air</b> <b>movers</b> have no {{moving parts}} {{and are thus}} {{maintenance}} free. Due to the high heat transfer coefficients, high reliability but lower overall flow rates, Synthetic jet <b>air</b> <b>movers</b> are usually used at the chip level and not at the system level for cooling. However {{depending on the size}} and complexity of the systems they can be used for both at times.|$|R
40|$|In {{terms of}} energy consumption, radiant cooling system has an {{advantage}} over conventional system. A significant amount of systems is consumed by fans, which are used to transport cool air through the ducts. Part of this electricity used to move the air also heats the conditioned air and, therefore, {{is part of the}} internal thermal cooling load. If the tasks of ventilation and thermal conditioning of buildings are separated, the amount of air transported through buildings can be significantly reduced. In this case the cooling is provided by radiation using water as the transport medium and the <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> outside <b>air</b> systems without the need for recirculation and cooling of air. Although the supply air necessary for ventilation purposes is still distributed through ducts, the electrical energy for fans and pumps can be reduced to approximately 25 % of that of conventional air-conditioning system. This experiment studies the application of radiant cooling using natural air for ventilation under hot and humid climate of Rajasthan. To avoid condensation of moisture on the cooling panel, the temperature of water supplied to the panel was limited to dew point temperature. The results generally confirm the good potential for application of radiant cooling...|$|R

50|$|The {{area known}} as Brompton {{was no more than}} a village {{surrounded}} by market gardens, but quickly developed in the 1840s. The hospital acquired a market garden site there from a charity to erect a new hospital, with the architect being Frederick John Francis. The stone laying for the west wing was on 11 June 1844 by Prince Albert, the Prince Consort, the building being described as a beautiful Elizabethan building with red brick and blue diapering with Portland stone mouldings. One of the features of the building was the inclusion of <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> forced warm <b>air</b> in an attempt to create a temperature more commonly found in more southern latitudes. The total cost for the west wing and part of the centre was £11,762. The first admission of patients was in 1847, whilst the east wing was completed in 1849.|$|R

40|$|The {{methodology}} {{of protecting the}} European stained glass windows against environmental risk (e. g. meteorological factors, <b>air</b> pollution, microorganisms) <b>by</b> means of an external glazing is not new. In spite of many scientific studies {{carried out in the}} last 20 years, some questions were still up for discussion. The European VIDRIO (2002 – 2005) project gave an answer to these questions. The research carried out by the different project partners established a new multidisciplinary approach aimed at evaluating the efficiency of the protective glazing systems and their effects on stained glass windows conservation, and finally at assessing the most appropriate strategy to preserve stained glass windows. Scientific results showed that the so-called isothermal glazing (i. e. <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> the <b>air</b> coming from the inside of the building) protected efficiently the ancient stained glass window from environmental attack (i. e. rain, pollutants, condensation, thermal shocks) with very limited secondary effects. The scientific research highlighted that its efficiency was strongly related to the technical design of the protective system. In particular, the ventilation {{and the size of the}} interspace had to be carefully considered. The research developed within the VIDRIO project was turned into general recommendations to the owners and practitioners on the best practice for the stained glass windows future conservation...|$|R
40|$|Larger window {{openings}} in {{the walls of a}} building may provide better natural ventilation. However, it also increases the penetration of direct solar radiation into indoor environment. The use of wing wall, one of the green features, is an alternative to create effective natural ventilation. Givoni conducted experiments in a wind tunnel to study the ventilation performance of wing walls. This paper presents a numerical study of the ventilation performance of wing walls using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations are compared with the results of the experiments of Givoni. The results indicate that wing wall can promote natural <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> increasing the <b>air</b> change per hour and the mean indoor air speed relative to wind speed at various wind speeds and wind directions. The best performance of wing wall is at the wind angle of around 45 °. The study also shows that 3 D CFD simulation produces similar trend to the experimental results though there are some discrepancies. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|There is {{currently}} interest in banning {{some types of}} filament lamp in some countries, such as Australia planning to ban standard incandescent light bulbs by 2010, because they are inefficient at converting electricity to light. Sri Lanka has already banned importing filament bulbs because of high use of electricity and less light. Less than 3% of the input energy is converted into usable light. Nearly all of the input energy ends up as heat that, in warm climates, must then {{be removed from the}} building <b>by</b> <b>ventilation</b> or <b>air</b> conditioning, often resulting in more energy consumption. In colder climates where heating and lighting is required during the cold and dark winter months, the heat byproduct has at least some value.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) <b>air</b> <b>movers</b> {{are uniquely}} {{positioned}} {{to become a}} key emerging <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> technology to compete with mechanical rotary fans {{in the next generation}} of ultrathin consumer electronics thermal management, due to their form factor flexibility, low height capability, flow rates, and silent operation. However, as is true of many emerging technologies, EHD driven thermal management lacks the development of fundamental scaling and design rules, robust and mature design tools, and proof-of-concept demonstration of small-scale EHD systems for thermal management, which are needed to progress to the commercial sector. This dissertation, broken roughly into four parts, attempts to move EHD thermal management a step forward towards commercial application. The first, presents the development of design theory investigating the fundamental factors of pressure generation in EHD systems, transduction efficiency, and device scaling. The second presents a coupled-physics EHD numerical model and its results that take into account charge generation, charge transport, electrostatics, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer. The third presents simulations and experiential work focused on the development of a proof-of-concept meso/micro-scale EHD <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> for jet impingement forced convection cooling. The forth presents a proof-of-concept EHD thermal management solution embedded in a commercial notebook computer, demonstrating the ability to integrate an EHD thermal system into a modern notebook computer. Finally, key future efforts required to bring EHD thermal management technology to a successful commercial application are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|In churches, {{intentional}} airing may be {{a measure}} to evacuate temporarily high levels of contaminants that are emitted during services and other occasions. Crucial contaminants include moisture and other emissions that may deteriorate and/or soil painted surfaces and other precious artefacts.
