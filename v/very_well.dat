5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him <b>very</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E

5|$|After Ranga Rao died in 1801, {{there were}} efforts to merge Bobbili with Vizianagaram {{but these were}} thwarted and a lasting {{settlement}} of the property was made with the adopted son of Ranga Rao. Rayadappa and his son Svetachalapti who succeeded in 1830 and lived till 1862 managed their property <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> In {{the middle of the}} 19th century, successors of this lineage constructed the present Bobbili Fort, following their improved economic conditions.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> but generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic. The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E
5|$|Despite President Obama's {{winning the}} state easily, and winning {{all of the}} state's counties, this race was fairly close. As expected, Warren {{performed}} <b>very</b> <b>well</b> in Suffolk County, which {{is home to the}} state's largest city and its capital Boston. Brown performed well {{in the southern part of}} the state near Cape Cod. Warren made history by becoming the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate in the state of Massachusetts.|$|E

In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} good {{critical}} reception, the film {{did not perform}} <b>very</b> <b>well</b> at the box office, with only about 35,000 tickets sold domestically.
