40|$|An {{extended}} throat {{flow nozzle}} has been examined as a device for {{the measurement of}} very high void fraction (a ³ 0. 95) multi-phase flows. Due to its greater density and partial contact with the wall, the equilibrium velocity of the liquid phase appreciably lags that of the lighter gas phase. The two phases are strongly coupled resulting in pressure drops across the contraction and in the extended throat that are significantly different than those experienced in single-phase flow. Information about the mass flow rates of the two phases can be extracted from the measured pressure drops. The performance of an extended throat flow nozzle has been evaluated under multi-phase conditions using natural gas and hydrocarbon liquids at 400 and 500 psi. Two hydrocarbon solvents were used as the test liquids, Isopar MÒ (sp = 0. 79) and Aromatic 100 â (sp = 0. 87). These data are compared to prior air-water data at nominally 15 psi. The high and low pressure data {{were found to be}} consistent, confirming that the temperature, pressure, and size scaling of the extended <b>throat</b> <b>venturi</b> are correctly represented. This consistency allows different sized devices to be applied under different fluid conditions (temperature, pressure, gas and liquid phase composition, etc) with confidence...|$|R
50|$|Figure 3 shows liquid {{injected}} at the <b>venturi</b> <b>throat.</b> Since it is sprayed at or {{just before}} the throat, it does not actually coat the throat surface. These throats are susceptible to solids buildup when the throat is dry. They are also susceptible to abrasion by dust particles. These venturis are best used when the inlet stream is cool and moist. These venturis {{are referred to as}} having a non-wetted approach.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} liquid {{injection}} at the <b>venturi</b> <b>throat</b> {{can also cause}} problems.

However, spray nozzles can easily plug when liquid is recirculated. Automatic or manual reamers can be used to correct this problem. However, when heavy liquid slurries (either viscous or particle-loaded) are recirculated, open-wear injection is often necessary.|$|E

As with other types of venturis, a means of separating entrained liquid from the gas stream must be installed. Entrainment separators are commonly used to remove remaining small droplets.|$|E

The requirement for the <b>venturi</b> flow meters' <b>throat</b> diameters is approximately 0. 040 ". An early risk reduction activity conducted by MSFC revealed that a venturi flow meter produced by FOX with a throat diameter near 0. 040 " had much higher pressure loss than venturi flow meters with larger throat diameters and venturis of similar throat diameter size but with no pressure taps (i. e. venturis with a throat length to diameter ratio of zero). In response, a series of venturi flow meters was fabricated and flow tested to gain insight into pressure recovery as it is affected by pressure port diameter, throat length and diffuser angle {{in an effort to}} improve the performance of a venturi flow meter. This presentation provides a summary of the venturi flow meter development activity including: a description of the test's objectives, a detailed description of each venturi configuration, a description of the manufacturing processes of the venturis, and observations from the test data.

40|$|A multiple-throat venturi {{system has}} been invented for {{measuring}} laminar flow of air or other gas at low speed (1 to 30 cm/s) in a duct while preserving the laminar nature of the flow and keeping the velocity profile across the duct as nearly flat as possible. While means for measuring flows at higher speeds are well established, heretofore, {{there have been no}} reliable means for making consistent, accurate measurements in this speed range. In the original application for which this system was invented, the duct leads into the test section of a low-speed wind tunnel wherein uniform, low-speed, laminar flow is required for scientific experiments. The system could also be used to monitor a slow flow of gas in an industrial process like chemical vapor deposition. In the original application, the multiple- <b>throat</b> <b>venturi</b> system is mounted at the inlet end of the duct having a rectangular cross section of 19 by 14 cm, just upstream of an assembly of inlet screens and flow straighteners that help to suppress undesired flow fluctuations (see Figure 1). The basic venturi measurement principle is well established: One measures the difference in pressure between (1) a point just outside the inlet, where the pressure is highest and the kinetic energy lowest; and (2) the narrowest part (the <b>throat)</b> of the <b>venturi</b> passage, where the kinetic energy is highest and the pressure is lowest. Then by use of Bernoulli s equation for the relationship between pressure and kinetic energy, the volumetric flow speed in the duct can be calculated from the pressure difference and the inlet and throat widths. The design of this system represents a compromise among length, pressure recovery, uniformity of flow, and complexity of assembly. Traditionally, venturis are used to measure faster flows in narrower cross sections, with longer upstream and downstream passages to maintain accuracy. The dimensions of the passages of the present venturi system are sized to provide a readily measurable pressure drop. Multiple throats are used to minimize the length needed to recover internal energy and enable the velocity profile to recover to near flatness...|$|R
50|$|Venturi {{scrubbers}} {{consist of}} a venturi-shaped inlet and separator. The dust-laden gases venturi scrubber enter through the venturi and are accelerated to speeds between 12,000 and 36,000 ft/min (60.97-182.83 m/s). These high-gas velocities immediately atomize the coarse water spray, which is injected radially into the <b>venturi</b> <b>throat,</b> into fine droplets. High energy and extreme turbulence promote collision between water droplets and dust particulates in the throat. The agglomeration process between particle and droplet continues in the diverging section of the venturi. The large agglomerates formed in the venturi are then removed by an inertial separator.|$|E
40|$|A {{careful study}} of the {{existing}} literature available {{in the field of}} cavitation reveals the potential of ultrasonics as a tool for controlling and, if possible, eliminating certain types of hydrodynamic cavitation through the manipulation of nuclei size present in a flow. A glass venturi is taken to be an ideal device to study the cavitation phenomenon at its throat and its potential control. A piezoelectric transducer, driven at the crystal resonant frequency, is used to generate an acoustic pressure field and is termed an ï¿½ultrasonic nuclei manipulator (UNM) ï¿½. Electrolysis bubbles serve as artificial nuclei to produce travelling bubble cavitation at the <b>venturi</b> <b>throat</b> {{in the absence of a}} UNM but this cavitation is completely eliminated when a UNM is operative. This is made possible because the nuclei, which pass through the acoustic field first, cavitate, collapse violently and perhaps fragment and go into dissolution before reaching the <b>venturi</b> <b>throat.</b> Thus, the potential nuclei for travelling bubble cavitation at the <b>venturi</b> <b>throat</b> seem to be systematically destroyed through acoustic cavitation near the UNM. From the solution to the bubble dynamics equation, it has been shown that the potential energy of a bubble at its maximum radius due to an acoustic field is negligible compared to that for the hydrodynamic field. Hence, even though the control of hydrodynamic macro cavitation achieved in this way is at the expense of acoustic micro cavitation, it can still be considered to be a significant gain. These are some of the first results in this direction...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCavitation is a {{phenomenon}} of classical interest which {{can be observed in}} various applications. It consists in a transition of phase due to a pressure drop under the saturation pressure of a liquid. The unsteady behavior of this phenomenon leads to generate some issues such as erosion, noise or vibrations: as a result the comprehension of the cavity dynamics remains of crucial importance. Unsteady cavitation has been investigated in numerous studies and a mechanism of re-entrant jet has been firstly identified as responsible of the cavity shedding process. Recently, a second shedding mechanism, induced by a shock wave propagation due to the condensation of vapor structures, has been experimentally highlighted with X-ray measurements [1]. The present paper focuses on the experimental detection, with a wavelet method, of these two shedding features on 2 D image sequences recorded with a high-speed camera about a double transparent horizontal Venturi nozzle with 18 • / 8 • con-vergent/divergent angles respectively.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professor Timothy A. SheddDue to price constraints, small engines rely on inexpensive and mechanically-simple de- vices for air-fuel mixture formation: carburetors. A typical carburetor consists of {{a complex set of}} internal passages designed to deliver to the engine the correct air-fuel mixture ac- cording to speed and load. This goal is achieved through several physical processes: flows through passages of short length and complex geometry; flows that transition from laminar to turbulent; high-frequency pulsating flow; two-phase flow of various forms, i. e., bubbles, sprays and thin liquid films; and flows with changing fuel and air properties due to rapid changes in temperature and pressure. This study addressed the theoretical modeling of the phenomena inside the main circuit typically found in small engine carburetors. This theo- retical study was done in two steps: first, a general one-dimensional model of the fuel flow as a flow network was derived. This model contains the characterization of the dynamic flow in single-phase elements and the appropriate two-phase flow model for the small diameter pipes. The model was implemented into a one-dimensional engine simulation software, and used to perform sensitivity analyses of carburetor performance as function of carburetor parts. The second part of the study contains the CFD analysis of the most important parts found in the sensitivity analysis: the main fuel orifice and the carburetor venturi. The CFD studies allowed {{to gain a better understanding}} of the flow characteristics in these elements,and their results were used to develop engineering correlations that may be implemented in the one-dimensional model. It was found that the flow in the small metering orifices behaves like a small pipe, which may be characterized with an inlet pressure loss coefficient and a Darcy friction factor. The analysis of the carburetor venturi showed that the flow may be considered isentropic from the inlet of the venturi to the <b>venturi</b> <b>throat.</b> Besides the throttle plate, the fuel tube is the most important part controlling the flow field and the pressure losses downstream of the <b>venturi</b> <b>throat...</b>|$|E

The Venturi meter is a favoured device for the metering of the unprocessed wet natural gas production flows. Various combinations of techniques have been employed in annular gas-liquid two phase flows to measure the flow parameters (e. g. liquid film thickness, gas volume fraction and the phase flow rates). One of the most useful techniques which has proven attractive for many multiphase flow applications is the electrical conductance technique. This paper presents an advanced Conductance Venturi Meter which is capable of measuring the gas volume fractions at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi.

We measure conductance using two ring electrodes flush with the inner surface of the <b>Venturi</b> <b>throat</b> and two ring electrodes flush with the inner surface of the Venturi inlet. The basic operation of the electrical conductance technique in a multiphase flow is that the conductance of the mixture depends on the gas volume fraction in the water. An electronic circuit was built and calibrated to give a dc voltage output which is proportional to the conductance of the mixture which can then be related to the water film thickness in annular flow...|$|E
