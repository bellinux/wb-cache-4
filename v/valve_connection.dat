50|$|The {{explosion}} {{occurred during}} a propane transfer from a Doxol railroad {{car to a}} storage tank on the Getz rail siding near Andy Devine Avenue/Route 66. The incident began when a railroad worker attempted to tighten a leaking connection by hitting a wrench with another wrench or a hammer; this caused a spark that ignited the leaking propane gas. The initial fire badly burned the two railroad employees present, one of whom later died from his burns. The burning propane gas escaping from the <b>valve</b> <b>connection</b> on the rail car quickly heated the liquid propane inside, increasing the tank pressure. This in turn increased the leak and fire, further heating the tank car.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectieves. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether wall motion abnormalities are present before or after the Fontan procedure in patients with a univentricular heart of the left ventricular type with an absent right atrioventricular <b>valve</b> <b>connection</b> (tricuspid atresia) and to assess the impact of such abnormalities on ventricular performance and clinical outcome. Background. Normal systolic and diastolic ventricular (unction is critical for a successful Fontan repair. However, there have been no previous studies addressing the relation between regional ventricular function and hemodynamic factors. Methods. Thirty-seven pediatric patients were studied with biplane ventricular cineangiography. There were 20 male and 17 female patients whose mean age at the time of the Fontan operation was 6. 5 ± 3. 5 years (range 2. 5 to 15. 6). Eighteen patients were studied preoperatively, 25 at > 1 year postoperatively and 6 serially. Wall motion was assessed by a centerline method. Normal ranges for wall motion and other variables were established from 25 normal subjects. Results. Wall motion abnormalities were observed in 2 of 18 patients preoperatively and in 11 of 25 patients postoperatively. Age at operation and ventricular volumes did not differ between postoperative patients who had normal (group I, 14 patients) or abnormal (group II, 11 patients) wall motion. However, ventricular mass and the mass/volume ratio were significantly greater and systolic variables and cardiac index were significantly lower in group II versus group I. Two patients in group I were considered to have a clinically poor outcome (persistent heart failure), and five in group II had heart failure, including one who died late. Conclusions. These observations suggest that postoperative regional wall motion abnormalities in this setting are not rare, may be related to excessive hypertrophy and may contribute to cardiac dysfunction and a poor clinical outcome...|$|E

40|$|The first (Phase- 1) {{commissioning}} of SuperKEKB, an asymmetric-energy electron-positron collider at KEK, {{began in}} February 2016, {{after more than}} five years of upgradation work on KEKB and successfully ended in June 2016. A major task of the Phase- 1 commissioning was the vacuum scrubbing of new beam pipes in anticipation of a sufficiently long beam lifetime and low background noise in the next commissioning, prior to which a new particle detector will be installed. The pressure rise per unit beam current decreased steadily with increasing beam dose, as expected. Another important task was to check the stabilities of various new vacuum components at high beam currents of approximately 1  A. The temperature increases of the bellows chambers, gate <b>valves,</b> <b>connection</b> flanges, and so on were less than several degrees at 1  A, and no serious problems were found. The effectiveness of the antechambers and TiN coating in suppressing the electron-cloud effect (ECE) in the positron ring was also confirmed. However, the ECE in the Al-alloy bellows chambers was observed where TiN had not been coated. The use of permanent magnets to create an axial magnetic field of approximately 100  G successfully suppressed this effect. Pressure bursts accompanying beam losses were also frequently observed in the positron ring. This phenomenon is still under investigation, but it is likely caused by collisions between the circulating beams and dust particles, especially in the dipole magnet beam pipes...|$|R
40|$|Great {{water losses}} in the {{internal}} plumbing of a building lead to the waste of money for a fence, purification and supply of water volumes in excess. This {{does not support the}} concept of water conservation and resource saving lying today in the basis of any building’s construction having plumbing. Leakage means unplanned of water losses systems in domestic water supply systems (hot or cold) as a result of impaired integrity, complicating the operation of a system and leading to high costs of repair and equipment restoration. A large number of leaks occur in old buildings, where the regulatory service life of pipelines has come to an end, and the scheduled repair for some reason has not been conducted. Steel pipelines are used in the systems without any protection from corrosion and they get out of order. Leakages in new houses are also not uncommon. They usually occur as a result of low-quality adjustment of the system by workers. It also important to note the absence of certain skills of plumbers, who don’t conduct the inspections of in-house systems in time. Sometimes also the residents themselves forget to keep their pipeline systems and water fittings in their apartment in good condition. Plumbers are not systematically invited for preventive examinations to detect possible leaks in the domestic plumbing. The amount of unproductive losses increases while simultaneous use of valve tenants, and at the increase of the number of residents in the building. Water leaks in the system depend on the amount of water system piping damages, and damages of other elements, for example, water <b>valves,</b> <b>connections,</b> etc. The pressure in the leak area also plays an important role...|$|R

When welding is necessary a hyperbaric welding chamber may be fitted around the pipeline so that welding {{can be done in}} an inert gaseous environment rather than wet, as this improves the weld quality. Depending on circumstances, the chamber may be large enough for the welder to work inside, but as the chamber must be accessed at depth and is under ambient pressure, the work must be done by a diver.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Automated radiosynthesizers {{are vital}} for routine {{production}} of positron-emission tomography tracers to minimize radiation exposure to operators {{and to ensure}} reproducible synthesis yields. The recent trend in the synthesizer industry towards the use of disposable kits aims to simplify setup and operation for the user, but often introduces several limitations related to temperature and chemical compatibility, thus requiring reoptimization of protocols developed on non-cassette-based systems. Radiochemists would benefit from a single hybrid system that provides tremendous flexibility for development and optimization of reaction conditions while also providing a pathway to simple, cassette-based production of diverse tracers. METHODS: We have designed, built, and tested an automated three-reactor radiosynthesizer (ELIXYS) to provide a flexible radiosynthesis platform suitable for both tracer development and routine production. The synthesizer is capable of performing high-pressure and high-temperature reactions by eliminating permanent tubing and <b>valve</b> <b>connections</b> to the reaction vessel. Each of the three movable reactors can seal against different locations on disposable cassettes to carry out different functions such as sealed reactions, evaporations, and reagent addition. A reagent and gas handling robot moves sealed reagent vials from storage locations in the cassette to addition positions and also dynamically provides vacuum and inert gas to ports on the cassette. The software integrates these automated features into chemistry unit operations (e. g., React, Evaporate, Add) to intuitively create synthesis protocols. 2 -Deoxy- 2 -[18 F]fluoro- 5 -methyl-β-l-arabinofuranosyluracil (l-[18 F]FMAU) and 2 -deoxy- 2 -[18 F]fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (d-[18 F]FAC) were synthesized to validate the system. RESULTS: l-[18 F]FMAU and d-[18 F]FAC were successfully synthesized in 165 and 170 min, respectively, with decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 46 % ± 1 % (n = 6) and 31 % ± 5 % (n = 6), respectively. The yield, repeatability, and synthesis time are comparable to, or better than, other reports. d-[18 F]FAC produced by ELIXYS and another manually operated apparatus exhibited similar biodistribution in wild-type mice. CONCLUSION: The ELIXYS automated radiosynthesizer is capable of performing radiosyntheses requiring demanding conditions: up to three reaction vessels, high temperatures, high pressures, and sensitive reagents. Such flexibility facilitates tracer development {{and the ability to}} synthesize multiple tracers on the same system without customization or replumbing.
