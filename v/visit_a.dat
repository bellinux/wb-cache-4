40|$|Objectives. To {{determine}} {{factors associated}} with routine dental attendance in Aboriginal Australians. Methods. Data of 271 Aboriginal adults residing in Australia’s Northern Territory were used. Routine dental attendance was defined as last <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> dentist {{less than one year}} ago or <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> dentist for a check-up. Both bivariate and multivariable analytical techniques were used. Results. While 27 % <b>visited</b> <b>a</b> dentist in the past year, 29 % of these <b>visited</b> for <b>a</b> check-up. In bivariate analysis, being female, low psychological distress, and low clinical attachment loss (CAL) were associated with <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> dentist within last year. Being aged younger than 39 years, male, no oral health impairment, being caries-free, low CAL, and low apolipoprotein B were associated with <b>visiting</b> for <b>a</b> check-up. Clinical attachment loss remained associated with <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> dentist less than one year ago while being younger than 39 years and having no oral health impairment remained associated with usually <b>visiting</b> for <b>a</b> check-up in multivariable analysis. Conclusions. Younger age, [End Page 67] no oral health impairment, and low CAL were associated with routine dental attendance among Indigenous Australians.
