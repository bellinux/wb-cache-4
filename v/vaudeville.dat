5|$|Like the extravaganza and the burlesque, {{the variety}} {{show was a}} comic and ribald production, popular from the middle {{to the end of}} the 19th century, at which time it had evolved into <b>vaudeville.</b> This form was innovated by {{producers}} like Tony Pastor who tried to encourage women and children to attend his shows; they were hesitant because the theater had long been the domain of a rough and disorderly crowd. By the early 20th century, <b>vaudeville</b> was a respected entertainment for women and children, and songwriters like Gus Edwards wrote songs that were popular across the country. The most popular <b>vaudeville</b> shows were, like the Ziegfeld Follies, a series of songs and skits that had a profound effect on the subsequent development of Broadway musical theater and the songs of Tin Pan Alley.|$|E
5|$|Richard Smith {{was active}} in the field of comedy, and participated in the <b>vaudeville</b> scene. He met his wife Alice Howell when {{she was a member of}} a {{production}} by DeWolf Hopper, in 1910. The two utilized the title of a previously known <b>vaudeville</b> group, and performed together as Howell and Howell. The Howell and Howell duo performed together for three years. Their performances included burlesque and <b>vaudeville.</b> Mack Sennett directed Smith at the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company in New York City. Sennett offered Smith a chance to go with him when he started the company Keystone Studios, but he declined the opportunity.|$|E

5|$|Although never gaining wide fame, Ali had a {{dedicated}} following on the <b>vaudeville</b> circuit in the United States. He performed for {{heads of state}} including Tsar NicholasII of Russia. Judy Garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and David Blaine identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of his act were captured in the short film Strange as It Seems (1930) and in Politiquerias (1931), the Spanish-language version of Laurel and Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's <b>Vaudeville.</b> Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the Rockefeller Institute had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to Johns Hopkins University for study, though the offer was declined.|$|E
5|$|Baker {{attended}} Greensburg Salem High School in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, {{where she}} was a debate team member and active in the marching band and school musicals. At 18, she moved with her family to St. Petersburg, Florida, where she attended St. Petersburg College (then St. Pete Junior College). After her first year in college, Baker began working as a magician's assistant on the <b>vaudeville</b> circuit and joined a dance company, working as a professional dancer. In 1949, Baker won the title of Miss Florida Fruits and Vegetables. In 1951, Baker moved to New York City, where she rented a dirt-floor basement apartment in Queens. She worked as a nightclub dancer and also took stint jobs as a chorus girl in traveling <b>vaudeville</b> shows, which took her to Windsor, Detroit, and New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|Being {{sick of the}} {{negative}} typecasting that had enveloped her throughout her American career, Anna May Wong visited Australia for over 3 months in 1939.

5|$|Following {{the grand}} opening, the theatre {{served as a}} venue for <b>vaudeville</b> and film, and {{following}} the decline of <b>vaudeville</b> as a movie palace until the 1970s. With the economic recession, the advent of television, and movie complex development in the suburbs, crowds dwindled and the theatre struggled to stay open. It was forced to close its doors in 1978 along with the nearby Orpheum theatre. A variety of re-use possibilities were proposed for the theatre including a Chinese restaurant, a triplex movie theater, an office building, or a shopping center. The city of Seattle was unable to protect the theatre as a designated landmark because of its unique position {{on the site of}} the original territorial university grounds owned by the state of Washington.|$|E

5|$|Seattle {{was also}} the home base of {{impresario}} Alexander Pantages who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting <b>vaudeville</b> acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on {{and became one of}} America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival John Considine, Seattle was for a while the western United States' <b>vaudeville</b> mecca. B. Marcus Priteca, the Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the Pantages name; Seattle's surviving Paramount Theatre, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.|$|E

5|$|Walton's {{only other}} opera, The Bear, {{based on a}} comic <b>vaudeville</b> by Chekhov, is judged by critics as much more successful. It is, however, a one-act piece, a genre not {{regularly}} staged at most opera houses, and so is infrequently seen. Operabase records four productions of the piece worldwide between 2013 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} {{politically active}} {{in the years following}} the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten <b>vaudeville</b> comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{announced}} in March 1942 {{that his brother}} William and he were setting up Cagney Productions to release films though United Artists.

The Victoria closed and a parking garage was built in its place.|$|E
