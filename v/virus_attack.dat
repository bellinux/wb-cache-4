2500|$|The {{apparent}} {{deaths of}} Adam and Eve throws the machine network into chaos, prompting YoRHa {{to launch a}} full-scale invasion. 2B and 9S form part of the vanguard, but a logic <b>virus</b> <b>attack</b> turns every YoRHa unit aside from 2B and 9S hostile. The two retreat to the Bunker, which is subsequently overrun—the [...] "glitch" [...] 9S encountered {{was in fact a}} hole opening in YoRHa's virus defenses, leaving the entire squadron vulnerable. Infected herself, the Commander orders 2B and 9S to the surface then self-destructs the Bunker. 2B and 9S are forced to separate on the descent when attacked by rogue YoRHa, and 2B ends up infected with a logic virus. Saved from rogue YoRHa by A2, 2B uploads her memories into her sword and tasks A2 with completing her mission. 9S sees A2 kill 2B, and ignorant of their interaction swears revenge against A2. Alongside this, a structure called the Tower created by the machines rises above the land. The story then divides between A2 and 9S, with their respective Pods 042 and 153 interacting with each other.|$|E
2500|$|A2 {{continues}} 2B's missions {{against the}} machines. During her story, Pascal's village is attacked when machines begin going berserk, and when A2 and Pascal fight off a machine attack the [...] "children" [...] of his village commit suicide {{in fear of}} being killed. A2 has the option of either wiping Pascal's memory at his request, killing him, or leaving him. Meanwhile, 9S investigates the Tower and its purpose: he learns that androids and machines are constructed from the same materials, and the Tower is preparing to launch something he assumes is a missile directed at the server on the moon. During his quest, 9S is tormented {{by the loss of}} YoRHa and 2B, and becomes emotionally and mentally unstable. 9S eventually gains access to the Tower with help from Devola and Popola, who sacrifice themselves to fend off the attacking machines—they are revealed to be the last surviving versions of the android type that triggered the end of humanity, thus suffering persecution by other androids. [...] They are programmed to feel perpetual guilt and try to atone for their actions. A2 follows 9S inside, where the machines' controlling artificial intelligence confronts them both—A2's backstory as the survivor of a precursor unit to the YoRHa that was designed to be destroyed is revealed, and 9S learns that the logic <b>virus</b> <b>attack</b> on YoRHa was part of the plan to perpetuate the ruse of humanity's survival and trap both machines and androids in a repeating cycle of war.|$|E

30|$|With the {{increasing}} attention to multi-hop network, {{it may become}} one of the main targets of <b>viruses</b> <b>attack</b> in the future. Faced with <b>attack</b> from <b>viruses,</b> it is important to master virus spreading behaviors in multi-hop network. It can help us to take measures to reduce the loss caused by <b>viruses</b> <b>attack.</b> Therefore, devising <b>virus</b> spreading models for multi-hop network is an important research area. In this paper, classic susceptible-infected (SI) model, susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model are applied to multi-hop network based on random way-point (RWP) model [7 – 9] to analyze virus spreading behaviors. Simulation results show a special node speed that can lead network to appear the fastest-spreading virus phenomenon is approximately equal to the ratio of communication radius of node to contact duration of virus. Distribution density of node and the number of initial infected nodes almost do not affect the special speed. Simulation results of this paper are of practical value for the analysis of virus spreading and give a deeper understanding of virus spreading behaviors in multi-hop network.|$|R

50|$|Virtual disk {{images can}} be stored in a special format (qcow or qcow2) that only take up disk space that the guest OS {{actually}} uses. This way, an emulated 120 GB disk may occupy only a few hundred megabytes on the host. The QCOW2 format also allows the creation of overlay images that record the difference from another (unmodified) base image file. This provides the possibility for reverting the emulated disk's contents to an earlier state. For example, a base image could hold a fresh install of an operating system that is known to work, and the overlay images are used. Should the guest system become unusable (through <b>virus</b> <b>attack,</b> accidental system destruction, etc), the user can delete the overlay and reconstruct an earlier emulated disk-image version.|$|E
