40|$|This poster {{will provide}} an {{overview}} of the development of an open-access digital musicology project, The Encoded Medieval Antiphoner: an Open Access Digital Source for Music and Liturgical Scholarship at Boston College. This is a collaborative project between the Digital Scholarship Group and library staff at the Boston College University Libraries, musicologist Dr. Michael Noone, research assistants, and several external partners, including CANTUS database staff. In the summer of 2015 we began encoding a 14 th century Franciscan Antiphoner using the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), as well as developing an open-access site to present the manuscript as an interactive object for research and scholarly use. The original Antiphoner is in manuscript form bound between leather-covered boards containing 119 parchment folios with text and notation for antiphons and responsories for the entire annual calendar of saints’ days (sanctorale). This poster will explain our process and workflows, which have involved transcribing and encoding over 1500 musical incipits, texts, and metadata, contributing the data to the CANTUS database, a highly-respected digital archive and index of chants, as well as, implementing open-source software for a presentation layer and search/retrieval of the content. The digitized object will be presented using Diva. js an open-source software that connects with the API of the CANTUS database to pull in metadata, transcribed music notation, and bibliographic data that we have contributed to this database. We will also present a variety of functionality options that will make this Antiphoner interactive. Additionally, this poster will highlight the collaborative aspect of this project and several positive outcomes, such as an interest to investigate rendering neume notation using Verovio rather than Volpiano font. Verovio is a software that renders MEI directly in a modern browser as SVG (scalable vector graphics: XML-based <b>vector</b> <b>image</b> <b>format)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|In many ways, Vector Architect {{was similar}} to Microsoft Expression Design, {{offering}} manipulation of native WPF objects, as opposed to performing conversion to XAML. Editing native objects is often necessary as XAML does not have exactly the same feature set as other popular <b>vector</b> <b>image</b> <b>formats</b> such as SVG and SWF, making the conversion process lossy in many cases. Although primarily focused on XAML, Vector Architect also supported the generation of PNG images with alpha channels, {{as well as the}} creation of icons containing alpha-blended images at multiple resolutions.|$|R
25|$|Microsoft {{submitted}} {{several other}} features of IE for consideration by the W3C for standardization. These include the 'behaviour' CSS property, which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviours (known as HTML Components, HTC); HTML+TIME profile, which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents (similar to the W3C XHTML+SMIL), and the VML vector graphics file format. However, all were rejected, {{at least in}} their original forms; VML was subsequently combined with PGML (proposed by Adobe and Sun), resulting in the W3C-approved SVG format, {{one of the few}} <b>vector</b> <b>image</b> <b>formats</b> being used on the web, which IE did not support until version 9.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} between bitmap fonts and outline fonts {{is similar to}} the {{difference between}} bitmap and <b>vector</b> <b>image</b> file <b>formats.</b> Bitmap fonts are like <b>image</b> <b>formats</b> such as Windows Bitmap (.bmp), Portable Network Graphics (.png) and Tagged <b>Image</b> <b>Format</b> (.tif or [...]tiff), which store the image data as a grid of pixels, in some cases with compression. Outline or stroke <b>image</b> <b>formats</b> such as Windows Metafile format (.wmf) and Scalable Vector Graphics format (.svg), store instructions in the form of lines and curves of how to draw the image rather than storing the image itself.|$|R

Some programs are more suitable for artistic work while others are better for technical drawings. Another important factor is the application's support of various <b>vector</b> and bitmap <b>image</b> <b>formats</b> for import and export.|$|R
50|$|Hollywood has {{its roots}} on the Amiga computer. Inspired by Amiga {{programming}} languages like AMOS, Blitz BASIC, and Amiga E, Hollywood author Andreas Falkenhahn began development of Hollywood in Spring 2002 after finishing his A-levels. Version 1.0 of the software was released in November 2002, but only for 68000-based Amiga systems. A month later, a native version for the PowerPC-based MorphOS followed. Support for WarpOS was introduced with Hollywood 1.9 which appeared in Spring 2004 together with the first release of the Hollywood Designer, a tool {{which can be used}} to create presentations with Hollywood. AmigaOS 4 is supported since March 2005. Starting with version 2.0 (released in January 2006), Hollywood is using the Lua programming language as its virtual machine, but with significant modifications in syntax and functionality. Starting with version 3.0 (January 2008), Hollywood for the first time also runs on two non Amiga inspired operating systems: Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Since version 4.5 (January 2010) Hollywood is also available with an integrated development environment on Windows. Since version 4.8 (April 2011) Hollywood can also compile executables for Linux. Hollywood 5.0 was released in February 2012 and introduces support for video playback and <b>vector</b> <b>image</b> <b>formats</b> like SVG. Starting with version 5.2 Hollywood also supports Android. Hollywood 6.0 was released in February 2015 and introduces support for OpenGL programming via a dedicated plugin as well as support for the Raspberry Pi. Hollywood 7.0 was released in March 2017 and introduces Unicode support and support for 64-bit architectures.|$|R
40|$|Set {{comparisons}} permeate a {{large number}} of data analysis workflows, in particular workflows in biological sciences. Venn diagrams are frequently employed for such analysis but current tools are limited. We have developed InteractiVenn, a more flexible tool for interacting with Venn diagrams including up to six sets. It offers a clean interface for Venn diagram construction and enables analysis of set unions while preserving the shape of the diagram. Set unions are useful to reveal differences and similarities among sets and may be guided in our tool by a tree or by a list of set unions. The tool also allows obtaining subsets' elements, saving and loading sets for further analyses, and exporting the diagram in <b>vector</b> and <b>image</b> <b>formats.</b> InteractiVenn has been used to analyze two biological datasets, but it may serve set analysis in a broad range of domains. InteractiVenn allows set unions in Venn diagrams to be explored thoroughly, by consequence extending the ability to analyze combinations of sets with additional observations, yielded by novel interactions between joined sets. InteractiVenn is freely available online at: www. interactivenn. net...|$|R
50|$|ImageMagick is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster <b>image</b> and <b>vector</b> <b>image</b> files. It can read and write over 200 <b>image</b> file <b>formats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many <b>image</b> <b>formats</b> are supported, {{including}} JPEG, JPEG2000, GIF, PNG, TIFF, TGA, OpenEXR, BMP, ICO, PDF, PICT, ICNS, {{and some}} raw digital camera types. Images are maintained {{in their native}} form {{for as long as}} possible before rasterizing for display. This means that Quartz Composer will keep <b>vector</b> <b>images</b> as <b>vectors</b> when cropping, scaling, rotating, or translating which allows it to work with very large logical image dimensions without consuming large amounts of memory or processing time. Such functionality is most apparent when working with text-based images, or PDFs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Clip art {{databases}} can {{be composed}} by raster im-ages or by vector drawings. There are technologies for searching and retrieving clip arts for both <b>image</b> <b>formats</b> but {{research has been}} done separately, focusing on either format, without taking benefits of both research fields as a whole. This paper describes a study where the benefits of combining information extracted from <b>vector</b> and raster <b>images</b> to retrieve clip arts are evaluated and discussed. Color and texture features are extracted from raster images and geometry and topology features are extracted from <b>vector</b> <b>images.</b> The paper presents several comparisons between different combinations with several descriptors.

40|$|Webmapping {{allows us}} now to network tools {{originally}} integrated into GIS desk software. They can be found under free licence, {{with some of them}} in open source, and answer to the needs of scientific research as well as to their financial budgets. Research centers, corporations or institutions interested must at first define their expectations in order to elaborate the appropriate GIS to put online. With the use of static maps in HTML, <b>vector</b> <b>images</b> in SVG <b>format,</b> <b>image</b> managing with the Applet Java or the designated map servers, it is possible to create complete and complex maps. An administrator can easily adapt the interface and the tools available to the user’s needs. These solutions are compatible with the format of the files generated by other applications and do not require a meltdown of map files in order to be switched onto a new format. These programs can be associated with others available in open source such as GeoServer, in Java language, and MapServer, programmable in C++. Acting as a transactional interface, the GeoServer system consists in stocking and editing spatial objects into a network. MapServer is an asset for customizing and advancing the broadcasting tools for online dynamic maps. This year we have successfully presented our Master 2 University project in Paris Panthéon-Sorbonne entitled NeoArcheo. It puts into practice the web tools and services mentioned above...|$|R

50|$|For <b>vector</b> <b>images,</b> {{there is}} no {{equivalent}} of resampling an image when it is resized, and {{there is no}} PPI in the file because it is resolution independent (prints equally well at all sizes). However, there is still a target printing size. Some <b>image</b> <b>formats,</b> such as Photoshop format, can contain both bitmap and vector data in the same file. Adjusting the PPI in a Photoshop file will change the intended printing size of the bitmap portion of the data and also change the intended printing size of the vector data to match. This way the vector and bitmap data maintain a consistent size relationship when the target printing size is changed. Text stored as outline fonts in bitmap <b>image</b> <b>formats</b> is handled in the same way. Other formats, such as PDF, are primarily vector formats which can contain images, potentially at a mixture of resolutions. In these formats the target PPI of the bitmaps is adjusted to match when the target print size of the file is changed. This is the converse of how it works in a primarily bitmap format like Photoshop, but has exactly the same result of maintaining the relationship between the vector and bitmap portions of the data.|$|R
