5|$|Increasing {{professional}} obligations {{after the}} birth of his first son in 1987 coincided with a reduction in his literary output. During the 1990s he instead focused his attention on his novel Feuers Geraun. Two early <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> novel's chapters were published by the Upper Austrian magazine die Rampe in 1994 (Der Schreiber von Aram) and 1997 (Das Gesetz). These chapters deal with Jewish and biblical traditions. The publishing list on Ebner's website lists only six publications in anthologies by 2004, but seventeen are listed from between 2005 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{salad is}} {{typically}} made with finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Although popularized by the kibbutzim, <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E

Castle Ploskovice in Ploskovice supplied {{the exterior of the}} gothic mansion.

5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} {{the notion of}} original sin. All <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden. The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings, maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E
5|$|The {{special-purpose}} card, Airport Express Tourist Octopus, {{was introduced}} by Octopus Cards Limited to target tourists in Hong Kong. Two <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> card are offered, a HK$220 card with a free single ride on the Airport Express, the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) train line that runs between the Hong Kong International Airport and the urban areas of Hong Kong, and a HK$300 card with two free single rides included. The airport journeys are valid for 180 days from the date of purchase. Both versions allow three days of unlimited rides on the MTR and include a HK$50 refundable deposit. Usable value on these cards may be added if necessary. These tourist Octopus cards may be used only by tourists staying in Hong Kong for 14 or fewer days; users {{may be required to}} produce a passport showing their arrival date in Hong Kong. Airport Express Tourist Octopus is available for purchase at all MTR stations.|$|E

5|$|The insertion-loss {{method of}} {{designing}} filters is, in essence, to prescribe a desired function of frequency for the filter as an attenuation {{of the signal}} when the filter is inserted between the terminations relative to the level {{that would have been}} received were the terminations connected to each other via an ideal transformer perfectly matching them. <b>Versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> theory are due to Sidney Darlington, Wilhelm Cauer and others all working more or less independently and is often taken as synonymous with network synthesis. Butterworth's filter implementation is, in those terms, an insertion-loss filter, but it is a relatively trivial one mathematically since the active amplifiers used by Butterworth ensured that each stage individually worked into a resistive load. Butterworth's filter becomes a non-trivial example when it is implemented entirely with passive components. An even earlier filter which influenced the insertion-loss method was Norton's dual-band filter where the input of two filters are connected in parallel and designed so that the combined input presents a constant resistance. Norton's design method, together with Cauer's canonical LC networks and Darlington's theorem that only LC components were required {{in the body of the}} filter resulted in the insertion-loss method. However, ladder topology proved to be more practical than Cauer's canonical forms.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} game's {{projected}} release date of December 19, 1986, {{the staff members}} worked overtime and often stayed in the office at night. They used torn cardboard boxes as beds, and covered themselves in curtains to resist the low temperatures of the unheated development building. Eventually, Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was finished and entered production a mere {{three days before the}} release date. Several ideas for additional stages had to be dropped because of these scheduling conflicts. In February and July 1987, respectively, a cartridge-based version was published for the NES in Europe and North America under the name Kid Icarus. For this release, the graphics of the ending were updated, and staff credits were added to the game. Unlike Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena, which saves the player's progress on the Disk Card, Kid Icarus uses a password system to return to a game after the console was turned off. In August 2004, Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was re-released as part of the Famicom Mini Disk System Selection for the Game Boy Advance. The game was published internationally for the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007. The North American, European and Australian <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> digital release have the cheat codes of the NES version removed.|$|E
