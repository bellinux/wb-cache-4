Republicans then tried to pass a second privileged resolution (H.Res.612) which would have rebuked Murtha for not showing the proper degree of respect as Speaker pro tempore to Rep. Sesenbrenner and misusing his power as chair. However, Majority Leader Hoyer sought a motion to table that second resolution. Minority Leader Boehner expressed outrage that the motion to table was brought to <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>without</b> <b>an</b> hour of <b>debate,</b> which should have begun when Hoyer stated [...] "Enough is enough" [...] in response to the GOP resolutions. (video here) Democrats were able to table the resolution, claiming that Hoyer's remarks were not official since the presiding Speaker, Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-Calif.) had not recognized the Majority Leader. Republican members then shouted [...] "Coverup! Coverup!" [...] as a response to Hoyer's remarks being stricken from the record. The next day, on August 4, Democrats again tabled a resolution (H.Res.623) offered by Republicans that would have expanded the newly created Select Committee's inquiry to include the August 3 omission of Hoyer's comment.|$|R

25|$|All bills must {{go through}} three {{readings}} in Parliament and receive the President's assent to become an Act of Parliament. The first reading is a mere formality, during which a bill is introduced <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate.</b> The bill is considered has having been read after the MP introducing it has read aloud its long title and laid {{a copy of it}} on the Table of the House, and the Clerk of Parliament has read out its short title. Copies of the bill are then distributed to MPs, and it is published in the Government Gazette for the public's information. The bill is then scheduled for its second reading.|$|R
5|$|In Roman {{constitutional}} law, the assemblies are {{a sovereign}} authority, {{with the power}} to enact or reject any law, confer any magistracies, and make any decision. In fact, with a single law, they held the authority to override the norms and precedents of the Republic as well as ancient laws long unchanged. There are two necessary components to any assembly: (1) the convening magistrate and (2) the citizens in the assembly itself. Assemblies did not participate or discuss matters laid before them, they heard the speakers put forth by the presiding officer. And after such discussion, the presiding officer could call for a direct up or down <b>vote.</b> <b>Without</b> <b>a</b> magistrate, there would be nobody to legally call upon the assembly; and without the citizens, there is naught but a magistrate.|$|R

The modified laws were held to need {{the approval of the}} citizens to enact the changes. On July 26, 1845 a public vote passed the amended Organic Laws of Oregon. One change was that the Legislative Committee was replaced by a House of Representatives; initially with 13 members and permitted to have up to 61 legislators. The House had the authority to change the laws by <b>vote,</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> need to submit changes to a popular vote of the people.|$|R

It was questioned whether the Succession Law enacted by King Vajiravudh actually barred Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath (and for that matter, Prince Chula Chakrabongse) from succession {{on the grounds that}} he married a foreigner (Russian). However, his marriage had taken place before this law was enacted and had been endorsed by King Chulalongkorn himself. There was no clear resolution, but in the end the many candidates were passed over and Prince Prajadhipok was enthroned.|$|R

40|$|Learning from {{multiple}} annotators took a valu-able step towards modeling data {{that does not}} fit the usual single annotator setting, since multi-ple annotators sometimes offer varying degrees of expertise. When disagreements occur, the es-tablishment of the correct label through trivial so-lutions such as majority voting may not be ad-equate, since without considering heterogeneity in the annotators, we risk generating a flawed model. In this paper, we generalize GP classi-fication in order to account for multiple annota-tors with different levels expertise. By explicitly handling uncertainty, Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a natural framework for building proper multiple-annotator models. We empirically show that our model significantly outperforms other commonly used approaches, such as majority <b>voting,</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> {{significant increase in the}} com-putational cost of approximate Bayesian infer-ence. Furthermore, an active learning method-ology is proposed, which is able to reduce anno-tation cost even further. 1...|$|R
50|$|In March 1933, an {{argument}} arose over irregularities {{in the voting}} procedure. The Social Democratic president of the National Council (the lower house of parliament) Karl Renner resigned {{to be able to}} cast a vote as a parliament member. As a consequence, the two vice presidents, belonging to other parties, resigned as well to be able to <b>vote.</b> <b>Without</b> <b>a</b> president, the parliament could not conclude the session. Dollfuss took the three resignations as a pretext to declare that the National Council had become unworkable, and advised President Wilhelm Miklas to issue a decree adjourning it indefinitely. When the National Council wanted to reconvene days after the resignation of the three presidents, Dollfuss had police bar entrance to parliament, effectively eliminating democracy in Austria. From that point onwards, he governed as dictator by emergency decree with absolute power.|$|R
