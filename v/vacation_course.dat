Litt. for his doctoral thesis The Phonetics of the Zulu Language and was promoted to Senior Lecturer. In 1931 he {{was appointed to the}} Chair of Bantu Studies and thus headed the Department of Bantu Studies. The Department acted as a catalyst for the admission of Africans to the University: as early as 1925 a limited number were admitted to the <b>vacation</b> <b>course</b> in African Studies. Doke supported the appointment of Benedict Wallet Vilakazi as member of the staff, as he believed a native speaker was essential for acquiring a language. This provoked a storm of criticism and controversy from the public. They both collaborated on the Zulu-English Dictionary, first published in 1948.

In 1919, the Phonetics Department began teaching its popular <b>vacation</b> <b>courses</b> in French and English phonetics. In the inaugural 1919 course, Armstrong conducted daily ear-training exercises for a course intended for those studying and teaching French. Two readers of English Studies who had attended the 1919 summer course for English favourably described Armstrong's ear-tests as [...] "a great help" [...] and [...] "splendid"; these ear-training exercises were praised by the journal [...] A Dutch participant in the 1921 session lauded Armstrong's ear-training classes and provided a description thereof. By the 1921 summer course, she not only conducted the ear-training exercises, but also lectured on English phonetics alongside Jones; she later gave lectures on English phonetics for a [...] "Course of Spoken English for Foreigners", taught with Jones and Arthur Lloyd James during the summer of 1930.

50|$|The {{language}} conflict {{entered a}} new phase in 1918, when the question was raised of why Faroese spelling was still not a compulsory subject in the schools. In the above-mentioned school regulations of 1912, this question had been deliberately ignored, since many Faroese teachers did not have sufficient knowledge of the orthography of their native language. However, there were already efforts under way to address this problem, as summer <b>vacation</b> <b>courses</b> in Faroese orthography were being conducted. As the time seemed ripe, the Løgting requested the Danish government to introduce Faroese spelling as a compulsory subject. The Danish education ministry immediately agreed, but §7 remained unchanged.|$|R

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1887, Bruce {{travelled}} north to Edinburgh to attend a pair of <b>vacation</b> <b>courses</b> in natural sciences. The six-week courses, at the recently established Scottish Marine Station at Granton on the Firth of Forth, were {{under the direction of}} Patrick Geddes and John Arthur Thomson, and included sections on botany and practical zoology. The experience of Granton, and the contact with some of the foremost contemporary natural scientists, convinced Bruce to stay in Scotland. He abandoned his place at UCL, and enrolled instead in the medical school at the University of Edinburgh. This enabled him to maintain contact with mentors such as Geddes and Thomson, and also gave him the opportunity to work during his free time in the Edinburgh laboratories where specimens brought back from the Challenger expedition were being examined and classified. Here he worked under Dr John Murray and his assistant John Young Buchanan, and gained a deeper understanding of oceanography and invaluable experience in the principles of scientific investigation.|$|R
40|$|Historians {{who have}} {{examined}} physical education (PE) have rarely related PE to its wider social context. This article considers {{the development of}} PE in elementary schools in England and Wales between 1907 and 1939, and locates PE within the wider history of die School Medical Service. From 1907, local authorities appointed specialist staff, acquired playing fields, and sent their teachers on short <b>vacation</b> <b>courses,</b> while at a policy level the Chief Medical Officer, Sir George Newman, came to regard PE {{as a component of}} preventive medicine. In the interwar period, PE was greatly influenced by voluntary organizations, and by the physical training schemes set up by the continental dictatorships, and this culminated in the Physical Training and Recreation Act of 1937. However PE also illustrated many of the weaknesses of the School Medical Service, including striking regional variations in its provisions, and in the 1930 s the emphasis on PE contrasted with the relative neglect of malnutrition. The article concludes by suggesting that the contrast between Sir George Newman's ambitious plans for PE as a branch of preventive medicine, and provision in most local authorities, illustrated the great gulf that could exist between rhetoric and reality...|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} {{of such a}} paradigm is familiarity and ease of use; the disadvantage is a possibly negative influence on knowledge formulation. Users must choose one of two basic strategies: either store all of their knowledge in a single file; or else break up their knowledge and store it across {{a number of different}} files, presumably according to subject matter and/or time period. The first choice can result in scalability problems—consider how much knowledge a user might collect over a decade, if they stored things related to their personal life, hobbies, relationships, reading materials, <b>vacations,</b> academic <b>course</b> notes, multiple work-related projects, future planning, etc. It seems unrealistic to keep adding this kind of volume to a single, ever-growing multi-gigabyte file. The other option, however, is also constraining: each bit of knowledge can be stored in only one of the files (or else redundantly, which leads to synchronization problems), and the user is forced to choose this at knowledge capture time.|$|R
