5000|$|Lap is {{the amount}} by which the <b>valve</b> <b>overlaps</b> each steam port at the middle {{position}} of each valve. [...] However, {{there are two different}} types of lap.|$|R
5000|$|The first kind is {{the steam}} lap, {{which is the}} amount by which the <b>valve</b> <b>overlaps</b> the port on the live steam side of the valve piston (i.e. the {{distance}} the valve needs to move to just begin to uncover the port). [...] Secondly, there is the exhaust lap, which is the amount by which the <b>valve</b> <b>overlaps</b> the port on the exhaust side of the valve piston. Exhaust lap is generally given to slow-running locomotives. [...] This is because it allows the steam {{to remain in the}} cylinder for the longest possible amount of time before being expended as exhaust, therefore increasing efficiency. [...] shunter locomotives tended to be equipped with this addition.|$|R
60|$|Valves of the Lower Whorl.--These, seen externally, seem {{to belong}} {{to more than one}} whorl, but {{internally}} their basal margins stand on a level. They vary in number, as already stated, from 22 to 26. I have seen an individual with a valve more on one side than on the other. They are of unequal sizes, but they are rather variable in this respect: the largest are not above half the size of the upper latera: three or four pairs, together with the sub-rostrum (e) and sub-carina (c), are always larger than the others: these two latter valves differ from the others only in being more concave. Seen externally, all these valves project considerably, and curl a little inwards, with their apices generally worn and truncated. Viewed internally (fig. 3 b´), whilst the valves are in their proper places, the inner and growing surfaces of the smallest are seen to be triangular,--of the larger, some are rhomboidal, and others quadrilateral with the upper side much longer than the lower. These latter <b>valves</b> <b>overlap</b> the upper parts of the little valves on both sides of them; the rhomboidal <b>valves</b> <b>overlap</b> a <b>valve</b> on one side, and are overlapped on the other; the triangular <b>valves</b> are <b>overlapped</b> on both sides.|$|R
2500|$|The {{camshaft}} [...] "lift" [...] is {{the resultant}} net {{rise of the}} valve from its seat. [...] The farther the valve rises from its seat the more airflow can be provided, which is generally more beneficial. [...] Greater lift has some limitations. [...] Firstly, lift {{is limited by the}} increased proximity of the valve head to the piston crown and secondly, greater effort is required to move the valve springs to a higher state of compression. Increased lift can also be limited by lobe clearance in the cylinder head casting. Higher valve lift can have the same effect as increased duration where <b>valve</b> <b>overlap</b> is less desirable.|$|E

40|$|A free-piston linear {{alternator}} (FPLA) {{is being}} developed by the Beijing Institute of Technology to improve the thermal efficiency relative to conventional crank-driven engines. A two-stroke scavenging process recharges the engine and is crucial to realizing the continuous operation of a free-piston engine. In order to study the FPLA scavenging process, the scavenging system was configured using computational fluid dynamics. As the piston dynamics of the FPLA are different to conventional crank-driven two-stroke engines, a time-based numerical simulation program was built using Matlab to define the piston's motion profiles. A wide range of design and operating options were investigated including effective stroke length, <b>valve</b> <b>overlapping</b> distance, operating frequency and charging pressure to find out their effects on the scavenging performance. The results indicate {{that a combination of}} high effective stroke length to bore ratio and long <b>valve</b> <b>overlapping</b> distance with a low supercharging pressure has the potential to achieve high scavenging and trapping efficiencies with low short-circuiting losses.

50|$|Secondly, {{designers}} exploit {{a property}} of air cavities known as Helmholtz resonance.

50|$|In a Velozeta engine, {{fresh air}} is {{injected}} into the cylinder during the exhaust stroke, which expands by heat and therefore forces the piston down for an additional stroke. The <b>valve</b> <b>overlaps</b> have been removed, and the two additional strokes using air injection provide for better gas scavenging. The engine seems to show 40% reduction in fuel consumption and dramatic reduction in air pollution. Its Power-to-weight ratio is slightly {{less than that of}} a four-stroke gasoline engine. The engine can run on a variety of fuels, ranging from gasoline and diesel fuel to LPG. An altered engine shows a 65% reduction in carbon monoxide pollution when compared with the four-stroke engine from which it was developed. The engine was developed in 2005 by a team of mechanical engineering students, Mr. U Krishnaraj, Mr. Boby Sebastian, Mr. Arun Nair and Mr. Aaron Joseph of the College of Engineering, Trivandrum.|$|R
40|$|Resumo: Um modelo de simulação fenomenológico de motores Diesel foi desenvolvido. O modelo permite a simulação das fases aberta e fechada do ciclo. A combustão é modelada utilizando um modelo de liberação de energia finita. É levado em conta um modelo unidimensional para escoamento sobre as válvulas e um modelo para a transmissão de calor instantânea entre os gases e a parede do cilindro. Por se tratar de um modelo paramétrico, uma série de estudos pode ser feita no sentido de avaliar as influências dos diversos parâmetros sobre os valores finais de eficiência global do motor. As curvas características e as eficiências do motor correspondem aos resultados finais obtidos após o processo iterativo. Um motor é comparado quando simulado em duas situações: com e sem cruzamento de válvulas. Ao simular o caso base (sem cruzamento de válvulas) foi possível comparar a potência efetiva de eixo declarada pelo fabricante (49 kW) e constatar que a potência calculada pelo modelo foi de 51. 3 kW indicando assim que as hipóteses adotadas foram bastante razoáveis. Além disso, o modelo forneceu valores para eficiência volumétrica, consumo específico e eficiência térmica condizentes com os valores usualmente encontrados nas referências bibliográficas. Constatou-se que ao gozar de um curto cruzamento de válvulas o motor teve seus parâmetros de eficiência aumentada em 3 %, além de uma redução de 3. 3 % no consumo específico de combustível, valores esses quando comparados ao caso base. O algoritmo desenvolvido permitiu também analisar a influência do ponto de injeção na curva de pressão de combustão, a influência da rotação na curva de taxas mássicas na admissão/escape e a influência da quantidade de combustível injetada sobre as potências de atrito, efetiva e indicada. Abstract: A phenomenological {{simulation}} model of Diesel engine was developed. The model {{is able to}} simulate the open and closed phase of the cycle. The combustion process is modeled by using a finite heat release model. A one-dimensional model is applied for the flow through the valves and the instantaneous heat transfer between gases and cylinder wall. As the model is parameterized, {{a series of studies}} can be done to evaluate the influence of several parameters on the final values of the overall engine efficiency. Typical engine curves and the engine efficiencies are obtained {{as a result of the}} interactive process. An engine is compared when simulated in two situations: with and without <b>valve</b> <b>overlapping.</b> By simulating the baseline case (without <b>valve</b> <b>overlapping)</b> it was possible to compare the brake power informed by the engine manufacturer (49 kW) and that obtained by model was (51. 3 kW), showing that the hypothesis adopted was reasonable. Furthermore, the model provides values for the volumetric efficiency, specific fuel consumption and thermal efficiency in agreement with values usually found in both the bibliographic references and manufacturer¿s data. It was found that when the engine operated with a short <b>valve</b> <b>overlapping,</b> the engine achieved 3 % of improvement in the efficiency parameters and 3. 3 % of reduction in specific fuel consumption, these values are compared with the base case. The algorithm developed also allowed to analyze the influence of the injection start point in the combustion pressure curve, the influence of engine rotation in the mass rate in intake and exhaust process and the influence of equivalence ratio on the friction, effective and indicated power...|$|R

50|$|Engines {{that always}} run at a {{relatively}} high speed, such as race car engines, will have considerable overlap in their valve timings for maximum volumetric efficiency. Road car engines are different because {{they are required to}} idle at less than 1000rpm, and excessive <b>valve</b> <b>overlap</b> would make smooth idling impossible because of the mixing of fresh and exhaust gases. Variable valve timing can give both maximum power at high rpm and smooth idling at low rpm by making small changes to the relative angular position of the camshafts and thereby varying the <b>valve</b> <b>overlap.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{concept for}} the use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in a modern turbocharged s. i. engine has been investigated by means of both 1 D and 3 D numerical simulations. Direct Injection of liquid fuel and Port Fuel Injection of both liquid and gaseous fuel were analyzed and compared with a Gasoline Direct Injection concept, that was assumed as a reference. In particular the use of large <b>valve</b> <b>overlaps</b> to achieve a "scavenging" effect in order to improve the engine low end torque and its implications in case of LPG injection were deeply investigated, pointing out the main issues and highlighting the potential of DI LPG. While a significant performance decrease (up to 15 % bmep decrease in the worst case) was found for PFI LPG, LPG DI showed a limited performance decrease (about 3 %) that could be fully compensated thanks to its higher octane quality that allowed boost and/or spark advance increase.

50|$|Strong {{radiating}} ribs {{are common}} in this group; and there are generally very strong plications or accordion-like folds on the sulcus (the long middle section) of the shell. This probably helps regulate {{the flow of water}} {{in and out of the}} shell. All rhynchonellids are biconvex (have a bulbous shell), and have a fold located in the brachial valve. This means that the commissure, the line between the two valves or shells, is zigzagged, a distinguishing characteristic of this group. The prominent beak of the pedicle <b>valve</b> usually <b>overlaps</b> that of the brachial valve, in order to allow the shell to open and close. There is usually a functional pedicle although the delthyrium may be partially closed.|$|R

50|$|MIVEC {{switches}} {{to the higher}} cam profile as engine speed increases, and drops back to the lower cam profile as engine speed decreases. The reduced <b>valve</b> <b>overlap</b> in low-speed mode provides stable idling, while accelerated timing of the intake valve's closing reduces backflow to improve volumetric efficiency, which helps increase engine output as well as reduce lift friction. High-speed mode {{takes advantage of the}} pulsating intake effect created by the mode's high lift and retarded timing of intake valve closure. The resulting reduced pumping loss of the larger <b>valve</b> <b>overlap</b> yields higher power output and a reduction in friction. The low- and high-speed modes overlap for a brief period, boosting torque.|$|E
5000|$|Many headers {{are also}} {{resonance}} tuned, {{to utilize the}} low-pressure reflected wave rarefaction pulse which can help scavenging the combustion chamber during <b>valve</b> <b>overlap.</b> This pulse is created in all exhaust systems each time a change in density occurs, such as when exhaust merges into the collector. For clarification, the rarefaction pulse is the technical term for the same process that was described above in the [...] "head, body, tail" [...] description. By tuning {{the length of the}} primary tubes, usually by means of resonance tuning, the rarefaction pulse can be timed to coincide with the exact moment <b>valve</b> <b>overlap</b> occurs. Typically, long primary tubes resonate at a lower engine speed than short primary tubes.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, the Myodocopa and Podocopa {{have been}} {{classified}} as subclasses within the class Ostracoda, {{although there is}} some question about how closely related the two groups actually are.

50|$|The large <b>valve</b> <b>overlap</b> {{leads to}} a {{reduction}} in cylinder charge and reduced torque and power output, but efficiency is increased.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of axon guidance cues have been shown recently to play important roles {{in the development of}} non-neural tissues. Semaphorins comprise one of the largest conserved families of axon guidance factors. We analyzed the expression patterns of Sema 3 D, Sema 3 F, and Sema 5 A genes in the chick embryonic heart by in situ hybridization. All three genes are expressed in the cardiac cushion regions, both in the mesenchymal cells, and epithelial cells in the endocardial layer, during the period of cardiac remodeling. In addition to the overlapping expression patterns in the cardiac cushion regions, these genes also exhibit distinct expression patterns in the developing heart: Sema 3 D is additionally expressed in the tips of the ventricular trabeculae; Sema 3 F is expressed in a subset of cells scattered throughout the ventricles; and Sema 5 A is expressed in the newly formed atrioventricular <b>valves.</b> The <b>overlapping</b> and distinct expression patterns of these genes suggest that they may play important roles in heart development...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The closed-center PDC/servo <b>valves</b> have <b>overlapped</b> spools {{to prevent}} {{internal}} leakage {{so that the}} system can hold a position even when the power is off. However, the over-lapped spools also introduce deadbands, which are sandwiched by plant dynamics and valve dynamics. The sandwiched deadbands would degrade the achievable control performance and {{are very difficult to}} deal with. Instead of trying to solve this sandwiched deadband control problem via complicated advanced controls with limited improvement of achievable performance, this paper bypasses this problem with the use of both valve hardware redesign and advanced controls to overcome this deadband problem completely. Specifically, the hardware is based on the programmable valves, a unique combination of five independently controlled poppet type cartridge valves. This paper will compare the programmable valves with traditional PDC/servo valves and demonstrate the ability of completely solving the deadband control problem of the electro-hydraulic systems using the programmable valves. A nonlinear model based Adaptive Robust Controller with deadband compensation is designed for PDC/servo valve and a two-level coordinate controller is designed for programmable valves to maximize the achievable control performance of each. Experimental results show that the best tracking performance is achieved through the programmable valves. I...|$|R
