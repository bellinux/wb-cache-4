40|$|Advancement in {{computer}} architecture leads to parallelize the sequential algorithm {{to exploit the}} concurrency provided by multiple core on single chip. Sequential programs do not gain performance from multicore. For multicore architectures, OPENMP and MPI are application programming interfaces. They {{can be used for}} parallelization of codes. For shared memory architecture OPENMP is used, whereas for distributed memory architecture MPI is used. In this paper, analysis of the performance of parallel algorithm over sequential algorithm is done. In particular, Graph Isomorphism problem based on vertex invariants is considered and parallelized using OpenMP. We demonstrate the performance of Graph Isomorphism using variable size graphs and parallelize it using <b>vertical</b> <b>tiling</b> technique on multicore architecture. Our previous work shows, sequential implementation of modified algorithm based on vertex invariants using Euclidian vector performs better than existing algorithm of Graph Isomorphism based on vertex invariants. To analyze the performance of parallel implementation, we present practical experiments with randomly generated graphs...|$|E
40|$|Millions {{of square}} meters of wall- and floor tiling are being layed {{manually}} at great expense {{in time and}} manpower. There is a great potential for rationalisation in the tiling of large areas (swimming pools, supermarkets, industrial plants, etc.) and in the series production of prefabricated bathrooms for hotels or tiled wall-elements for the renovation of homes. The Fraunhofer Institut Produktionstechnik und Automatisierung (IPA), Stuttgart has developed alternative concepts for automation of these areas and has set up and tested prototypes. The automation process includes the application of mortar or tile glue to the wall or the floor (floating process), or the direct covering of the tiles (buttering process) {{as well as the}} placement of the tiles. In the series production of tiled wall-elements and prefabricated bathrooms stationary industrial robots are being used. The tiling of large areas on the building site needs mobile robot systems with a navigation system for rough positioni ng at the respective site and an optical sensor system for precision positioning at the respective laying position. The fitting process is controlled by a multisensor system which is integrated into the tool. The multisensor system and an intelligent controller ensure both an exact level positioning of the tiles to hold an even width of the gap and also the height of the tiles to each other to get a level surface. For the <b>vertical</b> <b>tiling</b> process the adherence of the tiles is examined...|$|E

The default is a main area + stacking area arrangement, represented by a = character glyph. Other standard layouts are a single-window [...] "monocle" [...] mode represented by an M and a non-tiling floating layout that permits windows to be moved and resized, represented by a fish-like ><>. Third party patches exist to add a golden section-based Fibonacci layout, horizontal and <b>vertical</b> row-based <b>tiling</b> or a grid layout. The keyboard-driven menu utility [...] "dmenu", developed for use with dwm, is used with other tiling WMs such as xmonad, and sometimes also with other [...] "light-weight" [...] software like Openbox and uzbl.|$|R

It first discusses application requirements and system design, and then elaborates system architecture for optimal data organization and updating, efficient multi-resolution queries, and dynamic DTM generation. It then addresses technical issues related to data storage, seamless <b>tiling,</b> <b>vertical</b> indexing, and DTM generalization. Finally, it discusses the limitations and shortcomings of the current approach, and identifies future research and development tasks. 1...|$|R
3000|$|The {{tropopause}} {{inversion layer}} (TIL) is a persistent layer with high static stability. Although some mechanisms {{for the formation}} of the TIL have been proposed, the time evolution of the TIL under realistic conditions especially when factoring in the contribution of small-scale processes such as gravity waves is not well understood. To gain an understanding of this factor, we conducted a numerical experiment on an explosive cyclogenesis in mid-latitudes using a nonhydrostatic regional atmospheric model. Although the TIL in the model is consistent with previous observations {{in the sense that it}} is stronger in the negative vorticity areas, the relationship is clear only in the development and mature stages of a cyclone, suggesting that the evolution of the cyclone plays an important role in the formation of the TIL. To ascertain the effects of gravity waves on the <b>TIL,</b> <b>vertical</b> convergence at the tropopause is analyzed. Histograms of maximum buoyancy frequency squared [...]...|$|R
