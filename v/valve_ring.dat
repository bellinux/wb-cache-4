5000|$|Due to Syphilitic aortitis (a {{complication}} of tertiary syphilis) the aortic <b>valve</b> <b>ring</b> becomes dilated. The free margins of valve cusps no longer approximate leading to aortic valve insufficiency. As blood regurgitates {{into the left}} ventricle between each systole, volume overload ensues and the ventricular wall hypertrophies {{in an attempt to}} maintain cardiac output and blood pressure. The massive ventricle can lead to a heart weighing over 1000 grams (the weight of a normal heart is about 350 grams), referred to as [...] "Cor Bovinum" [...] for cow's heart.|$|E
50|$|A gas {{producer}} combustion system (GPCS) and dual Lempor exhaust were installed, {{along with some}} other small improvements. The Lempor had a four-jet blastpipe with extended petticoats to provide truer ejector proportions. To accommodate the arrangement, the smokebox was extended by 300 mm. Steam flow in the cylinders was improved by streamlining {{the edges of the}} piston valves which were each equipped with an additional <b>valve</b> <b>ring</b> to reduce leakage. The firebox was modified to the GPCS system wherein principal combustion is effected using secondary air introduced above the firebed through ducts in the firebox sides, while primary air was restricted through dampers and a redesigned grate.|$|E
50|$|DAH {{developed}} at Hannover Medical School (MHH) have shown sufficient mechanical stability for the systemic circulation at the greatest possible extent of antigen elimination {{and have been}} validated in long-term animal models. No dilatation has been observed at the different level such as the <b>valve</b> <b>ring</b> plane, in the sinuses or {{at the level of}} the sinutubular junction. Haemodynamic performance in terms of effective orifice area of DAH was outstanding compared to all other options and no calcification of the DAH has been observed to date. In the few cases in which a long valved homograft had to be implanted due to concomitant dilatation of the ascending aorta, there was also no dilatation of the homograft., Two prospective clinical trials funded by the European Union are currently underway to further evaluate this new approach.|$|E

5000|$|Attempts {{to improve}} {{the design of the}} valve and speed manufacturing, however, led to a weaker structure, with serious consequences. Beginning in 1979, Bj√∂rk - Shiley valves with the convexo-concave design had a {{tendency}} to develop fractures in the outflow strut which could result in catastrophic valve failure and possibly sudden cardiac death. Later analysis revealed that the strut was fracturing at the place where it was welded onto the metal <b>valve</b> <b>ring.</b> One end of the strut would fracture first, followed by the second strut some months later. Eventually, 619 of the 80,000 convexo-concave valves implanted fractured in this way, with the patient dying in two-thirds of those cases.

50|$|The ventricles are histologically and {{electrically}} {{isolated from the}} atria by the unique and electrically impermeable collagen layers of connective tissue known as the cardiac skeleton. The bulwarks of this entity stem from the central body to form the four <b>valve</b> <b>rings.</b> Collagen extensions from the <b>valve</b> <b>rings</b> seal and limit atrial electrical influence from ventricular electrical influence to the SA/AV/Purkinje pathways. Exceptions such as accessory pathways may occur in this firewall between atrial and ventricular electrical influence but are rare.The compromised load of atrial fibrillation detracts from overall performance but the ventricles continue {{to work as a}} physiologically effective pump. Given this pathology, ejection fraction may deteriorate by ten to thirty percent. Uncorrected atrial fibrillation can lead to heart rates approaching 200 beats per minute. If one can slow this rate down to a normal range of approximately 80 beats per minute, the filling time of the heart cycle is longer and confers additional benefit to the pumping ability of the heart. Breathless individuals with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation can be rapidly returned to normal breathing when conversion with medication or electrical cardioversion is attempted.Pharmacological manipulation of rate control, for example, by beta blocker|beta adrenoceptor antagonists, non-dyhydropyridine calcium channel blockers and digoxin are important historical interventions in this condition. Individuals prone to a hypercoagulable state are at a decided risk of thromboembolism, thus requiring therapy with warfarin for life if the defined pathology cannot be corrected.|$|R

In congenital valvar stenosis its application will be limited because of the complexity of the underlying valve deformities.

In acquired valvar stenosis the main limitation of balloon valvuloplasty seems to be massive calcification of the affected valves. Basically, in both the arterial and atrioventricular position, balloon valvuloplasty splits fused commissures and fractures calcific deposits. Excessive radial pressures may cause tears of the leaflets. The potential of thromboembolic complications, therefore, warrants caution.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{combination}} {{method of}} electrospinning and rapid prototyping (RP) {{fused deposition modeling}} (FDM) is proposed for the fabrication of a tissue engineering heart valve (TEHV) scaffold. The scaffold preparation consisted of two steps: tri-leaflet scaffold fabrication and heart <b>valve</b> <b>ring</b> fabrication. With the purpose of mimicking the anisotropic mechanical properties of the natural heart valve leaflet, electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (ES-TPU) was introduced as the tri-leaflet scaffold material. ES-TPU scaffolds can be fabricated to have a well-aligned fiber network, which is important for applications involving mechanically anisotropic soft tissues. We developed ES-TPU scaffolds as heart valve leaflet materials under variable speed conditions and measured fiber alignment by fast Fourier transform (FFT). By using FFT to assign relative alignment values to an electrospun matrix, {{it is possible to}} systematically evaluate how different processing variables affect the structure and material properties of a scaffold. TPU was suspended at certain concentrations and electrospun from 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 -hexafluoro- 2 -propanol onto rotating mandrels (200 - 3000 rpm). The scaffold morphological property and mechanical anisotropic property are discussed in the paper as a function of fiber diameter and mandrel RPM. The induction of varying degrees of anisotropy imparted distinctive material properties to the electrospun scaffolds. A dynamic optimum design of the heart <b>valve</b> <b>ring</b> graft was constructed by FDM. Fabrication of a 3 D heart <b>valve</b> <b>ring</b> was constructed using pro-engineer based on optimum hemodynamic analysis and was converted to an STL file format.

50|$|The {{growth of}} diamond {{directly}} on a substrate allows {{the addition of}} many of diamond's important qualities to other materials.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mitral valve repair for rheumatic {{mitral valve}} disease in {{children}} {{has become the}} preferred surgical modality. A mitral <b>valve</b> <b>ring</b> is frequently used in the repair. A recently introduced biodegradable ring has shown promising results and allows for growth of the native annulus. METHODS: Between January 1994 and March 2006, 220 children underwent mitral valve repair for rheumatic valve disease. Mitral valve insufficiency was predominant in 198 patients (90 %). Fifty-seven patients (26 %) had associated aortic valve insufficiency and 51 (23 %) had tricuspid valve insufficiency addressed during the same surgery. A mitral <b>valve</b> <b>ring</b> was used in 213 patients (173 Carpentier-Edwards and 40 biodegradable rings). Ninety-two percent (202 of 220) were in New York Association class III to IV. Echocardiography was performed at 6 months and thereafter once yearly. RESULTS: There were no hospital deaths or major postoperative morbidity. Follow-up was complete in 96 % (212 of 220). One late death occurred. Mean follow-up was 76. 4 months (range, 1 to 13 years). One patient (0. 5 %) had immediate mitral valve repair failure and required mitral valve replacement. Twelve patients (5. 5 %) required reoperation during follow-up. Recurrent mitral valve insufficiency/stenosis-free survival was 94. 5 % at 5 years and 92. 7 % at 10 years. Mean gradient was 5. 2 +/- 1. 9, 6. 2 +/- 2. 0, and 7. 0 +/- 2. 3 mm Hg, respectively, at 7 days, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively for the Carpentier-Edwards ring and significantly lower (p < 0. 001) for the biodegradable ring at 2. 8 +/- 0. 5, 3. 1 +/- 0. 7, and 3. 3 +/- 0. 5 mm Hg, respectively. Unchanged mean gradient {{during the first year}} was 65 % (26 of 40) for the biodegradable ring and 21 % (31 of 147) for the Carpentier-Edwards ring. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve repair in children with rheumatic valve disease has excellent immediate results with low operative risk and satisfactory midterm results and should therefore be the preferred treatment of choice. The use of biodegradable mitral <b>valve</b> <b>ring</b> results in a significant lower mean gradient {{during the first year of}} implantation compared with the Carpentier-Edwards ring and is available in a wide range of sizes...|$|E

50|$|The collagenous cardiac {{skeleton}} {{which includes}} the four heart <b>valve</b> <b>rings,</b> is histologically, elastically and uniquely bound to cardiac muscle. The cardiac skeleton also includes the separating septa of the heart chambers - the interventricular septum and the atrioventricular septum. Collagen contribution to the measure of cardiac performance summarily represents a continuous torsional force opposed to the fluid mechanics of blood pressure emitted from the heart. The collagenous structure that divides the upper chambers of the heart from the lower chambers is an impermeable membrane that excludes both blood and electrical impulses through typical physiological means. With support from collagen, atrial fibrillation should never deteriorate to ventricular fibrillation. Collagen is layered in variable densities with cardiac muscle mass. The mass, distribution, age and density of collagen all contribute to the compliance required to move blood back and forth. Individual cardiac valvular leaflets are folded into shape by specialized collagen under variable pressure. Gradual calcium deposition within collagen occurs as a natural function of aging. Calcified points within collagen matrices show contrast in a moving display of blood and muscle, enabling methods of cardiac imaging technology to arrive at ratios essentially stating blood in (cardiac input) and blood out (cardiac output). Pathology of the collagen underpinning of the heart is understood within the category of connective tissue disease.|$|R
