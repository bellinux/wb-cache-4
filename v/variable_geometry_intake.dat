5000|$|During the 1960s {{and into}} his retirement, he {{developed}} ideas for an [...] "all-speed" [...] aircraft, capable of efficient flight at all speed ranges from subsonic to hypersonic. In particular, his ideas and understanding of supersonic aerodynamics led to research that underwrote {{the design of the}} air intakes for Concorde's Olympus 593 engines. Using <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> air <b>intakes,</b> the Olympus engines were able to perform efficiently at all speeds from sub-sonic take-off and climb right through to supercruise at over Mach 2.|$|R
50|$|At low flight speeds the DASS engine relies {{solely on}} the {{on-board}} turbojet that runs on a conventional hydrocarbon fuel. The <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> <b>intake</b> (PCT patent pending) allows large gaps to form between the heat exchanger (which is not operating at this stage), minimizing intake pressure losses. During this mode, the bypass is closed and all air is processed through the turbojet core. The exhaust nozzle (PCT patent pending) contracts in the subsonic mode for optimal specific thrust. As the engine accelerates to supersonic velocities, the articulated portions of the intake direct flow into the heat exchanger (PCT patent pending). Liquid hydrogen fuel is passed through the heat exchanger, decreasing {{the temperature of the}} air prior to engine compression. Some of the air bypass the turbojet core, and is mixed with the hydrogen exiting the heat exchanger in the afterburner section. Note that the magnitude of heat transfer is coupled to the amount of hydrogen available for combustion in the afterburner. The combustion products are then expanded through a supersonic nozzle, variable geometry nozzle. The engine will be designed to completely consume the air to optimize for thrust. The level of bypass changes throughout the supersonic flight regime. The engine can operate at Mach 4 and provide thrust in excess of a conventional ramjet. At high Mach numbers (~4.88) air cannot be cooled below the turbojet limit (1200K). As a result, no combustion can occur in the core turbojet and the engine must transition into a pure ramjet mode. The variable inlet continues to articulate (PCT patent pending) to completely block air access to the turbojet, while optimizing intake to exit area ratios for ramjet combustion using hydrogen. The engine still realizes an efficiency boost from the cooling effects of the heat exchanger (albeit much less in this mode). The terminal flight speed is limited to that of a hydrogen fueled ramjet.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 2012, {{engines of}} up to 2000 cc were allowed, with only limited {{modifications}} from standard engines.

50|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>intake</b> <b>geometry</b> {{lets the}} engine produce full power at most speeds by {{optimizing}} for whatever speed {{the air is}} entering pulsejet at. Valveless designs are not as negatively affected by ram air pressure as other designs, as they were never intended {{to stop the flow}} out of the intake, and can significantly increase in power at speed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{engine air}} inlets of the Hornet, {{like that of}} the F-16, are of a simpler [...] "fixed" [...] design, while those of the F-4, F-14, and F-15 have <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> or <b>variable</b> <b>intake</b> ramp air inlets. This is a speed {{limiting}} factor in the Hornet design. Instead, the Hornet uses bleed air vents on the inboard surface of the engine air intake ducts to slow and reduce the amount of air reaching the engine. While not as effective as <b>variable</b> <b>geometry,</b> the bleed air technique functions well enough to achieve near Mach number 2 speeds, which is within the designed mission requirements.|$|R

50|$|Oblique shocks {{are often}} {{preferable}} in engineering applications {{when compared to}} normal shocks. This {{can be attributed to}} the fact that using one or a combination of oblique shock waves results in more favourable post-shock conditions (smaller increase in entropy, less stagnation pressure loss, etc) when compared to utilizing a single normal shock. An example of this technique can be seen in the design of supersonic aircraft engine intakes or supersonic inlets. A type of these inlets is wedge-shaped to compress air flow into the combustion chamber while minimizing thermodynamic losses. Early supersonic aircraft jet engine intakes were designed using compression from a single normal shock, but this approach caps the maximum achievable Mach number to roughly 1.6. Concorde (which first flew in 1969) used <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> wedge-shaped <b>intakes</b> to achieve a maximum speed of Mach 2.2.

40|$|This {{review paper}} {{deals with the}} {{evolution}} of the general processes employed in the suction process of IC Engines. The suction process has evolved from the traditional use of carburettors to much more sophisticated systems like CRDi, MPFi, etc. used in modern days. In doing so, various parameters such as the volumetric efficiency and the turbulence, etc. inside the engine have to be considered. Additional processes such as supercharging and turbocharging are employed to improve these parameters. It is also highly desirable to vary the Air-Fuel ratio effectively according to the speed of the engine for better power output and mileage. Thus researchers have developed several ways over the years to achieve it. Recent research work being carried out in this field is in the areas of Pressure Wave Superchargers, <b>Variable</b> <b>Geometry</b> Turbochargers, Multiple <b>Intake</b> valves, Shrouded Intake Valves, Camless Engines etc. Many of these technologies have been employed in the industry such as the DTS-Si, TDi&i-vtec Engines.

50|$|In {{order to}} house a large radar set, the design {{called for a}} solid nose and <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> side air <b>intakes.</b> However, the lack of {{familiarity}} {{with this type of}} intake meant the J-8 had to settle for a MiG-21 style nose intake. The solid nose J-8 was finally realized in the J-8II (Finback-B), which was based on the layout of the J-8I (same improvement is like the J-6 to Q-5). The radar chosen for the J-8 was the Type 204 mono-pulse fire-control radar, a primitive ranging radar for daylight within-visual-range operations. The performance of the radar fell well short of the PLAAF's requirements as research into a more capable fire control radar and power source proved difficult and time-consuming. The aircraft was originally armed with cannons and seven hardpoints for missiles, bombs, rockets or fuel tanks. The original weapons layout of the J-8 was two 30 mm Type 30-1 cannons after initial problems with the 30 mm Type 30-II four-barrel Gatling gun. The J-8 was also planned to be armed with the experimental PL-4 medium ranged missile but technical issues and political upheavals prevented any in-depth development and the project was cancelled in 1985 citing unsatisfactory performance. Therefore, the PL-2 IR-homing short-range air-to-air missile (SRAAM) was used instead. Unguided bombs and rockets can also be carried on the J-8. And nowadays with the development of light-weight military nuclear weaponry, the J-8II will now be able to carry missiles with nuclear warheads.|$|R
