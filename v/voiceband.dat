A lower bit rate may be chosen during the connection establishment phase due to adaptive modulationslower but more robust modulation schemes are chosen in case of poor signal-to-noise ratio. Due to data compression, the actual data transmission rate or throughput (see below) may be higher.|$|E
2500|$|Wideband audio, {{also known}} as HD voice, is high {{definition}} voice quality for telephony audio, contrasted with standard digital telephony [...] "toll quality". It extends the frequency range of audio signals transmitted over telephone lines, resulting in higher quality speech. The range of the human voice extends from 80Hz to 14kHz but traditional, <b>voiceband</b> or narrowband telephone calls limit audio frequencies to the range of 300Hz to 3.4kHz. Wideband audio relaxes the bandwidth limitation and transmits in the audio frequency range of 50Hz to 7kHz or higher.|$|E
2500|$|In Weaver's method, {{the band}} of {{interest}} is first translated to be centered at zero, conceptually by modulating a complex exponential [...] with frequency {{in the middle of}} the <b>voiceband,</b> but implemented by a quadrature pair of sine and cosine modulators at that frequency (e.g. 2kHz). [...] This complex signal or pair of real signals is then lowpass filtered to remove the undesired sideband that is not centered at zero. [...] Then, the single-sideband complex signal centered at zero is upconverted to a real signal, by another pair of quadrature mixers, to the desired center frequency.|$|E

50|$|Telephones are {{connected}} to the telephone exchange via a local loop, which is a physical pair of wires. The local loop was originally intended mostly for the transmission of speech, encompassing an audio frequency range of 300 to 3400 hertz (<b>voiceband</b> or commercial bandwidth). However, as long-distance trunks were gradually converted from analog to digital operation, the idea of being able to pass data through the local loop (by utilizing frequencies above the <b>voiceband)</b> took hold, ultimately leading to DSL.|$|E

50|$|Digital Circuit Multiplication Equipment (DCME) was a type {{of voice}} {{compression}} equipment that is installed {{at either end of}} a long-distance link (typically communications satellite or submarine communications cable). The main characteristics of DCME are defined in ITU-T recommendation G.763. DCME consists of a voice interpolation stage, which is a form of statistical multiplexor applied to <b>voiceband</b> signals, and a low rate encoding stage which exploits correlation between successive <b>voiceband</b> samples on an individual input channel to reduce the transmitted bitrate from that required by PCM of equivalent quality.|$|E

50|$|Wideband voice {{refers to}} the use of {{wideband}} codecs in digital telephony. Wideband codecs use higher sampling rates than ordinary narrowband (<b>voiceband)</b> codecs or utilize embedded sub-band coding techniques to effectively increase the bandwidth of the baseband voice, from the traditional 200 Hz to 3.5 kHz <b>voiceband</b> used in narrowband codecs, to 50 Hz at the low end and anywhere from 7 kHz to 22 kHz.at the high end, {{depending on the type of}} codec used. This results in a significant improvement in voice quality since it allows the wideband codec to transmit consonants, sibilants and other subtleties of the human voice formerly lost by narrowband codecs and significantly adds to the intelligibility and quality of the speech signal.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to being a data switch and multiplexer, a DSLAM is also a large collection of modems. Each modem on the aggregation card communicates with a single subscriber's DSL modem. This modem functionality is integrated into the DSLAM itself instead of being done via an external device like a 20th-century <b>voiceband</b> modem.|$|E

50|$|A {{digital secure}} voice usually {{includes}} two components, a digitizer to convert between speech and digital signals and an encryption system to provide confidentiality. It is difficult in practice {{to send the}} encrypted signal over the same <b>voiceband</b> communication circuits used to transmit unencrypted voice, e.g. analog telephone lines or mobile radios, due to bandwidth expansion.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{installation}} for {{an existing}} home involves installing DSL filters on every telephone, fax machine, voice band modem, and other <b>voiceband</b> device in the home, leaving the DSL modem {{as the only}} unfiltered device. For wall mounted phones, the filter {{is in the form}} of a plate hung on the standard wall mount, on which the phone hangs in turn.|$|E
50|$|The {{techniques}} {{employed in}} speech coding {{are similar to}} those used in audio data compression and audio coding where knowledge in psychoacoustics is used to transmit only data that is relevant to the human auditory system. For example, in <b>voiceband</b> speech coding, only information in the frequency band 400 Hz to 3500 Hz is transmitted but the reconstructed signal is still adequate for intelligibility.|$|E
50|$|The term Wideband Audio or (also termed HD Voice or Wideband Voice) denotes a {{telephony}} using a wideband codec, {{which uses}} a greater frequency range of the audio spectrum than conventional <b>voiceband</b> telephone calls, resulting in a clearer sound. Wideband {{in this context is}} usually considered to cover frequencies in the range of 50-7,000 Hz, therefore allowing audio with richer tones and better quality.|$|E
50|$|After {{the turn}} of the century, DSL modems also made {{extensive}} use of automated echo cancellation. Though they used separate incoming and outgoing frequencies, these frequencies were beyond the <b>voiceband</b> for which the cables were designed, and often suffered attenuation distortion due to bridge taps and incomplete impedance matching. Deep, narrow frequency gaps often resulted, that could not be made usable by echo cancellation. These were detected and mapped out during connection negotiation.|$|E
50|$|ADSL (asymmetric digital {{subscriber}} line) modems, {{a more recent}} development, {{are not limited to}} the telephone's <b>voiceband</b> audio frequencies. Standard twisted-pair telephone cable can, for short distances, carry signals with much higher frequencies than the cable's maximum frequency rating. ADSL broadband takes advantage of this capability. However, ADSL's performance gradually declines as the telephone cable's length increases. This limits ADSL broadband service to subscribers within a relatively short distance of the telephone exchange.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of telecommunications, {{weighting}} filters are widely used in the measurement of electrical noise on telephone circuits, and {{in the assessment of}} noise as perceived through the acoustic response of different types of instrument (handset). Other noise-weighting curves have existed, e.g. DIN standards. The term psophometric weighting, though referring in principle to any weighting curve intended for noise measurement, is often used to refer to a particular weighting curve, used in telephony for narrow-bandwidth <b>voiceband</b> speech circuits.|$|E
50|$|Most rural {{access to}} Internet is <b>voiceband</b> by 56k modem, but poor phone lines in many rural areas, {{many of which}} {{installed}} or last upgraded between the 1930s and the 1960s, may limit actual download speeds to 23-26k or less. Since many of these lines serve relatively few customers, phone company maintenance and speed of repair of these lines has actually degraded and their upgrade for modern quality requirements is unlikely. This results in a digital divide.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, transoceanic cables were coaxial cables that {{transmitted}} frequency-multiplexed <b>voiceband</b> signals. A {{high voltage}} direct current {{on the inner}} conductor powered repeaters (two-way amplifiers placed at intervals along the cable). The first-generation repeaters remain among the most reliable vacuum tube amplifiers ever designed. Later ones were transistorized. Many of these cables are still usable, but have been abandoned because their capacity {{is too small to}} be commercially viable. Some have been used as scientific instruments to measure earthquake waves and other geomagnetic events.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s most echo {{cancellation}} was done inside modems of type v.32 and later. In <b>voiceband</b> modems this allowed {{using the same}} frequencies in both directions simultaneously, greatly increasing the data rate. As part of connection negotiation, each modem sent line probe signals, measured the echoes, and set up its delay lines. Echoes in this case did not include long echoes caused by acoustic coupling, but did include short echoes caused by impedance mismatches in the 2-wire local loop to the telephone exchange.|$|E
50|$|Under heavy loading {{conditions}} (for example {{when a large}} number of channels show continuous activity due to <b>voiceband</b> data or Group III facsimile signals) the voice interpolation {{may not be able to}} operate within a satisfactory quality range - discontinuous signals such as speech being affected by competitive clipping of the initial part of the activity. To combat this DCME may incorporate Dynamic Load Control on a range of input channels. Dynamic load control is a form of back busying to the telephone switch.|$|E
50|$|Asymmetric digital {{subscriber}} line (ADSL) {{is a type of}} {{digital subscriber}} line (DSL) technology, a data communications technology that enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a conventional <b>voiceband</b> modem can provide. ADSL differs from the less common symmetric {{digital subscriber line}} (SDSL). In ADSL, Bandwidth and bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer premises (downstream) than the reverse (upstream). Providers usually market ADSL as a service for consumers for Internet access for primarily downloading content from the Internet, but not serving content accessed by others.|$|E
50|$|Most early telephone-line modems used audio {{frequency-shift}} keying (AFSK) to {{send and}} receive data at rates up to about 1200 bits per second. The Bell 103 and Bell 202 modems used this technique. Even today, North American caller ID uses 1200 baud AFSK {{in the form of}} the Bell 202 standard. Some early microcomputers used a specific form of AFSK modulation, the Kansas City standard, to store data on audio cassettes. AFSK is still widely used in amateur radio, as it allows data transmission through unmodified <b>voiceband</b> equipment.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{improvements}} {{in the use of}} existing copper telephone lines increased their capabilities if maximum line length is controlled. With support for higher transmission bandwidth and improved modulation, these digital subscriber line schemes have increased capability 20-50 times as compared to the previous <b>voiceband</b> systems. These methods are not based on altering the fundamental physical properties and limitations of the medium, which, apart from the introduction of twisted pairs, are no different today than when the first telephone exchange was opened in 1877 by the Bell Telephone Company.|$|E
50|$|To {{prevent the}} DSL signal from {{entering}} the phone lines into telephones, answering machines, faxes and other devices where it could cause interference, DSL modems come with low pass filters which must be plugged into the phone lines going to all <b>voiceband</b> devices on the same line. The filter blocks all frequencies above 4 kHz, so it blocks the DSL signal while allowing voice frequency signals through. A filter must not be inserted in the phone line going to the DSL modem, because it would block the communication between the modem and switching center.|$|E
