25|$|Acetaldehyde is a colorless, <b>volatile</b> <b>substance</b> with a fruity smell. Although {{it forms}} {{naturally}} in some fruit, {{it can cause}} an off-taste in bottled water. Acetaldehyde forms by degradation of PET through the mishandling of the material. High temperatures (PET decomposes above 300°C or 570°F), high pressures, extruder speeds (excessive shear flow raises temperature), and long barrel residence times all contribute {{to the production of}} acetaldehyde. When acetaldehyde is produced, some of it remains dissolved in the walls of a container and then diffuses into the product stored inside, altering the taste and aroma. This is not such a problem for non-consumables (such as shampoo), for fruit juices (which already contain acetaldehyde), or for strong-tasting drinks like soft drinks. For bottled water, however, low acetaldehyde content is quite important, because, if nothing masks the aroma, even extremely low concentrations (10–20 parts per billion in the water) of acetaldehyde can produce an off-taste.|$|E

40|$|<b>Volatile</b> <b>substances</b> are {{chemical}} compounds that give off fumes at room temperature. They are also called ‘inhalants’ {{in recognition of}} their route of administration [1]. They are central nervous system depressants, and their use involves deliberate inhalation to produce a state of altered consciousness or intoxication. Onset of effect occurs rapidly because the extensive capillary surface of the lungs readily absorbs the vapour, causing blood levels to peak within minutes of use [2]. There are approximately 250 household, medical and industrial products that contain potentially intoxicating <b>volatile</b> <b>substances</b> [1]. Many of these are readily available. <b>Volatile</b> <b>substances</b> are usually classified into four groups [3]: •	 solvents-liquids or semi-liquids that vaporise at room temperature, such as glues and petrol •	 gases-medical anaesthetics and fuel gases, such as lighter fuels •	 aerosols-sprays containing propellants and solvents •	 nitrites-amyl nitrite or cyclohexyl nitrite found in room deodorisers Nitrates, however, do not directly affect {{the central nervous system}} and their use occurs primarily for enhancement of sexual pleasure, rather than intoxication.

40|$|Background: Non-invasive breath {{analysis}} {{may provide}} valuable information for cancer recognition if disease specific volatile biomarkers could be identified. In order to compare non-diseased and diseased tissue in vivo this study {{took advantage of}} the special circumstances of one-lung ventilation (OLV) during lung-surgery. Methods: 15 cancer patients undergoing lung resection with OLV were enrolled. From each patient alveolar breath samples were taken separately from healthy and diseased lungs before and after tumour resection. <b>Volatile</b> <b>substances</b> were preconcentrated by means of solid-phase microextraction, separated, identified and quantified by means of GC-MS. Results: Different classes of <b>volatile</b> <b>substances</b> could be identified according to their concentration profiles. Due to prolonged fasting and activation of lipolysis concentrations of endogenous acetone significantly increased during surgery. Exogenous substances such as benzene or cyclohexanone showed typical washout exhalation kinetics. Exhaled concentrations of potentially tumour associated substances such as butane or pentane were different for non-diseased and diseased lungs and decreased significantly after surgery. Conclusion: Separate analysis of <b>volatile</b> <b>substances</b> exhaled from healthy and diseased lungs in the same patient, together with thorough consideration of substance origins and exhalation kinetics offers unique opportunities of biomarker recognition and evaluation. ...|$|R
