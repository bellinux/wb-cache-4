40|$|A {{parachute}} {{having an}} improved <b>vent</b> line stacking wherein the parachute {{is provided with}} a canopy having a central <b>vent</b> opening and a <b>vent</b> band secured to the canopy around {{the periphery of the}} <b>vent</b> opening, with a plurality of <b>vent</b> lines each lying on a diameter of the <b>vent</b> opening and having its ends secured to the <b>vent</b> band {{on opposite sides of the}} <b>vent</b> opening is described. The <b>vent</b> lines are sewed to the <b>vent</b> band in an order such that the end of a first <b>vent</b> line is sewed to the <b>vent</b> band at a starting point with the end of a second <b>vent</b> band then being sewed to the <b>vent</b> band adjacent to and counterclockwise from the first band. A third <b>vent</b> band is sewed to the <b>vent</b> band adjacent to and clockwise from the first band, with a fourth <b>vent</b> band being sewed to the <b>vent</b> band adjacent to and counterclockwise from the second <b>vent</b> band. It can be seen that, if the <b>vent</b> lines are numbered in the order of being sewed to the <b>vent</b> band, the odd numbered <b>vent</b> lines will run consecutively in a clockwise direction and the even numbered lines will run consecutively in a counterclockwise direction from the starting point.

40|$|In deep-sea {{hydrothermal}} <b>vent</b> fields, faunal {{distribution is}} associated with the geochemical environments generated by hydrothermal <b>vent</b> activity. Hydrothermal <b>vent</b> fields on the Central Indian Ridge (CIR) are associated with <b>vent</b> fauna which is thought as a mixture of Atlantic and Pacific and are discretely distributed along the ridge axis of more than 1, 000 km apart. In this chapter, faunal distribution in hydrothermal <b>vent</b> fields on the CIR is summarized at the intra- and inter-field levels. The species composition of the <b>vent</b> fauna in the four <b>vent</b> fields hitherto known is reviewed and updated, and faunal resemblance among the four <b>vent</b> fields of the CIR appears to reflect the number of species recorded, indicating that faunal surveys are not sufficient in describing the whole <b>vent</b> fauna on the CIR. All the genetic studies of the CIR <b>vent</b> fauna have indicated a high genetic connectivity among the local populations, despite the many potential dispersal barriers existing between the <b>vent</b> fields. On the basis of the spatial distribution of <b>vent</b> species in a <b>vent</b> field, typical <b>vent</b> fields on the CIR were classified into six zones, of which the central two zones are often covered by Rimicaris swarms in the Kairei and Edmond fields. The close relationship between <b>vent</b> fauna from the CIR and the western Pacific, compared to those from other regions, is highlighted.

5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the <b>venting,</b> through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch magazines.

5|$|This {{exothermic}} reaction is very slow below 100°C, but at temperature above 900°C {{the reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After <b>venting</b> the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations {{and at least one}} of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct <b>venting</b> of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor (PWR) containment buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises.|$|E

30|$|Several <b>vents</b> {{opened on}} September 27, 2014, {{according}} to reports by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) and Kaneko et al. (2016). Based on photographs of the summit area (Asahi Shimbun Newspaper, September 28, 2014; Kaneko et al. 2016), only one <b>vent</b> located {{in the center of}} these <b>vents</b> emitted an ash-laden plume, whereas the others emitted only steam-dominated plumes. The location of this center <b>vent</b> is shown in Fig.  1. We infer that the center <b>vent</b> was the only <b>vent</b> associated with the ejection of solid material by an ash-laden plume. Moreover, there is a pyroclastic cone in the south slope of the <b>vent</b> labeled “J 4 ” by Kaneko et al. (2016), which corresponds to our center <b>vent.</b> This pyroclastic cone suggests that the center <b>vent</b> emitted ballistic blocks. Therefore, the center <b>vent</b> was set as the only <b>vent</b> that ejected ballistic blocks in our simulation. The location of the center <b>vent</b> was taken from the polygon file provided on the GSI Web site (Geospatial information authority of Japan 2014), and its center was used as the ejection position of the ballistic blocks. Although our ballistic simulator can accept multiple ejection positions, only one position was used to focus on the effects of the topography and the ejection direction on the distribution of deposited particles. The center <b>vent</b> and two other <b>vents</b> were in the Jigokudani valley (Kaneko et al. 2016). The Jigokudani valley runs from northeast to southwest. The shape of this valley and the ejection position may have strongly affected the transport of the ballistic blocks.|$|R
5|$|Following Voyager's {{encounters}} with Enceladus {{in the early}} 1980s, scientists postulated {{that it may be}} geologically active based on its young, reflective surface and location near the core of the Ering. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the Ering, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the Ering, perhaps through <b>venting</b> of water vapor. Readings from Cassini's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism, where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, had been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement. Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the waves' frequency can be used to identify their composition, in this case ionized water vapor. During the two following encounters, the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region, with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the magnetometer, UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter.|$|E
25|$|Distraction from sadness using {{art therapy}} {{may be a}} better {{alternative}} than <b>venting</b> sadness. Two studies by Drake and Winner (2012) published from the American Psychological Association compared <b>venting</b> (expressing negative feelings) and distraction (expressing something that is not related to negative feelings) in one study. To distract oneself, the participants were told to draw something unrelated to a sad film they had watched. The participants who had vented were told to draw something related to the film. In study 2, the participants were told to think of a sad event and were put into the <b>venting,</b> distraction, and calming position or sitting conditions. The sitting condition allowed the passage of time to be evaluated. In study 1, the distraction method in which the participants drew something unrelated to the sad film significantly improved negative mood compared to the <b>venting</b> condition. In study 2, the distraction method in which the participants drew a house (something unrelated to the sad event), had significantly improved negative mood compared to <b>venting</b> (drawing the sad event) or the sitting condition (sat quietly for 10 minutes). Therefore, art therapy could be beneficial to people suffering from depressive moods through a way of distraction rather than <b>venting.</b>|$|E
