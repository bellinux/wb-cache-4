However, in cases where solids concentration in high-solids slurries is too high (50%+), {{it is better to}} handle these slurries using vacuum filtration, such as a continuous Indexing <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Belt</b> <b>Filter,</b> since high concentration of solids in slurries will increase pressure and if pressure is too high, the equipment might be damaged and/or less efficient operation.|$|E

40|$|The LignoCity Initiative {{is one of}} the {{existing}} test beds within the Environmental Technology topic, a part of "Testbed Sweden" and serves the need for infrastructure to upscale processes for lignin separation, purification and modification and/or lignin-based products and applications. The initiative offers help in the upscaling phase, with the aim of shortening the time to market for ideas. The main focus is to promote new lignin applications, although different new lignin separation unit operations and processes are other possible upscaling collaboration activities.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to compare the efficiency of counter-current and co-current filter cake washing techniques. Filter cake washing is a common unit operation which {{is used in the}} chemical process industry for improving the recovery of the liquid phase or for purifying the solid phase of the filter cake. Counter-current displacement washing is more difficult to arrange and it requires additional process equipment but the advantage of counter-current method is that the consumption of wash water that is required for achieving certain filter cake purity may be considerably decreased when compared to the co-current washing method. This is true especially for materials that are difficult to wash. The literature part of this thesis consists of a review of filter cake washing in general, including the basic principles of co-current and counter-current techniques, and a description of the structure and operation of a horizontal <b>vacuum</b> <b>belt</b> <b>filter,</b> which is the equipment considered in the experimental part of this thesis. Also the most common cake washing models are introduced. The experiments were performed by washing wheat apatite filter cakes in a laboratory scale vacuum filter by using both co-current and counter-current washing methods. The main results of these tests were the washing curves that relate the purity of the filter cake to the amount of wash liquid used. Comparison between the obtained washing curves showed that both washing methods could be efficiently applied for achieving good washing results. The differences between the wash liquid consumptions in the co-current and counter-current washing methods were found to be surprisingly small but this is most probably explained by the relatively good washing characteristics of the apatite cakes. The washing models introduced in the literature part were compared with the results obtained from the experiments and it was found out that the studied cake washing processes could be describe...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. Dewatering coal, and {{especially}} fine coal (- 600 μm), {{is a significant}} problem {{in the preparation of}} coal. The final moisture level of fine coal can be anything up to 30 % by weight, {{depending on the type of}} dewatering equipment used. Moisture in coal can cause many problems, for example by increasing the transportation costs, as well as decreasing the calorific value of the coal. In industry today there is a need for a dewatering technique that will produce a drier final product. It was found that an interruption in the application of vacuum during a single dewatering cycle yielded a filter cake with a lower final moisture content. It was also demonstrated that the rate at which the coal is being dewatered is much higher than during continuous vacuum application. A further study of this phenomenon showed a twofold time dependency involving both the duration of the vacuum break, and the instant it is introduced in the dewatering cycle. An optimum was found at about 29 s time duration and an introduction time of 30 s, after the start of the cycle. The possibilities of diffusion and cake structural changes were investigated. For the diffusion tests, repeated interruptions of the vacuum were performed during a single dewatering cycle. Although the kinetics agreed with what was expected, the final moisture content was not as low as that found for the optimum single break test. The compressibility of a coal filter cake was one of the structural changes investigated, the other being an increase in area and, thus, airflow through the cake. Coal filter cakes were shown to be largely incompressible. It was, however, shown that an increase in area, and thus an increase in the airflow through the cake, gave excellent results. An increased area resulted in a much lower final moisture content as well as an increase in the dewatering rate. The addition of a cake surface cutter to a standard <b>vacuum</b> <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> will make the application of these finfings relatively easy to industry. Master...|$|E

40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} elements on earth, iron is nearly always present in metal concentrates. This is specifically true for zinc sulphide concentrates, which can contain up to 18 % iron (marmatite). Today more than half of these concentrates are treated in hydrometallurgical- or combined hydrometallurgical¬pyrometallurgical circuits. In hydrometallurgical circuits, iron is solubilised (either in a roast-Ieach-, a direct leach- or bacterial leach circuit) along with zinc and must be removed from the zinc¬rich solution before the electrowinning- or solvent extraction step. Various iron removal processes were developed to address the iron problem in hydrometallurgical circuits. The better known of these include the jarosite-, goethite- and hematite processes also used in the zinc industry. Zincor (Zinc Corporation of South Africa) patented an iron removal process (Zincor Process), which was generally considered to be very similar to the so-called "para-goethite" iron removal process used only in two other zinc smelters notably Porto Vesme (Italy) and Pasminco Hobart (Tasmania). However, since the Zincor Process was patented in 1976, various changes have been made such as a change from a batch parallel to a continuous series process, a change in precipitation pH-profile and the introduction of a pH controlled acid wash in the second tank. The introduction of a weak acid leach step and <b>vacuum</b> <b>belt</b> <b>filters</b> at Zincor's residue treatment plant in the near future and an iron removal process that is not clearly understood, necessitated this further study of the Zincor iron removal process. The study has been conducted in three parts. The first part of the study has focused on the characterisation of the Zincor iron residue and the Zincor process. The second part of the study has been concerned with the definition of an optimum operating window in terms of the filterability of the residue and the third part investigated the use of neutralisation reagents other than zinc calcine to control the pH during iron precipitation. The distribution of iron in the Zincor iron precipitate, which usually contains between 35 % and 40 % iron, {{has been found to be}} as follows: approximately 45 % as schwertmannite, 5 % as ferrihydrite, 20 % as jarosites, 25 % as franklinite, trace amounts of pyrite as well as 5 % of an unknown phase. This confirmed that goethite is not present in the Zincor iron residue and that iron is mainly removed in the form of amorphous intermediate iron phases such as schwertmannite and ferrihydrite. Of these two phases, schwertmannite was the least expected as most work up until now were done on samples taken from natural environments. The following description of the conditions that promote iron removal, mainly as schwertmannite, is viewed as an expansion of the available literature data, which was gathered at ambient conditions. In terms of the main operating parameters, optimum filterability was achieved under the following conditions: pH of 3. 0, temperature as high as possible (70 °C) and at least 25 kg/m 3 seeding. A retention time of at least 4 hours at a pH of 3. 0 and 60 °C was required, which decreased by more than 50 % at a temperature of 70 °C. As these conditions mainly impact on the soluble zinc loss encountered during iron removal, an effort was made to further reduce the insoluble zinc loss, which is the inherent weakness in the Zincor process, and similar processes where zinc calcine is used for pH control, by investigating the use of alternative neutralisation reagents. This study showed that iron can be successfully removed with Ca(OH) 2, a basic zinc sulphate and zinc oxide mixture as well as chemically precipitated CaC 03 produced in the paper and pulp industry. Of these alternatives, CaC 03 appeared to be the most promising, with filtration rates an order of magnitude higher than the zinc oxide options (calcine and basic zinc sulphate mixture), due to better overall economics than with the use of Ca(OH) 2. Utilisation CaC 03 as an alternative neutralisation agent might increase the overall zinc recovery figure at Zincor by up to 1. 5 %. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that the Zincor process in its current form has a very distinct character compared to what was historically considered to be the very similar patented para-goethite iron removal process, as practiced at the Porto Vesme and the Pasminco Hobart hydrometallurgical zinc plants.

25|$|<b>Belt</b> press <b>filters</b> have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, {{gravity drainage}} zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> a three-belt system.
