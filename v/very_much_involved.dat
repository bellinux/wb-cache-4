A member of the National Trust, the current owner of Beaumont House, explains how Davenport's travels influenced his styles:Samuel Davenport was a great world traveller. He was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>involved</b> in the world exposition movement. Every two years there were big world expos happening in different cities around the world. And he would travel to every one of these expos...I'm sure that the influences that he picked up in all of his travels are reflected here in Beaumont House.|$|E

County Wexford wasn't as badly affected as some other areas by the Famine in the 1840s, but it still had a major impact on the county.|$|E
25|$|In Denmark, the Danish Women's Society (DK) debated, and informally supported, women's {{suffrage}} from 1884, {{but it did}} {{not support}} it publicly until in 1887, when it supported the suggestion of the parliamentarian Fredrik Bajer to grant women municipal suffrage. In 1886, in response to the perceived overcautious attitude of DK in the question of women suffrage, Matilde Bajer founded the Kvindelig Fremskridtsforening (or KF, 1886-1904) to deal exclusively with the right to suffrage, both in municipal and national elections, and it 1887, the Danish women publicly demanded the right for women's suffrage for the first time through the KF. However, as the KF was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>involved</b> with worker's rights and pacifist activity, the question of women's suffrage was in fact not given full attention, which led to the establishment of the strictly women's suffrage movement Kvindevalgretsforeningen (1889-1897). In 1890, the KF and the Kvindevalgretsforeningen united with five women's trade worker's unions to found the De samlede Kvindeforeninger, and through this form, an active women's suffrage campaign was arranged through agitation and demonstration. However, after having been met by compact resistance, the Danish suffrage movement almost discontinued with the dissolution of the De samlede Kvindeforeninger in 1893.|$|E
50|$|From the beginning, clubbing, {{while it}} was more rave subculture, has {{involved}} mostly younger people between 16 and 25 years of age. A subculture emerged around raves, featuring an ethos of peace, love, unity, and respect (the PLUR doctrine), rooted in community and empathy for others (Hill 2002; Hutson 2000; Reynolds 1998). Today, however, Tammy L.

500|$|Divorce is {{difficult}} on all parties {{involved in the}} process, including the children. Due to the stressful nature of divorce, along with inherent issues {{on the amount of}} time the children can spend with each parent, the process can have a long and lasting impact on the children. Unless the children's parents are often involved in intense conflict, or one of the parents is abusive and/or mentally ill, the children tend to fare better if the custody arrangement is a joint custody arrangement. Numerous studies have found that in joint custody arrangements, the children tend to exhibit better relationships with their families, better performance in their schools, higher levels of self-esteem, and fewer conduct and emotional issues. Further, it has been found that children that have a sole custody arrangement tend to have poorer outcomes when compared to average children (or rather children who do not have divorced parents), where children that have a joint custody arrangement tend to fare as well as average children. However, joint physical custody with an even division of time is not always necessary. These effects are generally seen simply when the children spend a substantial amount of time with both parents. According to Robert Emery, a divorce mediation expert, [...] "In many ways, joint physical custody is the ideal arrangement for children because they still have two parents <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>involved</b> in their lives." [...] This statement has been supported by psychological data. [...] Speculation that parental conflict erases the benefits of joint physical custody have not been supported by empirical research. A 2017 paper appearing in a journal published by the American Psychological Association analyzed every study that included measures and controls for conflict when comparing joint and sole physical custody families. Conflict was neither more nor less damaging for children in joint physical custody than those in sole custody. Of 16 studies that controlled for conflict when measuring children’s adjustment, only one reported worse adjustment in joint physical custody. One study found that boys did better and girls worse. Fourteen studies reported either better outcomes in joint physical custody or no differences, even after taking conflict into account.|$|E

He was promoted to Unterfeldwebel (junior non-commissioned officer) on 1 October 1936, to Feldwebel (non-commissioned officer) on 1 February 1937, and to Oberfeldwebel (staff sergeant) on 1 July 1937.|$|R

2500|$|Balasaheb Deoras, {{who succeeded}} Golwalkar {{as the chief}} of RSS, got <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>involved</b> in politics. In 1965, {{when he was the}} general {{secretary}} of the RSS, he addressed the annual meeting of Jana Sangh, which is seen as an [...] "unprecedented move" [...] by an RSS dignitary that reflected his strong interest in politics and his will to make the movement play a larger part in the public sphere. Jaffrelot says that he exemplified the specific kind of swayamsevaks known as 'activists', giving expression to his leanings towards political activism by having the RSS support the anti-Indira Gandhi's 'JP Movement'. The importance that RSS began to give to the electoral politics is demonstrated when its units (shakhas) were made constituency-based in the early 1970s, from which the RSS shakhas began to involve directly in elections, not only of legislatures, but also of trade unions, student and cultural organizations.|$|E

40|$|Raising {{awareness}} of the environmental impact of energy generation and consumption has been a recent concern of contemporary society worldwide. Underlying the {{awareness of}} energy consumption is an intricate network of perception and social interaction that can be mediated by technology. In this paper we argue that issues regarding energy, environment and technology are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> situated and <b>involve</b> tensions of sociocultural nature. This exploratory investigation addresses the subject by introducing the design of a Socially-inspired Energy Eco-Feedback Technology (SEET), which is composed of an interactive system to trigger and mediate collective savings and a tangible device as a public feedback. Results of an evaluation situated {{in the context of a}} school in a socially disadvantaged area in Brazil are discussed, shedding light on the sociocultural aspects related to the subject. The role of the SEET to motivate energy awareness collectively among the social group is assessed, as well as the design characteristics that contributed to that. Outcomes bring to light social aspects and dynamics that would hardly have been predicted, evidencing critical factors related to a socially inspired design approach in the energy awareness domain...|$|R

2500|$|Throughout the 1940s and 50s Anderson was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>involved</b> in Seattle's bustling art community. Morris Graves and Mark Tobey {{had become}} artists of {{international}} reputation; Tobey's studio {{and the home}} of painters Margaret and Kenneth Callahan become centers of lively socializing and philosophical debate. Otto Seligman and Zoe Dusanne were championing abstract art at their respective galleries, while SAM, the Henry Art Gallery, and the Frye Art Museum cautiously supported it. Anderson taught at the Helen Bush School in Seattle and Ruth Pennington's Fidalgo Art School in La Conner, while working at SAM, building stone mosaic patios for well-to-do patrons, and producing driftwood art for the commercial market. He lived in Seattle's University District, but spent much of his time painting at Graves' studio in La Conner or at the Callahans' summer place in Granite Falls, Washington. After a very successful show at SAM in 1945, he purchased his own cabin in Granite Falls. In September 1953 he became nationally known when Life magazine ran a major feature presenting Anderson, Tobey, Graves, and Kenneth Callahan as the [...] "big four" [...] of Northwest mystic art.|$|E
2500|$|This {{painting}} allegorically {{depicts the}} first meeting of Marie and Henry, which took place after their nuptials by proxy. The upper half of the painting shows Marie and Henry as the mythological Roman gods Juno and Jupiter. The representations are accompanied by their traditional attributes. Marie is shown as Juno (Greek Hera) identified by the peacocks and chariot. Henry is shown as Jupiter (Greek Zeus) identified by the fiery thunderbolts in his hand and the eagle. The joining of the couple's right hands is a traditional symbol of the marriage union. They are dressed in the classical style, which is naturally appropriate to the scene. Above the two stands Hymen who unites them. A rainbow extends from the left corner, a symbol of concord and peace. The lower half of the painting is dominated by imagery of Lyons. Reading from left to right, we see the cityscape with its single hill. The lions pull the chariot (which is a pun on the name of the city), and in the chariot we see the allegorical figure of the city herself with a crown of her battlements: Lyons. Rubens needed to be very careful in the representation of the couple's first meeting because allegedly Henry was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>involved</b> with a mistress {{at the time of the}} marriage. In fact, due to the king's other engagements their introduction was delayed, and it was not until midnight nearly a week after Marie arrived that Henry finally joined his bride. [...] By presenting him as Jupiter Rubens implies the promiscuity of the man and the deity. Simultaneously by placing King and Queen together he effectively illustrates the elevated status of the couple.|$|E
