40|$|Much of {{the recent}} debate about {{macroeconomic}} theory and policy in the United Kingdom {{has been seen as}} a simple clash between monetarists and Keynesians. This article argues that the vision is false. It traces out the changes which have taken place in the British economy {{since the start of the}} seventies and suggest some of the possible causes. These are developed around a framework of five fundamental differences that existed between monetarists and Keynesians at the start of the seventies and explains why there has been significant convergence over the disputed issues.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of sentences involves {{not only the}} retrieval {{of the meaning of}} single words, but the identification of the relation between a verb and its arguments. The way the brain manages to process word meaning and syntactic relations during language comprehension on-line still is a matter of debate. Here we review the different <b>views</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature and report data from crucial experiments investigating the temporal and neurotopological parameters of different information types encoded in verbs, i. e. word category information, the verb’s argument structure information, the verb’s selectional restriction and the morphosyntactic information encoded in the verb’s inflection. The neurophysiological indices of the processes dealing with these different information types suggest an initial independence of the processing of word category information from other information types as the basis of local phrase structure building, and a later processing stage during which different information types interact. The relative ordering of the subprocesses appears to be universal, whereas the absolute timing of when during later phrases interaction takes places varies as a function of when the relevant information becomes available. Moreover, the neurophysiological indices for non-local dependency relations vary {{as a function of the}} morphological richness of the language...|$|E
40|$|Recommender {{systems are}} {{becoming}} integral to how consumers discover media. The value that recommenders offer is personalization: in environments with many product choices, recommenders personalize the browsing and consumption experience to each userÕs taste. Popular applications include product recommendations at e-commerce sites and online newspapers’ automated selection of articles to display {{based on the}} current reader’s interests. This ability to focus more closely on one's taste and filter all else out has spawned criticism that recommenders will fragment consumers. Critics say recommenders cause consumers to have less in common {{with one another and}} that the media should do more to increase exposure to a variety of content. Others, however, contend that recommenders do the opposite: they may homogenize users because they share information among those who would otherwise not communicate. These are opposing <b>views,</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature for over ten years for which there is not yet empirical evidence. We present an empirical study of recommender systems in the music industry. In contrast to concerns that users are becoming more fragmented, we find that in our setting users’ purchases become more similar to one another. This increase in purchase similarity occurs for two reasons, which we term volume and taste effects. The volume effect is that consumers simply purchase more after recommendations, increasing the chance of having more purchases in common. The taste effect is that, conditional on volume, consumers buy a more similar mix of products after recommendations. When we view consumers’ purchases as a similarity network before versus after recommendations, we find that the network becomes denser and smaller, or characterized by shorter inter-user distances. These findings suggest that for this setting, recommender systems are associated with an increase in commonality in consumption and that concerns of fragmentation may be misplaced. recommender systems, collaborative filtering, fragmentation, personalization, long tail...|$|E

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{shortcomings}} of the Random Effects models {{is that it does}} not allow the unobserved individual factors to correlate with the explanatory variables.

40|$|Non-standard {{decision}} {{models are}} often inconsistent {{with a narrow}} version of the revealed preference principle, according to which “utility maximization and observed choice are synonymous”.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{claims that}} conceptual structure {{is in some}} part metaphorical, as identified by verbal metaphors like LOVE IS A JOURNEY.

It is argued that the first interpretation is not fully coherent.

40|$|Visual {{symmetry}} {{has been}} found to be preferred to asymmetry in a variety of domains and across species. A number of theories propose to explain why symmetry is preferred. In this article, I compare a perceptual bias view, in which symmetry is preferred due to factors inherit to the visual system, and an evolutionary advantage view, in which symmetry is preferred due to selection pressures on partner preference. Preferences for symmetry in three stimulus types were determined by having symmetric and asymmetric versions of the same images rated for pleasantness: human female faces, macaque monkey faces, and abstract art. It was found that preferences for symmetry were strongest for human female faces and weakest for art. This finding builds on previous research suggesting that symmetry preferences for human faces are different from symmetry preferences in other domains and that simple perceptual bias explanations do not wholly explain human visual face symmetry preferences. While consistent with an evolutionary advantage view, these data are also potentially explainable via a perceptual bias view which accounts for experience of stimuli.

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{reflection}} on effects produced by earthquakes {{at both ends of}} intensity scales: II (‘Scarcely felt') and XII (‘Completely devastating'). Now that most seismic regions—at least in developed countries—are monitored by seismic networks with magnitude thresholds close to magnitude 1, less attention is paid to reports of abnormal phenomena such as vibrations or noises. The alleged reason is that, if the event has not been detected by monitoring networks, there was no event at all. This point of <b>view</b> is <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light of recent examples in South-East France, where tectonic earthquakes with a very shallow focus (sometimes only 300 -m deep) can be heard and felt, whereas the nearby (less than 20 km) seismic stations could not record the events. Our study concludes that events with a magnitude smaller than 1, and even negative magnitudes, can be felt, thus making the human being an instrument eventually much more sensitive than monitoring networks. Another type of remarkable observation which has been reported during earthquakes is the upthrow of objects into the air. Such observations are evidence of ground acceleration exceeding gravity. Although this type of observation is associated with an intensity of XII on the modified Mercalli intensity scale, we show that earthquakes of magnitude as low as 6 can produce such effects...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Norwegian {{coastline}} is rugged {{with long}} fjords, and exposed to wind and waves from the North Sea. The fjords represent barriers to crossing traffic, and thus also to industrial growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coastal regions. Because {{of the many}} ferry connections <b>in</b> coastal regions, <b>the</b> Norwegian Public Roads Administration has always been searching {{for new ways to}} cross the fjords by fixed connections. During the last years limits have been stretched with regard to the use of slender suspension bridges as well as long and deep sub sea rock tunnels. However, there are still many ferry connections left. These are the most extreme fjord crossings, where existing bridge building technology has to be developed further, and in addition, new knowledge and experience from offshore technology turns out to be of great importance. To develop new alternative fjord crossing methods, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, Western Region, has organized a conceptual feasibility study of how to cross the wide and extremely deep Sognefjord. The experience from this study will be of great value to other fjord crossing projects as well. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> study may be of interest to projects in scenic inland lake areas and urban waterfront areas. The feasibility study focuses on crossing alternatives based on the use of water as a bearing element of the bridge structures.

A biographical sketch of the composer’s public life was developed incorporating <b>the</b> significant events <b>in</b> his life as they relate to <b>the</b> compositions, and <b>in</b> particular, his work with children. The primary sources for this study are the composer’s own writings - some of which were specially translated from Russian into English {{for the purpose of this}} study. Kabalevsky offered an alternative philosophy to that of many Western educators and musicians.

The clearest expression of his educational views is seen in his book A Story of Three Whales and Many Other Things and the recorded talks with children entitled What Music Says, both of which were translated from the Russian for this study. An overview of Kabalevsky’s music was developed, with particular reference to his music for children. Kabalevsky’s piano music for children is <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> larger context of his output for the instrument. Particular emphasis is placed on the use he made of the song, the dance and the march - the three major genres that are the basis of the small character pieces which constitute the majority of his works for children. Five sets of music, from the twelve-volume collection entitled Piano Music for Children and Young People, have been selected for investigation <b>in</b> this study. <b>The</b> sets are <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Pioneer Camp Op. 3 / 86 (127 / 1968), From Pioneer Life Op. 14 (1931 / 1968), Thirty Children’s Pieces Op. 27 (1937 - 38), Twenty-Four Easy Pieces Op. 39 (1943) and Thirty-Five Easy Pieces Op. 89 (1972). A descriptive analysis of each of the 100 pieces (under set criteria) was carried out, highlighting the major focus of the piece as well as the important pedagogical elements. An important aspect of this study was the identification and classification of <b>the</b> piano pieces <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> genre or style of the song, the dance or the march; only some were identified as such by the composer. The classification of pieces provided an important link between Kabalesky’s educational philosophy and his piano music for children. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} {{history of}} the Small Magellanic cloud (SMC) is unraveled {{based on the results}} of our new chemical evolution models constructed for the SMC, highlighting <b>the</b> observed anomaly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> age-metallicity relation for star clusters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SMC. We first propose that evidence of a major merger is imprinted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> age-metallicity relation as a dip in [Fe/H]. Our models predict that the major merger with a mass ratio of 1 : 1 to 1 : 4 occurred at ~ 7. 5 Gyr ago, with a good reproduction of the abundance distribution function of field stars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SMC. Furthermore, our models predict a relatively large scatter in [Mg/Fe] for - 1. 4 < [Fe/H] <- 1. 1 as a reflection of a looping feature resulting from the temporally inverse progress of chemical enrichment, which can be tested against future observational results. Given that the observed velocity dispersion (~ 30 km/s) of the SMC is much smaller than that (~ 160 km/s) of the Galactic halo, our finding strongly implies that the predicted merger event happened in a small group environment that was far from the Galaxy and contained a number of small gas-rich dwarfs comparable to the SMC. This theoretical <b>view</b> is extensively <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> framework that considers a connection with the formation {{history of the}} Large Magellanic cloud.
