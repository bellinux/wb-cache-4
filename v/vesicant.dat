25|$|Phenyldichloroarsine, NATO {{abbreviation}} PD, is {{an organic}} arsenical <b>vesicant</b> and vomiting agent developed by Germany and France {{for use as}} a chemical warfare agent during World War I. The agent is known by multiple synonyms and is technically classified as a <b>vesicant,</b> or blister agent.|$|E
25|$|Phenyldichloroarsine is an {{obsolete}} {{chemical warfare}} agent and {{is classified as}} a <b>vesicant</b> or a vomiting/incapacitating agent. It {{was used as a}} weapon during World War I, where it showed itself as less effective than other vomiting agents. Phenyldichloroarsine is an arsenical <b>vesicant</b> which can be mixed with mustard agents for use in chemical warfare.|$|E
25|$|Only qualified, chemotherapy-certified {{nurses who}} have been trained in {{venipuncture}} and administration of medications with <b>vesicant</b> and irritant potential {{should be allowed to}} administer vesicants.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>Vesicants</b> are {{blistering}} agents, extravasation {{may lead}} to irreversible tissue injury.|$|R
50|$|Complications {{related to}} extravasation are {{possible}} with any medication.Since <b>Vesicants</b> are blistering agents, extravasation {{may lead to}} irreversible tissue injury.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for chemical weapons {{to be used}} in terrorism is a real possibility. Classes of chemical weapons include nerve agents, <b>vesicants</b> (blister agents), choking agents, incapacitating agents, riot control agents, blood agents, and toxic industrial chemicals. The nerve agents work by blocking the actions of acetylcholinesterase leading to a cholinergic syndrome. Nerve agents include sarin, tabun, VX, cyclosarin, and soman. The <b>vesicants</b> include sulfur mustard and lewisite. The <b>vesicants</b> produce blisters and also damage the upper airways. Choking agents include phosgene and chlorine gas. Choking agents cause pulmonary edema. Incapacitating agents include fentanyl and its derivatives and adamsite. Riot control agents include Mace and pepper spray. Blood agents include cyanide. The mechanism of toxicity for cyanide is blocking oxidative phosphorylation. Toxic industrial chemicals include agents such as formaldehyde, hydrofluoric acid, and ammonia...|$|R
25|$|The digits, hands, {{and wrists}} {{should be avoided}} as {{intravenous}} sites for <b>vesicant</b> administration because of the close network of tendons and nerves that would be destroyed if an extravasation occurred.|$|E
25|$|Some {{members of}} Paederina (specifically the genus Paederus), a {{subtribe}} of Paederinae, contain a potent <b>vesicant</b> in their haemolymph {{that can produce}} a skin irritation called dermatitis linearis, which in English has acquired the inaccurate name Paederus dermatitis. The irritant pederin is highly toxic, more potent than cobra venom.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, the United States built a {{stockpile}} of 20,000 tonnes of weaponized lewisite (ClCH=CHAsCl2), a <b>vesicant</b> (blister agent) and lung irritant. The stockpile was neutralized with bleach and {{dumped into the}} Gulf of Mexico in the 1950s. During the Vietnam War, the United States used Agent Blue, a mixture of sodium cacodylate and its acid form, {{as one of the}} rainbow herbicides to deprive North Vietnamese soldiers of foliage cover and rice.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{depending}} on clinical circumstances, central line access {{may be most}} appropriate for patients who require repeated administrations of <b>vesicants</b> and irritants.|$|R
50|$|For {{those cases}} {{regarded}} as psychologically incurable, Pinel would employ baths, showers, opium, camphor and other antispasmodics, {{as well as}} <b>vesicants,</b> cauterization, and bloodletting in certain limited cases only. He also recommended the use of laxatives {{for the prevention of}} nervous excitement and relapse.|$|R
5000|$|To get {{drugs that}} can cause serious damage to skin and muscle tissue if they leak outside a vein (these drugs are known as <b>vesicants).</b> Getting them through a CVC {{rather than in a}} {{short-term}} IV reduces the risk that the drug will leak and damage tissues.|$|R
25|$|The {{most widely}} {{reported}} and, perhaps, {{the most effective}} gas of the First World War was mustard gas. It was a <b>vesicant</b> that was introduced by Germany in July 1917 prior to the Third Battle of Ypres. The Germans marked their shells yellow for mustard gas and green for chlorine and phosgene; hence they called the new gas Yellow Cross. It was known to the British as HS (Hun Stuff), while the French called it Yperite (named after Ypres).|$|E
25|$|The {{active agent}} has been {{estimated}} present at about 0.2-0.7mg per beetle, males producing significantly more than females. The beetle secretes the agent orally, and exudes it from its joints as a milky fluid. The potency of the insect species as a <b>vesicant</b> has been known since antiquity and the activity {{has been used in}} various ways. This has led to its small-scale commercial preparation and sale, in a powdered form known as cantharides (from the plural of Greek κανθαρίς, Kantharis, beetle), obtained from dried and ground beetles. The crushed powder is of yellow-brown to brown-olive color with iridescent reflections, is of disagreeable scent, and is bitter to taste. Cantharidin, the active agent, is a terpenoid, and is produced by some other insects, such as Epicauta immaculata.|$|E
25|$|Sulfur mustard {{was used}} as a {{chemical}} weapon in World War I and more recently in the Iran–Iraq War. Sulfur mustard is a <b>vesicant</b> alkylating agent with strong cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic properties. After exposure, victims show skin irritations and blisters. This agent also causes respiratory tract lesions, bone marrow depression, and eye damage, the epithelial tissues of these organs being predominately affected. Inhalation of high doses of this gas causes lesions in the larynx, trachea, and large bronchi with inflammatory reactions and necrosis. The alkylating agent affects more the upper parts of the respiratory tract, and only intensely exposed victims showed signs like bronchiolitis obliterans in the distal part. Secondary effects of sulfur mustard exposure lead to chronic lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis.|$|E
50|$|In 1870, Norman Chevers, M.D., a Surgeon-Major to the Bengal Medical Service, {{authored}} Manual of Medical Jurisprudence for India, describing unusual crimes involving poisons {{native to}} India. The book included three cases of poison khilat death, attributing {{the cause of}} one of the deaths to lethal <b>vesicants</b> impregnating the fabric of the robe and entering the victim's sweat pores.|$|R
2500|$|At {{various times}} between September 1939 and April 1945, many {{experiments}} were conducted at Sachsenhausen, Natzweiler, and other camps {{to investigate the}} most effective treatment of wounds caused by mustard gas. Test subjects were deliberately exposed [...] to mustard gas and other <b>vesicants</b> (e.g. Lewisite) which inflicted severe chemical burns. The victims' wounds were then tested {{to find the most}} effective treatment for the mustard gas burns.|$|R
50|$|Under the guidelines, seven {{research}} projects involving chemical weapons and human subjects were {{submitted by the}} Chemical Corps for Secretary of the Army approval in August 1953. One project involved <b>vesicants,</b> one involved phosgene, and five were experiments which involved nerve agents; all seven were approved. Operation Top Hat, however, was not among the projects submitted to the Secretary of the Army for approval.|$|R
25|$|When the United States {{entered the}} war, {{it was already}} mobilizing {{resources}} from academic, industry and military sectors {{for research and development}} into poison gas. A Subcommittee on Noxious Gases was created by the National Research Committee, a major research center was established at Camp American University, and the 1st Gas Regiment was recruited. The 1st Gas Regiment eventually served in France, where it used phosgene gas in a number of attacks. The Artillery used Mustard gas with significant effect during the Meuse Argonne Offensive on at least three occasions. The United States began large-scale production of an improved <b>vesicant</b> gas known as Lewisite, for use in an offensive planned for early 1919. By the time of the armistice on 11 November, a plant near Willoughby, Ohio was producing 10 tons per day of the substance, for a total of about 150 tons. It is uncertain what effect this new chemical would have had on the battlefield, however, as it degrades in moist conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Amiodarone IV {{should be}} {{administered}} via a Central Venous Catheter. [...] It has a pH of 4.08. [...] If administered {{outside of the}} standard concentration of 900mg/500mL it should be administered using a 0.22 micron filter to prevent preciptiate from reaching the patient. [...] Amiodarone IV is a known <b>vesicant.</b> For infusions of longer than 1 hour, do not exceed concentrations of 2mg/mL unless a central venous catheter is used.|$|E
2500|$|Infiltration {{occurs when}} an IV fluid or {{medication}} accidentally enters the surrounding tissue {{rather than the}} vein. It may occur when the vein itself ruptures (the elderly are particularly prone to fragile veins due to a paucity of supporting tissues), when the vein is damaged during insertion of the intravascular access device, when the device is not sited correctly, from increased vein porosity or when the entry point of the device into the vein becomes {{the path of least}} resistance (e.g. if a cannula is in a vein for some time, the vein may scar and close and the only way for fluid to leave is along the outside of the cannula where it enters the vein). Infiltration is an inadvertent administration of a nonvesicant solution/drug into the tissue, which happens so often when the tourniquet isn't removed in a timely fashion. [...] Infiltration is characterized by coolness and pallor to the skin as well as localized swelling or edema. It is treated by removing the intravenous access device and elevating the affected limb so that the collected fluids can drain away. Sometimes injections of hyaluronidase can be used to speed the dispersal of the fluid/drug. Infiltration is one of the most common adverse effects of IV therapy and is usually not serious unless the infiltrated fluid is a medication damaging to the surrounding tissue, most commonly a <b>vesicant</b> or chemotherapeutic agent, in which case it is called extravasation and extensive necrosis can occur.|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{chemical}} components {{can be used}} as warfare threats directly targeting humans. They can be classified according to their main biological effects as nerve agents, <b>vesicants,</b> lung damaging agents, cyanogen agents and incapacitants. Other chemical agents are water and food contaminants. Sill other less aggressive compounds are mainly used to control riots. Smokes, flame materials and herbicides belong to other classes of chemical agents of the warlike armamentum exhibiting a direct effect on man...|$|R
50|$|A {{chemical}} burn {{occurs when}} living tissue {{is exposed to}} a corrosive substance such as a strong acid or base. Chemical burns follow standard burn classification and may cause extensive tissue damage. The main types of irritant and/or corrosive products are: acids, bases, oxidizers / reducing agents, solvents, and alkylants. Additionally, chemical burns {{can be caused by}} some types of chemical weapons, e.g., <b>vesicants</b> such as mustard gas and Lewisite, or urticants such as phosgene oxime.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes, {{the skin}} will blister {{when it comes}} into contact with a cosmetic, detergent, solvent, or other {{chemical}} such as nickel sulfate, Balsam of Peru, or urushiol (poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac). This is known as contact dermatitis. Blisters can also develop {{as a result of}} an allergic reaction to an insect bite or sting. Some chemical warfare agents, known as blister agents or <b>vesicants,</b> cause large, painful blisters wherever they contact skin; an example is mustard gas.|$|R

2500|$|A large {{variety of}} organoarsenic {{compounds}} are known. Several were developed as chemical warfare agents during World War I, including <b>vesicants</b> such as lewisite and vomiting agents such as adamsite. Cacodylic acid, {{which is of}} historic and practical interest, arises from the methylation of arsenic trioxide, a reaction that has no analogy in phosphorus chemistry. Indeed, cacodyl was the first organometallic compound known, and was named from the Greek κακωδἰα [...] "stink" [...] for its offensive odor; like all arsenic compounds, it is very poisonous.|$|R
50|$|In June 1953 the United States Army {{formally}} adopted guidelines {{regarding the}} use of human subjects in chemical, biological, or radiological testing and research, where authorization from the Secretary of the Army was now required for all research projects involving human subjects. Under the guidelines, seven research projects involving chemical weapons and human subjects were submitted by the Chemical Corps for Secretary of the Army approval in August 1953. One project involved <b>vesicants,</b> one involved phosgene, and five were experiments which involved nerve agents; all seven were approved.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [An {{overview}} {{is given}} of biological markers {{of exposure to}} chemical warfare agents. Metabolites, protein, and/or DNA adducts have been identified for most nerve agents and <b>vesicants</b> and validated in experimental nimals or in {{a small number of}} human exposures. For several agents, metabolites derived from hydrolysis are unsatisfactory biomarkers of exposure because of background levels in the human population. These are assumed to result from environmental exposure to commercial products that contain these hydrolysis products or chemicals that are metabolized to them. In these cases, metabolites derived from glutathione pathways, or covalent adducts with proteins or DNA, provide more definitive biomarkers. Biomarkers for cyanide and phosgene are unsatisfactory as indicators of chemical warfare exposure because of other sources of these chemicals or their metabolites...|$|R
40|$|The UK {{government}} has {{carried out a}} research programme studying military capability under conditions of chemical warfare at a facility at Porton Down, Wiltshire, since World War I. In 2001 the Ministry of Defence commissioned a cohort study to investigate the long-term health effects on military veterans of their participation in this programme. We assessed the availability and quality of exposure assessment data held in the archive at Porton Down {{for the purpose of}} this study. This involved looking in detail at exposure data in a sample of 150 veterans and undertaking a general review of all available records held in the archive. These sources suggested that the Porton Down records were largely complete and included sufficient identifying information for linkage with service personnel data and with national mortality and cancer registration records. Servicemen usually had multiple tests so data were most readily available in a test-wise format, allowing subsequent aggregation of tests by individual. The name of the chemical used in each test could be determined for most tests and most of the named chemicals could be categorized into major groups for epidemiological analyses. For the major groups (<b>vesicants</b> and nerve agents), quantitative data were available on exposure and on acute toxicity. Standardization will be required of the several different units which were used. Based on this study, exposure assessment for the cohort study of Porton Down veterans will involve abstraction of the name of the chemical used in each test, with quantitative data on exposure and acute toxicity for <b>vesicants</b> and nerve agents. Our results here show that experimental records at Porton Down offer a unique and valuable resource for reconstructing the chemical exposures used in this research programme. The resulting cohort study has the potential to provide information which will assist in understanding the long-term health impact of chemical warfare agent exposure on these veterans...|$|R
40|$|I Abstract I Sesqui- and oxy-mustards pose a {{significant}} threat to military forces and civilians {{because they are}} potent <b>vesicants.</b> We have developed an isotope-dUution high-performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method utilizing negative ion multiple reaction monitoring {{for the analysis of}} sesqui-mustard metabolites bis(2 -hydroxyethylthio) alkanes (n = 1 - 5) and oxy-mustard metabolite bis(2 -hydroxyethylthioethyl) ether in human urine. Relative standard deviations were < 10 % and the reportable limits of detection were I ng/ml in 0. 5 mL of urine. We applied this method to 100 samples collected from individuals with no known exposure to sesqui- or oxy-mustards, and no urines showed detectable levels of any of the analytes, suggesting that these metabolites may be used for monitoring exposure to sesqui- and oxy-mustards...|$|R
