40|$|While an {{understanding}} of the dispersion of refrigerant in occupied spaces is important to ASHRAE Standard 15 - 2010 ’s objective of ensuring the safety of occupants for spaces in which HVAC&R systems are installed, only simplified models are generally used to describe refrigerant leakage phenomena because of their complexity. This paper describes some studies of the transient refrigerant dispersion behavior from variations in the leakage rate, the exhaust ventilation rate, and the height of a wall undercut {{that could be used to}} develop improved models of the dynamics of refrigerant leaks. The results indicate that well-mixed models do not accurately describe the refrigerant distribution in many cases because of stratification, and that this stratification may be used in tandem with <b>vent</b> <b>placement</b> to ensure that refrigerant concentration levels do not exceed safety limits...|$|E

Otherwise nowadays the teaching period has been expanded and the classrooms in many cases are used also for recreations of pupils free from school by local authorities. During months like June or September also in North Italy are present periods of high diurnal temperature and humidity. Consequently {{at least in the}} design of new school building some kind of cooling strategy is needed and considering the limited economic budget for functioning of this kind of institutions have to be low energy demanding. In this context night natural ventilation seems a promising solution able to provide cooling when requested. Even if its cooling capacity is limited, an optimized design process can lead to comfortable and controllable conditions for the occupants and can reach relevant decreases in energy consumption. As a case study the authors assumed the design of a new school building near Treviso in the North-East Italy. The purpose of the work is to analyse for northern Italian climate the performances of natural ventilation strategies such as stack chimney effect and wind induced cross ventilation by means of computational fluid dynamics simulation (CFD). Through a climatic analysis the mean wind directions and velocities and the mean ambient temperature fluctuations have been calculated. After the climatic analysis a urban CFD simulation has been performed to investigate wind behavior near the school building. A first design step was the sizing of openings and ventilation chimney by means of normographs and after that an internal CFD simulation has been performed with the aim of evaluate air flow patterns inside the classrooms. <b>Vent</b> <b>placement</b> and ventilation chimney shape and height have been verified and optimized considering a night ventilation flow pattern during summer. The internal analysis has highlighted that during a typical summer night the air moves across the school room entering from the bottom window and going out from the top chimney, providing an air changes value of 9 volumes per hour. This night summer air flow pattern lead to a surface temperatures reduction of about 2, 2 °C and to an air temperatures reduction of about 4, 7 °C...|$|E
25|$|Particulate contaminants, {{including}} pollen, dust, fibers, and soot, may affix {{to objects}} after entering collection areas through poorly maintained ventilation systems. Individuals {{passing through a}} collection area may also have particulates embedded on their clothing or bodies, which can become dislodged thereby becoming an airborne contaminant. Construction or maintenance efforts are another common cause of particulate pollution. Particulates which adhere to collection objects may cause soiling or blemishing, requiring mechanical removal and conservation efforts. These pollutants can be minimized via high quality HVAC systems, regularly replaced filters for <b>vents,</b> and careful <b>placement</b> of objects away from high-risk areas such as designated smoking sections, construction sites, and high-traffic areas such as entryways.|$|R
