At six slaughterhouses, the duodenum was collected from 458 randomly chosen pigs and examined in the laboratory. Three semi-solid <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> (modified semisolid Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium [MSRV], diagnostic semi-solid Salmonella medium [DIASALM], and Simple Method Salmonella [SMS] agar) and three enrichment broths (Rappaport-Vassiliadis, Rappaport Vassiliadis broth with Soya [RVS], and Muller Kauffmann Tetrathionate novobiocin broth [MKTTn]) were evaluated. If a migration zone was present on the semi-solid media, a loopful was taken both near the inoculation drop and {{at the edge of the}} migration zone and streaked on a Xylose Lysine Desoxycholate (XLD) agar plate. Each enrichment broth was streaked on XLD, and three presumptive colonies were further examined. Detection rate was calculated, and isolates were, after serotyping, genotyped by performing pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The overall frequency of Salmonella isolated in at least one of the six different media was 15. 5 % (71 / 458). No significant differences in relative sensitivity were obtained within semi-solid media and within liquid media. Semi-solid media showed a significant higher relative sensitivity than the one obtained with liquid media. A relative sensitivity higher than 83. 1 %, namely of 94. 4 %, could only be obtained by combining three different <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> (MSRV or DIASALM+RVS+MKTTn).

40|$|Low {{survival}} rate, {{slow growth}} and developmental abnormalities during the larval stage are challenges related to aquaculture of marine species. Several {{studies have shown}} that feeding the larvae their natural feed source, zooplankton, improves these factors significantly compared to feeding them intensive feeds like rotifers. The nutritional quality of the feed is likely to play a crucial role. Components suggested to have an impact are, for instance, the typical marine fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosehexaenoic acid (DHA). A high content of free amino acids (FAA) and peptides are also believed to be of importance due to limited differentiation of the digestive system in the larvae. In addition, the content of some minerals is believed to be crucial. The main objective {{of this study was to}} examine whether there were differences in biochemical composition between zooplankton and two intensive feeds (A and B) that could, at least in part, explain the increased growth when feeding on zooplankton at Lofilab AS (Steine, Norway). Natural rotifers are deficient or low in several nutritional components required for fish and thus they are normally enriched prior to feeding. A secondary aim was to compare the biochemical composition of the rotifers prior to and after enrichment. Three commercial <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> were also analysed and two underutilised marine sources of nutrients (krill and calanus) were included. The results showed large differences in biochemical composition between zooplankton and the intensive feeds, in particular in components of typical marine origin. The sum of the most typical marine fatty acids, EPA+ DHA, in zooplankton was 38. 5 % of the total lipid fraction, corresponding to 3. 1 % of the diet. In the intensive feeds the EPA+DHA were 21. 7 % (A) and 20. 5 % (B) respectively, corresponding to 2. 6 % and 2. 4 % of the diets. The relative amount of FAA in zooplankton was 15. 7 %, while the equivalent amounts in the intensive feeds were 10. 4 % and 12. 1 % in feed A and B respectively. Zooplankton was rich in taurine, 8. 4 mg/g dry weight (DW), while the two intensive feeds were almost devoid of it, reflecting the composition of the <b>enrichment</b> <b>media.</b> Except for phosphorus, zooplankton was richer in all of the minerals analysed. The main effect of the enrichment of rotifers was an increase of the amount of EPA and DHA in two out of three enrichment protocols. The existing enrichment protocols were ineffective if the target was to increase the content of the other nutritional components. The biochemical compositions of krill and calanus were more similar to zooplankton, as the content of taurine and EPA+DHA was higher than in the commercial <b>enrichment</b> <b>media,</b> thus supporting the idea of utilising these marine resources as new and improved <b>enrichment</b> <b>media...</b>|$|R

The digestive systems of the Arabian camels are anatomically {{different from that of}} the true ruminants such as cattle and sheep. The forestomach of camelids consists of three chambers, whilst in the true ruminant, they have four. Despite having differences in anatomical structures, functionally they are the same. The molecular diversity of the foregut bacterial {{community in the}} dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) in Central Australia was investigated through comparative analyses of 16 S rRNA gene sequences prepared from the foregut contents of 12 adult feral camels fed on native vegetation. A total of 267 near complete 16 S rRNA clones were examined, with 151 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified at a 99 % species-level identity cut-off criterion. The prediction of actual diversity in the foregut of the dromedary camel, using the Chaol’s approach, was 238 OTUs, while the richness and evenness of the diversity estimated, using the Shannon’s index, was 4. 84. The majority of clone bacteria in the current study was affiliated with the bacterial phylum Firmicutes (67 % of total clones) and was related to the classes Clostridia, Bacilli, and Mollicutes, and these were followed in number by the Bacteroidetes (25 %) that were mostly represented by the family Prevotellaceae. The remaining phyla consisted of Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cynophyta, Lentisphaerae, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and Sphirochaetes. Moreover, 11 clones of cultivated bacteria were identified as Brevundimonas sp., Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Prevotella sp., and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. The novelty in this foregut environment is remarkable where 97 % of the OTUs were distantly related to any known sequence in the public database. In the second study, numerous genera of cellulolytic bacteria, involved in fibre degradation in the rumen, and their functional role in the foregut of the dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) were investigated using 16 S rRNA gene libraries. The foregut content from five adult feral camels, fed on native vegetation, was inoculated in three different fibre <b>enrichment</b> <b>media,</b> namely; cotton thread (CT), filter paper (FP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF). A total of 283 near complete 16 S rRNA clones were examined, with 33 OTUs identified at a 99 % species-level identity cut-off criterion. The actual diversity was estimated using Chaol’s approach, with 42 OTUs predicted, while the richness of the diversity estimated using Shannon’s index was 2. 82. LIBSHUFF analysis of the three 16 S rRNA clone libraries revealed significant differences across all of them. Clostridium bifermentans were found in all three libraries, while Eubacterium sp, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Pyramidobacter piscolens and Schwartzia succinivorans were found in both CT and FP <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> only. The current results in the present study showed significant findings of fibre-degrading bacteria that inhabit the foregut of wild dromedary camels. In the third study, the total bacterial community, F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens, in the foregut of the dromedary camel was measured by quantifying the cell number of each respective species using real-time PCR. The samples from this study were obtained from the same samples used in the second study. The standard curve gave a linear relationship (R 2 = 0. 969) with the equation y= - 2. 975 x+ 42. 33. Using an absolute quantification method, the numbers of cells in one millilitre of each sample ranged from 4. 07 x 106 to 2. 73 x 109 for total bacteria, 1. 34 x 103 to 2. 17 x 105 for F. succinogenes and 5. 78 x 101 to 3. 53 x 104 for R. flavefaciens. The mean cell number for three set of primers used in the current study demonstrated that the number of general bacteria prevalent in the CT <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> was 242 -fold higher than in rumen content. The mean cell number of F. succinogenes was highest in the FP <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> at approximately 107 -fold, whereas for the R. flavefaciens targeted primer, the NDF <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> had the highest mean cell number with approximately 4 -fold when compared to the rumen content. Despite having a low population density in the rumen samples compared to samples from domesticated ruminants, the data presented here would help farmers to develop feeding regimes for dromedary camels since they do not share an interest in the forage consumed by domesticated livestock, especially during a drought season. The final study of this thesis was to identify the unrealized fibre-degrading bacteria in this environment niche using a combination of culturation and molecular methods. Samples in this study were obtained from the same <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> (CT, FP and NDF) used in the second and third studies. In this study, only 66 partial-length (700 bp) sequenced isolates were successfully recovered. The majority of the isolates in this study were represented by the phylum Firmicutes followed by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The phylum Firmicutes was dominant in the CT and FP <b>enrichment</b> <b>media,</b> while a reasonable number of Proteobacteria was present in the NDF enrichment culture. The genus Clostridium was found in all <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> and was the most dominant genus with the highest frequency, 56. 1 % of isolates, followed by Escherichia coli (19. 3 %), Actinomyces ruminicola (15. 8 %) and Streptococcus lutetiensis (8. 8 %). The results of the culture dependent methods revealed the difficulties in culturing fibre degrading bacteria and more work is needed to address this. None of the isolates obtained from the fibre-enriched media was able to degrade cellulose independently, confirming the complexity of the microbial ecosystem and the importance of the interaction between bacterial groups to degrade fibre. Overall, results of this study provided an insight into a microbial system of a herbivore that has not been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the study of the fibre-degrading bacterial community in the foregut of the dromedary camel has provided data that, hopefully, will contribute to the sustainable farming of camels well into the future. These animals do not compete with domesticated ruminants such as cattle and sheep either in feeding behaviour or in the type of feed these animals consume, so the data could support plans for the commercial management of a potential new livestock industry in Australia...|$|R

Conclusion: The comparison results of 3 <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> and 6 selective media showed that the mixture of RV broth and RA agar would be very fine for the isolation of Salmonella SPP...|$|R
40|$|Variability in gas {{production}} in multiple subcultures of Escherichia coli was assessed in two selective <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> and in lactose peptone water. Considerable variability occurred with all media at 37 and 44 degrees C. Addition of buffer increased {{gas production}} and decreased variability. The relationships between pH, growth, and gas production were complex. In buffered media, viable counts increased by 269 x 10 (6) to 382 x 10 (6) /U of pH fall, whereas in unbuffered media, they increased by 9. 45 x 10 (6) to 30. 37 x 10 (6) /U of pH fall. In buffered and unbuffered media, pH fell as gas production rose. However, variability in gas production among individual subcultures {{was not associated}} with changes in pH...|$|R
40|$|The first {{isolation}} {{methods for}} the detection of Listeria spp. were generally based on the direct culture of samples on simple agar media, but isolation of the pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes was difficult. In time, new techniques were developed, based on a variety of selective and elective agents in isolation and <b>enrichment</b> <b>media,</b> which gained better and quicker results. Current reference methods allow the recovery of L. monocytogenes from a variety of foods with relative ease. However, more comparative studies are needed to select one horizontal method. It is suggested that the procedure of the International Organization for Standardization is a good base for such comparisons. (C) 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

40|$|Stools, {{known to}} have {{contained}} salmonellas were cultured in three <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> on arrival at the laboratory. The three media were laboratory prepared selenite F, laboratory prepared Muller-Kauffmann tetrathionate and commercially obtained Oxoid Muller-Kauffmann tetrathionate (CM 343). Where faecal samples were sufficiently large, they were stored at room temperature and re-examined using the same three enrichment broths. Whether fresh or stored stools were investigated, the laboratory prepared media were significantly more efficient than the commercial medium. In a straight comparison of the two laboratory prepared media, {{no significant difference in}} efficiency was evident with fresh stool samples. With stored specimens, however, Muller-Kauffmann tetrathionate was significantly better than selenite F. This finding might be relevant in examining samples delayed in the post...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} report, {{it is the}} {{selective}} and <b>enrichment</b> <b>media</b> for Listeria monocytogenes and their practical application that are mainly described. 1. One per cent glucose nutrient broth with 1 : 12, 000 concentration of guanofuracin will be recommened as an enrichment medium, and 1 % glucose nutrient agar with 5 % sheep-blood and 1 : 10, 000 concentration of guanofuracin as a selective solid medium. In the latter medium, addition of 0. 01 % potassium tellurite is beneficial for the differentiation by the coloring of the colony. 2. By using these selective media, Listeria monocytogenes was detected in one nasal swab from a total 183 sheep. From the viewpoint of epidemiology of this disease, this finding will suggest {{the existence of a}} healthy carrier of the organism...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{prevalence}} of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and multiple antimicrobial resistances (MAR) among the faecal bacteria found in the Arieş river (Romania) affected by strong anthropogenic pressures. Isolation and identification of E. coli were done by using <b>enrichment</b> <b>media,</b> selective media, and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the disk diffusion method was conducted for 12 antimicrobial agents: ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, streptomycin, ceftazidin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, ticarcycline, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, erythromycin, and norfloxacin. The data of the antimicrobial susceptibility reviled that all the studied E. coli strains were resistant {{to most of the}} tested antibiotics. The analysis of antibiotic resistance frequencies has showed an incidence of 46. 66 % strains resistant to more than 4 different antibiotics. Moreover, a high incidence of multiple antibiotic resistances was detected in each of the studied samples...|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, culture {{methods for}} the {{isolation}} of E. rhusiopathiae involve the use of selective and <b>enrichment</b> <b>media.</b> Commercially available blood culture media are satisfactory for primary isolation from blood, since E. rhusiopathiae is not particularly fastidious. A number of selective media for {{the isolation of}} Erysipelothrix have been described, also. A commonly used medium is Erysipelothrix selective broth (ESB), a nutrient broth containing serum, tryptose, kanamycin, neomycin, and vancomycin [...] Modified blood azide medium (MBA) is a selective agar containing sodium azide and horse blood or serum. Packer’s medium is a selective medium for grossly contaminated specimens, which contains sodium azide and crystal violet. Bohm’s medium uses sodium azide, kanamycin, phenol, and water blue. Shimoji’s selective enrichment broth contains tryptic soy broth, Tween 80, tris-aminomethane, crystal violet, and sodium azide.|$|R
40|$|Culture {{dependent}} phenotypic characterization {{analysis was}} applied to study the bacilli diversity of the Lonar Lake. The uniqueness of the Lonar Lake water is its salinity and alkalinity. Aerobic, haloalkaliphilic bacteria were isolated and characterized from sediment and water samples collected from Lonar Lake. Fifty five bacterial strains were isolated using different <b>enrichment</b> <b>media.</b> Out of them twenty nine spore bearing bacteria were selected for further analysis. The phenotypic characterization indicated that bacterial strains were related to genera Bacillus and species were Bacillus flexus, Bacillus cellulosilyticus, Bacillus pseudofirmus, Bacillus clausii, Bacillus krulwichiae, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus lehensis, Bacillus halodurans, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus agaradhaerens, Bacillus sphaericus, Bacillus fusiformis, and Bacillus asahii, Bacillus pseudalcalophilus, Bacillus okuhidensis and Bacillus gibsonii. The abilities {{of many of the}} strains to produce extracellular protease, amylase and lipase suggest that they might be of potential value for biotechnological exploitation...|$|R
