25|$|The modern jury evolved out of {{the ancient}} custom of many ancient Germanic tribes whereby {{a group of men}} of good {{character}} was used to investigate crimes and judge the accused. The same custom evolved into the <b>vehmic</b> <b>court</b> system in medieval Germany. In Anglo-Saxon England, juries investigated crimes. After the Norman Conquest, {{some parts of the country}} preserved juries as the means of investigating crimes. The use of ordinary members of the community to consider crimes was unusual in ancient cultures, but was nonetheless also found in ancient Greece.|$|E

50|$|In The Illuminatus! Trilogy, the <b>Vehmic</b> <b>courts</b> are {{mentioned}} as being connected to Nazi Werwolf commandos {{as well as}} the Illuminati.|$|R
50|$|In an 1856 lecture, philosopher Karl Marx {{used the}} <b>Vehmic</b> <b>courts</b> {{as a metaphor}} to {{describe}} his predictions of the working-class revolution that would sweep Europe.|$|R
50|$|The {{seat of the}} <b>Vehmic</b> <b>court</b> (Freistuhl) was {{at first}} Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, {{one of which was}} known as the Femelinde. With the growing {{influence}} of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437.|$|E
50|$|Princes and nobles were initiated; and in 1429 {{even the}} Emperor Sigismund himself became “a true and proper Freischöffe of the Holy Roman Empire.” There is a {{manuscript}} in the Town Hall of the Westphalian town of Soest, {{which consists of}} an original <b>Vehmic</b> <b>Court</b> Regulation document, along with illustrations.|$|E
50|$|The Westphalian Vehmic courts {{developed}} from the High Medieval “free courts” (Freigerichte), which had jurisdiction within a “free county” (Freigrafschaft). As {{a result of the}} 14th century imperial reform of the Holy Roman Empire (Golden Bull of 1356), the Landgraviates lost much of their power, and the Freigerichte disappeared, with the exception of Westphalia, where they retained their authority and transformed into the <b>Vehmic</b> <b>court.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Vehmic</b> <b>courts</b> play a {{key role}} in the novel Anne of Geierstein or, The Maiden of the Mist by Sir Walter Scott in which Archibald von Hagenbach, the Duke of Burgundys {{governor}} at Brisach (Switzerland), is condemned and executed by the Vehmgericht. Scott drew his inspiration from Goethes play Goetz von Berlichingen which he had translated, incorrectly.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{abandonment}} of the <b>Vehmic</b> <b>courts,</b> the term acquired a connotation of mob rule and lynching. In Modern German, the spelling of Feme is most common. Other variant forms are: Fehme, Feime, Veme. The verb verfemen is in current use and means [...] "to ostracise", i.e. by public opinion rather than formal legal proceeding. A noun derived from this is Verfemter [...] "outlaw, ostracised person".|$|R
50|$|The <b>Vehmic</b> <b>courts</b> {{were the}} {{regional}} courts of Westphalia which, in turn, {{were based on}} the county courts of Franconia. They received their jurisdiction from the Holy Roman Emperor, from whom they also received the capacity to pronounce capital punishment (Blutgericht) which they exercised in his name. Everywhere else the power of life and death, originally reserved to the Emperor alone, had been usurped by the territorial nobles; only in Westphalia, called “the Red Earth” because here the imperial Blutbann was still valid, were capital sentences passed and executed by the Fehmic courts in the Emperor's name alone.|$|R
50|$|The modern jury evolved out of {{the ancient}} custom of many ancient Germanic tribes whereby {{a group of men}} of good {{character}} was used to investigate crimes and/or judge the accused. The same custom evolved into the <b>vehmic</b> <b>court</b> system in medieval Germany. In Anglo-Saxon England, juries investigated crimes.

50|$|The {{first known}} {{reference}} to Talhoffer is in 1433, when he represented Johann II von Reisberg, archbishop of Salzburg, before the <b>Vehmic</b> <b>court.</b> Shortly thereafter in 1434, Talhoffer {{was arrested and}} questioned by order of Wilhelm von Villach (a footman to Albrecht III von Wittelsbach, duke of Bavaria) in connection to the trial of a Nuremberg aristocrat named Jacob Auer, accused of murdering of his brother. Auer's trial was quite controversial and proved {{a major source of}} contention and regional strife for the subsequent two years. Talhoffer himself remained {{in the service of the}} archbishop for at least a few more years, and in 1437 is mentioned as serving as a bursary officer (Kastner) in Hohenburg.|$|E
50|$|Tradition has it {{that once}} Goding (thingsteads or Gogerichte) and Holting (forest courts or Holzgerichte) were convened in Dorfmark, Fallingbostel, Ostenholz and at the Heidhof. At the Heidhof {{sentences}} were passed {{in the manner of}} a <b>vehmic</b> <b>court</b> (Femegerichte). The last execution in the Heidmark was in 1777. However that has been passed by word of mouth from generation to generation, because the documents associated with it were destroyed in a fire in 1784. Over centuries it has been reported that the owner of the Jacobshof in Ahlften, Johann Hinrich Apenriep, who came from Castens Hof in Meimen, had collected the executioner, Holdorf, from Lüneburg and had driven him to Fallingbostel. Holdrof had then beheaded a woman or a girl.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Vehmic</b> <b>courts,</b> Vehmgericht, holy vehme, {{or simply}} Vehm, also spelt Feme, Vehmegericht, Fehmgericht, are names {{given to a}} [...] "proto-vigilante" [...] {{tribunal}} system of Westphalia in Germany active during the later Middle Ages, based on a fraternal organisation of lay judges called “free judges” (Freischöffen or francs-juges). The original seat of the courts was in Dortmund. Proceedings were sometimes secret, leading to the alternative titles of “secret courts” (heimliches Gericht), “silent courts” (Stillgericht), or “forbidden courts” (verbotene Gerichte). After the execution of a death sentence, the corpse could be hung on a tree to advertise the fact and deter others.|$|R
5000|$|On {{their way}} to Charles's {{headquarters}} father and son were overtaken by Anne disguised as a lady of rank, and, acting on her whispered advice to Arthur, they continued their journey by different roads. The elder fell in with a mysterious priest who provided him with {{a guide to the}} [...] "Golden Fleece," [...] where he was lowered from his bedroom to appear before a meeting of the <b>Vehmic</b> <b>court</b> or holy tribunal, and warned against speaking of their secret powers. The younger was met and conducted by Annette to a castle, where he spent the evening with his lady-love, and travelled with her the next day to rejoin his father at Strassburg. In the cathedral there they met Margaret of Anjou, who recognised Philipson as John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, a faithful adherent of the house of Lancaster, and planned with him an appeal to the duke for aid against the Yorkists. On reaching Charles's camp the earl was welcomed as an old companion in arms, and obtained a promise of the help he sought, on condition that Provence be ceded to Burgundy. Arthur was despatched to Aix-en-Provence to urge Margaret to persuade her father accordingly, while the earl accompanied his host to an interview with his burghers and the Swiss deputies.|$|E
