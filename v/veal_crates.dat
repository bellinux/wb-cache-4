25|$|On 14 May 2008, Colorado Governor Bill Ritter {{signed into}} law a bill, SB 201, that phases out {{gestation}} crates and <b>veal</b> <b>crates.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 14 January 2004, {{the bill}} AB-732 {{died in the}} California Assembly's Agriculture Committee. The bill would have banned {{gestation}} and <b>veal</b> <b>crates,</b> eventually being amended to include only <b>veal</b> <b>crates.</b> On 9 May 2007, the bill AB-594 was withdrawn from the California State Assembly. The bill had been effectively killed in the Assembly Agriculture Committee, by replacing {{the contents of the}} bill with language concerning tobacco cessation coverage under Medi-Cal. AB-594 was very similar to the current language of Proposition 2.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Mercy for Animals {{conducted}} an undercover investigation at Buckeye Veal Farm, a veal supplier to Costco. Immediately following the investigative release, Costco adopted a policy against purchasing veal from producers {{that use the}} crate-and-chain production method. The case prompted Ohio lawmakers to {{vote in favor of}} a <b>veal</b> <b>crate</b> phase-out in the state.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992 250,000 live calves {{had been}} {{exported}} for <b>veal</b> <b>crating</b> to the Netherlands alone, and 1.4 million live sheep had been exported. Following {{the introduction of}} the single European market in 1993, live animals were regarded as [...] "'agricultural products' {{in exactly the same way}} as a consignment of turnips", and any attempt to regulate their journey times or conditions of travel was interpreted as 'a restraint on trade' and, therefore, illegal.|$|R
50|$|In the US, {{the use of}} crates {{to prevent}} {{movement}} by veal calves is a principal source of controversy in veal farming. Many veal farmers started improving conditions in their veal farms in the 2000s. <b>Veal</b> <b>crating</b> is criticized because {{the ability of the}} calves to move is highly restricted; the crates have unsuitable flooring; the calves spend their entire lives indoors, experience prolonged sensory, social, and exploratory deprivation; and the calves are more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease.|$|R
25|$|On 7 November 2006, Arizona voters passed Proposition 204 with 62% support. The measure {{prohibits the}} {{confinement}} of calves in <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> and breeding sows in gestation crates.|$|E
25|$|To reduce {{aggression}} in overcrowded conditions, shortly after birth piglets are castrated, their tails are amputated, and their teeth clipped. Calves are sometimes raised in <b>veal</b> <b>crates,</b> which are small stalls that essentially immobilize calves during their growth, reducing costs and preventing muscle development, making the resulting meat a pale color, preferred by consumers.|$|E
5000|$|On January 14, 2004, {{the bill}} AB-732 {{died in the}} California Assembly's Agriculture Committee. The primary author of AB-732 was Loni Hancock of the 14th District.

5000|$|Peter Roberts, a Hampshire dairy farmer, founded Compassion in World Farming in 1967. After he {{realized}} there was public support, Roberts unsuccessfully appealed to contemporary animal welfare groups to campaign against factory farming. Undeterred, Roberts began his own campaign. Roberts retired in 1991. [...] He was replaced as Chief Executive by Joyce D'Silva, who served until 2005 and now serves as ambassador. [...] Philip Lymbery, co-author of Farmageddon, is the current Chief Executive. [...] Compassion in World Farming has offices in Ireland, the Netherlands, France, and the United States. Representatives are located in Oceania, South Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe. [...] Compassion in World Farming {{was responsible for the}} <b>veal</b> <b>crate</b> ban in the UK, as well as bans on narrow stalls and chains on pregnant sows. The European Union recognised animals as sentient beings {{as a result of their}} petition.|$|R
50|$|A {{major concern}} {{for the welfare of}} farm animals is factory farming in which large numbers of animals are reared in {{confinement}} at high stocking densities. Issues include the limited opportunities for natural behaviors, for example, in battery cages, <b>veal</b> and gestation <b>crates,</b> instead producing abnormal behaviors such as tail-biting, cannibalism, and feather pecking, and routine invasive procedures such as beak trimming, castration, and ear notching. More extensive methods of farming, e.g. free range, can also raise welfare concerns such as the mulesing of sheep, predation of stock by wild animals, and biosecurity.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} {{concern about the}} {{continuing}} export of between 300,000 and 400,000 calves each year to Europe, where they were then confined in darkness in <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> and fed on low-iron, liquid diets designed to produce a commercially valuable pale flesh. <b>Veal</b> <b>crates</b> had been banned in Britain since 1990, {{but there were no}} regulations in place to prevent the export of calves to other countries using <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> or on the subsequent re-import of the meat into Britain.|$|E

50|$|Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) sued Victor L. Mendes for {{confining}} calves in <b>veal</b> <b>crates,</b> which ALDF {{considered to}} be a violation of Pen. Code 597t. In Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Mendes, 160 Cal. App. 4th 136 (2008), the court ruled that ALDF had no private right to enforce 597t through civil action. Since 597t is a criminal law, it may only be enforced by a public prosecutor, or by a private corporation which meets particular standards. The court did not address whether the confinement of calves in <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> violates 597t.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to battery cages, extreme confinement of calves in <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> is legal in Canada, {{as is the}} removal of farm animal body parts (for instance, debeaking and castration) without anesthesia.|$|E
5000|$|Kentucky (Passed in 2014, the Kentucky Livestock Care Standards Commission {{issued a}} {{decision}} to begin a phase-out period of four years and that by 2018 <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> will be completely eliminated from Kentucky farms) ...|$|E

50|$|Veal calf production, as such, is {{not allowed}} in many {{northern}} European countries, such as in Finland. In Finland, giving feed, drink or other nutrition which {{is known to be}} dangerous to an animal which is being cared for is prohibited, as well as failing to give nutrients the lack of which is known to cause the animal to fall ill. The Finnish Animal Welfare Act of 1996 and the Finnish Animal Welfare Decree of 1996 provided general guidelines for the housing and care of animals, and effectively banned <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> in Finland. <b>Veal</b> <b>crates</b> are not specifically banned in Switzerland, but most calves are raised outdoors.|$|E
50|$|Shapiro {{previously}} directed HSUS's Farm Animal Protection campaign, including {{efforts to}} convince retailers, food service providers, and universities {{to end their}} use of eggs from battery-caged birds, pork from gestation-stalled pigs, and to expand their vegan options. Additionally, the Farm Animal Protection campaign {{played a significant role}} in helping enact Proposition 2 in California, a 2008 ballot initiative that phases out <b>veal</b> <b>crates,</b> battery cages, and gestation crates in the nation's largest agricultural state. The campaign was also central in Proposition 204, a successful 2006 Arizona ballot initiative that phases out gestation crates and <b>veal</b> <b>crates.</b> It has also helped pass laws against gestation crates and other agricultural practices in numerous other states.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, voters passed (by {{a margin}} of 55% for and 45% against) Amendment 10 to the Florida Constitution banning the {{confinement}} of pregnant pigs in gestation crates. In 2006, Arizona voters passed Proposition 204 with 62% support; the legislation prohibits the confinement of calves in <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> and breeding sows in gestation crates. In 2007, the Governor of Oregon signed legislation prohibiting the confinement of pigs in gestation crates and in 2008, the Governor of Colorado signed legislation that phased out both gestation crates and <b>veal</b> <b>crates.</b> Also during 2008, California passed Proposition 2, known as the [...] "Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act", which orders new space requirements for farm animals starting in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|There are no {{regulations}} {{on the welfare}} of farm animals in Iran. Stunning at slaughter is not required. De-beaking, de-toeing, tail-docking, tooth pulling, castration, and dehorning of livestock without anaesthetic are legal, as is confinement in gestation crates, <b>veal</b> <b>crates,</b> and battery cages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of these animals (around 500 million annually) are farmed intensively. [...] De-beaking, de-toeing, tail-docking, tooth pulling, castration, and dehorning of livestock without anaesthetic are not illegal (though debeaking is prohibited in the Australian Capital Territory), nor is confinement in <b>veal</b> <b>crates,</b> gestation crates and battery cages.|$|E
5000|$|Brazilian animal farms {{have been}} {{shifting}} towards a confinement model. [...] Battery cages, gestation crates, and <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> - systems of extreme confinement - are legal in Brazil. At any given time, {{there are over}} 70 million egg-laying hens living in battery cages and almost 1.5 million breeding sows in gestation crates.|$|E
50|$|To reduce {{aggression}} in overcrowded conditions, shortly after birth piglets are castrated, their tails are amputated, and their teeth clipped. Calves are sometimes raised in <b>veal</b> <b>crates,</b> which are small stalls that essentially immobilize calves during their growth, reducing costs and preventing muscle development, making the resulting meat a pale color, preferred by consumers.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposition}} adds {{a chapter}} to Division 20 of the California Health and Safety Code, Sections 25990-25994, to prohibit the confinement of certain farm animals {{in a manner}} that does not allow them to turn around freely, lie down, stand up, and fully extend their limbs. The measure deals with three types of confinement: <b>veal</b> <b>crates,</b> battery cages, and sow gestation crates.|$|E
5000|$|Social deprivation: Under natural {{conditions}} calves continue to suckle 3 to 6 {{times a day}} for up to 5 months. [...] Clearly, <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> prevent this social interaction. Furthermore, many calves are reared in crates with solid walls that prevent visual or tactile contact with their neighbours. It {{has been shown that}} calves will work for social contact with other calves.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Veal</b> <b>crates</b> are a close-confinement {{system of}} raising veal calves. Many calves raised for veal, {{including}} in Canada and the US, are confined in crates which typically measure approximately 66-76 cm (2.1-2.5 ft) wide. The calves are housed individually and the crates usually prevent physical contact between adjacent calves, and often prevent visual contact. [...] Crated calves are sometimes {{tied to the}} front of the crate with a short tether which restricts almost all movement. Floors are often slatted and sloped. This allows urine and manure to fall under the crate to help maintain a clean environment for the calf. In some veal crate systems, the calves are also kept in the dark without bedding and fed nothing but milk. [...] <b>Veal</b> <b>crates</b> are designed to limit movement of the animal because meat turns redder and tougher if the animals are allowed to exercise. The diet is sometimes highly regulated to remove sources of iron, which again makes the meat redder.|$|E
50|$|Provan {{successfully}} moved {{a motion}} {{calling for a}} ban on <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> and a maximum journey time of eight hours for live cattle being transported across Europe in 1995. During the 1997 general election campaign, he contradicted a claim by the Referendum Party {{on the extent of}} gold reserves which the Bank of England would have to transfer for the Pound sterling to join the Euro.|$|E
50|$|Abnormal {{bone and}} muscle development: Calves need to {{exercise}} to ensure normal bone and muscle development. Calves at pasture not only walk but also run about, jump and play. Calves in <b>veal</b> <b>crates</b> cannot turn around let alone walk or run. When finally {{taken out of}} their crates to go for slaughter, calves may stumble or have difficulty walking. There is a general increase in knee and hock swelling as crate width decreases.|$|E
