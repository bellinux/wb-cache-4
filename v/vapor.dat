5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the <b>vapor</b> cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the <b>vapor</b> is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the <b>vapor</b> exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E
5|$|Air {{contains}} water <b>vapor,</b> and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water <b>vapor</b> air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water <b>vapor</b> a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water <b>vapor</b> than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

40|$|Method {{and system}} for {{processing}} waste from human activities, including solids, liquids and <b>vapors.</b> A fluid-impermeable bag, lined with a liquid-impermeable but vapor-permeable membrane, defining an inner bag, is provided. A vacuum force is provided to extract <b>vapors</b> {{so that the}} waste is moved toward a selected region in the inner bag, extracted <b>vapors,</b> including the waste <b>vapors</b> and vaporized portions of the waste liquids are transported across the membrane, and {{most or all of}} the solids remain within the liner. Extracted <b>vapors</b> are filtered, and sanitized components thereof are isolated and optionally stored. The solids remaining within the liner are optionally dried and isolated for ultimate disposal...|$|R
40|$|Residual {{viscosity}} is {{a unique}} function of density for pure Freon- 12 and Freon- 22 <b>vapors.</b> Also, a plot of residual viscosity against density for Freon- 12 and Freon- 22 <b>vapors</b> exhibits a regular trend. These phenomena {{form the basis for}} predicting the viscosity of mixtures of Freon- 12 and Freon- 22 <b>vapors...</b>|$|R
30|$|For safety consideration, the {{operating}} pressure in the TDU is maintained at atmospheric pressure, which {{is controlled by the}} exhaust blower installed at the tail of the <b>vapors</b> exhaust pipe. The <b>vapors</b> are timely pumped out of the TDU once the liquids evaporated. The residence time of <b>vapors</b> in the TDU is usually very short.|$|R
5|$|In December 2013, the Hubble Space Telescope {{detected}} water <b>vapor</b> plumes {{above the}} {{south polar region}} of Europa, one of Jupiter's Galilean moons. It is thought that Europa's lineae might be venting this water <b>vapor</b> into space, caused by similar processes also occurring on Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|In {{a passive}} ALF, the input {{frequency}} must correspond almost exactly {{to the natural}} absorption lines of the <b>vapor</b> cell. Active ARFs are much more flexible, however, as the <b>vapor</b> may be stimulated {{so that it will}} absorb other frequencies of light.|$|E
5|$|Most ALF <b>vapor</b> cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high <b>vapor</b> pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common <b>vapor</b> cell materials are sodium, potassium and caesium. Note that non-metallic vapors such as neon may be used. As the early quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals, {{it is conceivable that}} such a medium could be used in the ALFs of today. This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vapors</b> {{are created}} when grease is heated to and beyond its {{vaporization}} point. As the <b>vapors</b> cool down, the grease condenses and settles on colder surfaces. It is thus important for {{occupational safety and}} health, as well as compliance with local fire codes, to vent such <b>vapors</b> outside the kitchen and outside the building where the kitchen is located.|$|R
50|$|The same direct {{relationship}} applies to gases and <b>vapors</b> diluted in air for example. Although, thorough mixing of gases and <b>vapors</b> {{may not be}} as easily accomplished.|$|R
50|$|The refinery, located {{seven miles}} from Sunray, Texas, {{included}} a spherical tank containing {{half a million}} gallons of pentane and hexane. <b>Vapors</b> escaped from the tank and migrated downhill toward other installations. The <b>vapors</b> ignited, probably near an asphalt plant and travelled back toward the tank. There the flames consumed the escaping <b>vapors,</b> forcing firefighters to use water to cool nearby tanks to prevent further spread.|$|R
5|$|Plutonium is a {{reactive}} metal. In {{moist air}} or moist argon, the metal oxidizes rapidly, producing {{a mixture of}} oxides and hydrides. If the metal is exposed long enough to {{a limited amount of}} water <b>vapor,</b> a powdery surface coating of PuO2 is formed. Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water <b>vapor</b> forms only PuO2.|$|E
5|$|The Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron {{relation}} {{leads to}} another equation also attributed to Kelvin, as the Kelvin equation. It explains why, because of surface tension, the <b>vapor</b> pressure for small droplets of liquid in suspension {{is greater than}} standard <b>vapor</b> pressure of that same liquid when the interface is flat. That {{is to say that}} when a liquid is forming small droplets, the equilibrium concentration of its <b>vapor</b> in its surroundings is greater. This arises because the pressure inside the droplet is greater than outside.|$|E
5|$|The band-pass of {{an atomic}} line filter is usually {{equal to the}} Doppler profile of the <b>vapor</b> cell, the natural range of {{frequencies}} at which a <b>vapor</b> cell will be excited by a pure light source. The Doppler profile is {{the width of the}} spectrum of Doppler shifted radiation emitted by the <b>vapor</b> cell due to its thermal motion. This value is less for larger atoms at lower temperatures, a system considered more ideal.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the factors governing the sorption of <b>vapors</b> by organic polymers. The principles {{have been applied}} {{in the past for}} designing and selecting polymers for acoustic wave sensors; however they apply equally well to sorption of <b>vapors</b> by polymers used on optical chemical sensors. A set of solvation parameters (a table is presented for various organic <b>vapors)</b> have been developed that describe the particular solubility properties of individual solute molecules; they are used in linear solvation energy relationships (LSER) that model the sorption process. LSER coefficients are tabulated for five polysiloxanes; so are individual interaction terms for each of the 5 polymers. Dispersion interactions {{play a major role in}} determining overall partition coefficients; the log L{sup 16 } (gas-liquid partition coefficient of solute on hexadecane) value of <b>vapors</b> are important in determining overall sorption. For the detection of basic <b>vapors</b> such as organophosphates, a hydrogen-bond acidic polymers will be most effective at sorbing them. Currently, fiber optic sensors are being developed where the cladding serves as a sorbent layer to collect and concentrate analyte <b>vapors,</b> which will be detected and identified spectroscopically. These solubility models will be used to design the polymers for the cladding for particular <b>vapors...</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon <b>vapors</b> and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the <b>vapors</b> can be ignited. At {{the same time it}} decreases the upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the <b>vapors</b> can be ignited. When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.|$|R
30|$|In this work, lithography-free growth/patterning on Si and Ge {{surfaces}} {{has been}} realized by controlling the reactions between substrates and metal <b>vapors.</b> Au NPs can effectively absorb the metal <b>vapors</b> at high temperature, initiating the micro-/nanoscale reactions of silicides and germanides and {{giving rise to}} nanostructures with well-defined morphology and orientation. Furthermore, with tailored sublimation, metal <b>vapors</b> can 'etch' the semiconductor surfaces, giving rise to pitlike structures with well-controlled morphology and orientation.|$|R
5|$|The effect {{explains}} supersaturation of vapors. In {{the absence}} of nucleation sites, tiny droplets must form before they can evolve into larger droplets. This requires a <b>vapor</b> pressure many times the <b>vapor</b> pressure at the phase transition point.|$|E
5|$|While every {{implementation}} of each kind of ALF is different, the <b>vapor</b> cell in each is relatively similar. The thermodynamic properties of <b>vapor</b> cells in filters are carefully controlled because they determine important {{qualities of the}} filter, for instance the necessary strength of the magnetic field. Light is let {{into and out of}} this <b>vapor</b> chamber by way of two low-reflection windows made of a material such as magnesium fluoride. The other sides of the cell may be of any opaque material, though generally a heat-resistant metal or ceramic is used as the <b>vapor</b> is usually kept at temperatures upwards of 100Â°C.|$|E
5|$|ZnO {{decomposes}} into zinc <b>vapor</b> {{and oxygen}} at around 1975Â°C {{with a standard}} oxygen pressure. In a carbothermic reaction, heating with carbon converts the oxide into zinc <b>vapor</b> {{at a much lower}} temperature (around 950Â°C).|$|E
50|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon <b>vapors</b> and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the <b>vapors</b> can be ignited. At {{the same time it}} decreases the upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the <b>vapors</b> can be ignited. When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.|$|R
50|$|In this case, the carbothermic {{reaction}} {{would produce}} no yield when the <b>vapors</b> {{moved into the}} cooler condensing zones inside the reactor, even though temporarily there would be intermediate carbon monoxide and actual magnesium <b>vapors.</b> There is still a feasible process with carbon, that uses shock-freezing of the <b>vapors,</b> to disallow any time for the reverse reaction - though such shock cooling is a far stretch from being an economical industrial process.|$|R

5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water <b>vapor.</b> The impact event did not produce any detectable water <b>vapor,</b> and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water <b>vapor.</b>|$|E
5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming light. The <b>vapor</b> cell absorbs the signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The <b>vapor</b> cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E

60|$|Sleep reigned {{throughout}} the canoes, sleeping upon the waters. But nearer and nearer, low-creeping along, came mists and <b>vapors,</b> a thousand; spotted with twinklings of Will-o-Wisps from neighboring shores. Dusky leopards, stealing on by crouches, those <b>vapors</b> seemed.|$|R
40|$|Linseed oil is very {{important}} in industry but its use is limited due to noxious <b>vapors</b> produced by oxidation on exposure to air. Since some of the products are toxic, release of linseed oil <b>vapors</b> to the environment is normally prohibited. In order to remove the odorous compounds, a biofilter system based on bacterial metabolism was designed and the major premises of bioremediation were studied. A total of five bacterial strains capable of using linseed oil <b>vapors</b> as their sources of carbon and energy were isolated from soil. The individual organisms were also mixed to form a bacterial consortium. The mixed population was able to degrade linseed oil <b>vapors</b> with more than 99 per cent efficiency. According to this research, a successful biodegradation system was designed and, theoretically, this system could be applied to the removal of linseed oil <b>vapors</b> in any industrial plant air stream...|$|R
5000|$|At {{temperatures}} above 350 Â°C, cellulose undergoes thermolysis (also called â€˜pyrolysisâ€™), decomposing into solid char, <b>vapors,</b> aerosols, and gases such as carbon dioxide.

5|$|Heating {{oil shale}} to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis {{to yield a}} <b>vapor.</b> Upon cooling the <b>vapor,</b> the liquid shale oilâ€”an unconventional oilâ€”is separated from combustible oil-shale gas (the term shale gas can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales). Oil shale can also be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing.|$|E
5|$|Known oxyhalides of {{einsteinium}} include EsOCl, EsOBr and EsOI. They are synthesized {{by treating}} a trihalide with a <b>vapor</b> mixture {{of water and}} the corresponding hydrogen halide: for example, EsCl3 + H2O/HCl to obtain EsOCl.|$|E
5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can {{be grown}} by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of high <b>vapor</b> pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical <b>vapor</b> deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E
25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} are flammable or highly flammable, {{depending on}} their volatility. Exceptions are some chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane and chloroform. Mixtures of solvent <b>vapors</b> and air can explode. Solvent <b>vapors</b> are heavier than air; they will sink {{to the bottom and}} can travel large distances nearly undiluted. Solvent <b>vapors</b> can also be found in supposedly empty drums and cans, posing a flash fire hazard; hence empty containers of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.|$|R
50|$|Spinning band {{distillation}} is {{a technique}} used to separate liquid mixtures which are similar in boiling points. When liquids with similar boiling points are distilled, the <b>vapors</b> are mixtures, and not pure compounds. Fractionating columns help separate the mixture by allowing the mixed <b>vapors</b> to cool, condense, and vaporize again in accordance with Raoult's law. With each condensation-vaporization cycles, the <b>vapors</b> are enriched in a certain component. A larger surface area allows more cycles, improving separation.|$|R
