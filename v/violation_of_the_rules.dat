5|$|On December 9, 1824, the Senate {{voted to}} repeal the law that had {{established}} the Court of Appeals and {{to establish a new}} Court of Appeals with four justices. The measure came to the House floor on December 23. During the debate, Governor Desha personally lobbied legislators to support the measure, a blatant <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the House. The next day the measure passed in the House by a vote of 5443. Governor Desha appointed pro-relief stalwart William T. Barry as Chief Justice, and three associate justices who were also Relief Party supporters.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{the term}} Hadrosaurinae was {{questioned}} in a comprehensive study of hadrosaurid relationships by Albert Prieto-Márquez in 2010. Prieto-Márquez noted that, though the name Hadrosaurinae had been used for the clade of mostly crestless hadrosaurids by nearly all previous studies, its type species, Hadrosaurus foulkii, has almost always been excluded from the clade that bears its name, in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> for naming animals set out by the ICZN. Prieto-Márquez defined Hadrosaurinae as just the lineage containing H. foulkii, and used the name Saurolophinae instead for the traditional grouping.|$|E
25|$|Because the British edition {{lacked the}} Epilogue, which {{accounts}} for Ishmael's survival, {{it seemed that the}} story was told by someone who was supposed to have perished. Many reviewers in British magazines recognized a <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of fiction and criticized the author for the serious flaw. Other reviewers, however, found the book too fascinating to dismiss for these reasons. Some of the scornful British reviews were either reprinted or quoted in American periodicals, wrong-footing the American readers because they had access to the Epilogue. About 3,200 copies were sold during the author's life.|$|E

At 6'3 and 462 pounds, Studdard had the highest starting weight and BMI of the entire cast. A member of the show's Red Team, Studdard was first eliminated in the fourth week after he failed to make his weight loss goal. However, because opposing coach Jillian Michaels had given her team caffeine pills in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> Studdard's elimination was voided and he returned before once again being eliminated during the competition's eighth week.|$|E

However, the Vikings lost to the Dallas Cowboys in the , 17–14, on a controversial touchdown pass from the Cowboys' quarterback Roger Staubach to wide receiver Drew Pearson that became known as the Hail Mary. The touchdown was controversial because many felt that Pearson pushed off on Vikings defensive back Nate Wright, which is pass interference and a <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> As the Metropolitan Stadium crowd was stunned to learn that no penalty was called, debris was thrown on the field for several minutes. A Corby's Whiskey bottle struck game official, Armen Terzian, rendering him unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Since leaving, Crowhurst {{had been}} {{deliberately}} ambiguous in his radio reports of his location. Starting on 6 December 1968, he continued reporting vague but false positions and possibly fabricating a log book; rather than continuing to the Southern Ocean, he sailed erratically {{in the southern}} Atlantic Ocean and stopped once in South America to make repairs to his boat, in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> A {{great deal of the}} voyage was spent in radio silence, while his supposed position was inferred by extrapolation based on his earlier reports. By early December, based on his false reports, he was being cheered worldwide as the likely winner of the race, though Francis Chichester publicly expressed doubts about the plausibility of Crowhurst's progress.|$|E
25|$|The lead-up to {{the review}} vote {{was marked by}} high {{emotions}} {{on both sides of}} the debate and allegations of rule breaking. Such allegations were risen when caucus members sent letters on party letterhead seeking support for Tory. The letters signed by Tory MPPs Bob Runciman and Toby Barrett were a clear <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the party, as the party in general is supposed to be neutral on the leadership review question. Tory responded by stating that he and his supporters will reimburse the party for the letters that the caucus members had sent in support of Tory's position as leaders. As a result, the party's president, Blair McCreadie, had stated that the matter is closed. A supporter of Tory's, PC Youth President Andrew Brander, launched a series of last-minute challenges of delegates on the grounds that they are representing ridings where they neither live nor work.|$|E

It will often also result in a league-imposed fine on the player. Roy Williams was the first player suspended for repeated <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> <b>The</b> one-game suspension was given following a horse-collar tackle on Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb that occurred on December 16, 2007, and it was Williams' third <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2007 season.|$|R

25|$|As {{a member}} of Te Kotahitanga, Tomoana {{presented}} to the native minister in June 1893 a draft Federated Māori Assembly Empowering Bill, and a petition listing Māori grievances. The bill asked for power over Māori to be delegated to Te Kotahitanga, subject only to the Governor of New Zealand. In 1893 Tomoana took up the cause of Tuhoe, who were resisting the survey of their land, and circulated a petition on their behalf throughout Hawke's Bay. This action led the Premier, Richard Seddon to release Tuhoe prisoners. In the 1898 session of the Kotahitanga parliament at Papawai in Wairarapa, the main item of business was discussion of Seddon's bill to set up Māori land boards, which threatened to further reduce Māori control of their land. Tomoana took a moderate line, accepting the bill {{as a basis for}} discussion, whereas most others regarded it as a <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> and procedures of the Māori parliament.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rule</b> against perpetuities {{is closely}} related to another {{doctrine}} in <b>the</b> common law <b>of</b> property, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> against unreasonable restraints on alienation.

500|$|On January 20, 2012, in {{what the}} Associated Press {{described}} as their [...] "breakthrough performance", eight {{members of the group}} performed a song on the Lobnoye Mesto in Red Square, entitled [...] "Putin Zassal". The title was variously translated by English language media as [...] "Putin has Pissed Himself", [...] "Putin Chickened Out", [...] "Putin Got Scared" [...] and [...] "Putin is Wetting Himself". The song called for a popular revolt against the Russian government and an occupation of Red Square. According to a Pussy Riot member identified as [...] "Shayba", the song was inspired by the events of December 24, 2011, during which approximately 100,000 people attended anti-Putin rallies in central Moscow. She told the Financial Times: [...] "We saw how troops were moving around Moscow, there were helicopters in the sky, the military was put on alert. The regime just wet its pants on that day. And the symbol of the regime is Putin." [...] During the performance a member ignited a smoke bomb, which led to Pussy Riot members being arrested and briefly detained on administrative charges, a Russian legal term similar to a summary offence or misdemeanor. A judge found two members of the group, Galkina and Schebleva, [...] "guilty under article 20.2 of the Administrative Code (<b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> for conducting rallies and pickets) and imposed a fine of 500 rubles on each." ...|$|E
