In {{order to}} solve the problem of aeolian sand {{subgrade}} compaction, we studied the technology of impact compaction, applied it to the engineering practice and analyzed its effect with Rayleigh wave. The technology of impact compaction can combine the compaction of potential energy and kinetic energy and make it easier for the materials to reach their elastic stage.

40|$|Abstract: Because of {{the high}} {{strength}} and sound stability, the cement stabilized base has been widely used in high grade pavement in China. But shrinkage cracking are easy {{to occur in the}} cement stabilized base. Under the repeating action of traffic loads and temperature loads, this kind of cracks are easy to propagate towards the asphalt surface, being called “reflective crack”. Shrinkage cracks are not normally avertable in the cement stabilized base, in contrast with a few wide cracks of broad spacing, numerous thin cracks of narrow spacing contribute little to the severe reflection cracking. On the basis of this thinking, the pre-cracking technique as a promising approach is brought forward. Several <b>vibratory</b> <b>roller</b> passes to the cement-treated base at a short curing stage, typically 1 to 3 days after placement, to create a fine network of cracks, which avoids the wide and/or long cracks and creates the ideal crack model. Comparing to wide cracking, the degree of the stress concentration resulting from thin cracking is by far mitigated. The Finite Element Method is used to predict the ideal crack model, and then the mechanical responses of the semi-rigid pavement of single wide cracking and net hairline cracking under vehicle loading are numerically simulated, simultaneously compared and analyzed. The simulation analyses indicate that the pre-cracking technique is a very useful tool to mitigate the reflective cracks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Liquefaction {{has always}} been {{intensely}} studied {{in parts of the}} world where earthquakes occur. However, the seismic ac-tivity is not the only possible cause of this phenomenon. It may in fact be triggered by some human activities, such as constructing and mining or by rail and road transport. In the paper a road embankment built across a shallow water reservoir is analyzed in terms of susceptibility to liquefaction. Two types of dynamic loadings are considered: first corresponding to an operation of a <b>vibratory</b> <b>roller</b> and second to an earthquake. In order to evaluate a susceptibility of soil to liquefaction, a factor of safety against triggering of liquefaction is used (FSTriggering). It is defined as a ratio of vertical effective stresses to the shear stresses both varying with time. For the structure considered both stresses are obtained using finite element method program, here Plaxis 2 D. The plastic behavior of the cohesionless soils is modeled by means of Hardening Soil (HS) constitutive relationship, implemented in Plaxis software. As the stress tensor varies with time during dynamic excitation, the FSTriggering has to be calculated for some particular moment of time when liquefaction is most likely to occur. For the purposes of this paper it is named a critical time and established for reference point at which the pore pressures were traced in time. As a result a factor of safety distribution throughout embankment is generated. For the modeled structure, cyclic point loads (i. e., vibrating roller) present higher risk than earthquake of magnitude 5. 4. Expla-nation why considered structure is less susceptible to earthquake than typical dam could lay in stabilizing and damping influence of water, acting here {{on both sides of the}} slope...|$|E

40|$|<b>Vibratory</b> <b>rollers</b> are {{commonly}} used for compaction of embankments and landfills. This task is time consuming and constitutes {{a significant part of}} most large construction and infrastructure projects. By improving the compaction efficiency, the construction industry would reduce costs and environmental impact. This research project studies the influence of the vibration frequency of the drum, which is normally a fixed roller property, and whether resonance can be utilized to improve the compaction efficiency. The influence of frequency on roller compaction has not before been studied but the concept of resonance compaction has previously been applied successfully in deep compaction of fills and natural deposits. In order to examine the influence of vibration frequency on the compaction of granular soil, small-scale compaction tests of sand were conducted under varying conditions with a vertically oscillating plate. Subsequently, full-scale tests were conducted using a <b>vibratory</b> soil compaction <b>roller</b> and a test bed of crushed gravel. The results showed that resonance can be utilized in soil compaction by <b>vibratory</b> <b>rollers</b> and plates and that the optimum compaction frequency from an energy perspective is at, or slightly above, the coupled compactor-soil resonant frequency. Since rollers operate far above resonance, the compaction frequency can be significantly reduced, resulting in a considerable reduction in fuel consumption, environmental impact and machine wear. The thesis also presents an iterative equivalent-linear method to calculate the frequency response of a vibrating foundation, such as a compacting plate or the drum of a roller. The method seems promising for predicting the resonant frequency of the roller-soil system and can be used to determine the optimum compaction frequency without site- and roller-specific measurements.

40|$|U šumarskoj cestogradnji do sada su primjenjivana različita stabilizacijska sredstva za poboljšanje nosivosti nenosivih šumskih tala pri izgradnji šumskih cesta. Stabilizacija se posebice koristi u nizinskim šumama, gdje je s građevnog motrišta velika prisutnost slabo nosivih i nenosivih šumskih tala. Dosadašnje kemijske metode koristile su vapno, cement, različite ugljikovodične pripravke (RRP, WEGS i sl.), dok je u novije vrijeme tendencija na primjeni različitih aditiva. Prema kemijskim karakteristikama PowerCem stabilizira humus i na taj način omogućava izgradnju šumskih cesta uz minimalnu uporabu kamenog materijala. Upravo je primjena sredstava za stabilizaciju omogućila da se snizi visina nivelete šumskih cesta u odnosu na klasični način izgradnje. So far, in {{the forest}} road building, various {{stabilisation}} means for improving the bearing capacity of non-bearing forest soils {{have been used in}} building forest roads. The stabilisation is particularly used in low-lying forests, where, from the civil engineering point of view, there are many forest soils of poor bearing capacity or non-bearing capacity. Previous chemical methods used lime, cement, various carbohydrate preparations (RRP, WEGS etc.), while lately, there has been a tendency of using various additives. According to chemical characteristics, PowerCem stabilises humus and in this way enables the building of forest roads with the minimum use of stone material. The very use of stabilisation means enabled the lowering of the height of forest road level lines in relation to the classical building method. PowerCem represents the efficient cement additive produced in the Netherlands pursuant to ISO 9001 and 14002 standards. PowerCem is a light grey powder which consists of alkaline and earth alkaline elements, i. e. chosen complex compounds. The chosen components were made on the resistance base where each component contributes to one or more characteristics within the complex chemical and mineralogical process. Apart from the increased resistance to pressure, PowerCem improves the immobilisation of damaging substances which endanger the environment. This includes heavy metals and organic matters which permanently strengthen in new crystal structures. Upon the completion of the stabilisation process, usually after a day, the surface can be burdened by some heavy machine or planned useful layers can be laid down. The final stabiliser quality is achieved in approximately 91 days. In the forest administration Strošinci the soil stabilisation was performed on 28. 09. 2005 by PowerCem on the area of 400 m 2. The stabilisation was performed by “Mixed-In-Place” technology. The existing soil is humus with humidity of 35 %. Due to lack of special machines in stabilisation performance, various machines were used: excavator, grader, agricultural fraiser, <b>vibratory</b> <b>roller</b> and cistern. According to data obtained by the examination, i. e. measurement by a circular plate o 30 on a trial route, after 24 hours the increase of the compressibility module (Ms) {{can be seen from the}} initial 6, 80 MN/m 2 to 39, 50 to 75, 00 MN/m 2 in relation to the examination position. The last examination carried out after fourteen days shows that the compressibility module is stabilised in a range from 52, 60 to 62, 50 MN/m 2 i. e. about 60 MN/m 2. Obtained examination results indicate that the compressibility model of the stabilised forest soil layer corresponds to the smallest compressibility module for ballast bed Ms = MN/m 2, and it is far above the smallest value for the classical stabilised soil Ms = 20 MN/m 2. The price of building 1 km of the forest road by PowerCem is 131, 340 €, while the price of the classically built forest road is 182, 960, 00 € which represents the saving of 28 % or 51, 622. 00 €/km. Soil stabilisation by PowerCem application belongs to improved and modernised chemical stabilisation of soil by cement. One of the greatest advantages obtained by this stabilisation is the use of humus, i. e. organic part of soil, which has so far been considered useless. Special machines are used in work and if they are not available, machines which are used in classical stabilisation by cement are used (Pičman, Pentek, 1998). All the advantages of this stabilisation can be divided in four basic groups: * Stabilised soil quality * Works on soil stabilisation performance * Ecological evaluation * Economic evaluation The most important and the most significant quality advantages in relation to the classical building of forest roads are as follows: * High bearing capacity * Very good elasticity values * Resistance to freezing * Stabilised soil does not absorb seepage water * Resistance to acids * Durabilit...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{findings}} of extensive damage on geogrids used in a road embankment in northern Sweden, the Swedish Transport Administration (TRV) started to investigate the reason of these damages. Since the geogrids were installed at low temperature, below 0 °C, it was suspected that the damages were connected the low temperature. To analyse whether low temperatures have an influence on the extent of installation damages, both a half-scale setup and temperature controlled tensile tests have been carried out on geogrids. In total five different types of geogrids have been tested; 3 extruded polypropylene geogrids, 1 woven PET geogrid, and 1 welded PET geogrid. All geogrids had an aperture size of approximately 35 mm and specified tensile strength of approximately 40 kN/m. The Half-scale tests was conducted by building a small road embankment inside a freeze container, at the Luleå University of Technology (LTU). The embankment contained crushed aggregate, type 0 - 70 mm, and geogrids. The purpose of the half-scale test was to simulate installation of geogrids at different temperatures and thereby investigate whether low temperatures have an influence on the rate of installation damages. The half-scale test was done for each type of geogrid at the temperatures: + 20 °C, - 20 °C and - 30 °C. First, the geogrid was covered by 150 mm of crushed aggregate. Then a vibratory plate (160 kg) was used to compact the crushed aggregate. After each installation, the crushed aggregate was removed carefully by vacuum suction. The geogrid was removed and then analysed by visual control and tensile tests conducted according to ISO 10319 : 2008 (wide width tensile test). Results from the half-scale tests indicate that 2 out of 5 of the tested geogrids were affected by the testing procedure. The results indicate that: -        one of the geogrids of polyprophylene (here referred to as G 2) was more damaged at lower temperatures compared to installation at + 20 ° C. -        the geogrid of woven PET (here referred to as G 5) was less damaged at lower temperatures compared to installation at + 20 ° C. Results for the other geogrids are either inconsistent or shows no significant variation of the measured parameters as function of temperature. Hence, these results cannot be interpreted as damage during installation. Temperature controlled tensile tests were done by tensile testing single strands from the geogrids to failure, inside a temperature controlled chamber. The purpose of these tests was to investigate how the strength properties of the geogrids are affected by low temperature. The test was repeated 5 times for each geogrid and temperature (+ 20 °C, 0 °C, - 10 °C and - 20 °C). Force and strain was measured during the tests. The results from the temperature controlled tensile tests show that the maximum strain decreases with lower temperature for all tested geogrids. The maximum strain decreased by 16 % - 49 % when the temperature dropped from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. The results show that the tensile strength increases with lower temperature for all tested geogrids except for the welded PET geogrid (here referred to as G 1). For G 1 the tensile strength decreased by approximately 7 % at a temperature drop from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. For the woven PET geogrid (G 5) and the polypropylene geogrids (G 2 -G 3) the tensile strength increased between 13 %- 45 % at a temperature drop from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. The E-modulus increased at lower temperature for all tested geogrids. The secant E-modulus at 2 % strain increased by 13 %- 71 % at a temperature drop from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. Summarized conclusions from the tests: Strength properties changed for all tested geogrids as the temperature decreased. All tested geogrids got stiffer at lower temperatures. The magnitude of the effects is different for different geogrids. The tensile strength increased with lower temperature for all tested geogrids except for the welded PET geogrid, which got lower tensile strength at lower temperature. The half-scale test indicates that the amount of installation damages at geogrids can be dependent of the temperature at installation. However, these indications can only be seen at two out of five tested geogrids. The effect cannot be connected to a specific step in the installation procedure and cannot be explained by the results from the temperature controlled tensile tests. The results from the half-scale test have a statistically low reliability since only one installation for each temperature and geogrid type was done. The compaction equipment used during the test was small, and had low compaction energy compared to a <b>vibratory</b> <b>roller</b> compactor commonly used in construction work. With respect to the discussion above, further studies should be focusing on developing the half-scale test. It is suggested that the test is scaled up to a full-scale test in order to simulate a real installation as close as possible. The test should also be conducted several times for each geogrid at each temperature in order to enable statistical analyses...|$|E
5000|$|Roller-compacted {{concrete}} (RCC) or rolled concrete (rollcrete) is {{a special}} blend of concrete that has essentially the same ingredients as conventional concrete but in different ratios, and increasingly with partial substitution of fly ash for Portland cement.
