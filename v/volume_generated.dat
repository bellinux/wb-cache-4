50|$|Marketing mix {{modeling}} is {{an analytical}} approach that uses historic information, such as syndicated point-of-sale data and companies’ internal data, {{to quantify the}} sales impact of various marketing activities. Mathematically, this is done by establishing a simultaneous relation of various marketing activities with the sales, {{in the form of}} a linear or a non-linear equation, through the statistical technique of regression. MMM defines the effectiveness of each of the marketing elements in terms of its contribution to sales-volume, effectiveness (<b>volume</b> <b>generated</b> by each unit of effort), efficiency (sales <b>volume</b> <b>generated</b> divided by cost) and ROI. These learnings are then adopted to adjust marketing tactics and strategies, optimize the marketing plan and also to forecast sales while simulating various scenarios.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantitatively evaluate hood leakage by measuring face velocity and turbulence during a <b>volume</b> <b>generating</b> process designed to simulate a hot process, defined here as any operation producing high temperature gases. A hot process has been recognized as a causal factor in the leakage of contaminants from laboratory fume hoods since 1950. A literature search reveals that during the last couple of decades only Johnson et al. reported a quantitative linear relationship between thermal loading and breathing zone trace gas concentrations using the ASHRAE 110 - 1995 method. Hot processes may well be the most common and least recognized of the operational factors able to cause fume hoods to leak. For hood performance testing, I conducted smoke tests and face velocity tests. Smoke tests were executed by means of smoke tubes and smoke matches as screening tools for hood leakage. Face velocity tests were conducted at 16 points arranged to represent equal areas of the hood face when the sash was fully opened. Face velocity data were indexed in time and space and used to estimate turbulence. By assuming corresponding samples were collected simultaneously, turbulence parameters were computed as both spatial and temporal averages of the velocity pressure. Turbulence is represented by the ratio of the standard deviation to average face velocity at each measurement point. Turbulence is generated by pressure differences occurring between the velocity pressure at the hood face and the <b>volume</b> <b>generating</b> rate that simulates a hot process. Through the average face velocity and turbulence measurements, I found that at a fixed exhaust flow, with a fixed injection volume flow, turbulence is stronger in the open sash position than in the reduced sash position. Further, turbulence associated with a <b>volume</b> <b>generating</b> process is more evident in the space-based data than in the time-based data. Face velocity at each point tends to decrease in a hood when the flow injected by a <b>volume</b> <b>generating</b> process increases. These data suggest that when a hood is operated with a <b>volume</b> <b>generating</b> process, leakage can be minimized by reducing the sash opening, by not positioning any object within six inches of the hood face, and by keeping face velocities stable...|$|R
40|$|International audienceConstructal {{theory has}} been used in several {{scientific}} fields since it has been established a decade ago. It mainly treats of the "area to point" flow problem, which has been first-written in the frame of the cooling of a finite-size <b>volume</b> <b>generating</b> heat. This problem, widely discussed in literature, has been optimized thanks to constructal theory formulated by Bejan, with a deterministic approach. However, some of the physical and mathematical assumptions made to simplify the problem are questionable, especially the ones regarding the high-conductivity material constituting the tree-shaped structure. In this paper, the performances of constructal designs are evaluated using a finite volume method, which allows making a comparison between different constructal geometries. An algorithm has been developed which has the ability for restraining constructal networks inside a finite-size area, without overconstraining the structure. All things considered, this paper examines constructal theory from a new point of view thanks to analytical and numerical investigations, in the frame of a finite-size <b>volume</b> <b>generating</b> heat...|$|R

Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the discrete case shows that the diffusion equation provides a unifying link between continuous and discrete scale spaces, which also generalizes to nonlinear scale spaces, for example, using anisotropic diffusion.
