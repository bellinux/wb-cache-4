5|$|Burton {{fails to}} {{complete}} the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero. The night after the exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains {{that he tried to}} stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured <b>video</b> <b>image</b> and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.|$|E

40|$|Detection of both scene {{text and}} graphic text in <b>video</b> <b>images</b> is gaining {{popularity}} {{in the area of}} information retrieval for efficient indexing and understanding the video. In this paper, we explore a new idea of classifying low contrast and high contrast <b>video</b> <b>images</b> in order to detect accurate boundary of the text lines in <b>video</b> <b>images.</b> In this work, high contrast refers to sharpness while low contrast refers to dim intensity values in the <b>video</b> <b>images.</b> The method introduces heuristic rules based on combination of filters and edge analysis for the classification purpose. The heuristic rules are derived {{based on the fact that}} the number of Sobel edge components is more than the number of Canny edge components in the case of high contrast <b>video</b> <b>images,</b> and vice versa for low contrast <b>video</b> <b>images.</b> In order to demonstrate the use of this classification on video text detection, we implement a method based on Sobel edges and texture features for detecting text in <b>video</b> <b>images.</b> Experiments are conducted using <b>video</b> <b>images</b> containing both graphic text and scene text with different fonts, sizes, languages, backgrounds. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, misdetection rate and inaccurate boundary rate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Cryptography is {{the study}} of {{mathematical}} techniques related to aspects of information security such as confidentiality, data integrity, entity authentication, and data origin authentication. Steganography is the science of embedding information into the cover <b>image</b> viz., text, <b>video,</b> and <b>image</b> without causing statistically significant modification to the cover image. Combining these two techniques either way together result to new technique-Metamorphic Cryptography [14]. The data (text, audio, <b>video,</b> <b>images)</b> is transformed into cipher data using a key, concealed into another cover object (audio, <b>video,</b> <b>images)</b> using Steganography converting it into a Stegno object, and is finally sent to the receiver. Or the data (text, audio, <b>video,</b> <b>images)</b> is concealed into Cover Object resulting into Stegno Object, (Steganography) and further converting Stegno Object into Cipher Stegno Object (audio, <b>video,</b> <b>images)</b> using Cryptography, and is finally sent to the receiver. This proposed both the technique thus achieves double layer security to data...|$|R

A parent or legal guardian or custodian of a child younger than 18 years of age commits an offense if he/she consents to the participation by the child in a sexual performance. This crime requires proof of inducement. However, inducement does not require threat, promise of payment or any specific incentive, or even verbal persuasion to be proven. under Texas Penal Code §33.021.

25|$|Hashtags (#topic) and user tags (@username) {{make use}} of {{metadata}} in order to track “trending” topics and to alert users of their name’s use within a post on a social media site. Used by various social media websites (most notably Twitter and Facebook), these features add internal linkage between users and themes. Characteristics of a multimodal feature can be seen through the status update option on Facebook. Status updates combine the affordances of personal blogs, Twitter, instant messaging, and texting in a single feature. The 2013 status update button currently prompts a user, “What’s on your mind?” a change from the 2007, “What are you doing right now?” This change was added by Facebook to promote greater flexibility for the user. This multimodal feature allows a user to add text, <b>video,</b> <b>image,</b> links, and tag other users. Twitter's 140 character in a single message microblogging platform allows users the ability to link to other users, websites, and attach pictures. This new media is a platform that is affecting the literacy practice of the current generation by condensing the conversational context of the internet into fewer characters but encapsulating several media.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} method of {{describing}} human activities from <b>video</b> <b>images</b> based on concept hierarchies of actions. Major difficulty in transforming <b>video</b> <b>images</b> into textual descriptions is how to bridge a semantic gap between them, which {{is also known as}} inverse Hollywood problem. In general, the concepts of events or actions of human can be classified by semantic primitives. By making correspondence between these concepts and the semantic features extracted from <b>video</b> <b>images,</b> appropriate syntactic components such as verbs, objects, etc. are determined and then translated into natural language sentences. We also demonstrate the performance of the proposed method by several experiments...|$|R

500|$|The {{commercial}} {{success of the}} album led to Shakira being deemed {{one of the most}} successful Latin crossover artists of all time, with Steve Huey from AllMusic calling her [...] "Latin pop's biggest female crossover artist since Jennifer Lopez" [...] and [...] "an instant pop sensation, thanks to her quirky poetic sense and a sexy <b>video</b> <b>image</b> built on her hip-shaking belly dance moves." [...] The success of the album also received considerable backlash, with many calling Shakira a [...] "sellout". This negative response was further heightened by the fact that Shakira, who was a natural brunette, had bleached her hair blonde at the time of the release of the album, which many viewed as a tactic to [...] "fit into the US market." [...] Regarding this backlash, Shakira said, [...] "I know my Latin people find this difficult. And I want [...] to be good news to my country. But it's typical that when you see somebody who is so close to you growing, you feel that the very word 'growing' is synonymous with leaving. My hair is a coincidence. I dyed it more than two and a half years ago." [...] On the other hand, many viewed Shakira's crossover success as a [...] "strong cultural statement" [...] as her musical style was representative of her mixed ethnicity.|$|E

The method of computing normalized image or pixel intensity contrast, and normalized temperature contrast are provided, including converting one from the other. Methods of assessing emissivity of the object, afterglow heat flux, reflection temperature change and temperature video imaging during flash thermography are provided. Temperature imaging and normalized temperature contrast imaging provide certain advantages over pixel intensity normalized contrast processing by reducing effect of reflected energy in images and measurements, providing better quantitative data.
