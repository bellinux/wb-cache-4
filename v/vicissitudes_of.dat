It was found that thoracic duct lymph volume always reduced by administration of physiological saline or hemoglobin solution after a temporal variation in the early stage of administration. 2. Temporal increase of bilirubin contents in thoracic duct lymph would often appear even under the administration of physiological saline, and it was apparent in the administration of hemoglobin solution. 3. The increase of bilirubin contents in thoracic duct lymph appeared by turns; the sound > the reticulo-endothelium-blocked > the liver-damaged. It appeared, on the other hand, most dominant by the mesentherial administration on the sound and by the femoral one on the other two. 4. <b>Vicissitude</b> <b>of</b> bilirubin conents in the thoracic duct lymph after the administration of hemoglobin solution was remarkable in the sound, pretty in the reticulo-endothelium-blocked, and scarce in the liver-damaged. 5.

And the results were as follows. 1. The mobilization of apoferritin was first observed on the administration of phenylhy drazin into healthy case and it was remarkably decreased, but the increase of easy split iron in blood and serum rion accompanied by hemolysis, then the increase of bilirubin were occured and apoferritin became showing the increase since that time. In other words, ferritin in the liver, kidney and spleen was quickly mobilized as the deposit iron, {{and a part of}} the iron isolated from easy split iron with the decomposition of hemoglobin was securely deposited as ferritin. 2. In the cases with liver damage by carbon tetrachloride, the mobilization of apoferritin in various organs was not occured at the early period because it might be caused by the function damage of bone marrow, on the contrary, those increase being related to the increase of easy split iron and serum iron accompanied by hemolysis was observed and the mobilization of apoferritin in various organs was observed afterward. Furthermore, it was thought that ferritin in kidney had not only the meaning of deposit iron, but also it had the meaning of block to iron excretion at that time, since the <b>vicissitude</b> <b>of</b> apoferritin in kidney. 3. The decrease of apoferritin in organ was observed on the liver damage by chloroform, but the <b>vicissitude</b> <b>of</b> apoferritin in liver after the administration of phenylhydrazin was not always agreed with <b>vicissitude</b> <b>of</b> hemoglobin dosis, easy split iron blood and serum iron and it was supposed that the mechanism of iron mobilization from ferritin and the mechaniam of ferritin formation in the liver were attacked with the damage of liver itself. 4. In the cases with thrombosis of reticulcendothelial system, apoferritin in organ increased with serum iron, but the mobilization of iron was not remarkable after the administration of phenylhdrazin. And the increase of apoferritin was not observed, even though easy split iron in blood and serum iron was increased after the decomposition of hemoglobin. 5. In the cases with binding of common duct, all of hemoglobin, serum iron and organ iron decreased and apoferritin in ordan increased with the increase of easy split iron and serum iron after 6 hours of the administration of phenylhydrazin. 6. Since the above results, ferritin in the liver, spleen and kidney had the significance as the deposit iron and the spleen was the most sensitive for the mobilization of iron in various conditions. And the significance of block to the excretion of iron in a part should be considered in the kidney...|$|R

Hence, the current paper intends to discuss evidence from scientific research and other studies concerning the <b>vicissitude</b> <b>of</b> concept of development theoretically through library method. Therefore, first of all, the paper reviews in a theoretical way the evolution of the concept of development from the material factors of development toward the human development concept.
