Three linearly arranged patches of 30 heads each were used. The central patch served both as pollen donor and receptor patch (complete flowers), {{the other two}} patches served only as receptor patches (emasculated flowers and female flowers). The central patch was connected over a distance of 25 m with one receptor patch by a corridor of flowers. The plant species of the <b>corridor</b> varied: either <b>S.</b> columbaria female heads, S. columbaria male heads, Origanum vulgare inflorescences or Aster multiflorus heads were used.

Donaghy 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Corridor</b> links a previously isolated 498 ha fragment of rainforest to an adjacent 80 000 ha of intact forest. Starting in the final year of the planting programme that established the corridor, we trapped two species of native small mammals, the Bush Rat (Rattus fuscipes) and the Cape York Rat (Rattus leucopus), within and nearby the linkage. We used genetic data from ear clippings to determine which side of the corridor individual animals originated from, and by comparing this information to trap locations, we identified 16 long-distance movements through the corridor. As genetic {{analysis of}} origins allowed movements to be detected from a single capture event and as it reflected movement since birth, this approach yielded considerably more data than capture records alone. The combination of movement and capture records allowed species-specific assessment of corridor function, revealing that the use and occupation of the corridor was higher for Bush Rat than for Cape York Rat and was neither symmetrical nor uniform. Long-distance movements through the corridor were most common immediately after habitat restoration, dropping off as the reconstructed habitat was colonized...|$|R

Social media does not promise to resolve this conundrum, but rather to afford local government a different avenue to deliver the appropriate service to their constituencies, whilst affording them a platform to engage with their City. Literature suggests that through active social media engagement, and in particular social networking sites, local governments can positively influence their citizens perceptions of the local governments.

I have made a Design proposal in Eriksdalslunden, Stockholm, with inspiration from the High Line. The proposal is based on design ideas of a park I logically call the Low Line, as the place isn't elevated as in New York, but lowered. The two places have some similarities, mainly the strong urban identity and the tracks crossing both areas. They also have very obvious differences, above all the fact that Eriksdalslunden is situated in a swale and is defined in a third dimension by the high bridges that crosses the area. The High Line is designed by James Corner Field Operations, and they have been working using their motto 'Keep it Simple, Keep it Wild, Keep it Quiet and Keep it Slow' during the whole process, words that normally aren't associated to Manhattan. I have also had the motto as a guide {{in the creation of a}} park that gives the <b>visitor</b> <b>s</b> possibility to enjoy peace and quiet in a very urban environment.
