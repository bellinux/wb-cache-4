5|$|As the {{paperback}} book came into fashion, lesbian themes were relegated to pulp fiction. Many of the pulp novels typically presented <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> women, or relationships that ended tragically. Marijane Meaker later wrote {{that she was}} told to make the relationship end badly in Spring Fire because the publishers {{were concerned about the}} books being confiscated by the U.S. Postal Service. Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan, wrote The Price of Salt in 1951 and refused to follow this directive, but instead used a pseudonym.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Die Another Day, the media began {{questioning}} whether or not Brosnan would reprise the role for a fifth time. At that time, Brosnan was approaching his 50th birthday. Brosnan kept in mind that both fans and critics were <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> with Roger Moore playing the role until he (Moore) was 58, but he was receiving popular support from both critics and the franchise fanbase for a fifth instalment. For this reason, he remained enthusiastic about reprising his role.|$|E
25|$|Grigg was <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> {{with the}} sound of the drums on Trash the Planet and left the band in late 1991, joining Mixed Relations as guest percussionist, whilst Bloxom and Weiley took a year off, moving to Queensland and going through a period of searching and trialling new drummers.|$|E

25|$|Jewish {{survivors}} {{found it}} practically impossible to reconstruct their earlier lives {{as they were}} before in pre-war Poland. Jewish communities and Jewish life as it had existed was gone. Those Jews who somehow survived the Holocaust and returned to their town or villages often discovered that their homes had been looted or destroyed. Some homes had new repatriated inhabitants who at times were <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> to see returning Jewish survivors.|$|E
25|$|Ramos' reign {{began with}} a 2–0 win over Blackpool in the League Cup. Immediately {{following}} Ramos' appointment, it was made clear in the public forum that he was <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the fitness of the team and instigated a new diet and fitness regime. Tottenham's league form began to improve and Tottenham's progress in the League Cup {{began with a}} 2–0 win over Manchester City which ended City's unbeaten home record.|$|E
25|$|By May 1863 Bahá'u'lláh was exiled next to Constantinople, {{the capital}} of the Ottoman Empire, and his family went with him. Now aged seventeen, after {{arriving}} in Constantinople, Bahíyyih Khánum renounced the idea of marriage. This was very strange for a woman of her rank and era, however it was a request which Bahá’u’lláh gladly accepted. After a short while in Constantinople the family was again exiled to Adrianople. Bahíyyih Khánum describes how she was a strong young woman until the journey to Adrianople. Adrianople proved a <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> period for the young Bahíyyih Khánum.|$|E

60|$|She did {{not seem}} to know what answer to make, and looked <b>very</b> troubled and <b>unhappy.</b> Tarzan saw a {{malicious}} grin of triumph curl Rokoff's lip. The girl evidently was in fear of these two--she dared not express her real desires before them.|$|R

25|$|She {{receives}} {{a letter from}} Rosalie who is <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> in her marriage and asks Agnes to come for a visit. Agnes is shocked by the change in Rosalie from a merry girl to an unhappy young woman. Rosalie confides that she despises Sir Thomas Ashby (and her mother-in-law), and claims he only left London because he was jealous of all the gentlemen she was attracting. Agnes also hears that Mr. Weston has left the area, and she grieves, believing {{she will not be}} able to see him again.|$|E
25|$|Shoghi Effendi {{received}} his early education {{at home with}} the other children in the household, then attended a French Christian Brothers school in Haifa, and later boarded at another Catholic school in Beirut. Shoghi Effendi later attended the Syrian Protestant College (later known as the American University of Beirut) for his final years of high school and first years of university, where he earned an arts degree in 1918. He reports being <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> in school and often returned on vacations to Haifa to spend time with `Abdu'l-Bahá.|$|E
25|$|The Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open {{did not go}} {{very well}} for Nadal. He beat Nikolay Davydenko, {{one of the few}} players to hold a {{positive}} head to head record over Nadal, in straight sets. He then lost to Fernando Verdasco, who he held a 13–0 record against in the third round 7–5 in the third, after blowing a 4–0 final set lead. Nadal stated that he was <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the new blue-colored clay and threatened not to attend in the future if the surface was not changed back to red clay. Several other players (such as Novak Djokovic) voiced similar criticism.|$|E
60|$|Sick and discouraged, he {{returned}} home, where his first act was to smash the luckless hat {{and replace it}} with another.

"The Skeezers," [...] said Ozma, [...] "could not drown; {{they only}} get wet and soggy {{and in that}} {{condition}} they would be <b>very</b> uncomfortable and <b>unhappy.</b> But you are a mortal girl, Dorothy, and if your Magic Belt protected you from death {{you would have to}} lie forever {{at the bottom of the}} lake." ...|$|R
60|$|But in {{the last}} few minutes there had dawned upon him the {{realization}} that none of these accomplishments was greatly in demand in the business world.

25|$|Chibnall {{wrote the}} script for Broadchurch on spec after his work on Camelot ended. Chibnall had a <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> {{experience}} working on Camelot, and fell ill with pneumonia after leaving the show. While taking time off to recover, he began using whiteboards in May 2011 to create backgrounds for each character and craft the plot of Broadchurch—which he envisioned as being a trilogy. Series one was written to work both as {{the first part of}} a trilogy as well as a self-contained drama. The first series had to be self-contained, he felt, in case the show did not do well in the ratings and a second series was not commissioned.|$|E
25|$|The Resurrection Stone {{allows the}} holder {{to bring back}} {{deceased}} loved ones, in a semi-physical form, and communicate with them. The form of Sirius Black generated by the stone tells Harry {{that he and the}} other forms created by the stone are part of him and invisible to others. This seems to suggest that these apparitions are conjured from memories and are not really resurrected people. According to the fairy tale concerning the origin of the Deathly Hallows, using the Resurrection Stone drove the owner to kill himself because he brought his late fiancée back from the dead, and she was <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> in the real world for she did not belong there. By the time the stone was seen in Marvolo Gaunt's possession, it had been set into a ring that bore the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, which the ignorant Gaunt believed to be the Peverell coat of arms; he used the ring to boast about his ancestry and blood purity. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald desired the stone, but for different reasons. While Dumbledore wanted it to communicate with his dead family, Grindelwald allegedly intended to use it to create an army of zombie-like Inferi. Harry said this is the Hallow he would desire most, as like Dumbledore he could name people he would like to communicate with again. Voldemort became aware of the ring's antiquity and eventually used the stone as a Horcrux, a container for part of his soul, being unaware of its additional magical properties.|$|E
25|$|Man Changwu (滿長武) was Man Wei's {{eldest son}} and he resembled his {{grandfather}} Man Chong in character. When he was 23, he started {{served as an}} assistant under Sima Zhao, the regent and de facto ruler of the Cao Wei state in its final years. In 260, when the Wei emperor Cao Mao launched a coup {{in an attempt to}} seize back power from Sima Zhao, Man Changwu was in charge of guarding one of the palace gates. Sima Zhao's younger brother, Sima Gan (司馬幹), led his men to the palace to assist Sima Zhao, but Man Changwu refused to let him pass and told him to enter through another gate instead. Later, when Sima Zhao asked Sima Gan why he was late, Sima Gan told him what happened. Wang Xian (王羨), a military adviser to Sima Zhao, was also denied entry so he bore a grudge against Man Changwu and later often spoke ill of him in front of Sima Zhao. In 257, when a rebellion broke out in Shouchun, Sima Zhao ordered Man Wei to join him in suppressing the rebellion. When Man Wei reached Xuchang, he fell sick so he remained in Xuchang and did not meet up with Sima Zhao at Shouchun. When Man Changwu, who was with Sima Zhao at Shouchun, heard about his father's illness, he left Shouchun and went to Xuchang to see his father. Sima Zhao was <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> with Man Changwu because of this. Later, he found an excuse to order Man Changwu's arrest and imprisonment. Man Changwu died under torture while in prison, while his father Man Wei was stripped of his titles and reduced to the status of a commoner. Many people saw this incident as a grievous injustice to Man Wei and Man Changwu.|$|E

60|$|Travelers who go into Scotland take a great {{interest}} in visiting, among other places, a certain room in the ruins of an old palace, where Queen Mary was born. Queen Mary was very beautiful, but she was <b>very</b> unfortunate and <b>unhappy.</b> Every body takes a strong interest in her story, and this interest attaches, in some degree, to the room where her sad and sorrowful life was begun.|$|R
500|$|Jean Sammet, a {{short-range}} committee member, {{noted that}} [...] "little {{attempt was made}} to cater to the professional programmer, in fact people whose main interest is programming tend to be <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> with COBOL" [...] which she attributed to COBOL's verbose syntax.|$|E
500|$|Another tale is {{associated}} with the temple dedicated to Kauri-bai—an aspect of Matangi—who appeared in low caste area of Varanasi. Kauri-bai was a goddess who was obsessed with the Brahmin ways and purity and abhorred Shiva's heterodox practices like dwelling in cremation grounds, partaking of intoxicants and being in the company of ghosts and goblins. While Shiva simply ignored Kauri-bai's words at first, after his marriage his wife Parvati could not bear Kauri-bai's abusive words toward her husband and cursed Kauri-bai to be reborn in and spend her entire lifetime within an [...] "untouchable" [...] area of Varanasi which Kauri-bai considered polluted. Consequently, Kauri-bai was indeed reborn in the low-caste area of Varanasi and felt <b>very</b> <b>unhappy.</b> She pleaded [...] Shiva—the Lord of Varanasi—who granted her the boon that no pilgrimage to Varanasi would be deemed complete without her worship.|$|E
500|$|Carson was {{inundated}} with speaking engagements, fan mail and other correspondence regarding The Sea Around Us, along with {{work on the}} documentary script that she had secured the right to review. She was <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> with {{the final version of}} the script by writer, director and producer Irwin Allen; she found it untrue to the atmosphere of the book and scientifically embarrassing, describing it as [...] "a cross between a believe-it-or-not and a breezy travelogue." [...] She discovered, however, that her right to review the script did not extend to any control over its content. Allen proceeded in spite of Carson's objections to produce a very successful documentary. It won the 1953 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, but Carson was so embittered by the experience that she never again sold film rights to her work.|$|E
5000|$|Love {{stories of}} Jat tribe, like Heer Ranjha, Sohni Mahiwal and Mirza Sahiban are {{considered}} legendary for showcasing the passion, {{the pain and}} the eventual separation of lovers. But this <b>very</b> notion of <b>unhappy</b> endings is what the protagonist Bittu disagrees with. Representing the rebellious nature of today’s youth, he wants to change the popular belief with his own, that every love story must have a happy ending only.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{rich and}} {{beautiful}} country, but has fallen under great misfortunes.

So every one is now <b>very</b> poor and <b>unhappy,</b> {{and that is a}} great pity in a country so fair and fertile." ...|$|R

500|$|On 18 February 1943, Phleps {{travelled}} to Zagreb {{to begin}} formal {{negotiations with the}} NDH government. He met with German foreign ministry envoy Siegfried Kasche and NDH Foreign Minister Dr. Mladen Lorković who represented Pavelić. Pavelić had already agreed to raise the division, but the Waffen-SS and NDH governments had very different ideas of {{how it would be}} recruited and controlled. Lorković suggested that it be named the SS Ustaša Division, a Croatian unit raised with SS assistance, with familiar geographically based regimental names such as Bosna, Krajina and Una. This reflected the concerns shared by Pavelić and Kasche that an exclusively Muslim division might aid a Muslim bid for independence. As a compromise, the word [...] "Croatian" [...] was included in its official title and Croatian Catholic officers were recruited. Himmler and Phleps largely prevailed and created the division as they saw fit, leaving the NDH <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the outcome, particularly regarding its ethnic composition.|$|E
500|$|Particular praise {{after the}} race went to both {{newcomers}} Haas and debutant Jolyon Palmer, who delivered what The Guardian described as an [...] "impressive" [...] drive. Palmer {{had been able to}} hold off attacks by both Toro Rosso drivers for several laps in the closing stages of the race. Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen was <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> with his team's strategy in the race handling the situation, repeatedly complaining and swearing over the team radio. He lost several seconds in a rushed pitstop, after which he lamented that he had wanted to pit before his teammate Sainz. While driving behind Sainz when both where trailing Palmer, he asked for team orders to allow him to pass his teammate, which were denied, leading him to describe his team's strategy as a [...] "joke". Verstappen received criticism for his outbursts, with Sky Sports describing him as sounding [...] "like a teenager - and a sulky one at that". He later apologised to his team for his outbursts.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{made plans}} in 1977 {{to sell the}} rights to his old {{television}} programs {{as part of a}} package which would bring him back to regular television appearances. [...] The package called for him to produce one new television show for every three older episodes; this appears to not have materialized. In 1980, he was taken to court by 13 of his former writers over a story that his will called for the destruction of recordings of all his old television shows upon his death. [...] Skelton contended his remarks were made {{at a time when he}} was <b>very</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the television industry and were taken out of context. He said at the time, [...] "Would you burn the only monument you've built in over 20 years?" [...] As the owner of the television shows, Skelton initially refused to allow them to be syndicated as reruns during his lifetime. In 1983, Group W announced that it had come to terms with him for the rights to rebroadcast some of his original television programs from 1966 through 1970; some of his earlier shows were made available after Skelton's death.|$|E
