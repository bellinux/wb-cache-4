50|$|On 1 October 2012 the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 made it {{an offence}} to {{undertake}} vehicle immobilisation in England and Wales without lawful authority. As a result, the SIA cancelled most of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>immobiliser</b> licences held by individuals located in England and Wales. Exceptions were made for those individuals wishing to undertake vehicle immobilisation activities in Northern Ireland (where vehicle immobilisation is still legal) or key holding and non-front line security roles across the United Kingdom (which any SIA licence allows).|$|E
40|$|In its {{everyday}} life an average person {{is surrounded by}} RFID devices. For example when using the access control at your office building, when travelling with a public transport card, when authenticating to a <b>vehicle</b> <b>immobiliser</b> that is embedded in your car key, when paying for lunch with your mobile phone and when reading out your pacemaker at the doctor. We often use such devices without giving its security much attention, let alone the actual strength of the provided security. It just works great and often feels even a bit magical, opening a door from a distance using (batteryless) wireless devices. This concept tends to give a false feeling of confidence about its security. It looks very complicated, so it is probably pretty hard to abuse. The opposite seems to be true when we inspect the products around us. This talk shows several examples where it went wrong and we, the general public, ended up with weak security using easy to break ciphers and protocols [1 – 15] with off-the-shelf hardware. We end up with such weak security when we let the industry sell us all kinds of incompetent products. It {{is no wonder that}} people start to feel like “everything is hackable”. The problem is not the availability of decent ciphers and protocols [16 – 21], but the choices we let the industry mak...|$|E
50|$|As a {{requirement}} of the Private Security Industry Act 2001, the UK now requires all contract security officers to have a valid Security Industry Authority license. The licence must be displayed when on duty, although a dispensation may be granted for store detectives, bodyguards and others who need to operate without being identified as a security guard. This dispensation is not available to <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Immobilisers.</b> Licenses are valid {{for three years and}} require the holders to undergo formal training, and are also to pass mandatory Criminal Records Bureau checks. Licences for <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Immobilisers</b> are valid for one year. Armed guarding and guarding with a weapon are illegal.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{vulnerabilities}} {{were found}} in the immobilisers designed to protect modern cars from theft. Many <b>vehicle</b> <b>immobilisers</b> use the Megamos-chip which is proven to be crackable. Megamos transponder is one of many different transponders found in today's immobilizer systems and also comes in many different iterations. Hacking of an immobiliser in the real world would happen on the vehicle not on the key. It would be faster to program a new key to the vehicle than to try and clone the existing key, especially on modern vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Property {{crime in}} Winnipeg has dropped immensely over the years. From the early 1990s to mid-2000s, Winnipeg {{had a huge}} auto-theft problem, where the rate peaked at 2,165.0 per 100,000 residents, in 2006. For a comparison, the 2006 rate in Canada was 4.5 times lower, at 487 auto-thefts per 100,000 residents. From 2000 to 2007, the rate only dipped below 1,500.0, one time, very slightly, in 2002 at 1,497.8. These rates were by far {{the highest in the}} country. Because of these insanely high rates, Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI), to combat auto theft, {{established}} financial incentives for motor vehicle owners to install ignition <b>immobilisers</b> in their <b>vehicles.</b> It now requires owners of high-risk <b>vehicles</b> to install <b>immobilisers.</b> This has proven to be successful as the auto-theft rate has been on a constant drop since 2006 (in total a 562.1% drop). In 2008 the rate was 1,059.6, in 2009; 692.7, 2010; 555.8, 2011; 341.5 and in 2012 the rate was 327.0. Other than motor theft, other property crimes have been dropping as well. Regarding the latest statistics year (2012), the theft rate has dropped every year since 2003, the break & enter rate has been going down since 1991, although not on a constant slope, but a bumpy downhill ride, and the mischief rate has gone down every year since 2005. However the arson rate seems to be on a trend upwards from 2007.|$|R
