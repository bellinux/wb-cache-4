5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a <b>vaginal</b> <b>ring</b> containing long-acting progesterone. This <b>vaginal</b> <b>ring</b> appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available in some areas of the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses of estrogen released from the <b>vaginal</b> <b>ring</b> may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{birth control}} {{methods such as}} birth control pills, the {{contraceptive}} patch, <b>vaginal</b> <b>ring,</b> contraceptive implant, and hormonal IUD are used to treat cramping and pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea.|$|E
50|$|The {{correlation}} between {{breast cancer and}} the use of <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings</b> is under investigation, but recent literature suggests that the hormones used in <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings</b> has little, if any, relation to the risk of developing breast cancer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vaginal</b> <b>rings</b> (also {{known as}} intravaginal rings, or V-Rings) are {{polymeric}} drug delivery devices {{designed to provide}} controlled release of drugs for intravaginal administration over extended periods of time. The ring is inserted into the vagina and provides contraception protection. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>rings</b> come in one size that fits most women.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are taking}} any {{hormonal}} contraception that contain ethinylestradiol (often found in combined oral contraceptives or <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings).</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{progesterone}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>ring</b> {{is available}} for birth control when breastfeeding {{in a number of}} areas of the world. An intrauterine device containing progesterone has also been marketed under the brand name Progestasert for birth control, including previously in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone is a {{medication}} and naturally occurring steroid hormone. It is a progestogen and neurosteroid {{and is used}} mainly in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause, hypogonadism, and transgender women. Progesterone can be taken by mouth, in through the vagina, and by injection into muscle or fat, among other routes. A progesterone <b>vaginal</b> <b>ring</b> form used for birth control also exists {{in some areas of}} the world.|$|E
500|$|Hormonal {{contraception}} {{is available}} {{in a number of}} different forms, including oral pills, implants under the skin, injections, patches, IUDs and a <b>vaginal</b> <b>ring.</b> They are currently available only for women, although hormonal contraceptives for men have been and are being clinically tested. There are two types of oral birth control pills, the combined oral contraceptive pills (which contain both estrogen and a progestogen) and the progestogen-only pills (sometimes called minipills). [...] If either is taken during pregnancy, they do not increase the risk of miscarriage nor cause birth defects. Both types of birth control pills prevent fertilization mainly by inhibiting ovulation and thickening cervical mucous. Their effectiveness depends on the user remembering to take the pills. They may also change the lining of the uterus and thus decrease implantation.|$|E
50|$|A {{study found}} that users of <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings</b> with {{ethinylestradiol}} and etonogestrel have a 6.5 times increased risk of venous thrombosis compared to non-users. This is commensurate with the risk of thrombosis due {{to the use of}} combination birth control pills, which in studies ranged between 2.9 times to 13.7 times the risk. As such, contraceptive <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings</b> do not necessarily appear to pose a lower risk of thrombosis than do birth control pills.|$|R

50|$|Ultimately, {{successful}} topical microbicides might simultaneously employ multiple {{modes of}} action. In fact, long-acting formulations such as <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings</b> {{could provide the}} technology needed to deliver multiple active ingredients with different mechanisms of action.|$|R
2500|$|Combined {{contraceptives}} {{have also}} been made available {{in a variety of}} forms. In the 1960s a few combined injectable contraceptives were introduced, notably Injectable Number 1 in China and Deladroxate in Latin America. [...] A third combined injection, Cyclo-Provera, was reformulated in the 1980s by lowering the dose and renamed Cyclofem (also called Lunelle). [...] Cyclofem and Mesigyna, another formulation developed in the 1980s, were approved by the World Health Organization in 1993. [...] NuvaRing, a contraceptive <b>vaginal</b> <b>ring,</b> was first marketed in 2002. [...] 2002 also saw the launch of Ortho Evra, the first contraceptive patch.|$|E
50|$|Progesterone <b>vaginal</b> <b>ring,</b> {{also known}} as progesterone-only <b>vaginal</b> <b>ring,</b> {{is a form of}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>ring</b> used for birth control when breastfeeding. Use can begin at four weeks and {{continue}} for at least up to a year following childbirth. Failure rates with usual use is about 1.5 per 100 women. It is used within the vagina with one ring lasting three months. The woman is able to place and remove the ring herself.|$|E

50|$|Insertion of {{the ring}} is {{comparable}} to insertion of other <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings.</b> The muscles of the vagina keep NuvaRing securely in place, even during exercise or sex. Women can check the contraceptive ring periodically with their finger. In rare instances, NuvaRing may fall out during sexual intercourse, while straining before or during a bowel movement, or while removing a tampon.|$|R
40|$|Re) ocurrence of {{inguinal}} hernia {{in case of}} very large <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings</b> may simply be prevented by closure of the vaginal tunic by TA staples during castration by inguinal approach.

40|$|Background: The <b>vaginal</b> {{contraceptive}} <b>ring</b> is a {{hormonal contraceptive}} that releases etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) {{is a rare}} but serious complication of hormonal contraceptive use. Case: We present a case of CVST in a 33 -year-old nulligravid woman who was using a <b>vaginal</b> contraceptive <b>ring.</b> At the time of presentation, she had been using the ring for 18 months, having previously used oral contraceptives for 13 years. She had no additional risk factors for thrombosis apart from cigarette smoking. Despite vigorous management, the patient died {{from the effects of}} the CVST. Conclusion: The serious adverse effects of the <b>vaginal</b> contraceptive <b>ring</b> are not well known, although deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and aortic thrombosis i...|$|R
50|$|Progesterone <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings</b> {{have been}} {{approved}} for medical use since 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. As of 2014 they are available in a number of South and Central American countries. As of 2016 it is not available in the United States. It was developed by the Population Council and is sold under the brand name Progering.|$|R
2500|$|In {{women who}} have had a hysterectomy, an {{estrogen}} is usually given without any progesterone, a therapy referred to as [...] "unopposed estrogen therapy". HRT may be delivered to the body via patches, tablets, creams, troches, IUDs, <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings,</b> gels or, more rarely, by injection. For example, vaginally administered estrogens include those given by intravaginal tablets, creams and rings, and can have more effect on atrophic vaginitis with fewer systemic effects than estrogens delivered by other means.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Product {{adherence}} and its measurement {{have emerged}} as a critical challenge {{in the evaluation of}} new HIV prevention technologies. Long-acting ARV-based <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings</b> may simplify use instructions and require less user behaviour, thereby facilitating adherence. One ARV-based ring is in efficacy trials and others, including multipurpose rings, are in the pipeline. Participant motivations, counselling support and measurement challenges during ring trials must still be addressed. In previous HIV prevention trials, this has been done largely using descriptive and post-hoc methods that are highly variable an...|$|R
40|$|New {{technologies}} in both reversible contraception and sterilisation are described. The review includes {{recent advances in}} the development of oral contraception, emergency contraception, injectable contraception, <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings,</b> subdermal implants, transdermal contraception, intrauterine devices, spermicides and barrier methods. It also covers methods of transcervical female sterilisation and more easily reversible male sterilisation. The emphasis is on the technology and its safety and effectiveness. Hormonal delivery systems are described in some detail. Mention is also made of research into vaccines and male hormonal methods, where progress has been disappointing...|$|R
40|$|A {{bacterial}} biofilm is {{a structured}} community of bacteria in a self-produced extracellular matrix, adherent to an inert surface or biological tissue. The involvement of biofilm in a bacterial infection {{implies that the}} infection is difficult to treat and that the patient will probably experience relapses of the condition. In bacterial vaginosis (BV), the lactobacilli concentration decreases, while the bacterial load of other (facultative) anaerobic bacteria increases. A hallmark of BV {{is the presence of}} clue cells, now known {{as the result of a}} polymicrobial biofilm formed in vaginal epithelial cells. Current knowledge of the individual roles of bacterial species involved in polymicrobial BV biofilms or interactions between these species are not fully known. In addition, knowledge of the composition matrix and triggers of biofilm formation is still lacking. Bacteria are able to attach to the surface of indwelling medical devices and cover these surfaces with biofilm. Vaginally inserted devices, such as tampons, intra-uterine devices and <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings,</b> can also be colonized by bacteria and be subjected to biofilm formation. This might hamper release of active product in case of drug-releasing devices such as <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings,</b> or promote the presence of unfavorable bacteria in the vagina. This paper reviews current knowledge of biofilms in the vaginal environment. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Vasomotor {{symptoms}} (VMS) {{are among}} the most bothersome complaints of postmenopausal women. To date, the most widely studied and effective treatment for VMS is hormone replacement therapy, consisting of estrogen (in women without a uterus) or estrogen plus progestin (in women with a uterus). Traditionally, oral estrogens have been used for treatment. However, over the years, additional estrogen formulations have been developed including transdermal patches; <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings,</b> creams, and tablets; and injectable preparations. Two newer formulations are transdermal estrogen spray and estradiol topical emulsion. This review evaluates the current literature assessing the use of these two newer formulations for the treatment of VMS associated with menopause...|$|R
5000|$|A {{study in}} the BMJ, with over 1.6 million women, found that users of <b>vaginal</b> <b>rings</b> with {{ethinylestradiol}} and etonogestrel have a 6.5 times increased risk of venous thrombosis compared to non-users. [...] Epidemiological {{studies have shown that}} oral contraceptives that contain desogestrel can increase the risk of blood clots (venous thrombosis) by 1.5 to 2.4 times the risk of second-generation oral contraceptives. [...] Second-generation oral contraceptives do not contain desogestrel. Hormones are released continuously from NuvaRing, thus peak and total estrogen and progestin doses are significantly lower than with combined oral contraceptives, but what effect this has on the risk of blood clots has not been established.|$|R
