500|$|The cold open {{features}} {{a montage of}} Jim setting up a prank—which involves sending Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail. Through Jim's <b>voice-over,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> heavily suggested that Jim set up the prank sometime circa 2006, which would have taken place during the show's second season. Appropriately, the montage was filmed {{to look as if}} the documentarians were using archival footage of Jim; his hair matches the style that Jim had during the first few seasons of the show. This {{is not the first time}} this technique has been used on the show. During the cold open for the sixth season episode [...] "Shareholder Meeting", a montage of Dwight harassing past receptionists was shown. Furthermore, during the seventh season episode [...] "Threat Level Midnight" [...] was filmed to give the impression that Threat Level Midnight, a amateur feature directed by Michael Scott, had been filmed and edited during the first seven or so seasons of the show.|$|R

50|$|The manga {{was also}} adapted into a 65-episode anime {{television}} series by Tatsunoko Production in 1981, chiefly directed by Masayuki Hayashi. The anime was aired across Japan on Fuji TV Sundays at 6 p.m. from 4 October 1981 to 26 December 1982. In Japan, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of Tatsunoko's most successful shows of the 1980s {{in terms of}} ratings, regularly scoring around 15-20%, but it achieved even greater success when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> adapted for the Italian TV market in 1983 under the title Gigi la Trottola.

500|$|In {{addition}} to the cast seen in the final cut of the film, Bill Pullman, Lukas Haas, and Mickey Rourke also performed but their scenes were eventually cut. Billy Bob Thornton recorded narration that was scrapped. Martin Sheen and Viggo Mortensen participated in readthroughs of the script and are thanked in the end credits. Editor Leslie Jones was on location for five months and rarely saw Malick, who left her to her own devices. After principal photography wrapped, she {{came back with a}} five-hour first cut and spent seven months editing, with Thornton contributing three hours of narrative <b>voice-over</b> material. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> at this point that editor Billy Weber came on board, and they spent 13 months in post-production and the last four months mixing the film, using four Avid machines with a fifth added at one point. Malick edited the footage one reel at a time with the sound off while listening to a Green Day CD. There were no preview screenings but several in-house ones, the largest of which was attended by 15 people for marketing executives. The editors faced the challenge of blending footage of veteran actors with less-experienced ones, integrating the many cameos, and the voice-overs. According to Jones, [...] "Malick removed scenes with dialogue whenever possible, with the final film varying greatly from the original concept". Four months after principal photography, Malick invited Toll to a rough-cut screening of the film. In December 1998, Toll did the first color correction at the lab prior to the film's release in North America.|$|R

5000|$|The 2008 Democratic presidential {{primaries}} featured an ad by Hillary Clinton {{directed at}} her main rival at the time, Barack Obama, which aired {{days before the}} Texas primary. The ad began by showing children asleep in bed while phone rang in the background. A <b>voice-over</b> stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> 3 a.m., the phone was ringing in the White House, and that [...] "something’s happening in the world". The voice-over then asked voters if they wanted someone who [...] "already knows the world’s leaders, knows the military" [...] and is [...] "tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world" [...] {{to pick up the}} phone. While Obama was never mentioned by name, the implication was clear and the ad set off a firestorm of discussion and controversy, causing even Obama himself to respond and describe it as an ad that [...] "played on people’s fears", predicting it would not work. Later in the campaign, after Obama had become the Democratic nominee, Republican nominee John McCain echoed a similar sentiment. In a controversial ad called [...] "Celebrity", McCain's campaign asked, [...] "Obama is the biggest celebrity in the world. But, is he ready to lead?" [...] The ad juxtaposed Obama supporters with photos of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.|$|R
2500|$|To take {{advantage}} of the educational opportunities from the Navy, Carson attended the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, where he joined Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and continued performing magic (then paid $25 per appearance). He majored in journalism with the intention of becoming a comedy writer. Instead, he switched his major to speech and drama a few months later, because he wanted to become a radio performer. Carson's college thesis, titled [...] "How to Write Comedian Jokes", was a compilation of taped skits and jokes from popular radio shows with Carson explaining the comedic technique in a <b>voice-over.</b> <b>It</b> allowed him to graduate in three years.

500|$|... "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Castellaneta, who voices {{characters}} such as Homer and Krusty on The Simpsons, and his wife Deb Lacusta. American comedian and actress Joan Rivers guest starred in the episode as Annie. She recorded her lines in March 2011. In an interview with E! News at that time, Rivers noted {{that this was not}} her first animated <b>voice-over</b> role, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> her biggest one yet. She further added that she is a fan of the show because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> [...] "so clever and so funny on so many levels. So when they called and said, 'Do you want to do it?' without even reading a script I said, 'Absolutely.'" [...] Adam Buckman, a former television columnist at the New York Post, noted on his blog that the story of the episode is similar to a period in Rivers' life {{at the end of the}} 1980s. At that time, she was hosting The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers on the Fox network. When Rivers challenged Fox executives who wanted to fire her husband Edgar Rosenberg as the show's executive producer, the network fired them both. Rosenberg committed suicide just three months later. Buckman wrote that the story of [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] was [...] "no doubt devised with Rivers’ approval and possibly with her input", and that [...] "only a comedian of her stature and experience" [...] would attempt to spoof a personal tragedy such as this one. Other guest stars in the episode include actor Kevin Dillon and stand-up comedian Janeane Garofalo as themselves, and stand-up comedian Jackie Mason in a minor reprisal of his role as Krusty's father, speaking only one line.|$|R

40|$|Audio {{description}} (AD) {{has established}} {{itself as a}} media access service for blind and partially sighted people {{across a range of}} countries, for different media and types of audiovisual performance (e. g. film, TV, theatre, opera). In countries such as the UK and Spain, legislation has been implemented for the provision of AD on TV, and the European Parliament has requested that AD for digital TV be monitored in projects such as DTV 4 ALL (www. psp-dtv 4 all. org) {{in order to be able}} to develop adequate European accessibility policies. One of the drawbacks is that in their current form, AD services largely leave the visually impaired community excluded from access to foreign-language audiovisual products when they are subtitled rather than dubbed. To overcome this problem, audio subtitling (AST) has emerged as a solution. This article will characterise audio subtitling as a modality of audiovisual localisation which is positioned at the interface between subtitling, audio description and <b>voice-over.</b> <b>It</b> will argue that audio subtitles need to be delivered in combination with audio description and will analyse, system- atise and exemplify the current practice of audio description with audio subtitling using commercially available DVDs...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most {{documentary}} films {{which contain}} ample cutaways to b-roll and archive footage, Barberland contains only interviews with barbers in their shops; {{sitting in their}} chairs and/or cutting their customer's hair. While an assemblage of talking heads {{would be considered a}} cardinal sin for most documentary filmmakers, this technique creates a simulation of the trip through a [...] "land of barbers", thus delivering on the film's title. The film also contains no <b>voice-over</b> as <b>it</b> common in most documentary films. Instead, the barbers tell their own story in their own words. The production of Barberland serves to create a unique sensibility that lives somewhere between Ken Burns and Michael Moore films.|$|R

Rock, Paper, Shotgun, praised the game's humour and fun, and said [...] "Surgeon Simulator 2013 is not a brilliant game. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a brilliant joke. In {{the form of a}} game.

5000|$|This film is {{the third}} part of what Wood aficionados refer to as [...] "The Kelton Trilogy", a trio of films {{featuring}} Paul Marco as [...] "Officer Kelton", a whining, reluctant policeman. The other two films are Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from Outer Space. [...] Although {{claimed to be a}} follow up to Bride of the Monster, Night of the Ghouls featured only two characters from that film (Kelton and Lobo), and, in a retcon, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> claimed that Lt. Bradford had worked on the earlier case when he in fact appeared nowhere in Bride. His exploration of Dr. Acula's house was borrowed from Wood's short film Final Curtain and given a <b>voice-over</b> to integrate <b>it</b> into the current story. As a result, {{there was no room for}} Harvey B. Dunn, who played Captain Tom Robbins in Bride, to reprise his earlier role.

5000|$|Filming {{took place}} on {{location}} in Aveyron, France from July to August 1969, so as not in interrupt Cargol's education. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> Truffaut's first film with cinematographer Néstor Almendros, {{who went on to}} work with Truffaut on eight more films. The film included several references to the aesthetics of silent films, such as using an iris shutter to end scenes and filming it in black and white and in 1.33 [...] "academy aspect ratio". Truffaut directed first-time actor Cargol by instructing him to pretend to be different animals or people during specific scenes, such as [...] "be like a dog", or [...] "like a horse", or even [...] "like Harpo Marx." [...] During the shoot, Cargol was given a 8mm camera and stated that he would become [...] "the first gypsy director", however Cargol only appeared as an actor in one more film. Truffaut later said that during the making of the film he [...] "saw that the cinema helped his evolution. In my opinion, the difference between Jean-Pierre Cargol before the film and after <b>it</b> <b>is</b> astonishing." [...] Truffaut had scripted a sequence in which Victor is depicted struggling against the harsh weather conditions of winter in the wild, but budgetary limitations forced him to cut out the scenes. The film has very little dialogue and is mostly dominated with Itard's <b>voice-over,</b> making <b>it</b> close to a silent film. The use of iris-ing in and out of Victor not only reinforced the film's affinity with silent films, but often symbolized Victor's coming out of and going into darkness. The film's music was arranged by Antoine Duhamel and consists of music by Antonio Vivaldi.|$|R

At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used.

Had the original pre-titles <b>voice-over</b> <b>been</b> used, <b>it</b> would have <b>been</b> unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as [...] "The Old Doctor"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, as the Master observes Rowan Atkinson's Doctor.|$|R
5000|$|La Momia Azteca was {{released}} in the United States in 1957 by Azteca Films Inc., undubbed and unsubtitled, for exhibition in the many communities of Spanish-speaking Americans, large and small. No English language version was developed, however, until 1964 when Jerry Warren arranged with Azteca Films to purchase rights to a half-dozen of its release titles for general American release. [...] However, Warren drastically cut the original film and added new footage of his own making, significantly altering the story line (e.g., Dr. Almada becomes the first casualty of the mummy when it grabs his foot as he is fleeing its tomb: a jump-cut is made and all further scenes showing Almada are eliminated, and <b>voice-over</b> narration makes <b>it</b> clear he has thus been killed). This rendering was sold directly to American TV-movie syndicator, Medallion Pictures Inc., as Attack of the Mayan Mummy. Then Warren took some of the footage from this TV-movie, including the footage of his own making, restored scenes of Dr. Alamada and others previously edited {{from the rest of}} the film, made some other cuts, added some more original footage, and combined all of this with principal footage culled from the unrelated Mexican horror-comedy, La Casa del Terror, starring Lon Chaney Jr. and Tin-Tan, to create another new story in Face of the Screaming Werewolf, which <b>is</b> how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made available to U.S. theaters.|$|R

Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 1 out of 5, describing it as [...] "irritating, poorly cast and terribly written".

Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five, describing it as [...] "a quirky failure". Shearman and Pearson felt that [...] "The Wild and the Innocent" [...] was a [...] "curious mix of the cloyingly sentimental and the unremittingly bleak", finding similarities to the works of Cormac McCarthy; however, they felt {{that it did not}} work well as an episode of Millennium, finding the minimal involvement of the series' main characters and the distinct difference in setting to detract from the episode as a whole.|$|R
