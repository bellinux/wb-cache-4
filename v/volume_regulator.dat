40|$|Restoration of {{cell volume}} after cell {{swelling}} in mammalian cells {{is achieved by}} the loss of solutes (K+, Cl-, and organic osmolytes) and the subsequent osmotically driven efflux of water. This process is generally known as regulatory volume decrease (RVD). One pathway for the swelling induced loss of Cl- (and also organic osmolytes) during RVD is the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). In this review, we discuss the physiological role and cellular control of VRAC. We will first highlight evidence that VRAC is more than a <b>volume</b> <b>regulator</b> and that it participates in other fundamental cellular processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. The second part concentrates on the Rho/Rho kinase/myosin phosphorylation cascade and on compartmentalization in caveolae as modulators of the signal transduction cascade that controls VRAC gating in vascular endothelial cells. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) {{is not the}} sole, {{but perhaps}} the most {{important}} <b>volume</b> <b>regulator</b> in vertebrates. To gain insights into the function and evolution of its components, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of its main related genes. We found that important parts of the system began to appear with primitive chordates and tunicates and that all major components were present at the divergence of bony fish, {{with the exception of the}} Mas receptor. The Mas receptor first appears after the bony-fish/tetrapod divergence. This phase of evolutionary innovation happened about 400 million years ago. We found solid evidence that angiotensinogen made its appearance in cartilage fish. The presence of several RAAS genes in organisms that lack all the components shows that these genes have had other ancestral functions outside of their current role. Our analysis underscores the utility of sequence comparisons in the study of evolution. Such analyses may provide new hypotheses as to how and why in today's population an increased activity of the RAAS frequently leads to faulty salt and volume regulation, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases, opening up new and clinically important research areas for evolutionary medicine...|$|E

40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) is {{the most}} {{aggressive}} primary brain tumor in adults. The mechanisms that confer GBM cells their invasive behavior are poorly understood. The electroneutral Na+-K+- 2 Cl− co-transporter 1 (NKCC 1) is an important cell <b>volume</b> <b>regulator</b> that participates in cell migration. We have shown that inhibition of NKCC 1 in GBM cells leads to decreased cell migration, in vitro and in vivo. We now report {{on the role of}} NKCC 1 on cytoskeletal dynamics. We show that GBM cells display a significant decrease in F-actin content upon NKCC 1 knockdown (NKCC 1 -KD). To determine the potential actin-regulatory mechanisms affected by NKCC 1 inhibition, we studied NKCC 1 protein interactions. We found that NKCC 1 interacts with the actin-regulating protein Cofilin- 1 and can regulate its membrane localization. Finally, we analyzed whether NKCC 1 could regulate the activity of the small Rho-GTPases RhoA and Rac 1. We observed that the active forms of RhoA and Rac 1 were decreased in NKCC 1 -KD cells. In summary, we report that NKCC 1 regulates GBM cell migration by modulating the cytoskeleton through multiple targets including F-actin regulation through Cofilin- 1 and RhoGTPase activity. Due to its essential role in cell migration NKCC 1 may serve as a specific therapeutic target to decrease cell invasion in patients with primary brain cancer...|$|E
40|$|The current {{studies were}} {{designed}} to investigate the functional significance of elevated endogenous atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in acute congestive heart failure (CHF). Integrated cardiorenal and endocrine function were measured in three models of acute low-output congestive heart failure with comparably reduced cardiac output (CO) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Acute CHF was produced by rapid right ventricular pacing (group I, n = 5) which decreases CO and increases atrial pressures and plasma ANF. In group II, n = 5, thoracic inferior vena caval constriction (TIVCC) was produced to decrease venous return and CO but without increases in atrial pressure or plasma ANF. In group III, n = 5, TIVCC was performed and exogenous ANF infused to achieve plasma concentrations observed in acute CHF. In acute CHF with increases in endogenous ANF, sodium excretion (UNaV), renal blood flow (RBF), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone (PA) were maintained despite decreases in CO and MAP. In contrast, TIVCC with similar reductions in CO and MAP but without increases in ANF resulted in decreases in UNaV and RBF and increases in PRA and PA. Exogenous administration of ANF in TIVCC to mimic levels in acute CHF prevented sodium retention, renal vasoconstriction, and activation of renin and aldosterone. These studies demonstrate that endogenous ANF serves as an important physiologic <b>volume</b> <b>regulator</b> in acute CHF to maintain sodium excretion and possibly participate in the suppression of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system despite the stimulus of arterial hypotension...|$|E
40|$|OBJECT: Identification of new {{therapeutic}} agents {{aimed at}} attenuating posttraumatic brain edema formation remains an unresolved challenge. Among others, activation of bradykinin B 2 receptors {{is known to}} mediate the formation of brain edema. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the protective effect of the novel nonpeptide B 2 receptor antagonist, LF 16 - 0687 Ms, in brain-injured rats. METHODS: Focal contusion was produced by controlled cortical impact injury. Five minutes after trauma, the rats received a single dose of no, low- (3 mg/kg body weight), or high- (30 mg/kg) dose LF 16 - 0687 Ms. After 24 hours, the amount of brain swelling and hemispheric water content were determined. Low and high doses of LF 16 - 0687 Ms significantly reduced brain swelling by 25 % and 27 %, respectively (p < 0. 03). Hemispheric water content tended to be increased in the nontraumatized hemisphere. In a subsequent series of 10 rats, cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected to determine whether changes in substances associated with edema formation could clarify why LF 16 - 0687 Ms increases water content. For this, the <b>volume</b> <b>regulator</b> amino acid taurine, the excitatory transmitter glutamate, and the adenosine triphosphate degradation products hypoxanthine and xanthine were measured. In CSF, the levels of taurine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine were significantly decreased following a single administration of LF 16 - 0687 Ms (p < 0. 005); the level of glutamate, however, was double that found in control animals (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Using the present study design, a single administration of LF 16 - 0687 Ms successfully reduced posttraumatic brain swelling. The decreased levels of taurine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine may reflect reduced posttraumatic brain edema, whereas the increased level of glutamate could account for the elevated water content observed in the nontraumatized hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|To {{characterize}} {{the impact of}} gut microbiota on host metabolism, we investigated the multicompartmental metabolic profiles of a conventional mouse strain (C 3 H/HeJ) (n= 5) and its germ-free (GF) equivalent (n= 5). We confirm that the microbiome strongly impacts on the metabolism of bile acids through the enterohepatic cycle and gut metabolism (higher levels of phosphocholine and glycine in GF liver and marked higher levels of bile acids in three gut compartments). Furthermore we demonstrate that (1) well-defined metabolic differences exist in all examined compartments between the metabotypes of GF and conventional mice: bacterial co-metabolic products such as hippurate (urine) and 5 -aminovalerate (colon epithelium) were found at reduced concentrations, whereas raffinose was only detected in GF colonic profiles. (2) The microbiome also influences kidney homeostasis with elevated levels of key cell <b>volume</b> <b>regulators</b> (betaine, choline, myo-inositol and so on) observed in GF kidneys. (3) Gut microbiota modulate metabotype expression at both local (gut) and global (biofluids, kidney, liver) system levels and hence influence the responses {{to a variety of}} dietary modulation and drug exposures relevant to personalized health-care investigations...|$|R
40|$|The cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane regulator (CFTR) is a Cl- channel. Mutations of this transporter {{lead to a}} defect of chloride secretion by epithelial cells causing the Cystic Fibrosis disease (CF). In spite of the high expression of CFTR in the kidney, patients with CF do not show major renal dysfunction, but {{it is known that}} both the urinary excretion of drugs and the renal capacity to concentrate and dilute urine is deficient. CFTR mRNA is expressed in all nephron segments and its protein is involved with chloride secretion in the distal tubule, and the principal cells of the cortical (CCD) and medullary (IMCD) collecting ducts. Several studies have demonstrated that CFTR does not only transport Cl- but also secretes ATP and, thus, controls other conductances such as Na+ (ENaC) and K+ (ROMK 2) channels, especially in CCD. In the polycystic kidney the secretion of chloride through CFTR contributes to the cyst enlargement. This review is focused on the role of CFTR in the kidney and the implications of extracellular <b>volume</b> <b>regulators,</b> such as hormones, on its function and expression...|$|R
30|$|Experimental {{procedures}} are as follows. (1) In these tests, only one sand pack (No. 1, {{as shown in}} Fig.  2) was used and saturated with the simulated formation water of different salinities (20, 000 and 200, 000  ppm) at a backpressure of 10.28  MPa under different temperatures. The pressure difference across the sand pack, ΔP 1, was measured for calculating the initial permeability of the sand pack. The water injection rate was maintained at 1  mL/min. (2) CO 2 was injected into the sand pack until a gas breakthrough occurred at the outlet of the sand pack. (3) A slug of the gel solution (modified PAM-methenamine-resorcinol gel system) (normally 0.3 pore volume (PV)) was injected into the sand pack. The concentration of the modified PAM used in brine was 1.0  wt%. (4) A slug of CO 2 (0.3 PV) was then injected into the sand pack, and all the valves were turned off for gel reactions. (5) After 8  h, the simulated formation water was injected into the sand pack at an injection rate of 1  mL/min, and the pressure difference (ΔP 2) was measured at different injection <b>volumes.</b> The backpressure <b>regulator</b> may control the water flow more steadily than a CO 2 flow in sand packs and the pressure difference can be measured with relatively higher accuracy using water flow. Hence, {{the performance of the}} gel system for water shutoff was employed to reflect the blocking capacity to CO 2 based on this gel system indirectly.|$|R
40|$|Neurotransmission and transmembrane {{signaling}} {{are among}} the cellular mechanisms affected in the aging nervous system. In the inner ear, the phosphoinositide second messenger cascade {{is of particular interest}} as a target of the aging process. In both the cochlear (CSE) and vestibular sensory epithelia (VSE), the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PtdInsP 2) to the second messenger inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3) is coupled to muscarinic cholinergic and P 2 y purinergic receptors and may be linked to calcium homeostasis. The present study compared the turnover of phosphoinositides (PtdlnsPs), receptor-mediated release of inositol phosphates (InsPs), and concentrations of endogenous myo-inositol in the CSE and VSE of young (3 months) and aged (24 months) Fischer- 344 rats. In the aged rat, there was a significant increase in [3 H]inositol incorporation (per mass of protein) into PtdlnsPs plus InsPs in both sensory epithelia while the protein content remained unchanged. In contrast, no age-dependent differences were found when pre-labeled [3 H]PtdInsPs were `chased' with non-radiolabeled myo-inositol indicating that the turnover of these lipids was unaffected. The cholinergic receptor agonist carbamylcholine and the P 2 purinergic receptor agonist adenosine 5 '-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate) stimulated the release of [3 H]InsPs two- to six-fold in both organs. This agonist-stimulated release of [3 H]InsPs (per mass of protein) was significantly higher in aged animals. However, when the same stimulation was expressed as per cent of control values, there was no age-dependent difference. Finally, the concentration of endogenous myo-inositol decreased by 44 % in the aged CSE and by 24 % in the aged VSE. In contrast, levels of added myo-[3 H]inositol were higher in aged tissues. These results suggest that the increased labeling of PtdlnsPs and InsPs in the aged CSE and VSE is a consequence of the increased specific radioactivity of the myo-[3 H]inositol precursor pool. The activity of the phosphoinositide second messenger pathway thus appears unchanged. However, a decreased myo-inositol content may contribute to age-dependent pathology in these tissues, myo-inositol is an organic osmolyte and <b>volume</b> <b>regulator.</b> Changes in osmotic pressure or turgor of hair cells could alter micromechanical coupling on the basilar membrane and vestibular epithelium causing pathophysiological changes in sensory transduction...|$|E
40|$|In the airways, adenine {{nucleotides}} {{support a}} complex signaling network mediating host defenses. Released by the epithelium into the airway surface liquid (ASL) layer, they regulate mucus clearance through P 2 (ATP) receptors, and following surface metabolism through P 1 (adenosine; Ado) receptors. The complexity of ASL nucleotide regulation provides an ideal subject for biochemical network modeling. A mathematical model {{was developed to}} integrate nucleotide release, the ectoenzymes supporting the dephosphorylation of ATP into Ado, Ado deamination into inosine (Ino), and nucleoside uptake. The model also includes ecto-adenylate kinase activity and feed-forward inhibition of Ado production by ATP and ADP. The parameters were optimized by fitting the model to experimental data for the steady-state and transient concentration profiles generated by adding ATP to polarized primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. The model captures major aspects of ATP and Ado regulation, including their > 4 -fold increase in concentration induced by mechanical stress mimicking normal breathing. The model also confirmed the independence of steady-state nucleotide concentrations on the ASL <b>volume,</b> an important <b>regulator</b> of airway clearance. An interactive approach between simulations and assays revealed that feed-forward inhibition is mediated by selective inhibition of ecto- 5 ′-nucleotidase. Importantly, the model identifies ecto-adenylate kinase as a key regulator of ASL ATP and proposes novel strategies {{for the treatment of}} airway diseases characterized by impaired nucleotide-mediated clearance. These new insights into the biochemical processes supporting ASL nucleotide regulation illustrate the potential of this mathematical model for fundamental and clinical research...|$|R
5000|$|Ever the innovator, {{he was not}} {{restricted}} to the sole use of hardwoods alone, and experimented in ivory sets of bass, baritone and tenor drones in an ivory common stock with characteristic [...] "lotus-top" [...] style of tuning. Many of the surviving Robertson pastoral and union pipe sets displayed a U-bend in the bass drone; that bends back into the stock of the instrument, to reduce the length and stretch to tune the bass drone. Other modifications of Scottish-made Union pipes of this period, included {{the addition of a}} third drone and model the drone stock into a separate chamber for the drone and regulator reeds, instruments of this period regularly attached the regulators above the stock. Robertson attached the regulators {{to the front of the}} stock to achieve a better balance or greater <b>volume</b> with double <b>regulator</b> reeds and the drones. Pastoral sets with one or two regulators are common in Roberstson’s sets as well as keyed Pastoral and shortened union chanters. Such developments were driven by experimentation as musical styles changed, diversifying the instruments by the maker or the particular tastes of the customer. Leading as musical instruments advanced from an open pastoral bagpipe chanter, to a staccato or closed union pipe in the mid-18th century. Robertson was one of the contemporary innovators of the pastoral and union pipes, as with other instrument makers in the mid-18 to 19th centuries across Scotland, England and Ireland. Makers would regularly exchange ideas, innovations and knowledge in the development of these pipes well into the 19th century, as well as their own unique styling and craftsmanship and sophisticated development of the instrument.|$|R
40|$|A {{possible}} avenue {{towards a}} non-perturbative Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on Minkowski space is the constructive approach which employs the Euclidian path integral formulation, {{in the presence}} of both ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) regulators, as starting point. The UV regulator is to be taken away by renormalisation group techniques which in case of success leads to a measure on the space of generalised Euclidian fields in finite <b>volume.</b> The IR <b>regulator</b> corresponds to the thermodynamic limit of the system in the statistical physics sense. If the resulting measure obeys the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, the actual QFT on Minkowski space is then obtained by Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction. In this work we study the question whether it is possible to reformulate the renormalisation group non-perturbatively directly at the operator (Hamiltonian) level. Hamiltonian renormalisation would be the natural route to follow if one had easier access to an interacting Hamiltonian operator rather than to a path integral, at least {{in the presence of}} UV and/or IR cut-off, which is generically the case in complicated gauge theories such as General Relativity. Our guiding principle for the definition of the direct Hamiltonian renormalisation group is that it results in the same continuum theory as the covariant (path integral) renormalisation group. In order to achieve this, we invert the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction, which may be called Osterwalder-Schrader construction of a Wiener measure from the underlying Hamiltonian theory. The resulting correspondence between reflection positive measures and Osterwalder-Schrader data consisting of a Hilbert space, a Hamiltonian and a ground state vector allows us to monitor the effect of the renormalisation flow of measures in terms of their Osterwalder-Schrader data which motivates a natural direct Hamiltonian renormalisation scheme.
