In 2006 the loss {{was estimated to}} be between £13bn and £18bn, equivalent to £1 for every £6 of <b>VAT</b> <b>due.</b> The bulk of the lost revenue, about £1 in every £8 of <b>VAT</b> <b>due,</b> is due to evasion. Evasion, which is illegal, occurs when registered businesses pay over to HMRC less than they should. This can be done by understating sales or overstating purchases. Evasion also occurs when businesses do not charge VAT on goods and services they provide even though they are legally obliged to. Cash-in-hand jobs by tradesmen may indicate VAT evasion.|$|E

5000|$|Bilta (UK) Ltd ("Bilta"), {{a company}} {{incorporated}} in England, seeks through its joint liquidators, Mr Hellard and Mr Ingram, to recover damages or equitable compensation {{in respect of}} its alleged loss. As against the directors, Bilta claims damages for conspiracy or equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary duty. The conspiracy {{is alleged to have}} been an unlawful means conspiracy, and the unlawful means are the directors' alleged breach of their fiduciary duties. As against Jetivia and Mr Brunschweiler, Bilta claims damages for conspiracy or compensation for dishonest assistance in the directors' breach of their fiduciary duties. Since the matter comes before the court on Jetivia's and Mr Brunschweiler's application for the claims against them to be summarily struck out or dismissed, it is to be assumed for present purposes that the factual allegations made in Bilta's amended particulars of claim are capable of proof, and {{there is no need to}} repeat the word [...] "alleged" [...] whenever referring to the defendants' conduct. The liquidators also pursue a separate claim for fraudulent trading under section 213 of IA 1986. Jetivia is a Swiss company and Mr Brunschweiler, who is resident in France, is its sole director.Bilta had two directors, Mr Nazir and Mr Chopra ("the directors"), who are the first and second defendants. Mr Chopra owned all the issued shares. Bilta was registered for the purposes of VAT. Its only trading activity, which took place between 22 April and 21 July 2009, was trading in European Emissions Trading Scheme Allowances ("EUAs"), which are commonly known as carbon credits. EUAs were treated as taxable supplies under the VAT Act 1994 until 31 July 2009. Since then they have been zero-rated. The VAT status of supplies of the EUAs at the relevant time explains Bilta's activities.In short, Bilta bought large numbers of EUAs from overseas suppliers, including Jetivia, free of VAT, and sold them in the UK with VAT to companies described as [...] "first line buffers", which immediately sold them on. The price for which Bilta sold the EUAs was lower before VAT than the price at which it bought, and Bilta was therefore never going to be in a position to meet its liabilities to HM Revenue and Customs ("HMRC"). Bilta had minimal capital and was insolvent virtually from the outset. The money payable to Bilta, including the <b>VAT</b> <b>due</b> to HMRC, was either paid to Bilta and paid on by it to its overseas supplier, or was paid by the first line buffer (or a later company in the chain) directly to Bilta's supplier, or was otherwise paid to offshore accounts. At the end of the chain the EUAs would be resold to a company outside the UK, generating a right to a VAT refund. It is a familiar kind of carousel or missing trader fraud.Bilta was insolvent throughout the period of its trading in EUAs. In that three-month period, Bilta sold more than 5.7m EUAs for about £294m. Its liability for VAT on those transactions amounts to £38,733,444. It did not submit any VAT returns to HMRC. On the application of HMRC Mr Hellard and Mr Ingram were appointed provisional liquidators of Bilta on 29 September 2009. They commenced the company's claim against the defendants who were its directors and other parties, including the appellants. The company was compulsorily wound up on 25 November 2009. The proceedings were amended on 13 October 2011 to include the liquidators' claims under section 213 of IA 1986.|$|E

40|$|The {{treatment}} of financial services under the VAT {{has been one}} of the most contentious VAT issues since the origin of the <b>VAT.</b> <b>Due</b> to theoretical and measurement complexities, most countries opt to exempt financial services under the VAT. Exemption is the cause of all the controversy. Exempting supplies under the VAT compromises one of the corner-stones of the VAT – neutrality. South Africa is one of many countries that exempts most financial services under VAT. Credit card suppliers in South Africa offer a bundle of financial services comprising fee-based-charges and interest earned. The credit card user is usually only charged for the interest. Interest is an exempt supply under VAT. This gives rise to many distortions for South African credit card users and financial intermediaries. Exhaustive research has been conducted on the {{treatment of}} financial services under the VAT around the world. This study only focusses on the VAT treatment of interest margins of credit cards in South Africa. Firstly, it was determined that credit card offerings in South Africa include bundled offerings which is impractical to separate on a transaction-for-for transaction-basis due to valuation complexities and market conditions. Secondly, it was determined that VAT doesn’t play a major role in credit card suppliers’ decision on how offerings are structured. It is mostly guided by the competition and legislation. Thirdly, it was determined that administrative burden and compliance cost caused by apportionment in South Africa is highly underplayed in the literature. Lastly, it was proposed that full taxation of all financial services with implicit charges at a lower rate or full taxation of fee-based charges with exemption of financial services with a partial input recovery, to be the best alternatives for South Africa to consider to tax financial services under VAT.

40|$|Various {{indicators}} (e. g., VAT-to-GNP ratio, VAT evasion rate) {{suggest that}} problems in VAT administration {{have not only}} persisted during the 1990 s but also appear to have worsened. This study makes use of the 1994 Input Output Table to estimate industry benchmarks for the ratio of VAT-able inputs to total output {{as well as the}} effective VAT rate. In so doing, it also attempts to decompose the sources of the leakage in VAT collections in 1999 - 2001. While in the aggregate the VAT-able purchases of the firms under the Large Taxpayer Unit of the BIR are less than their total output in the current year, it appears that many of these firms do claim excessive input VAT credits. The ratio of the value of total purchases to total sales is higher the corresponding I-O based benchmark in some 68 % of large VAT-payers. In this regard, the use of industry benchmarking to automatically trigger audit would help reduce the leakage in VAT collection. To start with, audit should focus on industries/sectors whose ratio of VAT-able purchases to taxable sales exhibit the greatest variance relative the I-O benchmark. But what is more worrisome is the lack of correspondence between the total negative <b>VAT</b> <b>due</b> in the previous year and the excess input tax carried over from the previous year in 1999 - 2001. This development suggests the absence of a good monitoring system for the excess input tax carried over from one period to the next and is clearly indicative of lapses in VAT administration. Finally, it should be stressed that, to be credible, industry benchmarking requires that each grouping represent a fairly homogeneous set of firms/ taxpayers in terms of key characteristics. Since VAT liability is largely dependent on the input-output structure of firms. In this regard, the 38 major sectors currently being used by the BIR in classifying firms appears to be inadequate. Prospectively, BIR should move towards a finer level of classification approaching at the minimum the I-O level of disaggregation. benchmarks, value added tax (VAT) ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{sustainable}} development challenge that many economies are facing worldwide requires stronger measures because some environmental issues (e. g. global warming) are becoming exponentially worse. If {{we do not}} act at once, this negative trend {{has the potential to}} keep on radically changing the living conditions on the Earth. One of the most effective ways to address this challenge might be developing new Market Based Instruments (MBIs) by adopting a life cycle perspective. In this paper we propose a new taxation framework based on Value Added Tax (VAT) and life cycle thinking. This framework might have the potential to drastically change the current consumption and production patterns towards a product life-cycle oriented economy. Methods. To identify the elements of a new framework enabling to improve the eco-efficiency of the current consumption and production patterns, firstly we have screened the potential of MBIs to face the {{sustainable development}} challenge in relation to the existing EU policy framework. Among MBIs, particular emphasis was given to <b>VAT</b> <b>due</b> to its potential to affect market prices. The key research advances for establishing a green VAT framework were then tracked down to outline the state-of-the-art. Moreover, how to use Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) results for differentiating VAT rates has been investigated. On this basis, a range of methodology proposals to change the current VAT framework have been outlined. A hypothetical case study has been simulated to test these proposals. Results. Some relevant changes to the current VAT taxation system are proposed in this paper bearing in mind the LCA principles and the “getting prices right” policy. Special emphasis was given to the methodological framework needed to differentiate VAT rates according to environmental performance of products. In this context, fiscal neutrality issues related to State budgets have been also taken into account by conceptualising more cautious approaches for differentiating VAT rates. Conclusions. This piece of research has identified life cycle thinking as possible perspective on which basis product VAT rates might be differentiated. Further studies and an impact assessment procedure are needed to evaluate the actual feasibility of this new taxation framework. If the response of this assessment were positive, policy makers, companies and other stakeholders concerned should set out a suite of measures to further fine-tune, test, establish, and facilitate the implementation of this green VAT framework.

40|$|In {{the context}} of Value Added Tax (VAT) on consumption, the {{importance}} of VAT deduction is increasing particularly by cross-border trade with goods and services. That is to say, the mechanism of deduction may prevent the foreign trade from VAT caused trade barriers. In this work, the conventional concept of trade barriers is initially clarified as governmental discrimination of economic sales from abroad. For VAT purposes, this concept takes a supplementation. The discrimination in terms of VAT can be proven {{on the basis of}} the so-called destination principle. According to this principle, it is solely admitted taxes to be imposed in that country in which supplied goods or services are consumed. Therefore, this principle is also called country of consumption principle. If goods or service have arrived at the country of destination and are burdened by the country of origin with VAT, this country should provide for deduction or refund of the levied VAT. Thus, the concept of trade barriers is to be supplemented by discrimination of economic sales to foreign countries. Hence, the country of origin has to award the unlimited right to deduct input VAT and the performance of this right in order to prevent trade barriers. Additionally, it is generally not allowed to levy higher taxes on the “imported” sale in the country of destination for the reason that the sale is originated from abroad. Subsequently, it is discovered certain restrictions of the VAT deduction concerning cross-border transactions of goods and services between EU member states and Turkey from the viewpoint of VAT law in the EU. Residents in Turkey as supplier or receiver of taxable sales can claim VAT deduction only in accordance to Directive 86 / 560 /EEC. This Directive concedes essential (political) scope for limitations of VAT deduction (refund), e. g. “of reciprocity” or the appointment of a tax representative, to the member states. Furthermore, the VAT refund is unavoidable excluded by the Directive, if the taxable person from Turkey supplies particular sales of insurances and financial products or incur some expenditures determined by the respective EU member state. Pursuant to Turkish VAT law, it can be stated that there are shortcomings of VAT deduction detrimental to EU residents with regard to the cross-border trade. If EU taxable persons receive goods or services from Turkey, which are subject to VAT, a VAT deduction, on a regular basis, is not permitted. Moreover, taxable persons from EU, who imports goods to Turkey, are basically obliged to pay import VAT. The deduction of this tax requires that the taxable person owes <b>VAT</b> <b>due</b> to other taxable sales in Turkey. The import VAT could be deducted from this VAT debt. But it is rarely the case that there is that kind of VAT debt. Finally, EU taxable persons supplying taxable cross-border sales in Turkey are not eligible to VAT deduction, to the extent that the input VAT on purchases exceeds the VAT debt on the cross-border sales...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Financial {{services}} {{have generally been}} exempt under value-added tax (<b>VAT)</b> systems <b>due</b> to the inability to identify the appropriate tax base, which is hidden in the financial margin. A cash-flow VAT approach represents one means of defining this tax base {{in a way that}} is compatible with credit-invoice VATs. This paper describes the use of a cash-flow VAT for a banking deposit/loan operation and indicates the practical difficulties blocking use of the full cash-flow method. It then describes a variant of the cash-flow system, referred to as the “Truncated Cash-Flow Method with Tax Calculation Account,” which is designed to overcome these difficulties. One of the most difficult areas in the operation of value-added tax (VAT) systems has been the treatment of financial services. A workable method of taxing such services has eluded tax authorities for decades. As a conse-quence, almost all the countries employing a VAT have opted to exempt financial services rendered to residents of their countries. Although the exemption approach has been widely adopted, there have been significant problems in its operation. The resulting tax cascading creates numerous economic distortions and adversely affects the competitive position of domestic institutions in international markets, while the definitions and allocations needed to operate the system have proven to be very complex. This paper presents an approach to applying a VAT to financial services that is designed to operationalize the cash-flow method. The cash-flow method has been considered a conceptually sound method of applying a VAT to financial services with some attractive attributes in the context of credit-invoice VAT systems. However, the method has also been seen to exhibit several fundamental difficulties, which have kept it from being used except in a few limited situations. The approach suggested here is designed to overcom...|$|R

At the beginning of the practical part, there will be described the legislation for VAT and the development of rates in this tax for said countries. Followed by a comparison of the VAT revenues for these countries to the total public revenues and analysis of dependence of growth real GDP to the growth of VAT revenues. The end of the practical part will include an analysis of the VAT lottery, which runs from 2004 in Malta and can therefore analyze the costs and revenues. The practical part will be using data from international databases Eurostat or World bank...|$|R
40|$|This study uses {{aspects of}} time series {{methodology}} to model and forecast major taxes such as Personal Income Tax (PIT), Corporate Income Tax (CIT), Value Added Tax (VAT) and Total Tax Revenue(TTAXR) in the South African Revenue Service (SARS). The monthly data used for modeling tax revenues {{of the major}} taxes was drawn from January 1995 to March 2010 (in sample data) for PIT, <b>VAT</b> and TTAXR. <b>Due</b> to higher volatility and emerging negative values, the CIT monthly data was converted to quarterly data from the rst quarter of 1995 to the rst quarter of 2010. The competing ARIMA/SARIMA and Holt-Winters models were derived, and the resulting model {{of this study was}} used to forecast PIT, CIT, VAT and TTAXR for SARS fiscal years 2010 / 11, 2011 / 12 and 2012 / 13. The results show that both the SARIMA and Holt-Winters models perform well in modeling and forecasting PIT and VAT, however the Holt-Winters model outperformed the SARIMA model in modeling and forecasting the more volatile CIT and TTAXR. It is recommended that these methods are used in forecasting future payments, as they are precise about forecasting tax revenues, with minimal errors and fewer model revisions being necessary.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the proposition that}} recent tax policy trends have been decisively influenced by tax research. In both the OECD countries and developing countries, {{the two most important}} changes in tax systems in recent decades have been the introduction of the VAT and the general lowering and flattening of statutory income tax rates. The downward pressure on personal and corporate income tax rates has certainly been supported, if not initiated, by the increasing research measuring the distortions caused by high marginal tax rates. Equally, the widespread adoption of <b>VAT</b> is probably <b>due</b> at least in part to acceptance of the economic argument that this form of sales tax is less economically distorting. For the most part, however, countries have not done these things because economists produced persuasive theories or empirical evidence that {{it would be good to}} do them but for their own reasons. After reviewing a number of aspects of how tax policy decisions are made in practice, the paper concludes that if tax scholars are interested in improving policy, they should focus not on the short-term political game within which policy decisions are inevitably made in all countries but rather on the long-term game of building up institutional capacity, both within and outside governments, to articulate relevant ideas for change, to collect and analyze relevant data, and to assess and criticize the effects of such changes as are made. Economic research may provide valuable inputs into policy decisions, both because it is the only approach focusing on efficiency concerns and because it can (but often fails to) say some useful things about the distributional outcomes that impact more immediately on policy decisions in most countries. But it is not and cannot be a substitute for the development of the political institutions that need to exist if ‘good’ tax policy is to be developed and implemented. tax policy, tax research, developing countries, administratin, political economy...|$|R
40|$|The second {{generation}} fiscal federalism (SGFF) approach {{is used as}} a reference to analyze the political and fiscal institutional design of Bolivia’s decentralization model and its evolution. Subnational public finance data up to 2008 is used to verify that decentralization of expenditure was higher than that of revenue, establishing a context of vertical fiscal imbalance that increased due to growing fiscal transfers during the positive external shock (boom) period. Consequently, the subnational fiscal surplus was not a result of internal efficiency but of excess revenues from such transfers. Panel models were estimated to identify and assess the implicit incentives embedded in fiscal institutions of the decentralization model. Findings at the municipal level are: i) misalignment of local spending with local interests due to dominance of transfers over own revenue (dominance of central government development policies); ii) incentive to spend transfers faster than own revenue (flypaper effect); iii) greater marginal contribution of own revenue to positive fiscal balances compared to transfers, thus introducing the seed for a soft budget constraint but hidden by the fiscal surplus; iv) disincentive to generate own revenue (tax and non-tax) due to the size and growth of transfers (disincentive to the culture of contributing to own revenue). Findings at the prefectural level are: i) misalignment with regional interests given the dominance of transfers over own revenue due to absolute lack of tax powers (until 2009); ii) high tendency to a soft budget constraint and, eventually, also fiscal bail-out, hidden by the fiscal surplus; iii) in only two departments collection of national-level taxes were higher, compared to transfers received in the same departments; iv) disincentive to pay the <b>VAT</b> (national-level tax) <b>due</b> to higher royalty transfers received, an effect not extended to other national-level taxes; v) high dependence from hydrocarbon-based transfers, and fiscal risk when this natural resource declines (both in volume and prices) due to volatility of international oil prices. Also, {{as a result of the}} decentralization model a positive and significant impact was found on education-coverage indicators, an important development objective of the national government. ...|$|R
