25|$|<b>Voluntary</b> <b>return</b> of {{refugees}} into {{their country of}} origin, in safety and dignity, is based on their free will and their informed decision. In {{the last couple of}} years parts of or even whole refugee populations were able to return to their home countries: e.g. 120,000 Congolese refugees returned from the Republic of Congo to the DRC, 30,000 Angolans returned home from the DRC and Botswana, Ivorian refugees returned from Liberia, Afghans from Pakistan, and Iraqis from Syria. In 2013, the governments of Kenya and Somalia also signed a tripartite agreement facilitating the repatriation {{of refugees}} from Somalia. The UNHCR and the IOM offer assistance to refugees who want to return voluntarily to their home countries. Many developed countries also have Assisted <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Return</b> (AVR) programmes for asylum seekers who want to go back or were refused asylum.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-five of the 34 cases {{listed in}} the {{previous}} Compliance Report have been closed, with approximately one-third resulting in {{the return of the}} children to the United States. There have been ten Hague court hearings since Fall 1999, with all children except one returned to the U.S. In one case, children were returned to the United States only six months after the abduction. In addition, there have been voluntary returns in more than 30 cases, with the existence of a pending Hague case a factor in the <b>voluntary</b> <b>return</b> decision. Once a child has been located, the taking parent must be notified of the hearing date. Mexico’s new procedure of taking children into custody at that time has been very effective in ensuring that the taking parent does not go into hiding with the children.|$|E

Balzer's theory gained immense popularity among historians. This view is refuted by Władysław Karasiewicz and Jan Baszkiewicz. However, doesn't completely exclude the possibility that during this period an agreement could have been concluded between Przemysł II and Henryk IV Probus, evidenced {{by the fact that the}} Duke of Wrocław <b>voluntary</b> <b>returned</b> of lands Ołobock and Wieluń to Przemysł II in his will.|$|R

However, the results were that there were significantly more left-handers amongst male mathematics undergraduates than male non-mathematics undergraduates (21% versus 11%) and significantly more non-right-handers (44% versus 24%), and that there was a similar but smaller left-handedness difference for female undergraduates (11% versus 8%).

5000|$|There is {{a related}} process called <b>voluntary</b> <b>return</b> or, in more formal parlance, {{administrative}} voluntary departure. This {{refers to a}} case where an alien is stopped from entering at a land border (by United States Border Patrol) and agrees to voluntarily return instead of undergoing expedited removal. A key difference between voluntary departure and <b>voluntary</b> <b>return</b> {{is that in the}} case of <b>voluntary</b> <b>return,</b> the alien never enters the United States, and therefore accrues no unlawful presence. The time between the alien arriving at the port and agreeing to return voluntarily can vary between a few hours and a few days, and throughout that duration the alien is under the supervision of either U.S. Customs and Border Protection or the carrier. Nonetheless, a number of commentators use the term <b>voluntary</b> <b>return</b> to refer to both voluntary departure and <b>voluntary</b> <b>return.</b> To add to the confusion, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses the term [...] "return" [...] when reporting the number of voluntary departures.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{compiled}} {{on the topic}} ?Immigration to the Czech Republic Seen by Members of the Foreign Police in České Budějovice. ? In the theoretical part I focus on the common interpretation of migration, its solutions on the international level and {{the attitude of the}} Police of the Czech Republic in relation to national minorities. For the investigation I have chosen the quantitative research using the method of questionning by means of a standardised questionnaire. Research collection was created by the members of the Foreign police in České Budějovice (further ?members?). In total, 90 respondents were questioned. Out of this number, 67 questionnaires were returned, so the rate of the data collection was 74 %. The practical part is focused on the targets and hypotheses of the thesis. The main targets were to find out the opinions of the members on immigration of foreigners and what are their attitudes to integration of foreigners into the society. Hypothesis 1 presupposed that the members see the form of <b>voluntary</b> <b>returns</b> of foreigners´ home positively. Hypothesis 2 presupposed that the members´ negative opinion on not obeying law by foreigners prevails. Hypotheses were statistically tested and proved. The project of <b>voluntary</b> <b>returns</b> of foreigners to their home country is evaluated as a positive way of enabling the journey home from the following reasons: unfavourable economical conditions and the loss of the stay objective in the Czech Republic. Opinions of the members show that the foreigners do not obey law as a result of downfall of the traditional cultural minority norms and values, imperfect integration to majoritarian society and the following isolation. It is necessary to inform the members on the problems of immigration, integration and discrimination prevention in the form of training and seminars. The results of my thesis might be used for the comparison of following investigations in the field of foreigners´ integration into the Czech society and might create the base for the following investigations on the problems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the factors}} that hold back the remaining refugees who might otherwise be attracted to return to Timor-Leste {{as a result of}} the country 2 ̆ 7 s increased political stability and growing prosperity. The unresolved status of thousands of former refugees who fled across the border following a 1999 vote for independence remains a challenge to Timor-Leste’s long-term stability. Many were never well integrated into host communities and are being drawn back across the border in small but increasing numbers by relative economic and political stability in the new state. These returns should be encouraged by both countries as a good opportunity to promote reconciliation between the two communities divided by the border. Doing so will expose the costs of impunity for the violence that surrounded the 1999 referendum and highlight the failure to implement practical recommendations from its two truth commissions, the CAVR and the Commission on Truth and Friendship. Timor-Leste’s leadership may yet decide that some form of amnesty is the best way forward, but the country cannot afford to further delay broad discussion on solutions. Political consensus on justice and reconciliation has been elusive but is urgently needed. The parliament and government of Timor-Leste should take the following steps: clarify with the Indonesian government through a memorandum of understanding the formal procedures for <b>voluntary</b> <b>returns</b> by those born in East Timor; develop an official policy supporting <b>voluntary</b> <b>returns,</b> including limited assistance to returnees, through food assistance and mediation support during a provisional period as well as strengthened welfare monitoring and elaborating their rights upon return; debate in parliament the CAVR report and draft laws on reparations for victims and the creation of a planned successor institution to the CAVR, whose mandate should include supporting community reconciliation processes; renew efforts to implement with Indonesia the recommendations of the Commission for Truth and Friendship; and publicly commit to the prosecution of existing indictments in the domestic courts...|$|R

Drawing on the experiences of Bosnian Serbs and Cypriot Maronite returnees since the 1993 - 95 and 1974 wars respectively, it examines two counter-intuitive attempts of partial reversal of forced displacement. This chapter also sheds light on the local and global networks of cooperation generated by diasporas in exile to advocate and sustain return home, focusing specifically at the importance of trust, exchange and social capital as manifested in these groups. While recognizing the limitations of diaspora politics in Bosnia and Cyprus, the chapter demonstrates that community effort resolves coordination and commitment problems, thereby facilitating <b>voluntary</b> peaceful <b>return</b> even under conditions of inter-communal fear, mistrust and economic insecurity...|$|R

The current operations of a company are described and the feasibility of three operational scenarios is analysed. Combining findings from the case study with literature, the paper also provides a framework of the different value and productivity advantages related to each step of the returns process. Value can be added to products by collecting used products, increasing the environmental image of a firm through reprocessing used goods, and offering a secondary market for used products. Productivity advantages are gained by the reuse of components as raw materials and analysing them to gain information on the durability of different components. This paper also proposes that making disposal and recycling easy and cheap for customers can be seen as a way to increase purchasing frequency, which can be considered to boost productivity...|$|R

40|$|The {{forced removal}} of foreign {{nationals}} {{has been a}} relatively uncommon occurrence in liberal democracies, {{at least since the}} 2 nd World War. This can be explained by both the inherent violence of this process, which raises widespread public opposition, and by the geopolitical difficulties it raises, as there must be agreement of both countries concerned. In recent years these problems appear to have been partially overcome and since 2005 a ‘deportation turn’ is evident across the European Union as deportations increase. This paper focuses on the international dimension to this increase, following work investigating deportation as an essentially biopolitical process of international governance of populations. This approach is developed in an analysis of the geopolitical impacts of that management process. The paper uses empirical research with Sri Lankan migrants who left the UK either as a result of force or <b>voluntary</b> <b>returns</b> policies to explain this development. It identifies the changing strategy of the deportation process, particularly recent attention to the negotiation of bilateral and multilateral readmission agreements and the role of international organisations as mediators as key contributions to an explanation for the rise in deportations...|$|R
5000|$|According to the UNHCR, every asylum-seeker than {{comes from}} the central and {{southern}} regions of Iraq should be granted refugee status. However, many European countries are not following these guidelines and argue that the post-war situation in these areas of Iraq {{is not enough for}} qualifying Iraqis as refugees. These discrepancies about the current situation of violence in Iraq —which has important political connotations, especially for those countries that participated in the invasion—and whether Iraqis are eligible for protection or not has enabled some countries not only to reject asylum applications, but also to repatriate asylum-seekers back to Iraq. The UNHCR has repeatedly condemned the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands and Norway, among other European countries, for forcibly repatriating Iraqis when the situation back in their homeland is still not safe for them. UNHCR's spokesman in Geneva, Adrian Edwards, said in September 2010 that [...] "we strongly urge European governments to provide Iraqis with protection until the situation in their areas of origin in Iraq allows for safe and <b>voluntary</b> <b>returns.</b> In this critical time of transition, we also encourage all efforts to develop conditions in Iraq that are conducive to sustainable and voluntary return".|$|R

Some historians represent the visit as a <b>voluntary</b> <b>returning</b> into captivity; but this was not so. The English king had accepted the hostages in his place, and was responsible for their safe-keeping, and had no claim upon the French monarch because they had taken advantage of the excess of confidence with which they had been treated. That the coming of the French king was not in any way regarded as a return into captivity is shown {{by the fact that he}} was before starting furnished by Edward with letters of safe-conduct, by which his secure and unobstructed return to his own country was expressly stipulated, and he was received by Edward as an honoured guest and friend, and his coming was regarded as an honour and an occasion for festivity by all England.|$|R
