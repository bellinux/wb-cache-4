5|$|From 1945 onwards, Britain {{conducted}} {{a number of}} studies into the properties and use of <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> wings. The noted British engineer and inventor Sir Barnes Wallis began exploring the concept during the Second World War and became an early pioneer and advocate for the <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> wing, conceiving of an aircraft consideration that lacked conventional features such as a vertical stabiliser and rudder, instead using <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> wings to provide primary controllability in their place. In 1946, Wallis published a paper upon this research, which was quickly hailed as being a major scientific breakthrough in the aviation industry. Wallis proceeded to advocate for the production of an aircraft, military or civil, that would take advantage of a <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> wing. The Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Defence arranged for a series of tests to demonstrate the application of the technology to projectiles, both for research purposes and a potential form of anti-aircraft defence; while Wallis worked upon this research programme, he continued to promote the concept of a manned <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> aircraft.|$|R
