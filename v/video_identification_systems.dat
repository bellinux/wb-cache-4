40|$|The current {{technological}} advances {{allow for the}} easy distribution and duplication of video content through various venues, the most popular being the World Wide Web. Upholding copyright laws has thus become an important task; the result to this problem needs to be implemented {{in such a way}} to provide automatic video identification. This paper presents a novel approach to video identification based on the video tomography technique. The proposed video signature was designed and evaluated based on its ability to uniquely identify videos. A video signature should be both independent and robust. This paper focuses on evaluating the independence of the proposed video signatures. The signatures were evaluated using a large test set developed for the MPEG activity on digital video signatures. The results show that the proposed signature works well and exhibits strong independence necessary to support general purpose <b>video</b> <b>identification</b> <b>systems.</b> Index Terms — video tomography, video signature, shot detection, independence 1...|$|E
40|$|ENGLISH: Over {{the last}} decades the amount of {{generated}} video content has increased exponentially. Easy access to video recording equipment and the Internet has given anyone {{the ability to create}} and share video material with the world almost instantaneously. With the enormous amount of content available the problem of managing it become relevant. In situations such as copyright control, media management or digital forensics {{there is a need to}} perform automatic video search. In this master thesis we investigate this problem. Using perceptual hash algorithms we create PYVIDID, a Python based <b>video</b> <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> able to match and search query videos to a large database. PYVIDID can also match both fragmented and transformed video files back to its original source. We also discuss possible application areas for a content based <b>video</b> <b>identification</b> <b>system.</b> Overall our results clearly shows that perceptual hash algorithms can indeed be used for <b>video</b> <b>identification</b> with high accuracy. We achieve good results regarding both accuracy and speed for both original, fragmented and transformed video files...|$|R

40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the visual {{identification}} of an aircraft flight's regimes. It describes the spatial motion of an airplane along with the visualization of flight parameters and also proposes a system for a flight regime visual <b>identification.</b> The <b>system</b> processes the input video on a frame by frame basis in two steps. Initially, the video is being stabilized and the system subsequently proceeds in identification of flight related quantities describing the current flight state. Video stabilization is based on feature points detection and an optical flow calculation. Video frames are transformed {{in order to achieve}} sufficient consecutive frames overlap and thus to minimize the parasitic oscillations of the <b>video</b> acquisition <b>system.</b> <b>Identification</b> of values indicated by flight instruments is based on the Hough line transform approach. The thesis also includes a description of an application that analyzes a video from the cockpit of an aircraft and is able to recognize the instrument values displayed on specified flight instruments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A <b>video</b> {{aircraft}} <b>identification</b> algorithm, {{based on}} the tail number recognition, is proposed {{as a part of}} a global airport surveillance video system. The recognition procedure searches and detects the presence of the tail number in the image and then recognises the tail number using pattern matching techniques. The <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> has been designed to deal with airport real images, taking into account letter sizes differences and potential deformations. Finally, the aircraft <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> calculates the joint probability of each tail number in the airport database. The tail number maximising the joint probability is selected. Results show that the identification procedure achieves a robust identification using the database...|$|R

40|$|Mistaken {{eyewitness}} {{identification is}} {{a major source of}} miscarriages of justice. In England and Wales, procedures for obtaining identification evidence are set out in legislation. The vast majority of identifications are obtained using a traditional ‘live’ identity parade (or line-up). However, in some circumstances <b>video</b> <b>identifications</b> are being used more frequently. Records of line-ups and <b>video</b> <b>identifications</b> used in actual criminal cases were obtained. The fairness of these two procedures was compared by use of a mock witness procedure. In a perfectly fair line-up the suspect would be chosen, by chance, by 11 % of the mock witnesses. However, 25 % of mock witnesses selected the suspect from 25 photographs of live line-ups, compared to 15 % of mock witnesses who selected the suspect from <b>video</b> <b>identifications.</b> An analysis of covariance, taking the number of visual features mentioned in the original witness's first description as the covariate, showed that the proportion choosing the suspect was significantly smaller from <b>video</b> <b>identifications.</b> It is concluded that the video line-ups were fairer than the live line-ups, and therefore that wider use of <b>video</b> <b>identifications</b> has the potential to improve the reliability of eyewitness identification evidence...|$|R
40|$|Tracking and {{identifying}} players in sports videos filmed {{with a single}} pan-tilt-zoom camera has many applications, {{but it is also}} a challenging problem. This article introduces a system that tackles this difficult task. The system possesses the ability to detect and track multiple players, estimates the homography between video frames and the court, and identifies the players. The <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> combines three weak visual cues, and exploits both temporal and mutual exclusion constraints in a Conditional Random Field. In addition, we propose a novel Linear Programming Relaxation algorithm for predicting the best player <b>identification</b> in a <b>video</b> clip. In order to reduce the number of labeled training data required to learn the <b>identification</b> <b>system,</b> we make use of weakly supervised learning with the assistance of play-by-play texts. Experiments show promising results in tracking, homography estimation, and identification. Moreover, weakly supervised learning with play-by-play texts greatly reduces the number of labeled training examples required. The <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> can achieve similar accuracies by using merely 200 labels in weakly supervised learning, while a strongly supervised approach needs a least 20000 labels.

40|$|With the {{development}} of voice transformation and speech synthesis technologies, speaker <b>identification</b> <b>systems</b> are likely to face attacks from imposters who use voice transformed or synthesized speech to mimic a particular speaker. Therefore, we investigated in this paper how speaker <b>identification</b> <b>systems</b> perform on voice transformed speech. We conducted experiments with two different approaches, the classical GMM-based speaker <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> and the Phonetic speaker <b>identification</b> <b>system.</b> Our experimental results showed that current standard voice transformation techniques are able to fool the GMM-based system but not the Phonetic speaker <b>identification</b> <b>system.</b> These findings imply that future speaker <b>identification</b> <b>systems</b> should include idiosyncratic knowledge in order to successfully distinguish transformed speech from natural speech and thus be armed against imposter attacks...|$|R

40|$|<b>Video</b> <b>identification</b> or copy {{detection}} is {{a challenging}} problem and {{is becoming increasingly}} important with {{the growing popularity of}} online video services. The problem addressed in this paper is the identification of a given video clip in a given set of videos. For a given query video, the system returns all the instance of the video in the data set. This <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> uses <b>video</b> signatures based on video tomography. A robust and low complexity video signature is designed. The signatures are generated for video shots and not individual frames. This results in a compact signature of 64 bytes per video segment / shot. The signatures are matched using simple Euclidean distance metric. Both signature generation and matching have a very low complexity. The system was evaluated using the dataset from video copy detection evaluations organized at the CIVR 2007. The results show that the proposed signatures outperform the results reported in the CIVR competition. The results also show that the signature is robust to common video transformations...|$|R
