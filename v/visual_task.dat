In this study, we investigate the relationship between IT and the performance and oculomotor variables measured during three simple <b>visual</b> <b>tasks.</b> Participants’ ITs were first measured using a slight variation of the standard IT task, which was followed by the three simple <b>visual</b> <b>tasks</b> that were designed to test participants’ visual–attentional control and visual working memory under varying degrees of difficulty; they included a <b>visual</b> search <b>task,</b> a comparative <b>visual</b> search <b>task,</b> and a <b>visual</b> memorization <b>task.</b> Significant correlations were found between IT and performance variables for each of the <b>visual</b> <b>tasks.</b> The implications of the correlation between IT and performance-related variables are discussed. Oculomotor variables on the other hand only correlated significantly with IT during the retrieval phase of the <b>visual</b> memorization <b>task,</b> which is likely a product of differences in participants’ ability to memorize objects during the loading phase of the experiment. This leads us to the conclusion that the oculomotor variables we measured do not correlate with IT in general, but may in the case where a systematic benefit would be realized...|$|R

50|$|Paivio {{found that}} {{participants}} when shown a rapid sequence of pictures {{as well as}} a rapid sequence of words and later asked to recall the words and pictures, in any order, were better at recalling images. Participants, however, more readily recalled the sequential order of the words, rather than the sequence of pictures. These results supported Paivio's hypothesis that verbal information is processed differently from visual information and that verbal information was superior to visual information when sequential order was also required for the memory task (Paivio, 1969). Lee Brooks conducted an experiment that provided additional support for two systems for memory. He had participants perform either a <b>visual</b> <b>task,</b> where they had to view a picture and answer questions about the picture, or a verbal task, where they listened to a sentence and were then asked to answer questions pertaining to the sentence. To respond to the questions, participants were asked to either respond verbally, visually, or manually. Through this experiment, Brooks found that interference occurred when a visual perception was mixed with manipulation of the <b>visual</b> <b>task,</b> and verbal responses interfere with a task involving a verbal statement to be manually manipulated. This supported the idea of two codes used to mentally represent information (Sternberg 2003).|$|E

40|$|Aim: Our aim was {{to study}} the effect of {{performing}} some common near <b>visual</b> <b>tasks</b> on corneal topography. Methods: We investigated the relative changes in corneal optics {{in a group of}} nine young subjects who undertook three different near <b>visual</b> <b>tasks</b> for 60 minutes. One task was reading a novel in downward gaze, the second task required the use of a binocular microscope and the third task involved using a desktop computer.

In a second experiment we studied the recovery of corneal topography following periods of reading ranging from 10 to 120 minutes with six young subjects. Results: Each of the three near <b>visual</b> <b>tasks</b> showed systematic and statistically significant effects on both the characteristics (p < 0. 05) and location (p = 0. 01) of corneal topographic changes.

50|$|Inattentional blindness, {{also known}} as perceptual blindness, is a {{psychological}} lack of attention that is not associated with any vision defects or deficits. It may be further defined as the event in which an individual fails to perceive an unexpected stimulus that is in plain sight. When it simply becomes impossible for one to attend to all the stimuli in a given situation, a temporary blindness effect can take place as a result; that is, individuals fail to see objects or stimuli that are unexpected and quite often salient. The term was coined by Arien Mack and Irvin Rock in 1992 and {{was used as the}} title of their book of the same name, published by MIT press in 1998, in which they describe the discovery of the phenomenon and include a collection of procedures used in describing it.

A more recent study in 2011 similarly studied a group of individual with bipolar disorder and found evidence for mood-dependent memory on a <b>visual</b> <b>task</b> (recognition of inkblots). It was observed that subjects had better recall for these inkblots when they were in the same mood state they had been in when they first saw these inkblots. However, researchers did not find a similar effect for verbal tasks. Because the two studies do not agree on the effects of mood in regard to verbal recall tasks, {{further research is needed to}} clarify the existence of mood-dependent memory on both verbal and visual recall tasks as well as to investigate mood-dependent memory in those suffering from other mood disorders or individuals without mood disorders of any kind.|$|E

He first obtained a MSc in Mathematics and Computer Science (1990). He then continued with his doctoral studies, culminating in a PhD in neuroscience (1994). During his time at the Weizmann Institute, his research focused on the visual brain. With his advisor, Professor Dov Sagi, {{he was able to}} resolve a 30-year-old scientific dilemma, which tried to understand how the human visual system is able to effortlessly discriminate between different types of visual textures, such as tree bark. They published their findings in the Optical Society of America (1990). Another accomplishment of his laboratory was elucidating the learning process in the brain. It was determined that after practicing a <b>visual</b> <b>task,</b> a consolidation period of at least six hours was needed before any improvement occurs. The expressions, [...] "cramming before a test will not be of any benefit" [...] and [...] "sleeping on it" [...] are adages that are supported by this research. To further this research, Rubenstein and colleagues wondered whether a certain stage of sleep was responsible for this consolidation. Their findings, reported in the Journal of Science (1994), show conclusively that the consolidation of visually learned tasks occurs during the dream stage (REM). These findings began a resurgence in the study of sleep. Rubenstein and colleagues’s research has been further cited and discussed in various publications, including Scientific American and the New York Times.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Robust {{low-level}} {{image features}} {{have proven to}} be effective representations for a variety of high-level <b>visual</b> recognition <b>tasks,</b> such as object recognition and scene classification. But as the <b>visual</b> recognition <b>tasks</b> become more challenging, the semantic gap between low-level feature representation and the meaning of the scenes increases. In this paper, we propose to use objects as attributes of scenes for scene classification. We represent images by collecting their responses to a large number of object detectors, or “object filters”. Such representation carries high-level semantic information rather than low-level image feature information, making it more suitable for high-level <b>visual</b> recognition <b>tasks.</b> Using very simple, off-the-shelf classifiers such as SVM, we show that this object-level image representation can be used effectively for high-level <b>visual</b> <b>tasks</b> such as scene classification.

40|$|Introduction: {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging is a useful non-invasive technique for the evaluation and mapping of human brain, especially the visual cortex. One of the most important subjects in this background is optimizing visual stimuli in various forms of <b>visual</b> <b>tasks</b> for acquiring significant and ro-bust signals. Materials and methods: The effects of physical pa-rameters of visual stimuli on 14 healthy volunteers for detecting visual cortical activity were evaluated by functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}}. These pa-rameters were temporal frequency (TF), different pat-terns of activation including, square wave and sine wave grating, and two different states of rest includ-ing black and white screens. Results: The results showed that BOLD signal will be maximally in the TF of 8 Hz, and use the black screen in the rest state. However there was not significant difference between square-¬wave and sine-wave grat-ings in producing visual activation in the cortex. Conclusion: Physical parameters of <b>visual</b> <b>tasks</b> are effective in detecting visual cortical activity, and it is necessary to pay attention to them in order to get sig-nificant and robust signal. <b>Visual</b> <b>tasks</b> with TF of 8 Hz and one pattern of square-wave or sine-wave in activation state, and black screen in rest state are op-timally suitable for fMRI studies...|$|R
