He could never make out how he had attained the footing of intimacy in the Dunster mansion above the bay—whether on the ground of personal merit or as the pioneer of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>silk</b> industry. It must have been the last, because he remembered distinctly, as distinctly as in a dream, hearing old Dunster once telling him that his next public task would be a careful survey of the Northern Districts to discover tracts suitable for the cultivation of the silk plant. The old man wagged his beard at him sagely. It was indeed as absurd as a dream.|$|E

His shop Morris & Co. sold both finished custom embroideries and kits in the new style, along with <b>vegetable</b> dyed <b>silks</b> in which to work them. Art needlework was considered an appropriate style for decorating artistic dress.|$|R
5000|$|Zwaardecrood {{had always}} had a great {{interest}} in developing new products. He encouraged coffee-planting in Priangan in Java so that coffee production grew quickly. From 1723, the whole of the harvest had to be delivered to the Company. Then Zwaardecroon introduced silk production into Java as well as the production of <b>vegetable</b> dyes. <b>Silk</b> production was not so successful. In 1772 he re-established the Chinese tea trade, which had been disrupted.|$|R

50|$|Traditional {{materials}} include linen, hemp, other <b>vegetable</b> fibers, sinew, <b>silk,</b> and rawhide. Almost any fiber {{may be used}} in emergency. Natural fibers {{would be}} very unusual on a modern recurve bow or compound bow, but are still effective and still used on traditional wooden or composite bows. Sinew and hide strings may be seriously affected by water.|$|R

Mass has most effect {{at the center of}} the string; 1 g of extra mass in the middle of the string slows the arrow about as much as 3.5 g at the ends. Traditional materials include linen, hemp, other <b>vegetable</b> fibers, sinew, <b>silk,</b> and rawhide. Almost any fiber may be used in emergency.|$|R

It also nests in caves, under the eaves of houses, and in recently burned stands.

Following the 1813 Gulistan Treaty, the {{northern}} area of the khanate was occupied by Russia, and the remainder was seized in the final Russo-Persian war of 1826-1828. The 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay left the area within the Russian empire and the khanate was abolished. During the 19th century, Lankaran exported rice, <b>silk,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> wood and fish to Russia. During the 20th century the tea-cultivation and processing industry became important in the rayon.|$|R

"Then {{some more}} native parties in short kimonos that showed their aboriginees {{punctured}} the near-horizon, {{and me and}} High had to skip back into Father Axletree's private boudoir. They came by ones, twos, and threes, and left all sorts of offerings--there was enough grub for Bingham's nine gods of war, with plenty left over for the Peace Conference at The Hague. They brought jars of honey, and bunches of bananas, and bottles of wine, and stacks of tortillas, and beautiful shawls worth one hundred dollars apiece that the Indian women weave {{of a kind of}} <b>vegetable</b> fibre like <b>silk.</b> All of 'em got down and wriggled {{on the floor in front}} of that hard-finish god, and then sneaked off through the woods again.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of Middlewich rose during the 19th and 20th centuries. Some of this rise {{is attributable to}} a number of parishes being combined, for example parts of Newton were added to Middlewich in 1894, with Sutton having previously been added to Newton in 1892. Some will also be due to a general increase in {{population of}} the United Kingdom, and some of the increase would have been required to provide a labour force for the increased number, and scale, of salt and chemical works in the town. In the middle of the 19th century Middlewich was described as a town with principal works being the surrounding farming district, a silk factory, and the salt works in Kinderton and Newton. In 1887 the town was described as having an antique appearance, with its principal trade being salt, along with fruit and <b>vegetables,</b> and small <b>silk</b> and heavy cotton works. The town had one bank and one newspaper. By 1911 the Encyclopædia Britannica mentions the existence of chemical works and the manufacture of condensed milk.|$|R
50|$|In Central Asia, the {{earliest}} surviving Turkic-language texts, the eighth-century Orkhon inscriptions, were erected by the Göktürks {{in the sixth}} century CE, and include words not common to Turkic but found in unrelated Inner Asian languages. Although the ancient Turks were nomadic, they traded wool, leather, carpets, and horses for wood, <b>silk,</b> <b>vegetables</b> and grain, as well as having large ironworking stations {{in the south of}} the Altai Mountains during the 600s CE. Most of the Turkic peoples were followers of Tengrism, sharing the cult of the sky god Tengri, although there were also adherents of Manichaeism, Nestorian Christianity and Buddhism. However, during the Muslim conquests, the Turks entered the Muslim world proper as servants, during the booty of Arab raids and conquests. The Turks began converting to Islam after Muslim conquest of Transoxiana through the efforts of missionaries, Sufis, and merchants. Although initiated by the Arabs, the conversion of the Turks to Islam was filtered through Persian and Central Asian culture. Under the Umayyads, most were domestic servants, whilst under the Abbasid Caliphate, increasing numbers were trained as soldiers. By the ninth century, Turkish commanders were leading the caliphs’ Turkish troops into battle. As the Abbasid Caliphate declined, Turkish officers assumed more military and political power taking over or establishing provincial dynasties with their own corps of Turkish troops.|$|R
