5|$|Basin and Range-associated {{stretching}} {{of large}} parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16millionyears ago and the region is still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and <b>vertical</b> <b>transport</b> of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal faults. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and {{at the base of}} the ranges also helped to develop the area. Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the Pacific Plate along the San Andreas Fault (west of the region), is responsible for the lateral movement.|$|E

Although horizontal convective rolls, {{also known as}} cloud streets, have been clearly seen in satellite photographs for the last 30 years, their development is poorly understood {{due to a lack of}} observational data. From the ground they appear as rows of cumulus [...] or cumulus-type clouds aligned parallel to the low-level wind.

Under the tutelage of Professor Julius von Wiesner of the University of Vienna, Chamberlain studied botany in Geneva, earning a Bacheliers en sciences (BSc) physiques et naturelles in 1881. His thesis, Recherches sur la sève ascendante (Studies on rising sap), was not finished until 1897 and did not culminate in a further qualification.

In-stream structure technologies studied are used to provide bank stabilization, flow control, scour and sediment control, as well as ecological enhancement through turbulent dispersion and <b>vertical</b> mass <b>transport.</b> Quantitative analysis evaluates flow effects induced by common channel restoration structures {{in their ability to}} provide mixing in our streams and rivers without significant impacts on flooding through excessive energy loss and backwater effect. Physical, fixed-bed flume experiments were performed under high-Reynolds number subcritical steady-state flow conditions. Theoretical energy loss relationships were developed, compared, and evaluated experimentally for stream barbs, spurs, submerged vanes, blocks and boulders. Extensive surface dye-trace experiments were performed to determine centerline mixing and <b>vertical</b> mass <b>transport</b> produced by stream barbs, vanes and boulders. The research presented in this thesis illustrates that the use of dispersion relationships to assess length of <b>vertical</b> mass <b>transport</b> based on the change in energy slope, and estimated shear velocity, of the channel does not properly correct for boundary layer formation and advection or angular motion produced by channel restoration structures. Submerged vanes were found to provide efficient vertical mixing with minimal energy loss or flood risk, as compared to stream barbs, spurs, blocks, and boulders. The deterioration of water quality and the need to provide bank stabilization with limited flood risk require updated NRCS and ASCE design standards and selection tools for <b>vertical</b> mass <b>transport</b> and energy loss relationships of channel restoration structures.

40|$|Beneath its {{ice cover}} the Arctic Ocean {{is a low}} energy environment. The weak {{turbulent}} activity allows other, more esoteric mixing mechanisms to become important in transforming the water masses. One such process is double-diffusive convection, which is triggered by the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt and utilises the potential energy stored in the unstably stratified component, heat or salt, to increase the <b>vertical</b> <b>transports.</b> Cold, fresh water above warm, saline water leads {{to the formation of}} diffusive interfaces, while warm and saline water above cooler and fresher water results in saltfingers. The former situation is more representative of the Arctic Ocean and the <b>vertical</b> heat <b>transport</b> through diffusive interfaces could contribute significantly to the upward flux of heat from the subsurface warm Atlantic water to the upper layers. The lateral property contrasts between the different inflow branches to the Arctic Ocean and between the boundary current and the water columns of the different basins allow finite lateral disturbances to create intrusions and inversions in the temperature and salinity profiles. These in turn cause double-diffusive transports, which generate convergences and divergences in the vertical buoyancy fluxes, reinforcing the lateral interleaving between the different water masses. Although the interleaving structures are most prominent at frontal zones, they appear t...|$|R

The future state of the Arctic is likely to be linked to <b>vertical</b> heat <b>transport</b> by microscale processes, specifically, double-diffusive convection. A series of realistic three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) were conducted to assess the <b>vertical</b> heat <b>transport</b> through thermohaline staircases in the Arctic region. Results revealed that vertical fluxes exceeded those of extant four-thirds flux laws by as much as a factor of two, and suggest that the 4 / 3 exponent requires downward revision. Results also showed that two-dimensional DNS can provide an accurate approximation of heat fluxes when the density ratio is sufficiently large. DNS results also reveal that the models with rigid boundaries result in heat flux estimates that are lower than those from models with periodic boundary conditions. Finally, the DNS-derived flux law was applied to Arctic data and results supported the conclusion that lab-derived flux laws significantly underestimate heat flux. All of these results suggest that <b>vertical</b> heat <b>transport</b> due to double-diffusive convection is a significant contributor to the measured reduction of Arctic sea-ice.

Charge transport {{is one of}} the key properties which defines the performance of conjugated polymers in electronic devices. This work aims to explore the charge transport anisotropy in thin films of P 3 HT, one of the most common conjugated polymers. Using X-ray diffraction techniques and charge transport measurements, the relation between <b>vertical</b> charge <b>transport</b> through thin P 3 HT films and structure of the films was established. It was shown that particular orientations of crystalline domains of P 3 HT, namely face-on and chain-on, are beneficial for <b>vertical</b> charge <b>transport.</b> These orientations provide the efficient pathways for the charges to be transported vertically, either via π-π stacking interaction between the adjacent conjugated chains, or via the conjugated chain backbones. It was also demonstrated that particular orientations of crystallites are favourable for the formation of interconnected percolated pathways providing enhanced <b>vertical</b> charge <b>transport</b> across the film. Deposition of P 3 HT on most commonly used silicon substrates typically results in the formation of mostly edge-on orientation of crystallites which is unfavourable for <b>vertical</b> charge <b>transport.</b> Nanoimprint lithography was demonstrated as a powerful processing method for reorienting the edge-on crystalline domains of P 3 HT into chain-on (vertical) orientation. It is also shown that thin P 3 HT films with preferentially face-on orientations of crystallites can be deposited on graphene surface by spin coating. Using patterning of thin P 3 HT films by nanoimprint lithography, unprecedentedly high average vertical mobilities in the range of 3. 1 - 10. 6 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 were achieved in undoped P 3 HT. These results demonstrate that charge transport in thin films of a relatively simple and well-known conjugated polymer P 3 HT can be significantly improved using optimization of crystallinity,orientation of crystallites, polymer chain orientation and alignment in the films...|$|R
