25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, it was {{hypothesized}} that autism can be caused or aggravated by opioid peptides like casomorphine that are metabolic products of gluten and casein. Based on this hypothesis, diets that eliminate foods containing either gluten or casein, or both, are widely promoted, and many testimonials can be found describing benefits in autism-related symptoms, notably social engagement and <b>verbal</b> <b>skills.</b> Studies supporting these claims have had significant flaws, so these data are inadequate to guide treatment recommendations.|$|E
40|$|Children’s {{development}} of <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> (i. e, counting abilities {{and knowledge of}} the number names) presents a milestone in mathematical development. Different factors such as visuo-spatial and verbal abilities have been discussed to contribute to the {{development of}} these foundational skills. To understand the cognitive nature of <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> in young children, the present study assessed the relation of preschoolers’ verbal and visuo-spatial abilities to their <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills.</b> In total, 141 children aged between five and six years participated in the present study. <b>Verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> were regressed on vocabulary, phonological awareness and visuo-spatial abilities, as well as verbal and visuo-spatial working memory in a structural equation model. Only visuo-spatial abilities emerged as a significant predictor of <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> in the estimated model. Our results suggest that visuo-spatial abilities contribute to a larger extent to children’s <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> than <b>verbal</b> abilities. From a theoretical point of view, these results suggest a visuo-spatial, rather than a verbal, grounding of <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills.</b> These results are potentially informative for the conception of early mathematics assessments and interventions...|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills,</b> {{as defined by}} the meaningful use of number words, marks a milestone in numerical development. In the present study, we were particularly interested in the question, whether <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> are primarily <b>verbal</b> in nature, or if they call upon visuo-spatial processes, reflecting a spatial grounding of <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills.</b> 141 five- to six-year old children were tested on a range of verbal (i. e. vocabulary, phonological awareness and verbal working memory) and visuo-spatial abilities (i. e. spatial perception, visuo-motor integration and visuo-spatial working memory). We were particularly interested in the predictive role of these abilities for children’s <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> (as measured by different counting and number naming tasks). In a latent regression model, basic visuo-spatial abilities, measured by spatial perception and visuo-motor integration, emerge as the most important predictor of <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills.</b> This gives raise to the assumption, that <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> are, despite their verbal nature, spatially grounded in young children...|$|R
40|$|<b>Verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> (i. e. {{counting}} {{and number}} naming) are milestones in numerical development. The {{aim of the}} present study was to clarify the role of different verbal abilities (VA) and visuo-spatial abilities (VSA) in the development of these <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> in kindergarten. We recruited 152 children (mean age: 5. 8 years) and administered different measures of VA (e. g. phonological awareness, pseudoword recall) and of VSA (e. g. spatial perception, copying) to assess their contribution to <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills.</b> Firstly, we computed two independent regression models, a “VA only” model explaining 23 % of variance, and a “VSA only” model explaining 38 % of variance. Adding verbal measures to the “VSA only” model does not lead to a significant increase in R 2. Our results show that VSA, rather than VA, contribute to a larger extent to children’s <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills.</b> Intriguingly, the development of <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> builds on VA, but more importantly on VSA. These results are potentially informative for the conception early mathematics interventions...|$|R

[...] Unlike the motor task, enhancement was not suppressed during the nocturnal sleep if the individual had napped earlier. [...] In the situation of visual skill learning, naps have been shown to prevent wakeful deterioration and even enhance learning above and beyond enhancement occurring in nocturnal sleep.|$|E

40|$|Previous neuropsychiatric {{studies suggest}} a {{relationship}} between reading disability and cognitive impulsivity. This relationship is not entirely explained by the high comorbidity between reading disability and {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD), as children with a co-occurrence of these disorders tend to be more impulsive than those with ADHD only. Other research has demonstrated that poor <b>verbal</b> <b>skill</b> (irrespective of the presence of dyslexia) deficits in executive functions and impulsivity are important risk factors for criminal behaviour. The present study bridges these two research traditions by examining whether patients undergoing forensic psychiatric investigation who also have dyslexia, have a cognitive style characterized by impulsivity. Male forensic patients (mean age 27 [*]years, range 16 – 35) with (n[*]=[*] 9) and without (n[*]=[*] 13) dyslexia were evaluated on the computerized EuroCog test battery. The findings suggest that patients with dyslexia tend to use a cognitive impulsive style and suggest a more direct link between dyslexia and cognitive impulsivity that is not mediated by the presence of ADHD. In order to identify treatment needs and tailor treatment accordingly, forensic patients should be assessed with respect to poor <b>verbal</b> <b>skill,</b> dyslexia and impulsivity...|$|R

40|$|Deficits in {{lateralization}} {{have been}} reported in handedness, language and anatomical asymmetry in schizophrenia, but the relationship between these anomalies has been unclear. Extending earlier work demonstrating that degrees of lateralization are related to verbal ability in the general population, we here investigate the relationship in children who later developed psychosis. Using data from a box-marking test and an index of receptive verbal ability in the UK National Child Development study, we constructed three-dimensional plots of verbal ability in relation to left- and right-hand skill at the age of 11 years, and compared the performance of 34 children who by age 28 had developed schizophrenia and 21 who had developed affective psychosis with 12, 782 in the total population. In the total population, <b>verbal</b> <b>skill</b> is decreased in those who are close to the L=R line. Children premorbid for schizophrenia are less lateralized and their <b>verbal</b> <b>skill</b> is lower than predicted by their hand skill, with a similar trend in children premorbid for affective psychosis. Thus pre-psychotic children deviate from the general population in the trajectory of lateralization of words. The findings are consistent with the concept that in psychosis at some critical stage in development there is a failure of lateralization of the components of language...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo {{important}} {{foundations for}} learning are language and executive skills. Data from {{a longitudinal study}} tracking the development of 93 children at family-risk of dyslexia and 76 controls was used to investigate the influence of these skills {{on the development of}} arithmetic. A two-group longitudinal path model assessed the relationships between language and executive skills at 3 – 4 years, <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills</b> (counting and number knowledge) and phonological processing skills at 4 – 5 years, and written arithmetic in primary school. The same cognitive processes accounted for variability in arithmetic skills in both groups. Early language and executive skills predicted variations in preschool <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills,</b> which in turn, predicted arithmetic skills in school. In contrast, phonological awareness was not a predictor of later arithmetic skills. These results suggest that verbal and executive processes provide the foundation for <b>verbal</b> number <b>skills,</b> which in turn influence the development of formal arithmetic skills. Problems in early language development may explain the comorbidity between reading and mathematics disorder...|$|R
