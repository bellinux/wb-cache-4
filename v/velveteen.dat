5|$|Dinklage had {{his first}} {{theatrical}} success in a fifth-grade production of The <b>Velveteen</b> Rabbit. Playing the lead, he was delighted by the audience's response to the show. Dinklage attended Delbarton School, a Catholic preparatory school for boys, where he developed his acting. In 1984, Dinklage {{was inspired by a}} production of the play True West, written by American playwright Sam Shepard, to pursue a career in acting.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{relatively}} small variety of coats {{in relation to the}} number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; <b>velveteen,</b> a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of it, such as hairless rats.|$|E

25|$|In {{other respects}} too, Stevenson was {{moving away from}} his upbringing. His dress became more Bohemian; he already wore his hair long, but he now took to wearing a <b>velveteen</b> jacket and rarely {{attended}} parties in conventional evening dress. Within the limits of a strict allowance, he visited cheap pubs and brothels. More importantly, {{he had come to}} reject Christianity and declared himself an atheist.|$|E
60|$|So, we {{stop at the}} Dazio, the town's customs hut, and <b>velveteens</b> has to pay {{for some}} meat and cheese he is {{bringing}} in. After which we slip into the cold high-street of Nuoro.

25|$|Undergraduates at {{many older}} {{universities}} also wear gowns; {{the most common}} essentially a smaller knee-length version of the BA gown, or the Oxford Commoners gown which is sleeveless lay type gown and has two streamers at the back at Oxford. At Cambridge, most colleges have their own distinctive design of gown. This {{is not the case}} at the Ancient Scottish universities, such as the University of St Andrews, where the undergraduate gown is scarlet and typically features a <b>velveteen</b> collar. Undergraduate gowns are seldom worn (even in institutions that prescribe them) nowadays except in the older universities. Most new universities do not prescribe them since academic dress has fallen out of daily use so students would hardly, if ever, wear them.|$|E
500|$|Born in Morristown, New Jersey, {{and raised}} in Brookside, Dinklage is a dwarf (achondroplasia) and stands [...] tall. He began acting {{as a child in}} a fifth-grade {{production}} of The <b>Velveteen</b> Rabbit. He studied acting at Bennington College, starring in a number of amateur stage productions. His film debut was in Living in Oblivion (1995) and his breakthrough came with the comedy-drama The Station Agent (2003). He has since appeared in such films as the comedy Elf (2003), the crime film Find Me Guilty (2006), the superhero comedy Underdog (2007), the fantasy film [...] (2008), the superhero film [...] (2014), and the acclaimed black comedy film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017).|$|E
500|$|John Calvert of The Quietus {{described}} [...] "Thinkin Bout You" [...] as a [...] "slow-release torch song {{the colour}} of caramel and bathed in low voltage lighting, a buzzing but soothing synth cycle and muffled beats evoke touching and kissing in a <b>velveteen</b> womb. Poised, considered, classy and moving, this is uniquely Frank Ocean." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune {{stated that the}} track [...] "couldn’t be any less auspicious as an opening song, {{little more than a}} delicate, yearning falsetto vocal over vaporous keyboards and a muffled rhythm track." [...] Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen described the song as [...] "woozy", featuring Ocean's [...] "falsetto rippling over murmuring electronic percussion". She stated that [...] "it's a bisexual black bohemian New Orleanian-turned-Angeleno's avant-R torch ballad. And, of course, it's just a love song – an anthem for anyone, anywhere, who's found love, and lost it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Damn brute!" [...] I ejaculated, {{bruising}} my knuckles {{against the}} fellow's jaw. Then I too found myself sitting dazedly on the grass, watching the great skirts of his <b>velveteens</b> flinging round {{him as if}} he had been a demon, as he strode away. I got up, pressing my chest where I had been struck. George was lying in the hedge-bottom. I turned him over, and rubbed his temples, and shook the drenched grass on his face. He opened his eyes and looked at me, dazed. Then he drew his breath quickly, and put his hand to his head.|$|R
60|$|In great dolor at this unhappy repulse, Israel trudged {{on in the}} {{moonlight}} some three miles {{to the house of}} another friend, who also had once succored him in extremity. This man proved a very sound sleeper. Instead of succeeding in rousing him by his knocking, Israel but succeeded in rousing his wife, a person not of the greatest amiability. Raising the sash, and seeing so shocking a pauper before her, the woman upbraided him with shameless impropriety in asking charity at dead of night, in a dress so improper too. Looking down at his deplorable <b>velveteens,</b> Israel discovered that his extensive travels had produced a great rent in one loin of the rotten old breeches, through which a whitish fragment protruded.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{would have}} retreated, in the panic {{terror of the}} moment; but Esther kept a bright {{look-out}} when her lover was expected. In a twinkling she was by his side, brimful of news and pleasure, too glad to notice his embarrassment, {{and in one of}} those golden transports of exultation which transcend not only words but caresses. She took him {{by the end of the}} fingers (reaching forward to take them, for her great preoccupation was to save time), she drew him towards her, pushed him past her in the door, and planted him face to face with Mr. Van Tromp, in a suit of French country <b>velveteens</b> and with a remarkable carbuncle on his nose. Then, as though this was the end of what she could endure in the way of joy, Esther turned and ran out of the room.|$|R
500|$|Keenan is {{featured}} in several segments of Mr. Show, {{most notably in}} the Ronnie Dobbs sketch presented in the first season. In one scene, he is seen being arrested with Dobbs. Later in the sketch he {{is featured}} wearing a wig as the lead singer of the then-fictitious band [...] "Puscifer". When asked about the arrest of Dobbs, Keenan replies [...] "Guilty? Yeah. I'm sure he's guilty but... he knows it. I mean, you're guilty, and you don't know it. So... who's really in jail?" [...] He also appears in episode 2.6, [...] "The <b>Velveteen</b> Touch of a Dandy Fop", {{as one of the}} viewers of Coupon: The Movie, saying [...] "Now is not the time", waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater. Later, Keenan would sing on a track for the Mr. Show incarnation Run Ronnie Run, and appear in the [...] "music video sex scene" [...] on its DVD. Keenan appeared {{on the cover of the}} May/June 1999 issue of Pop Smear magazine, portraying Charles Manson as part of a photo essay, imitating a famous Life magazine portrait. He also appeared as Satan in the 2002 film Bikini Bandits and its 2004 sequel Bikini Bandits 2: Golden Rod. When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, [...] "Oh, Manson. He's a real person. People know what he looks like, how he talked.

500|$|The Independent {{said that}} Insurrection [...] "never stops being familiarly jolly and antiquated", {{and called the}} entire Star Trek film {{franchise}} [...] "old-fashioned". The Washington Post also called the film old fashioned, but [...] "in the best sense of the word", {{and said that the}} film did what the [...] "doctor – make that Dr. 'Bones' McCoy – ordered". British journalist Simon Rose, writing for The Daily Mirror was more critical of the film, saying that it failed to break the odd-numbered Star Trek film curse, and that it was [...] "feeble", [...] "moribund" [...] and [...] "tedious". However, Josh Spiegel writing for The Buffalo News said that Insurrection broke the odd-numbered film rule. Further criticism came from the Birmingham Evening Mail, which said that it was [...] "an adult form of entertainment equivalent to Teletubbies for babies", and that there were [...] "lots of repetition, rubbery faces, gibberish dialogue, characters leaping up and down in funny suits and some very basic effects". The reviewer gave the film two stars for fans, and none for non-fans. In Folklore/Cinema: Popular Film as Vernacular Culture, the actions of Data and the Ba'ku child Artim in Insurrection are seen as [...] "a metamorphosis motif where a child becomes computerlike and a computer/android becomes more childlike". Data specifically [...] "is a metaphor for a child who seeks to understand what being human means and then, like the <b>velveteen</b> rabbit, wishes to become. From confronting his father and evil brother to finding his mother, Data also represents the potential within all of us to quest for a fuller humanity".|$|E

60|$|Wider and colder the {{landscape}} grew. As we topped a hill {{at the end}} of a village, we saw a long string of wagons, each with a pair of oxen, and laden with large sacks, curving upwards in the cold, pallid Sunday afternoon. Seeing us, the procession came to a standstill at the curve of the road, and the pale oxen, the pale low wagons, the pale full sacks, all in the blenched light, each one headed by a tall man in shirt-sleeves, trailing a static procession on the hill-side, seemed like a vision: like a Doré drawing. The bus slid past, the man holding the wagon-pole, while some oxen stood like rock, some swayed their horns. The q-b asked the <b>velveteener</b> what they were carrying. For a long time he took no notice of the question. Then he volunteered, in a snappy voice, that it was the government grain being distributed to the communes for bread. On Sunday afternoon too.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes {{the way is}} cut off by huge thorny hedges and fences of barbed wire--man's devilish {{improvement}} on the bramble--brought down to the water's edge. The river-follower must force his way through these obstacles, in most cases greatly {{to the detriment of}} his clothes and temper; or, should they prove impassable, he must undress and go into the water. Worst of all is the thought that he is a trespasser. The pheasants crow loudly lest he should forget it. Occasionally, too, in these private places he encounters men in <b>velveteens</b> with guns under their arms, and other men in tweeds and knickerbockers, with or without guns, and they all stare at him with amazement in their eyes, like disturbed cattle in a pasture; and sometimes they challenge him. But I must say that, although I have been sharply spoken to on several occasions, always, after a few words, I have been permitted to keep on my way. And on that way I intend to keep until I have no more strength to climb over fences and force my way through hedges, but like a blind and worn-out old badger must take to my earth and die.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Stevenson {{is not to}} be {{labelled}} novelist. He wanders the byways {{of literature}} without any fixed address. Too much of a truant to be classified with the other boys, he is only a writer of fiction {{in the sense that he}} was once an Edinburgh University student because now and again he looked in at his classes when he happened to be that way. A literary man without a fixed occupation amazes Mr. Henry James, a master in the school of fiction which tells, in three volumes, how Hiram K. Wilding trod on the skirt of Alice M. Sparkins without anything's coming of it. Mr. James analyzes Mr. Stevenson with immense cleverness, but without summing up. That [...] "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" [...] should be by the author of [...] "Treasure Island," [...] "Virginibus Puerisque" [...] by the author of [...] "The New Arabian Nights," [...] "A Child's Garden of Verses" [...] by the author of [...] "Prince Otto," [...] are to him the three degrees of comparison of wonder, though for my own part I marvel more that the author of [...] "Daisy Miller" [...] should be Mr. Stevenson's eulogist. One conceives Mr. James a boy in <b>velveteens</b> looking fearfully at Stevenson playing at pirates.|$|R

60|$|In {{front of}} him was a small hollow fringed with bushes. Collecting his {{strength}} he cleared these with a bound. Then another {{of the events of}} this eventful afternoon happened. Instead of the hard turf, his foot struck something soft, something which sat up suddenly with a yell. Barrett rolled down the slope and halfway up the other side like a shot rabbit. Dimly he recognized that he had jumped on to a human being. The figure did not wear the official <b>velveteens.</b> Therefore he had no business in the Dingle. And close behind thundered the keeper, now on his feet once more, dust on his clothes and wrath in his heart in equal proportions. 'Look out, man!' shouted Barrett, as the injured person rose to his feet. 'Run! Cut, quick! Keeper!' There was no time to say more. He ran. Another second and he was at the top, over the railing, and in the good, honest, public high-road again, safe. A hoarse shout of 'Got yer!' from below told a harrowing tale of capture. The stranger had fallen {{into the hands of the}} enemy. Very cautiously Barrett left the road and crept to the railing again. It was a rash thing to do, but curiosity overcame him. He had to see, or, if that was impossible, to hear what had happened.|$|R
60|$|Though Mr. Robert Kennedy {{was lying}} dead at Loughlinter, and though Phineas Finn, {{a member of}} Parliament, was in prison, accused of murdering another member of Parliament, still the world went on with its old ways, down in the {{neighbourhood}} of Harrington Hall and Spoon Hall as at other places. The hunting with the Brake hounds was now over for the season,--had indeed been brought to an auspicious end three weeks since,--and such gentlemen as Thomas Spooner had {{time on their hands}} to look about their other concerns. When a man hunts five days a week, regardless of distances, and devotes a due proportion of his energies to the necessary circumstances of hunting, the preservation of foxes, the maintenance of good humour with the farmers, the proper compensation for poultry really killed by four-legged favourites, the growth and arrangement of coverts, the lying-in of vixens, and the subsequent guardianship of nurseries, the persecution of enemies, and the warm protection of friends,--when he follows the sport, accomplishing all the concomitant duties of a true sportsman, he has not much time left for anything. Such a one as Mr. Spooner of Spoon Hall finds that his off day is occupied from breakfast to dinner with grooms, keepers, old women with turkeys' heads, and gentlemen in <b>velveteens</b> with information about wires and unknown earths, His letters fall naturally to the Sunday afternoon, and are hardly written before sleep overpowers him. Many a large fortune has been made with less of true devotion to the work than is given to hunting by so genuine a sportsman as Mr. Spooner.|$|R
60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} was a little chimney-sweep, and his name was Tom. That is a short name, and you have heard it before, so you will not have much trouble in remembering it. He lived in a great town in the North country, where there were plenty of {{chimneys}} to sweep, and plenty of money for Tom to earn and his master to spend. He could not read nor write, and did not care to do either; and he never washed himself, for there was no water up the court where he lived. He had never been taught to say his prayers. He never had heard of God, or of Christ, except in words which you never have heard, and which it would have been well if he had never heard. He cried half his time, and laughed the other half. He cried when he had to climb the dark flues, rubbing his poor knees and elbows raw; and when the soot got into his eyes, which it did every day in the week; and when his master beat him, which he did every day in the week; and when he had not enough to eat, which happened every day in the week likewise. And he laughed {{the other half of the}} day, when he was tossing halfpennies with the other boys, or playing leap-frog over the posts, or bowling stones at the horses' legs as they trotted by, which last was excellent fun, when there was a wall at hand behind which to hide. As for chimney-sweeping, and being hungry, and being beaten, he took all that for the way of the world, like the rain and snow and thunder, and stood manfully with his back to it till it was over, as his old donkey did to a hail- storm; and then shook his ears and was as jolly as ever; and thought of the fine times coming, when he would be a man, and a master sweep, and sit in the public-house with a quart of beer and a long pipe, and play cards for silver money, and wear <b>velveteens</b> and ankle-jacks, and keep a white bull-dog with one gray ear, and carry her puppies in his pocket, just like a man. And he would have apprentices, one, two, three, if he could. How he would bully them, and knock them about, just as his master did to him; and make them carry home the soot sacks, while he rode before them on his donkey, with a pipe in his mouth and a flower in his button-hole, like a king at the head of his army. Yes, there were good times coming; and, when his master let him have a pull at the leavings of his beer, Tom was the jolliest boy in the whole town.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Velveteen</b> Rabbit or How Toys Become Real was Margery Williams Bianco's first American work, and {{it remains}} her most famous. It has {{remained}} a classic piece of literature through numerous adaptations in children's theatre {{as well as on}} radio, television and in the movies. The author's trademark undercurrents of sentimentality and sadness persist in the tale of a small boy who finds a <b>velveteen</b> rabbit in his Christmas stocking. The boy quickly discards the toy after playing with it for a few hours in the bustle of Christmas and relatives. [...] In the nursery the rabbit is looked down on by the fancier wind up toys. He asks the skin horse, [...] "What is Real?" [...] The skin horse tells him, [...] "When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real." [...] The boy comes to adore the rabbit, and they are constant companions. This happy existence continues until the boy contracts scarlet fever. [...] The rabbit stays with him, whispering to him of the games they will play again when he is better. [...] As the boy gets better his family prepares {{to take him to the}} seaside. Although the rabbit looks forward to the seaside very much, the doctor insists he be thrown out and burned along with the other toys that may be infected. While the rabbit is waiting to be burned, he cries a real tear, from which a fairy emerges. The fairy tells the rabbit that he was real to the boy, because the boy loved him, but now she will make him truly real. [...] Later, the boy sees a real rabbit in the garden. [...] He thinks it looks like his old rabbit, but he does not know that it really is the <b>velveteen</b> rabbit he once loved.|$|E

Therefore, all her sons come before her on the Strand in London, leaving half the kingdom depopulated, for she summons both dull writers, their booksellers, and all who are stupid enough to patronise dull writers.|$|E

[...] The opening of the hood is trimmed in velvet or <b>velveteen.</b> [...] In most American colleges and universities, the colour of the velvet hood trimming is distinctive of the academic field – or as closely related as possible – to which the degree earned pertains (see Inter-Collegiate colors). [...] Many institutions, particularly larger ones, have dispensed with the bachelor's hood at commencement ceremonies altogether, though a graduate is still entitled to wear one once the degree is conferred.|$|E

The D/L wagon featured exterior woodgrain trim and reclining seats in a leather-like perforated vinyl.

2500|$|Pitchfork stated [...] "T.I. {{has always}} been a great rapper, warm and fluid and confident, his loose elastic voice winding under tracks with force and finesse. Before every other {{mainstream}} rapper was talking about drugs, he was doing it with a weary lived-in authority, proudly defiant and sheepishly defensive at the same time, bragging about getting money but lamenting the fact that he only had one way to do it. But great rappers don't always make great albums, and every one of T.I.'s previous full-lengths had a fatal flaw: desperate grabs at radio love, grossly insincere sex-jams, cobbled-together non-cohesion, or all three. Last summer, I thought Young Jeezy's [...] (2005) was the album T.I. should've made. Young Jeezy isn't half the rapper that T.I. is, but his album-- stunning in its focus and monolithic swagger and deeply nihilistic in worldview-- had more cinematic sweep than anything his progenitor had ever done." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters described the album as a stunning classic saying that [...] "Clifford “T.I.” Harris is one of America’s greatest songwriters. I’m not just talking about hip-hop, either—even if you add in all the other genres that people go all gaga over, T.I. strides this narrow world like a colossus. No one is smarter, no one constructs tighter songs, and no one has more ways to score. This is proven over and over again on King. T.I. is the whole package: gritty, smooth, smart, dangerous, introspective, and wise. And while it’s pretty early in 2006 to talk about albums of the year, this record says it’s time to start talking." [...] Stylus Magazine noted [...] "T.I.’s path to a self-made mythology hinges not just on his ability to trumpet himself, but to make his locale and history vital. King, T.I.’s latest, proves, among other things, that his legacy is tied into his town, and his town, Atlanta, is the true Southern metropolis: primal, spiritual, refined, and delicate at the same time. New Orleans may have the painful religious symbolism, Memphis the working-class spirit, and Houston the expansive, halting sound, but Atlanta is the melting pot of bourgeoisie, aristocracy, and neighborhood hustlers. Lil Wayne may be the chaperone of this coast, but T.I. is the CFO. Song to song production is generally top-shelf. From barn-burning “Top Back” to the slyly tender “Gone,” every chime chimes when it’s supposed to, every snare clacks right into place. Individually, Grand Hustle in-house rising star Toomp gobbles up the lion’s share of the praise: the cataclysmic “What You Know” and ostentatious “Bankhead” both soar. Mannie Fresh and Just Blaze inlay T.I.’s lines with <b>velveteen</b> strings and swirling drums respectively. King isn’t complacent enough to act like all the wars are fought and all the gods are dead; T.I. sees his legacy and city very much up for grabs. A city, a scene and his legacy are unfinished, and while King won’t be T.I.’s last, or, hopefully, best section of his mosaic, it’s the perfection of his aesthetic thus far." ...|$|E
