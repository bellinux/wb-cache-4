5000|$|Most {{motor oils}} {{are made from}} a heavier, thicker {{petroleum}} hydrocarbon base stock derived from crude oil, with additives to improve certain properties. The bulk of a typical motor oil consists of hydrocarbons with between 18 and 34 carbon atoms per molecule. One {{of the most important}} properties of motor oil in maintaining a lubricating film between moving parts is its viscosity. The viscosity of a liquid {{can be thought of as}} its [...] "thickness" [...] or a measure of its resistance to flow. The viscosity must be high enough to maintain a lubricating film, but low enough that the oil can flow around the engine parts under all conditions. The <b>viscosity</b> <b>index</b> is a measure of how much the oil's viscosity changes as temperature changes. A higher <b>viscosity</b> <b>index</b> indicates the viscosity changes less with temperature than a lower <b>viscosity</b> <b>index.</b>|$|E

The purpose of this work was to utilize commercially available palm oil and Jatropha oil {{for the production of}} biolubricants, through two stages of Transesterification. The first stage is the process of using methanol in the presence of potassium hydroxide to produce biodiesel. The second stage is the reaction of biodiesel with trimethylolpropane using sodium methoxide as catalyst to yield palm or Jatropha oil base trimethylolpropane esters (biolubricants). Palm oil based trimethylolpropane esters with yield of 97. 8 % was obtained after 4 h of reaction at 130 °C. Under similar reaction conditions, Jatropha oil based trimethylolpropane esters with a yield of 98. 2 % was obtained. The resulting products were confirmed by FTIR and evaluated by ASTM analyses. The obtained Jatropha oil based trimethylolpropane esters exhibited high <b>viscosity</b> <b>indices</b> (140), low pour point temperature (− 3 °C), and moderate thermal stabilities and met the requirement of commercial industrial oil ISO VG 46 grade.
