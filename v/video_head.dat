50|$|The {{original}} VHS specification {{had only}} two <b>video</b> <b>heads.</b> Later models implemented {{at least one more}} pair of heads, which were used at (and optimized for) the EP tape speed. In machines supporting VHS HiFi (described later), yet another pair of heads was added to handle the VHS HiFi signal.|$|R

50|$|Together with Betacam SX, Sony {{introduced}} {{a generation of}} hybrid recorder, allowing use of both tape and disk recording on the same deck, and high speed dubbing from one to another. This was intended to save wear on the <b>video</b> <b>heads</b> for television studio applications, as well to speed up online editing.|$|R
5000|$|Because video signals have a {{very high}} bandwidth, and {{stationary}} heads would require extremely high tape speeds, in most cases, a helical-scan <b>video</b> <b>head</b> rotates against the moving tape to record the data in two dimensions.|$|E

5000|$|U-matic {{was named}} after {{the shape of the}} tape path when it was {{threaded}} around the helical scan <b>video</b> <b>head</b> drum, which resembled the letter U. Betamax used a similar type of [...] "B-load" [...] as well. Recording time was limited to one hour.|$|E

5000|$|Although Philips and Grundig {{agreed on}} a common tape format, {{they came up with}} {{machines}} that were radically different mechanically. Building on its experience with VCR, Grundig machines featured a Betamax-style loading ring to gently pull the tape around the <b>video</b> <b>heads</b> in a 'U-wrap' over all three generations of their recorders, which was effective, simple and economical.|$|R
50|$|Although Quad {{became the}} {{industry}} standard for approximately thirty years, it has drawbacks such as an inability to freeze pictures, and no picture search. Also, in early machines, a tape could reliably be played back using only {{the same set of}} hand-made tape heads, which wore out very quickly. Despite these problems, Quad is capable of producing excellent images. Subsequent videotape systems have used helical scan, where the <b>video</b> <b>heads</b> record diagonal tracks (of complete fields) onto the tape.|$|R
50|$|The dew sensor {{itself is}} mounted {{very close to}} the <b>video</b> <b>head</b> drum. Contrary to how one might expect this to behave, the sensor {{increases}} its resistance when moisture is present. Poor contacts on the sensor can therefore be a cause of random dew sensor warnings.|$|E
50|$|Anabolic and Diabolic were {{originally}} headquartered in Venice, California for 10 years. Diabolic was founded {{as a separate}} label in 1998 by Gregg Allan, and Anabolic <b>Video</b> <b>head</b> Christopher Alexander. Alan had previously run the two companies sales department for 15 years, starting in 1992. On January 15, 1998, Diabolic Video released its first video.|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{the tape}} is passed {{longitudinally}} through two fixed erase heads, one located just before the tape moves to the <b>video</b> <b>head</b> drum and the other {{right next to the}} audio/control head stack. Upon recording, the erase heads erase any old recording contained on the tape to prevent anything already recorded on it from interfering with what is being recorded.|$|E
50|$|Peep Search (or BetaSkipScan) is feature {{available}} on many videocassette recorders and most camcorders, whereby the unit {{can show you}} {{what is on the}} tape during rewind and fast forward operations. For this feature to work seamlessly, the tape must be fully laced up (wrapped around the <b>video</b> <b>heads)</b> during rewind and fast-forward operation, which is not usually supported on VHS decks and therefore makes VHS almost the only video tape format where peep search is not usually available.|$|R

50|$|Soon after, {{there was}} yet another major lineup change. Jan Rubach and Thomas Nack both left in order to return to Anesthesia and in came new drummer Dan Zimmermann. Zimmerman is also known for being a {{founding}} member of the German power metal band Freedom Call. Schlächter, who was originally a bass player, as can be seen on the 1990 <b>video</b> <b>Heading</b> for the East, left the second guitar spot and took back his original instrument, being replaced on guitar by Henjo Richter.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} poppers. Nitrites include amyl, butyl, methyl, isopropol, isobutal, ethyl, alkyl and the newer [...] "US" [...] formula {{containing}} cyclohexyl nitrite (the only nitrite to not currently require a prescription). Originally used as anti-anginal heart medication to {{lower blood pressure}} and even {{as an antidote to}} cyanide poisoning. Products are advertised as odorisers, leather cleaner and <b>video</b> <b>head</b> cleaner.|$|E
50|$|On March 14, 1961, Ampex {{introduced}} the first helical scan video recorder, the VR-8000, which recorded video using helical scan recording technology on 2-inch tape. The VR-8000 was made using a similar chassis used by Ampex's 2-inch quadruplex VTRs. Unlike the VR-660, it used only one <b>video</b> <b>head</b> on the scanner {{with a full}} alpha wrap. The first unit was working in January 1961.|$|E
5000|$|Every {{videotape}} {{system was}} designed to put as much video as possible onto a given-sized tape, but information from one recording track (pass of the <b>video</b> <b>head)</b> must not interfere with information on adjacent stripes. Using slant azimuth recording, the need for guard bands, that is the blank space between tracks, is eliminated, allowing more recording {{to be placed on}} a given length of tape.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{erase head}} erases the old signal {{right before the}} <b>video</b> <b>heads</b> write onto the tape, there is no remnant of the old signal to cause visible {{distortion}} at and after the moment a cut is made, resulting in a clean edit. In addition, the ability of flying erase heads to erase old video off the tape right before recording new video on it allows the ability to perform insert editing, where new footage can be placed within an existing recording with clean cuts {{at the beginning and}} end of the edit.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{if not a}} cover exactly, {{the first}} notes of the song are {{featured}} in the <b>video</b> game <b>Head</b> over Heels (<b>video</b> game) for ZX Spectrum and MSX computers.|$|R
5000|$|The format {{was called}} [...] "M" [...] {{due to the}} shape of the {{threading}} path of the tape around the helical scan <b>video</b> <b>head</b> drum, which resembles a letter M. (This is also how the U-matic format got its name, for its U-shaped tape path in the VCR.) VHS also uses the same M-shaped tape threading path as M; it was carried over to M from VHS.|$|E
50|$|The video {{cassette}} recorder {{is sensitive to}} changes in temperature and humidity. If the machine (or tape) was moved from a cold to a hotter environment there could be condensation of moisture on the internal parts, such as the rotating <b>video</b> <b>head</b> drum. Some later models were equipped with a moisture detector which would prevent operation in this case, but it could not detect moisture {{on the surface of}} a tape.|$|E
50|$|The <b>video</b> <b>head</b> drum {{itself of}} a VX machine {{also has the}} unique {{distinction}} of being completely removable and replaceable without any special tools or equipment. The drum has a knurled nut on top, which can be adjusted by hand, allowing the drum {{to be removed from}} the deck for cleaning or replacement. To this date, the VX machines have been the only VCR designed with this feature.|$|E
50|$|A {{research}} {{undertaken by}} Sony claimed {{that there was}} no hard evidence of the above statement. The only evidence claimed was that using ME tapes in equipment designed for MP tapes can cause tape damage and hence dropouts. Sony has done a significant amount of internal testing to simulate head clogs as a result of mixing tape lubricants, and has been unable to recreate the problem. Sony recommends using cleaning cassettes once every 50 hours of recording or playback. For those who are still skeptical, Sony recommends cleaning <b>video</b> <b>heads</b> with a cleaning cassette before trying another brand of tape.|$|R
50|$|After {{another month}} of {{repairing}} and replacing parts, testing and tuning mechanisms, the project {{got the first}} solid result that the tapes were good. Each tape starts with a short standard-format audio clip of the operator, and the tape drives were {{able to read the}} audio signal. (Hear a sample of the audio.) This does not use the <b>video</b> <b>heads</b> that are needed to read the Lunar Orbiter data off the tape, but this demonstrated that the tapes had not deteriorated and that many of the sub-systems of the tape drive were in good working order.|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} size of cameras, the VHS-C {{mechanism}} uses a two-thirds size head drum (41.3 mm diameter instead of the original VHS drum size of 62 mm). The wrap angle is 270 degrees instead of VHS's 180 degrees. The drum rotates at a proportionately higher speed, and four rotary <b>video</b> <b>heads</b> are used to trace out exactly the same helical recording path as a standard sized VHS drum.By adding more heads, the same small VHS-C drum can record and playback FM Hi-Fi audio that is also fully compatible with a standard sized Hi-Fi video drum.|$|R
