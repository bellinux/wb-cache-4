5000|$|Once this {{material}} has been {{run through a}} <b>visbreaker</b> (and, again, there will be considerable variation from <b>visbreaker</b> to <b>visbreaker</b> as no two will operate under exactly the same conditions) the reduction in viscosity is dramatic: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{severity}} of <b>visbreaker</b> operation is normally {{limited by the}} need to produce a <b>visbreaker</b> tar that can be blended to make a stable fuel oil.|$|E
5000|$|Vacuum residue fed to a <b>visbreaker</b> can be {{considered}} to be composed of the following: ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{refinery}} naphthas {{also contain}} some olefinic hydrocarbons, such as naphthas {{derived from the}} fluid catalytic cracking, <b>visbreakers</b> and coking processes used in many refineries. Those olefin-containing naphthas are {{often referred to as}} cracked naphthas.|$|R
50|$|Prior to World War II in {{the early}} 1940s, most {{petroleum}} refineries in the United States consisted simply of crude oil distillation units (often referred to as atmospheric crude oil distillation units). Some refineries also had vacuum distillation units as well as thermal cracking units such as <b>visbreakers</b> (viscosity breakers, units to lower the viscosity of the oil). All of the many other refining processes discussed below were developed during the war or {{within a few years}} after the war. They became commercially available within 5 to 10 years after the war ended and the worldwide petroleum industry experienced very rapid growth. The driving force for that growth in technology and in the number and size of refineries worldwide was the growing demand for automotive gasoline and aircraft fuel.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} work during this {{reporting}} period was {{the construction of}} an automated probe that will be used to measure the thickness of coke deposits in thermal cracking furnaces. A discovery was made during the last reporting period, which indicated that a conventional NDE broadband transducer could be used in conjunction with a sacrificial standoff composed of a fusible alloy to efficiently couple the transducer to a rough surface operating at high temperature. A probe was constructed that incorporates the recent discovery and initial testing of the probe is now underway. Successful development of the coke detector will provide industry with the only available method for on-line measurement of coke deposits. The coke detector will have numerous uses in the refining and petrochemical sectors including monitoring of <b>visbreakers,</b> hydrotreaters, delayed coking units, vacuum tower heaters, and various other heavy oil heating applications where coke formation is a problem...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Visbreaker</b> unit {{upgrades}} heavy residual oils {{from the}} vacuum distillation unit by thermally cracking them into lighter, more valuable reduced viscosity products.|$|E
50|$|<b>Visbreaker</b> tar can {{be further}} refined by feeding it to a vacuum fractionator. Here {{additional}} heavy gas oil may be recovered and routed either to catalytic cracking, hydrocracking or thermal cracking units on the refinery. The vacuum-flashed tar (sometimes referred to as pitch) is then routed to fuel oil blending. In a few refinery locations, <b>visbreaker</b> tar is routed to a delayed coker {{for the production of}} certain specialist cokes such as anode coke or needle coke.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, a fluid {{catalytic}} cracker, an alkylation unit, a <b>visbreaker,</b> and an MTBE (Methyl tert-butyl ether) unit (for high octane petrol) were added.|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{the project}} is to {{demonstrate}} the performance and practical use of a laser ultrasonic probe for measuring the thickness of coke deposits located within the high temperature tubes of a thermal cracking furnace. This aim will be met by constructing an optical probe that will be tested using simulated coke deposits that are positioned inside of a bench-scale furnace. Successful development of the optical coke detector will provide industry with the only available method for on-line measurement of coke deposits. The optical coke detector will have numerous uses in the refining and petrochemical sectors including monitoring of <b>visbreakers,</b> hydrotreaters, delayed coking units, vacuum tower heaters, and various other heavy oil heating applications where coke formation is a problem. The coke detector will particularly benefit the olefins industry where high temperature thermal crackers are used to produce ethylene, propylene, butylene and other important olefin intermediates. The ethylene industry requires development of an on-line method for gauging the thickness of coke deposits in cracking furnaces because the current lack of detailed knowledge of coke deposition profiles introduces the single greatest uncertainty in the simulation and control of modern cracking furnaces. The laser ultrasonic coke detector will provide operators with valuable new information allowing them to better optimize the decoking turnaround schedule and therefore maximize production capacity...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>visbreaker</b> is a {{processing}} unit in an oil refinery whose {{purpose is to}} reduce the quantity of residual oil produced in the distillation of crude oil and to increase the yield of more valuable middle distillates (heating oil and diesel) by the refinery. A <b>visbreaker</b> thermally cracks large hydrocarbon molecules in the oil by heating in a furnace to reduce its viscosity and to produce small quantities of light hydrocarbons (LPG and gasoline). The process name of [...] "visbreaker" [...] refers {{to the fact that the}} process reduces (i.e., breaks) the viscosity of the residual oil. The process is non-catalytic.|$|E
50|$|The PONA {{number is}} an index for oil components. It {{is used to}} {{determine}} the paraffins (P), olefins (O), naphthenes (N) and aromatics content of FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) and coker (<b>visbreaker)</b> gasoline.|$|E
50|$|The Crude Refining Unit is {{a complex}} {{refinery}} with hydrocracker and <b>visbreaker</b> units, capable of converting fuel oil into middle distillates. This unit refines crude oil into products, which may include reformate for delivery to aromatics complex. It has a capacity of 145,000 barrels/day.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quality of}} the feed going into a <b>visbreaker</b> will vary {{considerably}} {{with the type of}} crude oil that the refinery is processing. The following is a typical quality for the vacuum distillation residue of Arabian light (a crude oil from Saudi Arabia and widely refined around the world): ...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to crude and vacuum distillation units, the major refining units are catalytic reforming unit, once-through Hydrocracker unit, Resid Fluidised Catalytic Cracking unit, <b>visbreaker</b> unit, delayed coking unit, bitumen blowing unit, hydrogen generation unit, sulphur block and associated auxiliary facilities. In {{order to produce}} low sulphur diesel, a Diesel Hydro Desulphurisation Unit (DHDS) was commissioned in 1999.|$|E
5000|$|Increase the {{proportion}} of middle distillates in the refinery output: Middle distillate {{is used as a}} diluent with residual oils to bring their viscosity down to a marketable level. By reducing the viscosity of the residual stream in a <b>visbreaker,</b> a fuel oil can be made using less diluent and the middle distillate saved can be diverted to higher value diesel or heating oil manufacture.|$|E
50|$|Atmospheric Fuel Oil is also fed to the Lubes Vacuum Unit. After {{a series}} of {{processes}} {{in order to improve}} properties of the lubricants, such as viscosity index, pour point, cloud point, the final base lubes are produced and stored. Additionally, asphalt can be produced from the Lubes vacuum unit, whereas the bottoms of both vacuum units are routed to the <b>visbreaker</b> for further upgrading and production of fuel oil.|$|E
5000|$|The {{yields of}} the various {{hydrocarbon}} products {{will depend on the}} [...] "severity" [...] of the cracking operation as determined by the temperature the oil is heated to in the <b>visbreaker</b> furnace. At {{the low end of the}} scale, a furnace heating to 425 °C would crack only mildly, while operations at 500 °C would be considered as very severe. Arabian light crude residue when visbroken at 450 °C would yield around 76% (by weight) of tar, 15% middle distillates, 6% gasolines and 3% gas and LPG.|$|E
5000|$|As middle {{distillates}} have a {{far higher}} {{value in the}} market place than fuel oils, {{it can be seen}} that the use of a <b>visbreaker</b> will considerably improve the economics of fuel oil manufacture. For example, if the cutter stock is taken to have a value of $300 per tonne and fuel oil $150 per ton (oil prices naturally change quickly, but these prices, and more importantly the differences between them, are not unrealistic), it is a simple matter to calculate the value of the different residues in this example as being: ...|$|E
50|$|Essar Oil {{reported}} {{commercial production}} of 10.5mtpa in May 2008.The units commissioned {{in the first}} phase were the CDU, VDU, sulphur gas unit, naphtha hydrotreater, catalytic cracker and <b>visbreaker.</b> The fluid catalytic cracker and a diesel hydro desulphuriser were commissioned in November 2006.The FCC and DHDS plants were modified so as to be compliant with the cleaner Euro III and Euro IV fuels. The refinery configuration lends itself well to de-bottlenecking and its capacity is enhanced to 14mtpa in 2009.The docking facilities include an SBM capable of handling vessels up to 350,000DWT with a capacity of 25mtpa, tankages with interconnecting pipelines of 20mtpa capacity, marine product dispatch capacity of 12mtpa and rail-car and truck-loading facilities.|$|E
50|$|The third 1 mmtpa {{distillation}} unit was commissioned in September 1967 to process Ankleshwar and North Gujarat crudes. In December 1968, Udex plant was commissioned for production of benzene and toluene using feedstock from CRU. By 1974-75 with in-house modifications, {{the capacity of}} the refinery increased by 40% to a level of 4.2 mmtpa. To process imported crude the refinery was expanded during 1978-79 by adding another 3 mmtpa crude {{distillation unit}} along with downstream processing units including vacuum distillation, <b>visbreaker</b> and bitumen blowing units. By 1980-81 this unit started processing Bombay High crude in addition to imported crudes. It {{was the first time that}} Indian engineers independently handled a project of that scale.|$|E

The Company operates in four segments: Oil and Gas, Buildings & Infrastructure and Power. Its {{oil and gas}} business includes pipelines, storage tanks and terminals including cryogenic tanks, and refineries. Punj Lloyd has successfully executed complex process plants including Hydrocracker Units on a turnkey basis, Hydrogen, Motor Spirit Quality Upgradation, Sulphur Blocks, <b>Visbreaker,</b> Crude and Vacuum Distillation for modernisation and expansion of refineries. The Buildings & Infrastructure and Power business of the Company comprises all elements of both urban and rural infrastructure creation including construction of roads and highways, airports, metro, buildings among others.|$|E
5000|$|Visbreaking {{preferentially}} cracks aliphatic compounds {{which have}} relatively low sulphur contents, low density and high viscosity {{and the effect}} of their removal can be clearly seen in the change in quality between feed and product. A too severe cracking in a <b>visbreaker</b> will lead to the asphaltene colloid becoming metastable. Subsequent addition of a diluent to manufacture a finished fuel oil can cause the colloid to break down, precipitating asphaltenes as a sludge. It has been observed that a paraffinic diluent is more likely to cause precipitation than an aromatic one. Stability of fuel oil is assessed using a number of proprietary tests (for example [...] "P" [...] value and SHF tests).|$|E
5000|$|De-coking: The {{cracking}} reaction forms {{petroleum coke}} as a byproduct. In coil visbreaking, this deposits in the tubes of the furnace and will {{eventually lead to}} fouling or blocking of the tubes. The same will occur in the drum of a soaker <b>visbreaker,</b> though the lower temperatures used in the soaker drum lead to fouling at a much slower rate. Coil visbreakers therefore require frequent de-coking. This is quite labour-intensive, but can be developed into a routine where tubes are de-coked sequentially without the need {{to shut down the}} visbreaking operation. Soaker drums require far less frequent attention but their being taken out of service normally requires a complete halt to the operation. Which is the more disruptive activity will vary from refinery to refinery.|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} {{test was}} carried out at the Lukoil Neftochim Bourgas, Bulgaria visbreaking unit. Thevisbreaker furnace outlet temperature was varied between 436 and 4540 C and the throughput wasvaried between 184 and 215 m 3 /h. The increase of severity led to increase of 360 oC conversionfrom 18. 7 to 25. 1 %. The <b>visbreaker</b> residue stability was found to depend not only on severity butalso on the VGO content in the vacuum residue feed. The reduction of VGO content (increase ofvacuum residue viscosity) allows achievement of higher conversion and production of stablevisbreaker residue. The activation energy of the <b>visbreaker</b> process {{was determined to be}} 14. 3 kcal/mol for the investigated conditions. The increase of conversion above 21 % was associatedwith a reduction of <b>visbreaker</b> residue flash point in closed cup below 60 oC...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of sulfur in bituminous binders started many years ago: {{a number of}} roads were paved in U. S. with SA (sulfur-asphalt) mixtures. Literature reports that, when mixing sulfur and asphalt, H 2 S evolution starts at temperatures higher than 150 °C. By using thermal analysis techniques, the present paper shows that H 2 S evolution begins at about 130 °C for most types of bitumens. Kinetics of reaction between sulfur and <b>visbreaker</b> bitumens were also studied: the reaction order with respect to sulfur is equal to 0. 5 for the three <b>visbreaker</b> bitumens considered in this work...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} quick test method was {{developed}} to distinguish thermally cracked materials, especially <b>visbreaker</b> residues and bitumens, from untracked products, such as straight-run distillation bitumens and residues. The method {{is based on the}} reactivity of thermal residues and bitumens with phosphoric acid to form high-molecular-weight products that are clearly visible as black spots in a thin film of the treated material...|$|E
40|$|A three step {{process is}} {{proposed}} for stabilizing thermal residues and bitumens, such as <b>visbreaker</b> residues, and for upgrading SR bitumens {{used to produce}} stable polymer-modified bitumens. The process {{is based on the}} addition of phosphorus compounds such as phosphoric or polyphosphoric acid to VB residues and bitumens, and to the utilization of the insoluble by-product for upgrading SR bitumens or for the preparation of very stable polymer modified bitumens...|$|E
40|$|Production {{planning}} {{is vital to}} modern refinery operation because of increasing crude prices and changing market demands. In this article LP/NLP is used to simulate the effect of change in crude types on the yields of CDU, VDU, <b>visbreaker,</b> feed and product blender units. Central Composite experimental Design (CCD) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) are used to obtain a second-degree polynomial model for maximizing profitability of operation of these units...|$|E
40|$|Two {{samples from}} failed <b>Visbreaker</b> tubes {{were sent to}} the {{laboratory}} along with a sample of unused tube for analysis. Examination suggests that the tubes have failed due to exposure to high temperature. Microstructural study indicated that the tube material was exposed to over 8000 C for a prolonged period. This has resulted in localized oxidation of the tube steel with subsequent reduction in tube-wall thickness. When the thickness became critical, the tubes have either bulged or cracked under the hoop stress. EDX analysis showed that the tube material conforms to A 335 (9 Cr- 1 Mo) steel...|$|E
40|$|Investigation on {{the closed}} cup flash point of {{visbreaking}} residue and finished fuel oil {{was carried out}} inthe Lukoil Neftochim Bourgas, Bulgaria (LNB). It was found that depending on preliminary sample treatmentflash point in closed cup of the fuel oil and <b>visbreaker</b> residue can be differed by 260 C. This difference ismuch higher than the specified in EN ISO 2719 repeatability – 50 C and reproducibility - 100 C and wasobserved in three laboratories: LNB Research laboratory, Saybolt and SGS. A possible explanation of theobserved difference in the flash point of the fuel oil {{is the fact that}} the residual fuel oil is a colloidal dispersionsystem and the different treatment of a sample results in different stability of the colloidal dispersionsystem which eventually affect the measured value of flash point in closed cup...|$|E
40|$|Measures {{reducing}} the NO formation by qualified firing (primary measures) are inten-sively investigated. Fundamental elements {{in this context}} are the staging of fuel and combustion air {{as well as the}} recirculation of exhaust gas, to control residence time and also temperature and concentration patterns. For prediction, but also for optimi-zation and control of technical combustion processes, simplified models of NO forma-tion are applicable and required. These models should be simplified in a way that allows on-line operation and is capable of reflecting sufficiently the process. The structure of such a model (kinetics, reactors) is described in the present paper. Introducing two model parameters (a characteristic process temperature and a fuel-NO parameter), the model has proved effective in predicting NO formation during combustion of natural gas and also <b>visbreaker</b> residue. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work was to study {{the effect of the}} {{addition}} of small quantities of phosphoric acid (or P 2 O 5), on the physical and chemical behaviour of petroleum residues and bitumens. Phosphoric acid (and P 2 O 5) reacts only with thermal products such as <b>visbreaker</b> (VB) residues and bitumens, and do not react with straight run (SR) products. The unstable constituents of VB residues, i. e. carbonaceous material and part of the asphaltenes, contain significant amounts of free radicals which easily share electrons with phosphorous. The resulting condensed particles are higher molecular wighht, polar material no longher soluble in the bitumen, and flocculate. This reaction confirms the presence of stable free radicals in thermal bitumens and residues, suggests a way to neutralize their destabilizing effect...|$|E
40|$|On the {{contrary}} to the high hydrogen partial pressure (near 200 Bars) present in the middle - distillate hydro-cracker reactor, <b>Visbreaker</b> naphtha cannot be well refined there. Briefly speaking, three categories of adverse effects can occur as the consequences of such a refinement:A- Products Specifications; including mercaptan formation, considerable total sulfur content and remaining aromatic compounds in the products. B- Catalyst and Chemical Reactions; consisting of lower reactor residence time, lower hydrogen partial pressure, higher polymerization and coke formation, higher nitrogen content (and weakened cracking) and formation of dried- out points or hot spots on the catalyst bed.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the problem of}} residue upgrading operations in an oil refinery. Visbreaking is a residue-upgrading process that improves profitability of a refinery. The economics of converting the heavy residue into the lighter and more valuable streams, coupled with the installation of a modem <b>visbreaker</b> unit at the Engen Refinery in Durban, provides sufficient motives to develop a mathematical model to simulate the unit's capability and estimate {{the economics of the}} visbreaking process and fuel oil operations. Furthermore, the proposed model should provide a crude-dependent visbreaking yield {{that can be used in}} the refinery's global linear programme (LP), employed to evaluate and select the crude and to optimise refinery's operations. Traditionally, kinetically based models have been used to simulate and study the refining reaction processes. In this case, due to the complexity of the process and some unknown reactions, the performances of existing visbreaking simulators are not fully satisfactory. Consequently, a neural network model of the visbreaking process and fuel oil blending operation is developed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Industrial {{monitoring}} of complex processes with {{hundreds or thousands}} of variables is a hard task faced in this work through evolving fuzzy systems. The <b>Visbreaker</b> process of the Sines Oil Refinery is the case studied. Firstly dimension reduction is performed by multidimensional scaling, obtaining the process evolution in a three dimensional space. Then an evolving fuzzy system (eFS) is developed to detect eventual malfunction of sensors. This eFS takes the data in the three reduced dimensions as antecedents and classifies the process state into normal and abnormal states. A software platform- the eFSLab (Evolving Fuzzy Systems Laboratory) -, with which this work has been developed, is presented and discussed. Several strategies for rule creation and evolution of rules, for Takagi-Sugeno (and for Mamdani system obtained from these), are implemented in eFSLab. The obtained eFS shows a promising performance in the case studied, classifying in some simulations the state of the process into abnormal-normal condition in about 95 % of the cases, with a number of rules between 5 and 8...|$|E
