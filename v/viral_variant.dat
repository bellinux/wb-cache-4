50|$|Central to Marx et al. {{argument}} {{is the concept}} of adaptation by serial passage (or serial transmission): an adventitious virus (or other pathogen) can increase its biological adaptation to a new host species if it is rapidly transmitted between hosts, while each host is still in the acute infection period. This process favors the accumulation of adaptive mutations more rapidly, therefore increasing the odds that a better adapted <b>viral</b> <b>variant</b> will appear in the host before the immune system suppresses the virus. Such better adapted variant could then survive in the human host for longer than the short acute infection period, in high numbers (high viral load), which would grant it more possibilities of epidemic spread.|$|E

In utero transmission is highly restricted and results in selection of <b>viral</b> <b>variant</b> from the mother to the child. We have developed an in vitro system that mimics the interaction between viruses, infected cells present in maternal blood, and the trophoblast, the first barrier protecting the fetus. Trophoblastic BeWo cells were grown as a tight polarized monolayer in a two-chamber system. Cell-free virions applied to the apical pole neither crossed the barrier nor productively infected BeWo cells. In contrast, apical contact with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) resulted in transcytosis of infectious virus across the trophoblastic monolayer and in productive infection correlating with the fusion of HIV-infected PBMCs with trophoblasts. We showed that viral variants are selected during these two steps and that in one case of in utero transmission, the predominant maternal <b>viral</b> <b>variant</b> characterized after transcytosis was phylogenetically indistinguishable from the predominant child's virus. Hence, the first steps of transmission of HIV- 1 in utero appear to involve the interaction between HIV type 1 -infected cells and the trophoblastic layer, resulting in the passage of infectious HIV by transcytosis and by fusion/infection, both leading to a selection of virus quasispecies...|$|E

The diverse T cell repertoire and the extensive human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphism across populations is the evolutionary response to viral mutation. However, the molecular basis underpinning the interplay between HLA polymorphism, the T cell repertoire, and viral escape is unclear. Here we investigate the T cell response to a HLA-B* 35 : 01 - and HLA-B* 35 : 08 -restricted (⁴⁰⁷) HPVGEADYFEY(⁴¹⁷) epitope from Epstein-Barr virus and naturally occurring variants at positions 4 and 5 thereof. Each <b>viral</b> <b>variant</b> differently impacted on the epitope's flexibility and conformation when bound to HLA-B* 35 : 08 or HLA-B* 35 : 01. We provide a molecular basis for understanding how the single residue polymorphism that discriminates between HLA-B* 35 : 01 / 08 profoundly impacts on T cell receptor recognition. Surprisingly, one <b>viral</b> <b>variant</b> (P 5 -Glu to P 5 -Asp) effectively changed restriction preference from HLA-B* 35 : 01 to HLA-B* 35 : 08. Collectively, our study portrays the interplay between the T cell response, viral escape, and HLA polymorphism, whereby HLA polymorphism enables altered presentation of epitopes from different strains of Epstein-Barr virus...|$|E
40|$|Individuals {{infected}} with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) harbor a mixture of <b>viral</b> <b>variants</b> with different sequences {{and in some instances}} with different phenotypic properties. Major and rapid fluctuations in the proportion of <b>viral</b> <b>variants</b> coexisting in an infected individual can be observed under strong pharmacological and immune selective pressure. Because of the short half-life of HIV-infected cells and of HIV virions in the blood, plasma virus populations are highly relevant to HIV evolution {{in the face of these}} selective pressures. Here we analyzed the sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization of <b>viral</b> <b>variants</b> coexisting in the plasma virus populations of two infected patients. For each patient, several replication-competent viral clones were constructed that carry primary envelope gene sequences obtained from a single plasma sample. Viral clones differed in their tropism and replicative capacity and in the number and positions of glycosylation sites in the envelope glycoproteins. Viruses were tested against heterologous and autologous sera obtained at different time points. Interestingly, we found that <b>viral</b> <b>variants</b> coexisting in each plasma sample were highly heterogeneous in terms of sensitivity to neutralization. The order of sensitivity depended on the serum used and was not associated with virus tropism.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the host and viral factors associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission is essential to developing effective strategies to curb the global HIV epidemic. Here we used the rhesus macaque-simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) animal model of HIV infection to study the range of viral genotypes that are transmitted by different routes of inoculation and by different types of viral inocula. Analysis of transmitted variants was undertaken in outbred rhesus macaques inoculated intravenously (IV) or intravaginally (IVAG) with a genetically heterogeneous SIVmac 251 stock derived from a well-characterized rhesus macaque viral isolate. In addition, we performed serial IV and IVAG passage experiments using plasma from SIV-infected macaques as the inoculum. We analyzed the V 1 -V 2 region of the SIV envelope gene from virion-associated RNA in plasma from infected animals by the heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) and by DNA sequence analysis. We found that a more diverse population of SIV genetic variants was present in the earliest virus-positive plasma samples from all five IV SIVmac 251 -inoculated monkeys and from two of five IVAG SIVmac 251 -inoculated monkeys. In contrast, we found a relatively homogeneous population of SIV envelope variants in three of five monkeys inoculated IVAG with SIVmac 251 stock and in two monkeys infected after IVAG inoculation with plasma from an SIV-infected animal. In some IVAG-inoculated animals, the transmitted SIV variant was the most common variant in the inoculum. However, a specific <b>viral</b> <b>variant</b> in the SIVmac 251 stock was not consistently transmitted by IVAG inoculation. Thus, it is likely that host factors or stochastic processes determine the specific viral variants that infect an animal after IVAG SIV exposure.

A common approach employed to describe viral quasispecies is by means of the quasispecies equation (QE). However, a main criticism of QE is its lack of frequency-dependent selection. This can be overcome by an alternative formulation for the evolutionary dynamics: the replicator-mutator equation (RME). In turn, a problem with the RME is how to quantify the interaction coefficients between <b>viral</b> <b>variants.</b> Here, this is addressed by adopting an ecological perspective and resorting to the niche theory of competing communities, which assumes that the utilization of resources primarily determines ecological segregation between competing individuals (the different <b>viral</b> <b>variants</b> that constitute the quasispecies). This provides a theoretical framework to estimate quantitatively the fitness landscape. Results Using this novel combination of RME plus the ecological concept of niche overlapping for describing a quasispecies we explore the population distributions of <b>viral</b> <b>variants</b> that emerge, as well as the corresponding dynamics.

Vaccine-induced multispecific CTL could {{also be able to}} control viral variants replication. To explore these possibilities, we extensively characterized CTL responses following vaccination with an epitope-based lipopeptide vaccine and challenge with pathogenic SIVmac 251. The viral sequences corresponding to the epitopes present in the vaccine as well as the viral loads were then determined in every macaque following SIV inoculation. Results In most cases, the emergence of several viral variants or mutants within vaccine CTL epitopes after SIV challenge resulted in increased viral loads except for a single macaque, which showed a single escape <b>viral</b> <b>variant</b> within its 6 vaccine-induced CTL epitopes.

In silico shRNA design for HIV has lacked a detailed study of virus variability constituting a possible breaking point in a clinical setting. We designed shRNAs against HIV- 1 considering the variability observed in naïve and drug-resistant isolates available at public databases. Methods A Bioperl-based algorithm was developed to automatically scan multiple sequence alignments of HIV, while evaluating the possibility of identifying dominant and subdominant <b>viral</b> <b>variants</b> {{that could be used}} as efficient silencing molecules. Student t-test and Bonferroni Dunn correction test were used to assess statistical significance of our findings. Results Our in silico approach identified the most common <b>viral</b> <b>variants</b> within highly conserved genome regions, with a calculated free energy of ≥ - 6. 6 kcal/mol. This is crucial for strand loading to RISC complex and for a predicted silencing efficiency score, which could be used in combination for achieving over 90 % silencing. Resistant and naïve isolate variability revealed that the most frequent shRNA per region targets a maximum of 85 % of viral sequences. Adding more divergent sequences maintained this percentage. Specific sequence features that {{have been found to be}} related with higher silencing efficiency were hardly accomplished in conserved regions, even when lower entropy values correlated with better scores. We identified a conserved region among most HIV- 1 genomes, which meets as many sequence features for efficient silencing. Conclusions HIV- 1 variability is an obstacle to achieving absolute silencing using shRNAs designed against a consensus sequence, mainly because there are many functional <b>viral</b> <b>variants.</b> Our shRNA cocktail could be truly effective at silencing dominant and subdominant naïve <b>viral</b> <b>variants.</b> Additionally, resistant isolates might be targeted under specific antiretroviral selective pressure, but in both cases these should be tested exhaustively prior to clinical use. </p...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 {{is characterized by}} extensive genetic heterogeneity. Having previously demonstrated that, in the peripheral blood, the initial viral population is more homogeneous than at subsequent stages of infection, we have extended our studies to tissue samples, allowing comparisons between viral populations in peripheral blood and tissues during both the acute and chronic stages of infection. We found that homogeneity in gp 120 sequences during the acute infection phase is not just restricted to the peripheral blood but also extends to other tissue compartments. However, in chronically infected individuals, heterogeneous and distinct viral populations were found in different compartments. We therefore conclude that the dominant and homogeneous viral population observed during the acute infection phase is likely to infiltrate lymphoid tissues and form the genetic bases for subsequent diversification. It is therefore likely that the compartmentalization of viral sequences observed in chronically infected patients reflects a gradual diversification of a common dominant <b>viral</b> <b>variant</b> rather than the preferential migration of distinct viral populations to different tissue compartments {{at the beginning of}} infection...|$|E

To assess viral characteristics influencing HIV- 1 transmission, we sequenced 167 near full-length viral genomes and generated 40 infectious molecular clones (IMC) including TF variants and multiple non-transmitted (NT) HIV- 1 subtype C variants from six linked heterosexual transmission pairs near the time of transmission. Consensus-like genomes sensitive to donor antibodies were selected for during transmission in these six transmission pairs. However, TF variants did not demonstrate increased viral fitness in terms of particle infectivity or viral replicative capacity in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC). In addition, resistance of the TF variant to the antiviral effects of interferon-α (IFN-α) was not significantly different from that of non-transmitted variants from the same transmission pair. Thus neither in vitro viral replicative capacity nor IFN-α resistance discriminated the transmission potential of viruses in the quasispecies of these chronically infected individuals.

Previous chemical screens identified Daclatasvir (BMS- 790052) as a potent nonstructural protein 5 A (NS 5 A) inhibitor for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with an unclear inhibitory mechanism. Here we have developed a quantitative high-resolution genetic (qHRG) approach to systematically map the drug-protein interactions between Daclatasvir and NS 5 A and profile genetic barriers to Daclatasvir resistance. We implemented saturation mutagenesis in combination with next-generation sequencing technology to systematically quantify the effect of every possible amino acid substitution in the drug-targeted region (domain IA of NS 5 A) on replication fitness and sensitivity to Daclatasvir. This enabled determination of the residues governing drug-protein interactions. The relative fitness and drug sensitivity profiles also provide a comprehensive reference of the genetic barriers for all possible single amino acid changes during viral evolution, which we utilized to predict clinical outcomes using mathematical models. We envision that this high-resolution profiling methodology will be useful for next-generation drug development to select drugs with higher fitness costs to resistance, and also for informing the rational use of drugs based on <b>viral</b> <b>variant</b> spectra from patients...|$|E

40|$|A {{previous}} study on N gene variation of rabies viruses circulating in Ontario red foxes identified four <b>viral</b> <b>variants.</b> This study confirms the geographical localization of these variants and extends the analysis {{to the less}} conserved G gene of these viruses. A greater number of regionally localized variants was revealed and their phylogenetic relationships have been examined. Ongoing surveillance on recent disease outbreaks revealed that variants do not always persist in specific areas. The distribution of these variants did however appear {{to be influenced by}} topographical features of the study area likely to affect host animal movements and contacts. The majority of G gene base changes were synonymous and limited glycoprotein sequence variation predominantly to the C-terminal transmembrane and endo-domains. These data are most readily explained by random appearance of genetic <b>viral</b> <b>variants</b> followed by their spread throughout sub-populations of the fox host according to the easiest routes of transmission...|$|R
