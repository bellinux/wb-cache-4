40|$|Extra <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> {{and mixed}} oil were {{analyzed}} by UV-Vis spectroscopy and Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS). When the oils were heated at high temperatures (frying), oxidation products were formed which were harmful to human health and antioxidants present were degraded. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate tocopherol (an antioxidant present in oils) and the behaviour of oxidation products in different <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> classes. MCR-ALS results showed that degradation started at 70 ºC for extra <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> while tocopherol concentration decreased and oxidation products increased starting at 40 ºC in <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> In mixed oil, commercialized as a mixture of 85 % soybean oil and 15 % <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> tocopherol concentration started to decrease and oxidation products increase at 30 ºC.

40|$|An {{association}} between the intake of heterocyclic amines (HAs) {{and the development of}} cancer has been observed in some epidemiological studies, while in other studies no such correlation has been found. HAs are mutagenic/carcinogenic compounds formed at low levels via the Maillard reaction and a free radical mechanism during cooking of animal tissue. The addition of pure antioxidants or foods containing antioxidants has previously been shown to decrease the amount of HAs formed during cooking. In this study, beefburgers were fried in six different oils: refined <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> depleted of phenols, rapeseed <b>oil,</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> with rosemary extract and refined <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> with rosemary extract. The content of antioxidative compounds in the <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and the rosemary extract was determined. The beefburgers were analysed with regards to 12 different HAs by solid phase extraction and HPLC analysis. MeIQx, 4, 8 -DiMeIQx, PhIP, Harman and Norharman were detected in all beefburgers fried in the different oils, but the relative amounts varied. Frying in <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> reduced the formation of HAs compared with refined <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> This effect is probably due to the content of phenols in the <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> The HA-reducing effect of <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> decreased during storage, but the addition of rosemary extract may prevent this decrease...|$|R

40|$|<b>Virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> {{the main}} fat of the Mediterranean diet, is per se {{considered}} as a functional food—as stated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) —due to its content in healthy compounds. The daily intake of endogenous bioactive phenolics from <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> is variable due {{to the influence of}} multiple agronomic and technological factors. Thus, a good strategy to ensure an optimal intake of polyphenols through habitual diet would be to produce enriched <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> with well-known bioactive polyphenols.
