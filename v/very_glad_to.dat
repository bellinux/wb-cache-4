5|$|Although Busoni {{met with}} many other artistic personalities who were also basing {{themselves}} in Switzerland during the war (including Stephan Zweig and James Joyce– the former noting Busoni's extensive drinking) he soon found his circumstances limiting. After {{the end of the}} war, he again undertook concert tours in England, Paris and Italy. In London he met with the composer Kaikhosru Sorabji who played to him his Second Piano Sonata (which he dedicated to Busoni); Busoni was sufficiently impressed to write for Sorabji a letter of recommendation. When Busoni's former pupil Leo Kestenberg, now an official at the Ministry of Culture in the German Weimar Republic, invited him to return to Germany, with the promise of a teaching post and productions of his operas, he was <b>very</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> take the opportunity.|$|E

I think you ought to consider these things fully and reflect whether the little work we can give you is not better than no work at all.

[...] The Irish Times said Springsteen showing {{no signs of}} age as he neared his 60th birthday, despite taking a spill during his stage antics in rainy Dublin, and remarked upon how [...] "a set that features so many songs about the toughness of life ... can be delivered with such extraordinary verve {{that by the time}} you leave, you’re <b>very</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be alive." [...] The Independent echoed the sentiment in reviewing the Hyde Park show, writing that he showed [...] "the vigour of a frontman a third of his age" [...] and that [...] "Springsteen's intensity was staggering from first powerful vocal to final thrashed-out chord." [...] The Bath Chronicle saluted Springsteen's performance at Glastonbury, saying [...] "As all the tickets were sold before Springsteen was even confirmed on the bill, he must have known he was facing something very rare for him – the musical equivalent of a sporting 'away match' where not everyone was necessarily a worshipper at the altar of Bruce." [...] They concluded that Springsteen gave [...] "a performance of passion, exuberance, exhilaration and musical majesty" [...] while sticking with his standard tour set list and not resorting to playing many of his better-known hits.|$|E
