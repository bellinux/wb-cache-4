Although seminarians spent the school year studying in the cities of Vienna or Lviv, they spent their summer <b>vacations</b> <b>courting</b> in various Ukrainian villages. Priests married prior to their ordination at about 26 years of age. [...] Their brides were usually the daughters of other priests. After being ordained, the priests typically spent ten to twenty-five years being transferred to different parishes before settling in one place as its pastor.|$|R
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the case, {{commentators}} and courts have remained divided over whether manifest disregard is still available as grounds to vacate an arbitration award. In Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. v. Bacon, the following year, the Fifth Circuit decided Hall Street had settled the question and overruled a district <b>court's</b> <b>vacation</b> of an award. The next year, 2010, the Eleventh Circuit followed suit in Frazier v. CitiFinancial Corp.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the <b>court</b> <b>vacation</b> in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were {{unlikely}} to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the <b>court</b> <b>vacation</b> writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|R
25|$|The Chief Justice is {{empowered}} {{to determine the}} sitting times of the High Court and the Court of Appeal {{and the distribution of}} business among judges, and to schedule vacations of the Supreme Court not exceeding two months in each calendar year. In general, the High Court and Court of Appeal sits throughout the year except during the mid-year and end-year <b>court</b> <b>vacations</b> (usually end of May to end of June, and the beginning of December to the beginning of January respectively).|$|R
2500|$|Persons {{seeking to}} become {{advocate}}s and solicitors must {{apply to the}} Supreme Court. An advocate is a lawyer who appears in court {{on behalf of his}} or her client, while solicitors traditionally deal with non-contentious legal matters that do not require court appearances. As the legal profession in Singapore is fused, applicants are admitted to the bar as both advocates and solicitors, and may practise as either or both. Admission is in the discretion of the Court and subject to the requirements specified in the Legal Profession Act. The Act specifically provides that no person is disqualified by sex from being admitted and enrolled as an advocate and solicitor. Unless the Chief Justice orders otherwise, applications for admission as an advocate and solicitor are heard on the second Wednesday of each month except during <b>court</b> <b>vacations.</b> The <b>Court</b> generally arranges a [...] "mass call" [...] of advocates and solicitors on the last Saturday of May to cater to the large number of graduates from the Faculty of Law of the National University of Singapore and the School of Law of the Singapore Management University completing their professional training and seeking admission to the bar at this time of year. Where a case is difficult and complex, the Court may admit on an ad hoc basis a Queen's Counsel who does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia and who has special qualifications or experience to practise as an advocate and solicitor for the purpose of the case. Lawyers practising as advocates and solicitors, other than Queen's Counsel admitted ad hoc, are required to apply annually to the Registrar of the Supreme Court for a practising certificate.|$|R
60|$|The time of {{year when}} Scott and Leyden visited Yarrow was not the AUTUMN {{vacation}} of 1802, as Lockhart erroneously writes, {23b} but the SPRING vacation of 1802. The spring vacation, Mr. Macmath informs me, ran from 11th March to 12th May in 1802. In May, apparently, Scott having obtained the Auld Maitland MS. in the vernal <b>vacation</b> of the <b>Court</b> of Session, gave his account of his discovery to his friend Ellis (Lockhart does not date the letter, but wrongly puts it after the return to Edinburgh in November 1802).|$|R

50|$|Ben-Itto {{began to}} {{research}} The Protocols of the Elders of Zion during her {{years on the}} bench, using her free time and <b>court</b> <b>vacations</b> to peruse the topic in footnoted academic studies.

Desiring to write a book for the general public, she took early retirement in 1991 and spent six years writing The Lie That Wouldn't Die: The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The book was published in Hebrew in 1998 and has since been translated into ten languages, including German, Russian, Dutch, Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Spanish, English, Arabic and Persian.|$|R

He succeeded his father-in-law Sir John Pratt as a Whig Member of Parliament for Midhurst in 1715, vacating his seat when he was knighted and raised to the Bench as a Baron of the Exchequer on 24 January 1717.

500|$|At the time, {{there was}} no {{organised}} way for a new barrister to find a pupil master or set of chambers, and in addition the barrister {{would be expected to}} pay the pupil master between 50 and 100 guineas (equivalent to between £ and £ in 2015).

Instead he wandered around Middle Temple and by chance ran into Frederick Corbet, the only practising barrister he knew. After Hastings explained his situation, Corbet offered him a place in his set of chambers, which Hastings immediately accepted. Although he now had a place in chambers, Hastings had no way of getting a pupillage (Corbet only dealt with Privy Council cases) and he instead decided to teach himself by watching cases at the Royal Courts of Justice. Hastings was lucky: the first case he saw involved Rufus Isaacs, Henry Duke and Edward Carson, three of the most distinguished English barristers of the early 20th century.

From the Academy, he entered the University of Virginia. After graduation, he joined Professor F.P. Brent in conducting a classical school at Onancock, in Accomack County. Returning to the University in the fall of 1881, he {{became a member of the}} law class taught by Professor John B. Minor and received his Bachelor of Law degree in 1882. That same year, he opened an office in Rocky Mount, Virginia. In 1887, he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates and served there for seven terms, including two years (1899-1901) as Speaker. In 1901 he was elected Judge of the Fourth Judicial Circuit. When the circuits in Virginia were reorganized, as ordered by the Constitution of 1902, he became Judge of the Seventh Judicial Circuit. While serving in that capacity, he was elected to fill a vacancy in the United States Congress, where he remained for seven years. In 1920, he was elected to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. Judge Saunders served less than two years on this court before he died at his home in Rocky Mount, during the <b>vacation</b> of the <b>court.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Opening of the Legal Year {{ceremony}} can {{be traced}} back to the ceremonial opening of the first assizes of the year which was held in the 19th century when Singapore was managed by the East India Company. The assizes were periodic criminal courts held in Singapore. The ceremony ceased for some years but was revived in 1923. In that year the ceremony involved the Chief Justice inspecting a Sikh guard of honour commanded by a subedar outside the Supreme Court, then being met by the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and Sheriff. The four gentlemen made their way to the Chief Justice's chambers in the courthouse, the route lined by police officers and members of the Bar. By 1926, the practice of attending a service at St. Andrew's Cathedral prior to the honour guard inspection had been revived, and in 1955 it was reported that a service was also held at the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd for Roman Catholic judges and lawyers. Church services ceased to be an official part of the ceremony when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, though members of the legal profession continued to attend special services in an unofficial capacity. Following Singapore's full independence in 1965, the ceremony became known as the Opening of the Legal Year. The ceremony was generally held on the first Monday in January following the end-of-year <b>court</b> <b>vacation,</b> but in 1971 for the first time it was held on the first Saturday in January to coincide with the inaugural Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Singapore. This set the trend for subsequent years. It appears that the parade by police officers during which Chief Justice inspected a guard of honour was abolished in the late 1960s or early 1970s.|$|R
