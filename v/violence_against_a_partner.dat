40|$|This paper {{examines}} men's lifetime physical intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration across eight low- {{and middle-income}} countries {{to better understand}} key risk factors that interventions can target {{in order to promote}} gender equality and reduce IPV. We use data from men (n = 7806) that were collected as part of the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Chile, Croatia, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), India, Mexico, and Rwanda. Results show that there is wide variation across countries for lifetime self-reported physical violence perpetration (range: 17 % in Mexico to 45 % in DRC), men's support for equal roles for men and women, and acceptability of violence against women. Across the sample, 31 % of men report having perpetrated physical <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> in their lifetime. In multivariate analyses examining risk factors for men ever perpetrating physical <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>partner,</b> witnessing parental violence was the strongest risk factor, reinforcing previous research suggesting the inter-generational transmission of violence. Additionally, having been involved in fights not specifically with an intimate partner, permissive attitudes towards violence against women, having inequitable gender attitudes, and older age were associated with a higher likelihood of ever perpetrating physical IPV. In separate analyses for each country, we found different patterns of risk factors in countries with high perpetration compared to countries with low perpetration. Findings are interpreted to identify key knowledge gaps and directions for future research, public policies, evaluation, and programming...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the role of}} anger and victimization in women’s use of aggres-sion in heterosexual intimate relationships. The sample was composed of 108 women, pri-marily African American, urban, and poor, who had used <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> in the previous 6 months. Path modeling {{was used to examine}} the interrelationships among anger, women’s aggressive behavior, victimization, childhood abuse experiences, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression. Results revealed that almost all of the women experienced violence from their partners. Greater frequency of victimization from partners and experiences of childhood abuse increased the likelihood that women would use aggression against their partners. Victimization from partners and childhood abuse also increased the likelihood that women would experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression. Women with more symptoms of posttraumatic stress {{were also more likely to}} express anger outwardly towards others. Expressing anger outwardly toward others, in turn, predicted an increased likelihood of using aggression against partners...|$|E

40|$|Objective: A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} suggests that intimate partner violence (IPV) occurs within same-sex relationships and {{that members of the}} Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender (LGBT) community face a number of unique challenges in accessing IPV-related services. This paper examines the use of an online survey, marketed through a popular social networking site, to collect data on the experience and perpetration of IPV among {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) in the United States. Methods: Internet-using MSM were recruited through selective placement of banner advertisements on MySpace. com. Participants were eligible for the baseline survey if they were males ≥ 18 years of age, and reported at least one male sex partner in the last 12 months. In total 16, 597 men responded to the ad, of which 11, 681 were eligible for the study, and 5, 602 completed the questionnaire; 543 men completed the follow-up survey, which included questions on the experience and perpetration of IPV. The final analysis sample was 402. Results: The prevalence of violence among the sample was relatively high: 11. 8 % of men reported physical violence from a current male partner, and about 4 % reported experiencing coerced sex. Reporting of perpetration of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> was generally lower, with approximately 7...|$|E

50|$|Even though {{intimacy}} {{has been}} broadly {{defined in terms}} of romantic love and sexual desire, the neuroanatomy of intimacy needs further explanation in order to fully understand their neurological functions in different components within intimate relationships, which are romantic love, lust, attachment, and rejection in love. Also, known functions of the neuroanatomy involved can be applied to observations seen in people who are experiencing any of the stages in intimacy. Research analysis of these systems provide insight on the biological basis of intimacy, but the neurological aspect must be considered as well in areas that require special attention to mitigate issues in intimacy, such as <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> beloved <b>partner</b> or problems with social bonding.|$|R
50|$|Bride {{kidnapping}} {{is practiced}} by certain communities in Ethiopia, {{mainly in the}} Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region (SNNPR). According to surveys conducted in 2003 by the National Committee on Traditional Practices in Ethiopia, the custom's prevalence rate in the SNNPR was estimated at 92 percent. However, the 2004 Criminal Code criminalizes this practice, {{as well as other}} forms of abuse of women, such as child marriage, trafficking and sexual harassment, at Chapter III - Crimes Committed against life, person and health through harmful traditional practices (Articles 561-570) and also by other provisions (Articles 587, 597, 625, 635, 637, 648).

40|$|The {{mental health}} {{correlates}} of male aggression or <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>an</b> intimate <b>partner</b> (IPV) are examined using exploratory cluster analysis for 81 men who self-reported {{risk factors for}} IPV perpetration on a computer-based health risk assessment. Men disclosing IPV perpetration could be meaningfully subdivided into two different clusters: a high pathology/high violence cluster, and lower pathology/low violence cluster. These groups appear to perpetrate intimate partner violence in differing psychoemotional contexts and could be robustly identified using multiple distinct analytic methods. If men who self-disclose IPV in a health care setting can be meaningfully subdivided based on mental health symptoms and level of violence, it lends support for potential new targeted approaches to preventing partner violence perpetration by both women and men...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 188 - 210. <b>Violence</b> <b>against</b> {{women is}} <b>a</b> {{universal}} problem and is widely recognised {{as a fundamental}} barrier to women's health and gender equality.

Data on risk factors that explain men's use of violence have been limited. Such data is required before interventions can be developed. The aims {{of this study was to}} describe the prevalence of different types of <b>violence</b> men use <b>against</b> their partners, as well as the risk factors for men's use of such violence. The study was based among men working at three municipalities in Cape Town. A random sample of 1800 names was chosen, from among which 1414 interviews were held.

40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{prevalence}} of neglectful behavior by parents of university students in 17 nations (6 in Europe, 2 in North America, 2 in Latin America, 5 in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand) and tests the hypothesis that neglect is {{a risk factor for}} <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> dating <b>partner.</b> The percent-age at each university who experienced neglectful behavior ranged from 3. 2 % to 36 % (median 12 %), and the percent-age who perpetrated <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> dating partners ranged from 15 % to 45 % (median 28 %). Multilevel modeling found that the more neglectful behavior experienced as a child the greater the probability of assaulting and injuring <b>a</b> dat-ing <b>partner</b> and that the link between experiencing neglect and perpetrating violence is stronger at universities in which dating violence is more prevalent. Efforts to help parents avoid neglectful behavior can make an important contribu-tion to primary prevention of partner violence and probably also other forms of child maltreatment...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that {{a significant proportion of}} men who have been violent towards their partners desist from such violent behaviors; yet, research examining desistance from intimate partner violence (IPV) is limited. This omission is surprising given that an understanding of desistance processes is required to inform evidence-based IPV interventions. In this critical review of the empirical literature, eligible studies included 15 publications, identified through electronic databases and hand searches of bibliographies that directly investigated the cessation of physical <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>an</b> intimate <b>partner,</b> by heterosexual men. No single theory was identified that explains desistance from IPV. However, empirical studies reveal that the severity and frequency of violence is associated with desistance, with those using moderate levels of violence being more likely to desist than those who engage in severe violence. Typology research suggests differences in individual characteristics (e. g., low psychopathology and impulsivity) can distinguish desisters from persisters. In addition, the nature of the dyad within which the violence occurs is also influential in desistance processes. It is concluded that much {{more research is needed to}} inform practice and in particular to examine the role of protective factors in mitigating risk and enabling individuals to desist from IPV...|$|R
40|$|The first {{purpose of}} the current study was to assess the {{relationship}} between sexual aggression and violence to determine whether women's higher reported rate of use of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> dating <b>partner</b> is related to defending against unwanted sexual advances. The second purpose was to determine whether psychopathy-related personality traits would differentiate subjects who reported using aggression from those subjects who did not. Subjects were 274 students from the University of Windsor with a replication sample of 174 students from the University of Saskatchewan. All subjects completed the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (Josephson & Check, 1990), a sexual aggression scale (Stets & Pirog-­Good, 1989), the Socialization scale (So; Gough, 1975), Eysenck's (1985) I- 7 (impulsivity, venturesomeness, and empathy) and a similar measure by Schalling (1978), and the Social Desirability Scale (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960). Results indicated that, while males associate physical and sexual aggression, females do not. The Socialization scale was the only personality measure which predicted the use of physical aggression by females and the use of sexual aggression by males. Sociocultural attitudes regarding gender expectations are considered while interpreting the sex differences. Alternate research methods are suggested for further exploration of questions raised by the current study...|$|R

In terms of many of the characteristics of childhood and adulthood, the IP murder group differs from the MM group and appears to be more “ordinary ” or “conventional. ” However, the IP group is less conventional in that {{they are more likely to}} have intimate relationships that had broken down, to have used <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> previous woman <b>partner</b> as well as against the victim they killed, and to “spe-cialize ” in <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} and identify specific alcohol consumption patterns related to intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization among youth in Kampala, Uganda. Methods: Data were collected on 457 youth aged 14 - 24 years for the 2011 Kampala Youth Survey. Prevalence for intimate partner violence victimization and perpetration were compared for males and females. The relationship between two specific alcohol consumption patterns and intimate partner victimization and perpetration were examined. Results: In 2011, 32. 2 % of Kampala youth reported being victims and 20. 3 % reported being perpetrators of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>an</b> intimate <b>partner.</b> Females were {{significantly less likely to}} report being perpetrators than males (OR= 0. 53, 95 % CI 0. 36 - 0. 79). Increased frequency of alcohol consumption within the past month was associated with an increased likelihood for intimate partner violence victimization, perpetration, and the overlap variable of being both a victim and perpetrator. Conclusion: This study identifies specific alcohol consumption patterns that are risk factors for being a victim, a perpetrator, and both a victim and perpetrator of intimate partner violence in youth in the slums of Kampala. It also highlights the need for adolescent-specific studies regarding intimate partner violence due to gender differences...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 204 - 226). This {{study examined}} how {{women and men}} in intimate heterosexual relationships attribute meaning to the man's perpetration of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> woman <b>partner.</b> Narrative interviews were conducted with women and men who constituted 15 heterosexual couples (30 individual women and men). Narrative analytical methods, informed by feminist poststructuralism, revealed that participants located themselves within multiple and ambiguous gendered subject positions. In their talk about violence and relationships, women and men 'performed' gender and enacted diverse culturally available constructions of femininity and masculinity. The analysis also showed that participants' talk about violence was embedded in broader sociocultural mechanisms that construct woman abuse as a serious social problem in South Africa. Within-case and across-case narrative analytical methods revealed that couples' narratives were either constructed collaboratively or incongruently across partners. In collaborative narratives, couples' stories were congruent in terms of their content, structure and aims, for example, explaining the ending of the marriage. Incongruent narratives, on the other hand, were characterised by major disconnections in the content and function. It was concluded that, although presumptions about homogeneity prevail, greater sensitivity to heterogeneity amongst victims, perpetrators and couples is appropriate. This study provides insight into the dynamics of abusive relationships as well as a basis for suggestions about interventions for perpetrators and victims of woman abuse...|$|R
5000|$|Ethiopia is {{estimated}} {{to have one of}} the highest rates of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women in the world. A report by the UN found that women in Ethiopia are the most likely to suffer domestic violence at the hands of their partners, and that nearly 60% of Ethiopian women were subjected to sexual violence. The 2004 Criminal Code of Ethiopia creates the offense of rape, by Article 620, which states that: [...] "Whoever compels a woman to submit to sexual intercourse outside wedlock, whether by the use of violence or grave intimidation, or after having rendered her unconscious or incapable of resistance, is punishable with rigorous imprisonment from five years to fifteen years". There are also certain aggravated circumstances which lead to an increased punishment for rape. Apart from the criminal offense of rape, there are also other sexual offenses in the Criminal Code. The age of consent is 18. As can be seen above, a woman cannot charge her husband with rape. However, the 2004 Criminal Code brings major improvements for women's rights in the country, by criminalizing several forms of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women, such as female genital mutilation, <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> pregnant women, marriage by abduction, child marriage, trafficking and sexual harassment, though Chapter III - Crimes Committed against life, person and health through harmful traditional practices (Articles 561-570) and other provisions (Articles 587, 597, 625, 635, 637, 648). Article 564 - <b>Violence</b> <b>Against</b> <b>a</b> Marriage <b>Partner</b> or <b>a</b> Person Cohabiting in an Irregular Union is a major step forward.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the link between stereotypic images of African American women and intimate partner violence in the African American community. Abrief questionnaire was given to a community-based sample of 221 African American men to (a) examine {{the degree to which}} African American men endorsed stereotypic images of African American women and (b) explore whether a belief in these images related to a belief that it is justified to use <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>an</b> intimate <b>partner.</b> Results indicated that a large percentage of African American men endorsed stereotypic images of African American women. Endorsement of the stereotypes positively related to justification of <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women. Domestic <b>violence</b> is a pervasive problem in our society. It is esti-mated that one in four wives is physically battered and that 3 to 4 million American women are battered each year by their part-ners (Russo, Koss, & Goodman, 1995). Domestic violence cuts across all races, cultures, and social classes (Coley & Beckett, 1988; Williams, 1993, 1994 a). It is an issue that is thousands of years old, but {{it was only in the}} 1970 s that our country began to address this problem (Coley & Beckett, 1988; Taylor & Hammond, 1987). Many researchers have studied different aspects of this issue, but there is one facet that has been too often neglected: the experiences of women of color (Asbury, 1987; Hampton, 1980; Harrison & Esqueda, 1999). Relatively few studies have investigated ethnic differences and similarities in <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women in the United States (Sorenson, 1996).

Exposure to IPV was determined by men’s self-reports of witnessing inter-parental violence in childhood. We used adjusted binary logistic regression models to assess the influence of exposure on husbands’ perpetration of IPV and their endorsement of attitudes justifying wife beating. Results Nearly 60 % of men reported violent behaviour towards <b>an</b> intimate <b>partner</b> and 35. 7 % endorsed attitudes justifying spousal abuse.

40|$|Just {{under one}} quarter of all {{homicide}} victims in England and Wales were killed by <b>an</b> intimate <b>partner</b> in the year 2008 / 9, according to Home Office statistics. In the aftermath of such fatalities, where the offender was clearly well known to the victim, questions are often raised about whether the attack could have been foreseen and whether services had failed the victim in not preventing the sometimes seemingly inevitable event. This article considers how psychological theory and research can lend itself to the prevention of serious and fatal intimate partner violence {{and looks at the}} current state of practice in this domain. ‘Stalker guilty of stabbing ex-girlfriend to death in brutal attack’ (London Evening Standard, 2010) ‘Bridge game fights “led man to murder wife”’ (Reuters, 2010) ‘Horror as man kills himself after stabbing ex-partner outside Tesco store’ (Daily Record, 2010) Attention-grabbing headlines like these that depict murderous scenes of male-perpetrated <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> female intimate <b>partner,</b> are commonplace in the British media. Lethal acts that hit the headlines are often preceded by risk factors that, with hindsight, show warning signs of the event that was about to unfold (as in the 2010 case of Raoul Moat, see Case 1 opposite). As psychology can be used to evidence patterns in behaviour, it is plausible that this branch of the social sciences will be able to contribute to the prediction and prevention of intimate partner homicid...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{reliability}} of criminal justice systems in foreign countries have resulted in uneven treatment of foreign convictions in U. S. courts. Federal courts, however, have historically accepted tribal court convictions as predicate offenses under recidivist statutes. But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently rejected the uncounseled convictions obtained against Michael Bryant, Jr., a serial domestic abuser, in the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Court. The court dismissed a federal indictment that had been brought against Bryant under 18 U. S. C § 117, {{which makes it a}} felony to commit domestic <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> spouse or <b>partner</b> in Indian country if the perpetrator has at least two prior domestic abuse convictions, because Bryant’s convictions did “not comport with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. ” The Ninth Circuit decision jeopardizes {{the health and safety of}} Native American women and stymies federal efforts to prosecute domestic violence in Indian country. Available studies suggest domestic abuse is a grave concern among indigenous communities. For instance, over half of indigenous women respondents to a Department of Justice survey reported being stalked, physically assaulted, or raped during their lifetimes. But the stakes of the case also extend to the legitimacy of tribal courts. Because federal courts often allow the use of foreign convictions as predicate offenses or factor them into sentencing decisions, even where those convictions would have violated the U. S. Constitution if obtained domestically, the Ninth Circuit’s rejection of the uncounseled conviction in United States v. Bryant implicitly suggested that tribal courts are less reliable fora than many foreign courts. This year the Supreme Court will have the opportunity to repudiate the Ninth Circuit’s distrust of tribal court procedures and affirm its commitment to the integrity of tribal courts...|$|R
