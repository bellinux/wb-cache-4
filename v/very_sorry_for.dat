500|$|A soldier {{under the}} command of Colonel Garnons Williams wrote an account of his {{commanding}} officer's death, which puts the date of his death as 27 September. Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: [...] "I was <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him, as we could not have had a better, braver officer. He was with us {{all the time in the}} front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could have done better. Nobody could get back to him." [...] The following evening, the battalion was relieved, Garnons Williams being declared officially wounded and missing in action, unofficially reported killed.|$|E
500|$|Octavius {{was close}} to his nearest sister Sophia, who called Octavius [...] "her son", and went with her and their siblings, Elizabeth and Edward to Eastborne on the Sussex coast, where he could take in the fresh seaside air {{during the summer of}} 1780. When he was {{nineteen}} months old, Octavius became an older brother with the birth of his younger brother Prince Alfred. Octavius was three years of age when Alfred died on 20 August 1782, and he again became the youngest surviving child. Horace Walpole wrote to Sir Horace Mann that upon Prince Alfred's death, King George had declared [...] "I am <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Alfred; but had it been Octavius, I should have died too." [...] In 1820, historian Edward Holt would write of the prince's character, [...] "Though Prince Octavius had not passed his fifth year, he was considered very docile, and possessed good-nature in such an uncommon degree, that he was the delight of all about him." [...] Biographer John Watkins added Octavius was [...] "reckoned one of the finest of the royal progeny." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I can't 'xactly say as I {{have come}} to do that, but I dessay I may as well begin that way. I'm <b>very</b> <b>sorry,</b> miss, <b>for</b> havin' did you, an' I've called now to see if I can't do you again." ...|$|R

500|$|After {{some months}} in London, Lambert was visited by Józef Boruwłaski, a [...] dwarf then in his seventies. Born in 1739 to a poor family in rural Pokuttya, Boruwłaski was {{generally}} considered to be the last of Europe's court dwarfs. [...] He was introduced to the Empress Maria Theresa in 1754, and after a short time residing with deposed Polish king Stanisław Leszczyński, he exhibited himself around Europe, thus becoming a wealthy man. At age60, he retired to Durham, where he became such a popular figure that the City of Durham paid him to live there and he became one of its most prominent citizens. [...] Boruwłaski had a superb memory, and recalled that Lambert, while still employed by Patrick's die casting works and before he grew fat, had paid to see him in Birmingham. Boruwłaski remarked [...] "I have seen this face twenty years before at Birmingham, but certainly it be another body". He had been told that Lambert's bulk was a hoax, and he therefore felt his leg to prove to himself that it was not. The two men compared their respective outfits, and calculated that one of Lambert's sleeves would provide enough cloth to make an entire coat for Boruwłaski. Lambert enquired after Boruwłaski's wife, Isalina Barbutan, whereupon the latter replied [...] "No, she is dead, and I am not <b>very</b> <b>sorry,</b> <b>for</b> when I affront her, she put me on the mantle-shelf for punishment." ...|$|E
500|$|British {{historian}} Robert Service {{wrote in}} his book, Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-First Century, that [...] "When he [...] succeeded Khrushchev, {{he was still a}} vigorous politician who expected to make the Party and government work more effectively. He had not been inactive; he had not been entirely inflexible. But his General Secretaryship had turned into a ceremonial reign that had brought communism into its deepest contempt since 1917." [...] He added that it was [...] "hard to feel <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Brezhnev"; his socio-economic policies had sent the country into an Era of Stagnation from which his successors were never able to fully recover. Talal Nizameddin states in his book Russia and the Middle East: Towards A New Foreign Policy that [...] "Brezhnev's legacy, generally unaffected by his weak successors (Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko), was entanglement in Afghanistan, tension with China and Japan, as well as the prospect of a new dimension to the arms race with the United States {{in the form of the}} Strategic Defence Initiative (Star Wars)." [...] According to historian David Dyker in his book The Soviet Union under Gorbachev: Prospects for Reform [...] "Brezhnev left his successors a Soviet Union suffering from a host of domestic and foreign problems". The biggest obstacle, according to Dyker, was the weakness of the economy which had undermined Soviet influence outside its borders considerably during the late Brezhnev due to its relative technological backwardness.|$|E

6000|$|... "You talk nonsense, my dear Mr. Andrew, or Mr. Andrew de la Borne," [...] she said. [...] "If {{you tried}} to retain Major Forrest on such a cock and bull pretext, you would be {{probably}} <b>very</b> soon <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> it. Besides you have no power to do anything of the sort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{they always}} come back, and are <b>very</b> repentant and <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> what they've done," [...] Blanche said. [...] "See, {{here comes the}} Foker, and dear Laura leaning on him. How pretty she looks!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes, he is your brother, and all that. You {{may feel}} for him what you like. But I must say this: {{it was a}} shameful thing, and a {{betrayal}} of confidence, such as it grieves {{me to think of}} in his father's son. I am <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> her, poor thing! whom I should have looked after better; and I am <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> indeed <b>for</b> you, Cilla; but I must tell you that to bury the poor girl next to Mrs. Sandbrook, as your brother's wife, would be a scandal.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Matsuzaka also {{apologized to}} Red Sox fans, saying, [...] "I am <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> making you worry. I {{assure you that}} the [...] season {{will be a great}} season.

2500|$|On May 17, 2007, Berger relinquished {{his license}} to {{practice}} law {{as a result of}} the Justice Department investigation. Saying, [...] "I have decided to voluntarily relinquish my license. ... While I derived great satisfaction from years of practicing law, I have not done so for 15 years and do not envision returning to the profession. I am <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> what I did, and I deeply apologize." [...] By giving up his license, Berger avoided cross-examination by the Bar Counsel regarding details of his thefts.|$|E
2500|$|Voice actor Matt Zimmerman who voiced Alan Tracy and {{supporting}} characters in Thunderbirds spoke to BBC News about Anderson's death praising his work saying [...] "it's {{a big part}} of people's lives" [...] saying also that [...] "people speak of the shows with such affection, and I held Gerry with that kind of affection as well. I am very pleased to have known him and I feel <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Jamie and his wife Mary." [...] David Graham who voiced Gordon Tracy, Parker, Brains and Kyrano said it was [...] "a very sad day".|$|E

'I {{originated}} it,' said Martin; 'and so {{far from}} having any complaint to make against you, highly esteem the friendship you entertain for Tom, and the very many proofs you have given him of it.

6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said Jack, meekly. [...] "I see I'm {{trespassing}} on your grounds. I'm <b>very</b> <b>sorry.</b> Thank you <b>for</b> telling me. I {{should have gone}} on {{a mile or two}} farther, I suppose, until I came to your house," [...] he added, innocently.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is no use fretting," [...] he said, philosophically. [...] "There's no one {{you care}} about, particularly, up there; and I am sure there's no one I care about--only I {{should like to}} have peeped in, and have seen her face, when the Romans burst open the door. I don't suppose she was <b>very</b> <b>sorry,</b> though, <b>for</b> {{it will be better}} to be a Roman slave than to be going through what they have been, for the last month." ...|$|R
2500|$|Fulci and Argento met in 1994 {{and agreed}} to {{collaborate}} on a horror film called The Wax Mask, a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price horror classic House of Wax, also based on a story called [...] "The Waxwork Museum" [...] by Gaston Leroux. Argento claimed he had heard about Fulci's miserable circumstances {{at the time and}} wanted to offer him a chance at a comeback. It is said that Argento was shocked at how thin and sickly Fulci appeared at their meeting at the 1994 Rome Fanta Festival, and said he felt <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him.|$|E
2500|$|Georgiana's nephew once {{remarked that}} she thought of {{politics}} and [...] "nothing else", while her sister cared little for it. In 1838, Lady Carlisle articulated a negative opinion of Charles Dickens, who was then emerging as a successful author. [...] "I know there are such unfortunate beings as pickpockets and streetwalkers. I am <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> it and am very much shocked at their mode of life, but I own I do not much wish to hear what they say to one another", she said. Historian Judith Lewis cites this opinion {{as evidence of the}} prevalence of class consciousness during the 19th-century, as Lady Carlisle was [...] "one of the more inoffensive of the grand dames of her time".|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{publication}} of Sir Richard Henriques' Report on Operation Midland and other police investigations on 8 November 2016, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Police Commissioner for the Metropolis, [...] apologised to Proctor and others accused by [...] "Nick" [...] for the over 40 mistakes made by the Metropolitan Police service in Operation Midland. He said Proctor was innocent of all the allegations. On 15 November 2016 Hogan-Howe met Proctor at Hogan-Howe's request in Dean's Yard, London and repeated his apology {{and said he was}} very, <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> the MPS's mistakes. Proctor accepted the apologies but said these would not restore his life to how it had been before the raid on his house on 4 March 2015. Proctor sued the Metropolitan Police in February 2017.|$|E
60|$|There {{was no one}} in {{the company}} with whom Grisell was <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> to part, <b>for</b> though Dame Gresford had been kind to her, it had been merely the {{attending}} to the needs of a charge, not showing her any affection, and she had shrunk from the eyes of so large a party.|$|R
6000|$|To {{the poor}} wretch’s rapture the old king lets him go unharmed. He {{has a more}} {{exquisite}} revenge to take, and sends for Harpagus, who likewise confesses the truth. The wily old tyrant has naught but gentle words. It is best as it is. He has been <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> himself <b>for</b> the child, and Mandane’s reproaches had gone to his heart. ‘Let Harpagus go home and send his son to be a companion to the new-found prince. To-night there will be great sacrifices in honour of the child’s safety, and Harpagus {{is to be a}} guest at the banquet.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Together {{they went}} down cross the Green Meadows asking every one whom they met if they had seen the thief who had stolen Happy Jack's store of nuts from the hollow in the old {{chestnut}} tree. All the Merry Little Breezes joined in the search, and soon every one {{who lived in the}} Green Meadows or in the wood knew that some one had stolen all of Happy Jack Squirrel's store of nuts from the hollow in the old chestnut tree. And because every one liked Happy Jack, every one felt <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> indeed <b>for</b> him.|$|R
2500|$|Artists {{from the}} metal and hard rock {{community}} also paid homage to Jackson. Metallica {{paid tribute to}} Jackson during its encore at the Sonisphere Festival. Honoring Michael Jackson during its July 4 headlining appearance at the event, the band played a portion of 'Beat It' before easing into a riotous cover of Queen's 'Stone Cold Crazy'. Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high." [...] Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave performed a cover version of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] on June 27, 2009, at the Peace & Love festival in Borlänge, Sweden. Steve Vai and Andy Timmons of Danger Danger performed an instrumental version of [...] "Beat It" [...] at the Meinl Guitar Festival 2009 on June 27 in Gutenstetten, Germany. Former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach commented: [...] "Another angel down... I am <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> my friend Jermaine's loss. I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television. He made performing seem easy and inspired my generation with his music and his grace. He was one of a kind and will be missed but his music will live forever." [...] Legendary Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen recorded [...] "Beat It" [...] with ex-Judas Priest/Iced Earth frontman Tim [...] "Ripper" [...] Owens on vocals. Guitarist Buckethead wrote a song entitled [...] "The Homing Beacon", inspired by Jackson's 3-D film, Captain EO. Alternative metal band CKY performed [...] "Beat It" [...] for the duration of their [...] "Carver City" [...] Tour. In some instances, guitarist Chad I Ginsburg wore T-shirts depicting Jackson during the performances.|$|E

60|$|But though Sir Launcelot had thus {{won that}} pass with great credit and honor to himself, {{fighting}} {{as a single}} man against so many, yet {{he was still in}} a <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> plight. <b>For</b> there he stood, a full-armed man with such a great weight of armor upon him that he could hardly hope to walk a league, far less to reach the castle of Sir Mellegrans afoot. Nor knew he what to do in this extremity, for where could he hope to find a horse in that thick forest, where was hardly a man or a beast of any sort? Wherefore, although he had won his battle, he was yet in no ease or satisfaction of spirit.|$|R

'I am <b>very</b> <b>sorry,</b> indeed, <b>for</b> all this. I really don't know what {{would be best to}} do, and that's the truth. Nicholas ought to be the best judge, and I hope he is. Of course, it's a hard thing to have to keep other people's children, though young Mr Snawley is certainly as useful and willing as it's possible for anybody to be; but, if it could be settled in any friendly manner--if old Mr Snawley, for instance, would settle to pay something certain for his board and lodging, and some fair arrangement was come to, so that we undertook to have fish twice a week, and a pudding twice, or a dumpling, or something of that sort--I do think that it might be very satisfactory and pleasant for all parties.' ...|$|R
