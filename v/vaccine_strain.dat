5|$|Subsequently, Albert Sabin {{developed}} another live, oral polio vaccine. It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the <b>vaccine</b> <b>strain</b> is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. A single dose of Sabin's oral polio vaccine produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated oral vaccine produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Two live {{attenuated}} oral rotavirus vaccines, Rotarix and RotaTeq, {{have been}} introduced as voluntary vaccination in Japan since 2011 and 2012, respectively. Effectiveness of the vaccines has been confirmed, whereas concerns such as shedding of the <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> and gastroenteritis cases caused by <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> are not well assessed. We aimed to identify the <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> in children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) to investigate the prevalence of AGE caused by vaccination or horizontal transmission of <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains.</b> A total of 1, 824 stool samples were collected from children with AGE at six outpatient clinics in 2012 - 2015. Among all, 372 group A rotavirus (RVA) positive samples were screened for vaccine components by real-time RT-PCR which were designed to differentiate <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> from rotavirus wild-type strains with high specificity. For samples possessing both <b>vaccine</b> and wild-type <b>strains,</b> analyses by next-generation sequencing (NGS) were conducted to characterize viruses existed in the intestine. As a result, Rotarix-derived strains were identified in 6 of 372 (1. 6 %) RVA positive samples whereas no RotaTeq strain was detected. Among six samples, four possessed Rotarix-derived strains while two possessed both Rotarix-derived strains and wild-type strains. In addition, other pathogens such as norovirus, enterovirus and E. coli were detected in four samples. The contribution of these <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> to each patient's symptoms was unclear as all of the cases were vaccinated 2 - 14 days before sample collection. Proportion of average coverage for each segmented gene by NGS strongly suggested the concurrent infection of the vaccine-derived strain and the wild-type strain rather than reassortment of these two strains in one sample. This is the first study to report the prevalence of vaccine-derived strains in patients with RVA AGE in Japan as 1. 6 % without evidence of horizontal transmission.

40|$|Vibrio cholerae secretes {{cholera toxin}} (CT) and the closely related heat-labile {{enterotoxin}} (LT) of Escherichia coli, the latter when expressed in V. cholerae. Both toxins are also potent immunoadjuvants. Mutant LT molecules that retain immunoadjuvant properties while possessing markedly diminished enterotoxic activities when expressed by E. coli have been developed. One such mutant LT molecule has {{the substitution of}} a glycine residue for arginine- 192 [LT(R 192 G) ]. Live attenuated strains of V. cholerae {{that have been used}} both as V. cholerae vaccines and as vectors for inducing mucosal and systemic immune responses directed against expressed heterologous antigens have been developed. In order to ascertain whether LT(R 192 G) can act as an immunoadjuvant when expressed in vivo by V. cholerae, we introduced a plasmid (pCS 95) expressing this molecule into three <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> of V. cholerae, Peru 2, ETR 3, and JRB 14; the latter two strains contain genes encoding different heterologous antigens in the chromosome of the vaccine vectors. We found that LT(R 192 G) was expressed from pCS 95 in vitro by both E. coli and V. cholerae strains but that LT(R 192 G) was detectable in the supernatant fraction of V. cholerae cultures only. In order to assess potential immunoadjuvanticity, groups of germfree mice were inoculated with the three V. cholerae <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> alone and compared to groups inoculated with the V. cholerae <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> supplemented with purified CT as an oral immunoadjuvant or V. cholerae <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> expressing LT(R 192 G) from pCS 95. We found that mice continued to pass stool containing V. cholerae strains with pCS 95 for at least 4 days after oral inoculation, the last day evaluated. We found that inoculation with V. cholerae <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> containing pCS 95 resulted in anti-LT(R 192 G) immune responses, confirming in vivo expression. We were unable to detect immune responses directed against the heterologous antigens expressed at low levels in any group of animals, including animals that received purified CT as an immunoadjuvant. We were, however, able to measure increased vibriocidal immune responses against <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> in animals that received V. cholerae <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> expressing LT(R 192 G) from pCS 95 compared to the responses in animals that received V. cholerae <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> alone.

The comparison with the Serva genome showed that 35 open reading frames (ORFs) differed across the five genomes. Overall, 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 27 amino acid differences in 19 ORFs and two insertions in the UL 52 and ORFC genes were identified. Similarity among the field strains and between the field and the <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> ranged from 99. 96 % to 99. 99 %.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Every {{year the}} World Health Organization (WHO) {{recommends}} which influenza virus strains {{should be included}} in a northern hemisphere (NH) and a southern hemisphere (SH) influenza vaccine. To determine the best vaccine formulation for Kenya, we compared influenza viruses collected in Kenya from April 2007 to May 2013 to WHO <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains.</b> METHODS: We collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens from patients with respiratory illness, tested them for influenza, isolated influenza viruses from a proportion of positive specimens, tested the isolates for antigenic relatedness to <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains,</b> and determined the percentage match between circulating viruses and SH or NH influenza vaccine composition and schedule. RESULTS: During the six years, 7. 336 of the 60, 072 (12. 2 %) NP/OP specimens we collected were positive for influenza: 30, 167 specimens were collected during the SH seasons and 3717 (12. 3 %) were positive for influenza; 2903 (78. 1 %) influenza A, 902 (24. 2 %) influenza B, and 88 (2. 4 %) influenza A and B positive specimens. We collected 30, 131 specimens during the NH seasons and 3978 (13. 2 %) were positive for influenza; 3181 (80. 0 %) influenza A, 851 (21. 4 %) influenza B, and 54 (1. 4 %) influenza A and B positive specimens. Overall, 362 / 460 (78. 7 %) isolates from the SH seasons and 316 / 338 (93. 5 %) isolates from the NH seasons were matched to the SH and the NH <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains,</b> respectively (p< 0. 001). Overall, 53. 6 % and 46. 4 % SH and NH vaccines, respectively, matched circulating strains in terms of <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> and timing. CONCLUSION: In six years of surveillance in Kenya, influenza circulated at nearly equal levels during the SH and the NH influenza seasons. Circulating viruses were matched to <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains.</b> The <b>vaccine</b> match decreased when both <b>vaccine</b> <b>strains</b> and timing were taken into consideration.
