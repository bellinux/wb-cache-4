5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of <b>vitrinite</b> and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and <b>vitrinite.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Vitrinite</b> {{reflectance}} {{data from}} several source rocks of the Cesar-Ranchería Basin show present-day mature to overmature Cretaceous formations (La Luna, Aguas Blancas and Lagunitas Formations) and (marginally) mature Paleocene source rocks, mainly Los Cuervos. Apatite fission track analysis and modeling combined with <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance data, showed the Cretaceous units {{have a significant}} potential for hydrocarbon generation. The Lagunitas and Aguas Blancas Formations are heavily fractured and considered a good potential fractured reservoir, while the Río Negro Formation has been analysed to be cemented and bearing low porosities.|$|E
25|$|Two {{separate}} {{periods of}} Whin dolerite injection are confirmed by studies of <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance over the Alston Block where two periods of Whin contact metamorphism have been recognized. The two periods of Whin dolerite emplacement {{form part of}} the end-Carboniferous earth movements in northern England. They can be shown to have occurred between a period of compression from a W-SW direction and later gentle doming of the Alston Block near the Westphalian-Stephanian boundary, dated about 300-295 Ma.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{approach}} to study the alteration of D/H ratios of kerogen during catagenesis: 1)laboratory incubation of organic matter that enables mechanistic study with controlled experiments. 2)natural sample measurement that provides information of combined effects over geological timescales. The complex composition and chemistry of kerogen complicates the results. Nevertheless, most research on hydrogen isotopes of kerogen show D enrichment with increasing maturity. Type II kerogen(marine derived) from New Albany Shale is reported to have δD rise from -120‰ to -70‰ as <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance increase from 0.3% to 1.5%. Two main mechanisms have been proposed for enrichment. One of them is kinetic fractionation during hydrocarbon generation while the other is isotopic exchange with surrounding water. Anhydrous incubation experiments have shown that the products are generally more depleted in D than their precursors, causing enrichment in residual kerogen. Schimmelmann et al. studied the relationship between terrestrially-derived oil and their source rock kerogens from four Australian Basins. They found that on average the oil is depleted to corresponding kerogen by 23‰. Hydrous incubation experiments suggest that 36-79% of bulk organic hydrogen may come from water at moderate maturity. While still under debate, it appears likely that incorporation of water hydrogen isotopes is the more dominant process for kerogen D- enrichment during catagenesis.|$|E
25|$|N-alkanes {{are also}} known to {{preserve}} detailed information of source material. Li et al. studied oils from the marine-derived Upper Cretaceous Second White Speckled Shale and found strong depleted signal around -180‰ in C12-C18. The low δD of this marine samples was {{explained by the}} discharge of a large high latitude river. Schimmelmann et al. found that the δD of the oil sampled from coaly facies of the Crayfish group reaches down to -230‰ where as those sampled from algal facies of the same group are around -100‰. Such huge variation is hard to be explained by any other causes than Australia splitting from the Antarctic continent during late Cretaceous. Another special case reported by xiong et al. studied Ordovician carbonates from Bohai Bay Basin. They found big differences between δD of n-alkanes exists, reflecting that the original signal is preserved rather than being homogenized. The result is not obvious as the sample is very mature(inferred <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance R0 up to 2.3). Thus this is a strong evidence that carbonate systems have much lower catalytic efficiency of hydrogen exchange on hydrocarbons. Strong enrichment(~40‰) in odd carbon numbered alkanes to even carbon numbered alkanes {{is also found in}} some subset of samples and the reason is unclear at this point. This odd-even effect is also observed in immature clastic sediments.|$|E
500|$|Three major {{types of}} organic matter (macerals) in oil shale are telalginite, lamalginite, and bituminite. Telalginite is defined as {{structured}} organic matter composed of large colonial or thick-walled unicellular algae such as Botryococcus and Tasmanites. Lamalginite includes thin-walled colonial or unicellular algae that occur as distinct laminae, but display few or no recognizable biologic structures. Under the microscope, telalginite and lamalginite are easily recognized by their bright shades of yellow under ultraviolet/blue fluorescent light. Bituminite is largely amorphous, lacks recognizable biologic structures, and displays relatively low fluorescence under the microscope. Other organic constituents include <b>vitrinite</b> and inertinite, which are macerals derived from the humic matter of land plants. These macerals are usually found in relatively small amounts in most oil shales.|$|E
2500|$|Coal plies and {{particles}} {{have different}} relative densities, determined by <b>vitrinite</b> content, rank, ash value/mineral content and porosity. Coal is usually washed by passing {{it over a}} bath of liquid of known density. This removes high-ash value particle and increases the saleability of the coal {{as well as its}} energy content per unit volume. Thus, coals must be subjected to a float-sink test in the laboratory, which will determine the optimum particle size for washing, the density of the wash liquid required to remove the maximum ash value with the minimum work.|$|E
2500|$|... 4D Basin {{analysis}} of the Santos Basin has revealed insights about the interplay among the elements and processes of the petroleum system to assess source rock potential (vertical and horizontal distribution), thermal evolution of the source rocks, transformation ratio, hydrocarbon generation and charge, timing of migration, oil origin, quality, and volume of petroleum in the main reservoirs. In a basin modeling study performed in 2008 and 2009, a detailed facies model from the pre-salt section was built based on well data and conceptual models from seismic interpretation associated with previous knowledge of the tectono-sedimentary sequences of the Santos Basin. The predicted <b>vitrinite</b> map, integrated with all data, indicates that the Coquinas source rock {{in most of the}} eastern half area is in the main oil window, whereas the western half is in the late oil/wet gas generation window. In terms of transformation ratio, the Barremian and Aptian source rock systems in the area reached 70% to 80% today where the main depocentres are. The charge and accumulation simulation model for the pre-salt province suggests a potential reserve in the Cluster area of Santos Basin much larger than that reported, getting numbers to 60 billion barrels of oil reserves.|$|E
50|$|The optical {{properties}} of semifusinite {{are very similar}} to those of <b>vitrinite.</b> They differ in that semifusinite displays a folded texture as compared to <b>vitrinite</b> which generally maintains its composed structure. Inertinites also displays higher reflectance than <b>vitrinite,</b> except when approaching an anthracitic or graphite state.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vitrinite</b> group, which {{consists}} of various individual <b>vitrinite</b> macerals, {{is the most common}} component of coals. It is also abundant in kerogens that are derived from the same biogenic precursors as coals, namely land plants and humic peats. <b>Vitrinite</b> forms diagenetically by the thermal alteration of lignin and cellulose in plant cell walls. It is therefore common in sedimentary rocks that are rich in organic matter, such as shales and marls with a terrigenous origin, or some terrigenous content. Conversely, carbonates, evaporites and well-sorted sandstones have very low <b>vitrinite</b> contents. <b>Vitrinite</b> is absent in pre-Silurian rocks because land plants had not yet evolved.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vitrinite</b> {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{components}} of coals and most sedimentary kerogens. <b>Vitrinite</b> is a type of maceral, where [...] "macerals" [...] are organic components of coal analogous to the [...] "minerals" [...] of rocks. <b>Vitrinite</b> has a shiny appearance resembling glass (vitreous). It is derived from the cell-wall material or woody tissue of the plants from which coal was formed. Chemically, it is composed of polymers, cellulose and lignin.|$|E
50|$|The lack of <b>vitrinite</b> {{macerals}} {{in marine}} shales with little terrestrial input often requires alternative maturity parameters instead of <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance such as Rock-Eval Tmax, biomarker equivalences and other maceral reflectance parameters (e.g. liptinite reflectance).|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} <b>vitrinite</b> {{reflectance}} (or VR) {{is a key}} method for identifying the maximum temperature history of sediments in sedimentary basins. The reflectance of <b>vitrinite</b> was first studied by coal explorationists attempting to diagnose the thermal maturity, or rank, of coal beds. More recently, its utility {{as a tool for}} the study of sedimentary organic matter metamorphism from kerogens to hydrocarbons has been increasingly exploited. The key attraction of <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance in this context is its sensitivity to temperature ranges that largely correspond to those of hydrocarbon generation (i.e. 60 to 120°C). This means that, with a suitable calibration, <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance can be used as an indicator of maturity in hydrocarbon source rocks. Generally, the onset of oil generation is correlated with a reflectance of 0.5-0.6% and the termination of oil generation with reflectance of 0.85-1.1%. The onset of gas generation ('gas window') is typically associated with values of 1.0-1.3% and terminates around 3.0%. However these generation windows vary between source rocks with different kerogen types (<b>vitrinite</b> is typically abundant in 'Type III' kerogen-rich source rocks), so a conversion to 'Transformation Ratio' (TR) can be applied to create a kerogen-specific maturity parameter. The <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance value represents the highest temperature that the <b>vitrinite</b> maceral (and source rock) has experienced, and is routinely used in 1D burial modelling to identify geological unconformities in sedimentary sections.|$|E
5000|$|Some archaic {{definitions}} of pyrobitumen include peat and lignite, although these materials experienced little geological heating {{compared to that}} required to form fluid bitumen, let alone pyrobitumen. For humic-derived solids in the earth, an analogous position on the coal maturation pathway would place it at a minimum in the medium-volatile bituminous range (i.e., H/C<0.8, O/C<0.05, and <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance >1.0%)., [...] For petroleum systems, Mukhopadhyay states that solid bitumen starts to form when <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance reaches 0.45%, i.e., {{the early stages of}} conversion of kerogen to oil and gas. Bitumen also becomes more reflective with maturity, and he gives an equivalent bitumen reflectance of 0.6% for a <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance of 1.0%, which corresponds to the boundary between asphalt/albertite and epi-impsonite. Although the archaic definition of pyrobitumen includes low-maturity solid bitumens such as albertite, a definition more closely linked to the formation and destruction of oil from kerogen would define pyrobitumen as having an H/C ratio less than 1.0. In fact, the Biomarker Guide defines pyrobitumen as having an H/C ratio less than 0.5, which corresponds to <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance of about 2.0% and low-volatile bituminous to semi-anthracite coal rank. Hwang et al. found that the solubility of solid reservoir bitumens decreased below 50% for a <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance of 0.7% and below 20% for <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance greater than 1.0%, with a <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance of 1.1% corresponding to an atomic H/C ratio of 0.8. Warner et al. also found pyrobitumen in the Tengiz field with H/C of 0.8. They also quote it as having a high reflectivity, including the occurrence of mosaic reflectivity texture. Pyrolysis yielded some oil similar to that from which it was derived. Bordenave describes pyrobitumen as having a reflectivity of between 1.5 and 2.5% and a pyrolysis yield of less than 80 mg hydrocarbon/g organic carbon. From these descriptions and other pyrolysis studies, it becomes clear that the H/C ratio of 0.5 given by Peters corresponds to the end of such pyrolysis yield, even though the bitumen becomes insoluble, and therefore pyrobitumen, prior to that maturity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vitrinite</b> is shiny, glass-like {{material}} that {{is considered to be}} composed of cellular plant material such as roots, bark, plant stems and tree trunks. <b>Vitrinite</b> macerals when observed under the microscope show a boxlike, cellular structure, often with oblong voids and cavities which are likely the remains of plant stems. This has a high calorific value (24 - 28 MJ/kg) and a large proportion of volatile matter (24 - 30%). It often occurs interbanded or interlaminated with inertinite and can be recognised as bright bands.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vitrinite</b> {{reflectance}} {{data from}} several source rocks of the Cesar-Ranchería Basin show present-day mature to overmature Cretaceous formations (La Luna, Aguas Blancas and Lagunitas Formations) and (marginally) mature Paleocene source rocks, mainly Los Cuervos.

50|$|Haynes {{and others}} have raised the {{possibility}} of coal contamination, but only of the 11 oldest dates. Adovasio has repeatedly pointed out that there is no coal seam at Meadowcroft—only isolated outcrops of vitrinite—making contamination unlikely. Further, the highly localized <b>vitrinite</b> is separated from the Stratum IIa occupational floors by approximately 30-50 cm of undisturbed deposits. Regardless, <b>vitrinite</b> is not soluble in water and could therefore only contaminate fire features in the stratum as particulate matter. Repeated examination of the radiocarbon samples by four different laboratories has consistently failed to reveal any particulate fragments. Additionally, microstratigraphic analyses by Paul Goldberg and associates has conclusively indicated absolutely no groundwater movement and hence, no vehicle for transporting contaminants in any of the sites 11 strata. Furthermore, if <b>vitrinite</b> contaminated the dates in Stratum IIa, it logically follows that it would have similarly contaminated all subsequent dates as the same <b>vitrinite</b> exposures were present throughout the Meadowcroft occupation. If the later dates were contaminated to the same extent claimed for the earlier dates, the later dates would be several thousand years in the future. Haynes also suggests that soluble matter may have contaminated the carbonized cut bark specimen from lower Stratum IIa, {{as is the case with}} the charcoal samples derived from fire features. There is absolutely no evidence for soluble or non-soluble contamination of the cut bark specimen.|$|E

50|$|Cannel coal is also {{lower in}} fixed carbon than typical {{bituminous}} coal. It includes various amounts of <b>vitrinite</b> and inertinite. Analytically, cannel coal consists of micrinites, macerals of the exinite group, and certain inorganic materials.|$|E

50|$|Paleotemperatures {{have been}} derived from <b>vitrinite</b> {{reflectance}} by {{measure of the}} percentage of incident light reflected from the surface of <b>vitrinite</b> particles in a sedimentary rock from the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous formation along the Lewis thrust. Results yielded the pre-deformational paleogeothermal gradient to a range of <30 to 11 °C/km compared to 18-22 °C/km during peak coalification and maximum temperatures. These results are indicative that the Lewis thrust sheet succession was overlain by at least 3 km of additional Late Cretaceous strata, along with the 8 km thick succession indicating that the Lewis thrust sheet had an approximate thickness of 12-13.5 km prior to thrust movement.|$|E
5000|$|Lamosite is an olive-gray {{brown or}} dark gray to {{brownish}} black lacustrine-type oil shale, {{in which the}} chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. In minor scale it also consists of <b>vitrinite,</b> inertinite, telalginite, and bitumen.|$|E
50|$|Bituminous coals are graded {{according}} to <b>vitrinite</b> reflectance, moisture content, volatile content, plasticity and ash content.

50|$|A maceral is a component, organic in origin, of coal or oil shale. The term 'maceral' in {{reference}} to coal {{is analogous to the}} use of the term 'mineral' {{in reference}} to igneous or metamorphic rocks. Examples of macerals are inertinite, <b>vitrinite,</b> and liptinite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vitrinite</b> reflectance, which {{typically}} demonstrates an exponential evolution {{of organic matter}} {{as a function of}} time, is the best organic indicator for thermal maturation.

5000|$|Organic matter (telalginite) in {{torbanite}} {{is derived}} from lipid-rich microscopic plant remains similar in appearance to the fresh-water colonial green alga Botryococcus braunii.

[...] Torbanite consists of subordinate amounts of <b>vitrinite</b> and inertinite; however, their occurrence vary depending of deposits.|$|E
50|$|The {{potential}} of a particular coalbed as a CBM source depends on the following criteria. Cleat density/intensity: cleats are joints confined within coal sheets. They impart permeability to the coal seam. A high cleat density is required for profitable exploitation of CBM. Also important is the maceral composition: maceral is a microscopic, homogeneous, petrographic entity of a corresponding sedimentary rock. A high <b>vitrinite</b> composition is ideal for CBM extraction, while inertinite hampers the same.|$|E
