5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} reports of associated risk factors for <b>vertebral</b> artery dissection; many of these reports suffer from methodological weaknesses, such as selection bias. Elevated homocysteine levels, often due to mutations in the MTHFR gene, appear to {{increase the risk of}} <b>vertebral</b> artery dissection. People with an aneurysm of the aortic root and people with a history of migraine may be predisposed to <b>vertebral</b> artery dissection.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} <b>vertebral</b> artery {{dissection}} can be grouped under two main categories, spontaneous and traumatic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vertebral</b> artery {{dissection}} (VAD) is a flap-like tear of {{the inner}} lining of the <b>vertebral</b> artery, which {{is located in the}} neck and supplies blood to the brain. After the tear, blood enters the arterial wall and forms a blood clot, thickening the artery wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of <b>vertebral</b> artery dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vertebral</b> artery {{dissection}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of dissection of the arteries in the neck. The other type, carotid artery dissection, involves the carotid arteries. <b>Vertebral</b> artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical trauma to the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E
5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the <b>vertebral</b> bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive <b>vertebral</b> joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} numbers are unknown, the <b>vertebral</b> column of Megalosaurus was {{probably}} divided into ten neck vertebrae, thirteen dorsal vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae and fifty to sixty tail vertebrae, as {{is common for}} basal Tetanurae.|$|E
5|$|Dissecting aneurysms of the <b>vertebral</b> artery {{constitute}} 4% of all cerebral aneurysms, and are hence {{a relatively}} rare but important cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of <b>vertebral</b> artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the {{affected}} side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of <b>vertebral</b> and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vertebral</b> {{column of}} Scelidosaurus {{contained}} {{at least six}} neck vertebrae, seventeen dorsal vertebrae, four sacral vertebrae and at least thirty-five tail vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the <b>vertebral</b> column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
5|$|I. valdensis, a {{renaming}} of Vectisaurus valdensis by Ernst van den Broeck in 1900. Originally {{named by}} Hulke {{as a distinct}} genus in 1879 based on <b>vertebral</b> and pelvic remains, {{it was from the}} Barremian stage of the Isle of Wight. It was considered a juvenile specimen of Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis, or an undetermined species of Mantellisaurus, but is indeterminate beyond Iguanodontia.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries supply oxygenated {{blood to}} the front of the brain and the <b>vertebral</b> arteries supply {{blood to the}} back of the brain. These two circulations join together in the circle of Willis, a ring of connected arteries that lies in the interpeduncular cistern between the midbrain and pons.|$|E
5|$|The neck {{consisted}} of nine cervical vertebrae, {{which would have}} formed an S-shaped curve, {{as indicated by the}} shape of the <b>vertebral</b> bodies in the side view of the skeleton. The <b>vertebral</b> bodies of the anterior cervical vertebrae are shaped like a parallelogram, those of the middle are rectangular and those of the posterior show a trapezoid shape. The trunk was short, consisting of 12 dorsal and 6 fused sacral vertebrae. The tail was long compared to the body; although incompletely known, it probably {{consisted of}} 34 to 37 caudal vertebrae. The dorsal spine was stiffened by ossified tendons, beginning with the fourth dorsal vertebra. This feature is present in many other ornithischian dinosaurs and probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion. In contrast to many other ornithischians, the tail of Heterodontosaurus lacked ossified tendons, and was therefore probably flexible. It had a long, narrow pelvis and a pubis which resembled those possessed by more advanced ornithischians.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vertebral</b> arteries {{arise from}} the subclavian artery, and run through the {{transverse}} foramen of the upper six vertebrae of the neck. After exiting {{at the level of}} the first cervical vertebra, its course changes from vertical to horizontal, and then enters the skull through the foramen magnum. Inside the skull, the arteries merge to form the basilar artery, which joins the circle of Willis. In total, three quarters of the artery are outside the skull; it has a high mobility in this area due to rotational movement in the neck and is therefore vulnerable to trauma. Most dissections happen {{at the level of the}} first and second vertebrae. The <b>vertebral</b> artery supplies a number of vital structures in the posterior cranial fossa, such as the brainstem, the cerebellum and the occipital lobes. The brainstem harbors a number of vital functions (such as respiration) and controls the nerves of the face and neck. The cerebellum is part of the diffuse system that coordinates movement. Finally, the occipital lobes participate in the sense of vision.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vertebral</b> arteries {{emerge as}} {{branches}} of {{the left and right}} subclavian arteries. They travel upward through transverse foramina – spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and one on the right of the medulla. They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The <b>vertebral</b> arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vertebral</b> {{column in}} bowfin is ossified and in {{comparison}} to earlier fishes, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize unpaired fins. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the <b>vertebral</b> column allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the bowfin to have more controlled and powerful movements, {{in comparison to}} fish that had only a notochord. The bowfin has a homocercal tail, {{which means that the}} tail has equal lobes that appear symmetrical.This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because the bladder supplies the fish with natural buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vertebral</b> artery dissection, {{a tear in}} {{the arteries}} in the neck which provide blood to the brain can result from {{rotation}} of the neck while the neck is extended. This can occur {{in a variety of}} contexts, but is an event which could occur in some yoga practices. This is a very serious condition which can result in a stroke.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vertebral</b> {{dissection}} {{may occur}} after physical {{trauma to the}} neck, such as a blunt injury (e.g. traffic collision), strangulation or manipulation, but may also happen spontaneously. 1–4% of spontaneous cases have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the blood vessels. Treatment is usually with either antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or with anticoagulants such as heparin or warfarin.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of <b>vertebral</b> fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E
5|$|After {{lying on}} the ice for {{approximately}} 10 minutes, Moore {{was removed from the}} playing surface on a stretcher. He was treated for three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a grade three concussion, <b>vertebral</b> ligament damage, stretching of the brachial plexus nerves, and facial lacerations. He was also suffering from amnesia. Bertuzzi apologized to Moore and his family, as well as to Burke, Canucks owner John McCaw, Jr., the Canucks organization, his teammates, and the fans in a press conference two days later.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the <b>vertebral</b> column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the <b>vertebral</b> column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus louisae {{was named}} by Holland in 1916, being first known from a partial {{skeleton}} {{that was found}} in Utah. The holotype is CM3018, with referred specimens including CM3378, CM11162, and LACM52844. The former two consist of a <b>vertebral</b> column; the latter two consist of a skull and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively. Apatosaurus louisae specimens all come from the late Kimmeridgian of Dinosaur National Monument. In 2015 Tschopp etal. found the type specimen of Apatosaurus laticollis to nest closely with CM3018, meaning the former is likely a junior synonym of A.louisae.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{that live}} in or visit water have adaptations that improve their {{swimming}} abilities. The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. The webbing between the toes of the hind feet increases {{the area of the}} foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. Members of the family Pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization. They have inflexible <b>vertebral</b> columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, lateral line systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet. Tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, von Zittel divided stegocephalians {{among three}} taxa: Lepospondyli, Temnospondyli, and Stereospondyli. He placed microsaurs in Lepospondyli, a group which he {{characterized}} as having simple, spool-shaped <b>vertebral</b> centra. Temnospondyli included forms with the centra divided into pleurocentra and intercentra. All members of Stereospondyli had amphicoelous centra composed {{only of the}} intercentra. Cope objected to von Zittel's classification, considering the vertebrae of lepospondyls and stereospondyls indistinguishable because each had a simple spool shape. He continued to use Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta (which he alternatively referred to as Rhachitomi) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of occipital condyles.|$|E
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a <b>vertebral</b> column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|In older literature, the {{scientific}} {{name of this}} species was often given as C. menisorrah. The blacktail reef shark (C. wheeleri), native to the western Indian Ocean, is now regarded as the same species as the grey reef shark by most authors. It was originally distinguished from the grey reef shark by a white tip on the first dorsal fin, a shorter snout, and one fewer upper tooth row on each side. Based on morphological characters, <b>vertebral</b> counts, and tooth shapes, Garrick (1982) concluded the grey reef shark is most {{closely related to the}} silvertip shark (C. albimarginatus). This interpretation was supported by a 1992 allozyme phylogenetic analysis by Lavery.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} other sauropods, the neck {{vertebrae}} are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck. The <b>vertebral</b> formula for the holotype of A.louisae is 15cervicals, 10dorsals, 5sacrals, and 82caudals. The caudal vertebra number may vary, even within species. The cervical vertebrae of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus are stouter and more robust than {{those of other}} diplodocids and {{were found to be}} most similar to Camarasaurus by Charles Whitney Gilmore. In addition, they support cervical ribs that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section. In Apatosaurus louisae, the atlas-axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated. Apatosaurus has ten dorsal ribs {{on either side of the}} body. The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. Apatosaurus, like its close relative Supersaurus, has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the <b>vertebral</b> spines with increasing distance from the hips. Apatosaurus also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest. As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon is {{represented}} in the fossil record by teeth, <b>vertebral</b> centra, and coprolites. As with all sharks, the skeleton of megalodon was formed of cartilage rather than bone; consequently most fossil specimens are poorly preserved. To support its large dentition, the jaws of megalodon {{would have been more}} massive, stouter, and more strongly developed than those of the great white, which possesses a comparatively gracile dentition. Its chondrocranium, the cartilaginous skull, would have had a blockier and more robust appearance than that of the great white. Its fins were proportional to its larger size.|$|E
5|$|Several tyrannosaurid skeletons {{from the}} Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana {{probably}} belong to Gorgosaurus, although it remains uncertain whether {{they belong to}} G. libratus or a new species. One specimen from Montana (TCMI 2001.89.1), housed in the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, shows evidence of severe pathologies, including healed leg, rib, and <b>vertebral</b> fractures, osteomyelitis (infection) {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw resulting in permanent tooth loss, and possibly a brain tumor.|$|E
5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused by physical trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (forward movement of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of <b>vertebral</b> fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, to result from otherwise minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|Teeth {{from what}} is now {{documented}} as a Tyrannosaurus rex were found in 1874 by Arthur Lakes near Golden, Colorado. In the early 1890s, John Bell Hatcher collected postcranial elements in eastern Wyoming. The fossils {{were believed to be}} from a large species of Ornithomimus (O. grandis) but are now considered Tyrannosaurus rex remains. <b>Vertebral</b> fragments found by Edward Drinker Cope in western South Dakota in 1892 and assigned to Manospondylus gigas have also been recognized as belonging to Tyrannosaurus rex.|$|E
5|$|The {{back was}} also reconstructed {{in a more}} or less {{horizontal}} orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the <b>vertebral</b> column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{caudal fin}} is homocercal, meaning {{the upper and}} lower lobes are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, the base of the caudal fin, {{distinguishing}} this group from those in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the caudal fin, such as most fish from the Paleozoic (541 to 252 million years ago). The neural arches are elongated to form uroneurals which provide support for this upper lobe. In addition, the hypurals, bones that form a flattened plate at the posterior end of the <b>vertebral</b> column, are enlarged providing further support for the caudal fin.|$|E
5|$|The drug {{strontium}} ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and {{lessen the}} incidence of <b>vertebral,</b> peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate also {{increases the risk of}} venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the <b>vertebral</b> column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E
5|$|There is {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} VAD {{is more common in}} men or in women; an aggregate of all studies shows that it is slightly higher incidence in men (56% versus 44%). Men are on average 37–44 years old at diagnosis, and women 34–44. While dissection of the carotid and <b>vertebral</b> arteries accounts for only 2% of strokes (which are usually caused by high blood pressure and other risk factors, and tend to occur in the elderly), they cause 10–25% of strokes in young and middle-aged people.|$|E
