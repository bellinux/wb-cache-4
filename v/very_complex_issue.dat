Thus – along with the ideal operative conditions – the relative geometry target-sensor, the presence of missing plots, the measurement uncertainties and the credibility of filter predictions are investigated.

In a nutshell, there are inherent inefficiencies and hard limits on optimizing in Java, given that it heavily relies on flexible high-level abstractions, however, the use of a powerful JIT compiler (as in modern JVM implementations) can mitigate some issues. In any case, if the inefficiencies of Java are too great, compiled C or C++ code can be called from Java via the JNI.|$|E

30|$|Throughout the interview, I had a {{sense of}} being {{urgently}} asked to reassure and validate her struggle. “I mean you must have this feeling as well”, she said at one point. I did indeed recognise the feeling and recalled with some discomfort the complex and contradictory mix of both victimised and persecutory feelings from life in the field. Significantly for Jane, she had recently attended a workshop where space and time had been given to relational dilemmas, which she said had been a revolutionary experience. So, while acknowledging the “superwoman” persona, she seemed to have been finally given an opportunity to express feelings of confusion and fatigue that were then validated by others. In terms of the research question, it was striking that Jane had apparently carried personal and relational challenges of such magnitude for so long without being able to openly discuss them.

40|$|Includes bibliography. School {{effectiveness}} is a multi-faceted concept. One {{of the important}} factors leading to school {{effectiveness is}} the type of leadership provided by the principal. Through his/her leadership, the principal must create the conditions under which the staff can function optimally in pursuit of the educational goals of the institution. A very important means of creating these conditions is for the principal to try to match his/her leadership style with the expectations of his/her staff. Failure to do so may lead to frustration and consequently to conditions not conducive to education. The only way for this match to take place is to know what teachers perceive as appropriate leadership styles and under which conditions these will be appropriate. Although much research has been done on effective leadership and leadership styles, they remain <b>very</b> <b>complex</b> <b>issues.</b> Research outside the sphere of educational management coupled with institutionally based research will provide us with a source of information rich enough to try to unravel the complexities of effective leadership.

The Manchus were faced with the issue of maintaining loyalty among the people they ruled {{while at the same time}} maintaining a distinctive identity.

Over the course of centuries the Manchus were gradually assimilated into the Chinese culture and eventually many Manchus identified themselves as a people of China.|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{infection}} {{is still to}} be considered a major public health problem in those 106 countries where the risk of contracting the infection with {{one or more of the}} Plasmodium species exists. According to estimates from the World Health Organization, over 200 million cases and about 655. 000 deaths have occurred in 2010. Estimating the real health and social burden of the disease is a difficult task, because many of the malaria endemic countries have limited diagnostic resources, especially in rural settings where conditions with similar clinical picture may coexist in the same geographical areas. Moreover, asymptomatic parasitaemia may occur in high transmission areas after childhood, when anti-malaria semi-immunity occurs.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the degree of}} choice pregnant women at low obstetric risk had in making informed decisions {{on the use of}} intrapartum fetal monitoring techniques. METHODS: An exploratory descriptive design was used as part of a larger, multi-method study. A total of 63 pregnant women at low obstetric risk were approached to complete antepartum and postpartum questionnaires. Sixty-three women completed antepartum questionnaires, 38 of these 63 women also completed postpartum questionnaires. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: More than half of the sample wanted electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) in labor despite being classified at low risk for obstetric complications. Having choices and being in control was important to all respondents whilst in labor. Despite this, almost all respondents stated that midwives had not given them a choice of monitoring method. More than a half of the sample received some form of EFM. CONCLUSIONS: Intrapartum fetal monitoring practices for women with normal pregnancies do not reflect current evidence. Women still expect EFM in labor. Choice and control are <b>very</b> <b>complex</b> <b>issues</b> and as such are difficult to measure. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the studies}} of {{inertial}} fusion energy (IFE) the physics of the fireball expansion and afterglow stage of plasma/gas evolution in the IFE chamber plays important role for both protection of the chamber first wall and conditions for next target injection which will follow in a time scale ~ 0. 1 s. In this report we discuss {{the results of the}} analysis of the main physics processes including residual gas/plasma cooling and recombination, the effects of residual plasma on the heat flux to the target, the impact of large convective cells on gas/plasma cooling and recombination processes, and possible effects of collective phenomena on fireball’s fast ion and electron dynamics. Introduction. After a very short (few µs) phase of the fireball expansion, much longer the afterglow phase starts which occupies most of the time (~ 0. 1 s) between the shots and is characterized by the cooling of the plasma-gas mixture and the plasma recombination-neutralization processes.

Using an extensive study of the literature in management science, and applying new models and methodologies in numerous case studies, Dekkers draws many insightful conclusions including the claim that companies often evolve slower than generally expected. Furthermore the research calls into question the effectiveness of the common practice of corporate reorganization.
