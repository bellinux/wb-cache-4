40|$|Available {{machine fault}} {{diagnostic}} methods show unsatisfactory performances on both on-line and intelligent analyses because their operations involve intensive calculations and are labour intensive. Aiming at improving this situation, {{this paper describes}} {{the development of an}} intelligent approach by using the Genetic Programming (abbreviated as GP) method. Attributed to the simple calculation of the mathematical model being constructed, different kinds of machine faults may be diagnosed correctly and quickly. Moreover, human input is significantly reduced in the process of fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated by an illustrative example, in which three kinds of valve states inherent in a six-cylinders/four-stroke cycle diesel engine, i. e. normal condition, <b>valve-tappet</b> <b>clearance</b> and gas leakage faults, are identified. In the example, 22 mathematical functions have been specially designed and 8 easily obtained signal features are used to construct the diagnostic model. Different from existing GPs, the diagnostic tree used in the algorithm is constructed in an intelligent way by applying a power-weight coefficient to each feature. The power-weight coefficients vary adaptively between 0 and 1 during the evolutionary process. Moreover, different evolutionary strategies are employed, respectively for selecting the diagnostic features and functions, so that the mathematical functions are sufficiently utilized and in the meantime, the repeated use of signal features may be fully avoided. The experimental results are illustrated diagrammatically in the following sections...|$|E
