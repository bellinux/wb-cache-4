5|$|Due to the state's {{worsening}} economy, {{the primary}} issue facing the legislature for the session was a $456 million budget shortfall. Expanded gambling was again proposed {{as a possible}} source of revenue, and a bill to allow slot machines at the state's racetracks passed the House Licensing and Occupations Committee, but died in the House Appropriations and Revenue Committee. Speaker Stumbo expressed doubt that he had enough <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the measure {{even if it were}} brought to the House floor. Instead, the Assembly passed a series of tax bills to deal with the shortfall. The Assembly also began the process of reforming the state's system of school accountability testing, a move advocated by Beshear. Other bills passed during the session revised the state road plan to allocate newly available federal stimulus funds, created a program to divert accused substance abusers to treatment before their trials, and created a statewide database for tracking payday loans.|$|E

25|$|On January 16, 2007, the NPP Senate Caucus imposed {{disciplinary}} {{sanctions on}} two more NPP senators, José Emilio González, Rosselló's fellow senator from the Arecibo district, and Carmelo Ríos Santiago of the Bayamón district. The two were the decisive <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a Concurrent Resolution proposing {{a constitutional amendment}} that would turn Puerto Rico's bicameral legislature in a unicameral system, an issue not addressed by the party's platform. In total, during the term, the caucus disciplined eight of the 16 members elected to the Senate in 2004.|$|E
25|$|ENDA {{has been}} {{introduced}} in every Congress since 1994 except the 109th. Similar legislation {{has been introduced}} without passage since 1974. The bill gained its best chance at passing after the Democratic Party gained the majority after twelve years of Republican majorities in the 2006 midterm elections. In 2007, gender identity protections {{were added to the}} legislation for the first time. Some sponsors believed that even with a Democratic majority, ENDA did not have enough <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the House of Representatives with transgender inclusion and dropped it from the bill, which passed the House and then died in the Senate. President George W. Bush threatened to veto the measure. LGBT advocacy organizations and the LGBT community were divided over support of the modified bill.|$|E
500|$|Washington, Jefferson, and James Madison, then a {{representative}} from Virginia, all supported a permanent capital on the Potomac; Hamilton backed a temporary capital in New York City, and a permanent one in Trenton, New Jersey. At the same time, Hamilton's funding proposal, a plan in which {{the federal government would}} assume debts incurred by states in waging the Revolutionary War was failing to garner enough support to pass. Jefferson, understanding that Hamilton needed southern <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> his funding plan, and keenly aware that the Potomac capital concept would fail without additional northern support, made use of an opportunity provided by a chance encounter with Hamilton to an informal dinner meeting at which interested parties could discuss a [...] "mutual accommodation." [...] The deal subsequently struck, known as the Compromise of 1790, cleared the way for passage, in July 1790, of the Residence Act. The act transferred the federal capital to Philadelphia for 10 years, while a permanent capital along the Potomac was under construction. Hamilton's debt assumption plan became law {{with the passage of the}} Funding Act of 1790.|$|E

[...] The Hallowing Point terminal remains today as a boat ramp immediately south of the bridge. [...] State senator Louis L. Goldstein of Calvert County sponsored a bill to construct a bridge between Benedict and Hallowing Point. [...] In order to get enough <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass,</b> the bridge bill stipulated the bridge would have a 25-cent toll. [...] Work on the Benedict Bridge began in May 1950. [...] The toll plaza and administration building were completed on the Calvert County side of the bridge in autumn 1951. [...] The bridge itself and [...] wide gravel approach roads on both sides of the river were completed and opened in spring 1952. [...] The toll was removed from the bridge in 1955 due to very low traffic; a daily average of 237 vehicles used the bridge in its first year. [...] By comparison, the bridge had an average annual daily traffic figure of 12,312 vehicles in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 2015, Boehner and the Freedom Caucus {{remained}} at odds. Boehner stripped his opponents of leadership posts and other perks, while the American Action Network, a group allied with Boehner, aired television ads against Freedom Caucus members {{in their home}} districts. Meanwhile, the Freedom Caucus opposing Boehner's plans, forcing him to rely on Democratic <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> bills. Needing to pass a federal budget for the 2016 fiscal year beginning October 1, the Freedom Caucus, now consisting of approximately 40 conservative Republicans affiliated with the Tea Party movement, threatened to block a resolution from passing unless it would defund Planned Parenthood and to initiate a vote to vacate the speakership if Boehner did not support their demands. [...] The caucus sought the following promises: (1) the decentralization of the House Steering Committee, so that the Speaker and House Majority Leader are not solely in charge of committee assignments, (2) not supporting {{an increase in the}} U.S. debt ceiling without entitlement reform, (3) willingness to impeach John Koskinen, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and (4) passing spending bills approved by the caucus rather than a continuing resolution favored by Democrats in the United States Senate.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the first}} French Constitution had {{included}} {{a role for}} the king, it was long since invalid {{and needed to be}} updated for the Republic. A large number of drafts had been circulating within the Convention since the king's execution, and Saint-Just submitted his own lengthy proposal on 24 April 1793. His draft incorporated the most common assertions of the others: the right to vote, the right to petition, and equal eligibility for employment were among the basic principles that made his draft tenable. Where he stood apart from the rest was on the issue of elections. Saint-Just dismissed all complex systems of voting and eligibility and supported only the classical style of a simple majority of citizens in a nationwide vote. Amid a flurry of proposals by other deputies, Saint-Just held inflexibly to his [...] "one man one vote" [...] plan, and this conspicuous homage to Greco-Roman traditions (which were particularly prized and idealized in French culture during the Revolution) enhanced his political cachet. When no plan gained enough <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass,</b> a compromise was made which tasked a small body of deputies as official constitutional draftsmen, and Saint-Just was among the five elected members. In recognition of the importance of their mission, the draftsmen were all added to the powerful new Committee of Public Safety.|$|E

2500|$|From 1917 to 1949, the {{requirement}} for cloture was two-thirds of senators voting. Despite that formal requirement, however, political scientist David Mayhew has argued that in practice, {{it was unclear whether}} a filibuster could be sustained against majority opposition. [...] During the 1930s, Senator Huey Long of Louisiana used the filibuster to promote his populist policies. He recited Shakespeare and read out recipes for [...] "pot-likkers" [...] during his filibusters, which occupied 15 hours of debate. [...] In 1946, five Southern Democrats — senators John H. Overton (La.), Richard B. Russell (Ga.), Senator Millard E. Tydings (Md.), Clyde R. Hoey (N.C.), and Kenneth McKellar (Tenn.) — blocked a vote on a bill (S. 101) proposed by Democrat Dennis Chávez of New Mexico that would have created a permanent Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC) to prevent discrimination in the workplace.

2500|$|Until 2013, Dayton {{opposed the}} legalization of medical {{cannabis}} and drug policy reform, adopting {{the same position as}} his Republican predecessor Tim Pawlenty. The Marijuana Policy Project called Dayton [...] "no more favorable" [...] to drug policy reform than the last Republican governor.

When Dayton posed a $2 million study on medical marijuana with the Mayo Clinic instead of signing a bill to legalize medical marijuana, advocates [...] "bashed" [...] Dayton for not allowing suffering patients to have access to the drug.
