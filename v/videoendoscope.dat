50|$|The {{development}} {{of technology in}} computers, lighting, software, wireless data transmission, CCD-Sensors, <b>Videoendoscope</b> and more, was so rapid in the decades following 1995, that an architecture student in the 2010s can barely imagine how laborious model simulation and visualization was earlier. The {{development of}} endoscopes also benefited from the new technology during those years. An example of this development is the Urban Simulation Laboratory at the Polytechnic University of Milan, (DIAP), {{which was founded in}} 2007. At the EAEA Conference in Milan in 2013, a demonstration was made of a mini car with a micro-camera that could go into a model street, 2.2 cm wide, to record a video from the eye-level perspective in the car. The images were transmitted directly to a screen. The mini car was moved by hand through the city model. The earlier elaborate technical design for video recording was no longer necessary.|$|E
40|$|Purpose We {{assessed}} {{the applicability of}} a new multidirectional <b>videoendoscope</b> (digiCAMeleon, Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany) in various neuroendoscopic procedures. Methods A 4 -mm-diameter rigid <b>videoendoscope</b> (digiCAMeleon, Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany) with 1 sensor and an internal LED light source was tested. The device offers a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and weighs 215 g. The prototype was tested on three cadaveric heads using three different approaches: a) endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal; b) frontal transcortical intraventricular; c) supraorbital. Results We identified several major benefits of the integrated system as applied to endoscopic endonasal, transcortical intraventricular, and endoscopic supraorbital keyhole approaches. These included improved maneuverability of the scope on account of reduced bulk and integration of the camera and fiberoptic light components, a variable angle of view from 0 â€" 70 degrees, and a novel feature that can be activated to maintain orientation of the surgical horizon. Our preliminary report highlights the potential for handling the <b>videoendoscope</b> in one hand, as one would a microsurgical instrument. The <b>videoendoscope</b> harbors all its electronic and lighting data into a unique and thin cable, thus resembling a modern "all-inone" computer technology. Because of its reduced weight and ergonomic shape, controlling its movements is very easy and comfortable, even in the microsurgical environment. Furthermore, the <b>videoendoscope</b> offers the unique feature of orienting the horizon of vision, thanks {{to the possibility of}} offering angled views while working; this helps the surgeons to stay oriented with direct visualization and improved control of the instruments over a specific area of interest. Conclusions The <b>videoendoscope</b> prototype represents an HD-image quality versatile tool in a neurosurgical environment, thanks to its reduced weight and dimensions; in these preliminary simulations, we have identified optimized visibility and maneuverability as major benefits of this novel surgical adjunct...|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{laryngeal}} lesions {{were observed}} and the lesions were recorded {{with an electronic}} <b>videoendoscope</b> system using the PENTAX EPM- 3300 video processor and the PENTAX VNL- 1330 endoscope portion. The electronic <b>videoendoscope</b> system differs from the conventional fiberoptic endoscope connected to a video camera in that a small monochrome charge-coupled device (CCD) chip is built in {{the tip of the}} endoscope portion. The PENTAX VNL- 1330 rhinolarynx endoscope portion has a tip and insertion tube of approximately 4 mm in outer diameter to allow its introduction through the nasal passages into the larynx. The dynamic color images provided by this system were superior to those obtained by a conventional rhinolarynx flexible fiberscope connected to a video camera in both quality and resolution of detail. This system should be useful in diagnosing laryngeal lesions...|$|E
50|$|Special {{peripherals}} such as microscopes {{fitted with}} digital cameras, <b>videoendoscopes,</b> medical ultrasound imaging devices, otoscopes, etc., {{can be used}} in conjunction with videoconferencing equipment to transmit data about a patient. Recent developments in mobile collaboration on hand-held mobile devices have also extended video-conferencing capabilities to locations previously unreachable, such as a remote community, long-term care facility, or a patient's home.|$|R
40|$|Head {{and neck}} surgery can be fraught with {{difficulties}} in accessing the pharynx and larynx. Minimally invasive surgery has developed with the recent advances in technology. Currently, we {{have a variety of}} high-definition multichannel <b>videoendoscopes</b> and robots in our armamentarium. We present our experience in a new robotic surgical system-'The Medrobotics Flex™ System' at our tertiary referral unit. We aimed to assess the safety, functionality and ease of use of this new device in this prospective study. Thus far, this is the first study in live human subjects who have undergone surgery for the following conditions: (1) obstructive sleep apnoea involving the base of tongue, the tonsil and the velum; (2) vocal fold polyp; (3) carcinoma of the lateral edge of the tongue. There were no complications in our series and the system provided good visualisation and access to these subsites without compromising safety or success. In summary, we found the Medrobotics Flex™ System to have certain other advantages including ease of set up and use besides being reliable and safe...|$|R

30|$|For {{myomectomy}} and hysterectomy, only 2 small ports (5  mm umbilical trocar and 3  mm trocar- left lower quadrant) are placed. The {{procedure is}} performed {{the same as}} traditional laparoscopy. Only one 5  mm port is required for our adnexectomy as another manipulation port {{is placed in the}} vagina to reduce abdominal trauma even more. In these procedures a 5 or 10  mm distal chip flexible <b>videoendoscope</b> is introduced into the vaginal port and flexed 180 degrees. A similar image to umbilical laparoscopy is obtained with an image converter.|$|E
40|$|In {{the seventies}} in Europe, after the Japanese, {{duodenal}} mucosa staining methods {{were focused on}} minute lesions and duodenal ulcer. The availability of more powerful acid secretion inhibitors (PPI) and H. pylori eradication have decreased the interest for vital coloration. However, the diagnosis of duodenal and jejunal villous atrophic lesions required vital dyes and spraying coloration techniques. Nowadays, the use of megapixel <b>videoendoscope</b> with magnifying optical system associated to chromoscopy is powerful for the diagnosis and the follow-up of total or subtotal villous atrophis in celiac disease or its variants (latent CD, refractory sprue) and in other malabsorption syndrome diseases (tropical sprue), etc...|$|E
40|$|As {{the result}} of basic researches, several intravital fluorophores have been {{determined}} so far in human colorectal tissue.

While detecting faint autofluorescence intensity by conventional fiberoptic endoscopy remains challenging, the latest AFE system with high-resolution <b>videoendoscope</b> capabilities enables such detection by using a false-color display algorithm. To this end, the diagnostic benefits of AFE have been reported in several multicenter randomized controlled studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and differential diagnosis.

40|$|Endoscopic biliary {{drainage}} {{has been}} established to provide effective treatment for acute obstructive jaundice and cholangitis. A recently developed ultrathin transnasal <b>videoendoscope</b> (TNE) is minimally invasive even for critically ill patients and can be performed without conscious sedation. Transnasal endoscopic biliary drainage (TNE-BD) is performed using a front-viewing TNE with approximately 5 mm outer diameter and 2 mm working channel diameter. Finally, 5 F naso-biliary tube or plastic stent are placed. Technical success rates are approximately 100 % and 70 % for post-endoscopic sphincterotomy or placement of self-expandable metallic stent, and intact papilla, respectively. There are no serious complications. In conclusion, although further cases should be accumulated, TNE-BD and in particular, one-step naso-biliary drainage using TNE may be a useful and novel technique {{for the treatment of}} acute cholangitis...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose: This paper {{presents}} a new embeddable method for polyp detec- tions in both endoscopic video images and wireless capsule endoscopic images - WCE. Methods: This approach consists rst in extracting possible polyps within the image using some geometric considerations about {{the shape of}} the polyps, and then in re n- ing the obtained regions of interest by a boosting-based method using texture features. The performances of the method have been evaluated on a large dataset of 300 polyps, and 1200 non-polyps images. Results: The results show interesting performances of the boosting-based classi cation with a sensitivity of 91 %, a speci city of 95 % and a false detection rate of 4. 8 %. These performances are similar to those obtained by Bernal et al. on the same dataset, but the proposed approach reduces the complexity of the hardware implementation for embedded use in WCE or <b>videoendoscope...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: New {{generation}} videoendoscopes potentially may visualize duodenal villi. This study compared endoscopic {{findings with}} this type of instrument to the histopathologic evaluation of duodenal villi. METHODS: A total of 191 patients underwent upper endoscopy for the purpose of obtaining duodenal biopsy specimens. The findings were assessed independently by 3 experienced observers by using a commercially available, high-resolution, high-magnifying (x 2) <b>videoendoscope.</b> The duodenal villous profile was determined by endoscopic magnification and by endoscopic magnification after filling the duodenum with water. With both endoscopic magnification and endoscopic magnification after filling the duodenum with water, villous patterns were scored as the following: definitely present, partially present, or definitely absent. Villous patterns also were histopathologically scored as the following: normal, partial villous pattern, or total villous atrophy. RESULTS: Interobserver variability was excellent (kappa = 0. 93). The concordance between either endoscopic magnification or endoscopic magnification after filling the duodenum with water and histology was 100...|$|E

40|$|Endoscopic {{diagnosis}} of reflux-oesophagitis with special regard to computerised image processing by Hanne Witt Department of Surgery, Division for Diagnostic Radiology, Karolinska Institute and Hospital, S- 17174 Stockholm, Sweden. The {{advent of the}} <b>videoendoscope</b> {{is an important step}} in endoscope technology and it is ofvital importance in the linkage between endoscopy and computers. The Charge CoupledDevice (CCD) of an electric <b>videoendoscope</b> transforms the light reflected from the mucosainto electric signals. These signals are in turn converted in the videoprocessor unit into a digitalimage which is presented on the monitor. The digital image is suitable for different kinds ofimage processing with the mann purpose to enhance the information stored in the image. Pathological mucosa has very often subjectively a colour (objectively; difference in absorptionspectrum) which is different from that of normal mucosa. Such differences can be analysedquantitatively by means of a colorimetric image processing. The generally most accepted methods for diagnosing reflux oesophagitis are endoscopy withbiopsy, pH-measurement and manometry. No universally accepted classification system for theendoscopic staging of reflux oesophagitis exists, but the Savary-Miller classification is the mostcommonly used. Computerized quantification of the extent of the mucosal lesions by means ofcolour analysis of the endoscopic images could allow us to establish a more objectiveclassification system of reflux oesophagitis. The important role of the microcirculation in the mucosa in the gastrointestinal tract has beenemphasized in the development and healing of peptic ulcerations and other gastrointestinaldiseases. An estimation of the mucosal hemoglobin content appears to by important inelucidating the role of the mucosal blood flow in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinaldiseases. The greater part of the pigments in the mucosa in the gastrointestinal tract arehemoglobin. Light from the endoscope is composed of the three primary colours (red, greenand blue). The hemoglobin will absorb the green light but reflect most of the red light. Therefore it is possible to estimate the hemoglobin content in the mucosa using the differenceof the intensity of the red and green light. Endoscopic real-time analysis of the mucosalhemoglobin content in the oesophageal mucosa can by done by combining reflectancespectrophotometry with electronic endoscopy and an image processing system.

40|$|Aim of {{this report}} is to {{introduce}} {{the use of a}} new high resolution magnifying endoscope in the endoscopic examination of the upper aerodigestive tract and discuss the usefulness of this tool in the diagnosis of laryngeal lesions. A total of 26 patients presenting various laryngeal disorders were examined by means of an electronic <b>videoendoscope</b> and a high resolution magnifying endoscope. The images obtained were examined and compared. High resolution high magnification endoscopic examination allowed a better description of the laryngeal lesions (colour, extension and thickness of the lesion, irregularities in surface and borders) with easy characterisation of aspect of neighbouring laryngeal mucosa especially in pre-malignant lesions. Furthermore, the optical magnifying zoom does not require a close approach to the laryngeal mucosa, therefore, local anaesthesia is not required. In conclusion, the high resolution magnified images obtained with this new tool provide important information on the characteristics of the laryngeal structures. This new endoscopic technology, as already occurred in gastric, oesophageal and colorectal disorders, could also be improved by using chromo-endoscopy and other vital stain techniques in order to provide useful information concerning pre-neoplastic lesions of the larynx...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} a technique of endoscopic harvesting of autogenous fascia lata. METHODS: A retrospective, noncomparative clinical study {{to evaluate the}} technique of <b>videoendoscope</b> assistance in harvesting autogenous fascia lata was conducted during a 1 -year period in 2002. A small incision approximately 2 cm long is made over the lateral aspect of the thigh, either as a low or high approach. A sheathed 4 -mm rigid 0 - or 30 -degree endoscope is used to visualize {{the length of the}} fascia lata along both its superficial aspect and its undersurface. Standard endoscopic brow lifting instruments are then used to dissect a length of fascia under direct visualization. RESULTS: Three patients underwent harvesting of autogenous fascia lata under endoscopic visualization (2 high-thigh and 1 low-thigh technique). Adequate lengths of fascia lata, approximately 12 cm long, were harvested and no complications occurred. The endoscope was particularly useful in identifying the anatomical structures adjacent to the fascia. The technique was easy to use, but took twice as long as traditional harvesting techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Videoendoscopy allows complete visualization of anatomical structures during harvesting of autogenous fascia lata. It highlights the anatomy for teaching and provides an alternative approach to conventional harvesting methods. Malhotra, Raman; Selva, Dinesh; Olver, Jane M...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the feasibility of detecting high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early cancer (EC) in Barrett's esophagus (BE) with a prototype video autofluorescence endoscope. Methods: Sixty patients with BE were evaluated with a prototype, high-resolution <b>videoendoscope</b> that has separate charge-coupled devices for white light endoscopy (WLE) and autofluorescence imaging (AFT). Nondysplastic BE appears green on AFT, whereas potentially neoplastic areas appear blue/violet. The BE was first screened with WLE for visible abnormalities and then was examined by AFT to detect additional lesions. Lesions that raised a suspicion of neoplasia and control areas that were normal on AFT were sampled for histopathologic assessment. Finally, random 4 -quadrant biopsy specimens were obtained at 2 -cm intervals. Results: A diagnosis of HGD/EC was made in 22 patients; one patient had no visible abnormality, and 21 had endoscopically detectable areas with HGD/EC. In 6 of the latter 21 patients, the HGD/EC was detected with AFT alone; in another patient, HGD/EC was detected with AFT and random biopsies. In 14 patients, HGD/EC was detected with both WLE and AFT; in 3 of these 14 patients, additional lesions containing HGD/EC were detected by AFT alone. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that video AFT may improve the detection of HGD/EC in patients with B...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{accuracy}} of Methylene Blue (MB) targeted biopsies with random biopsies in detecting intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia in the follow-up of patients after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. METHODS: Thirty patients (21 Billroth II, 9 Billroth 1) for cancer, referred to the Gastroenterology Unit for an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), were enrolled. All endoscopies were performed with a high-resolution <b>videoendoscope</b> with an adjustable image magnification: EG- 485 ZH (Fujinon, Omiya, Japan). During EGD three random biopsies were taken in the stomach and, after staining with MB, three targeted biopsies were taken from every stained area. RESULTS: In 28 patients traditional endoscopy showed hyperemia of the anastomosis, in 2 patients a lesion. After MB in 6 / 30 there were stained area (2 lesions seen with traditional endoscopy and 4 blue areas in other patients). As regards histology: 24 patients showed inflammation, while 2 patients with alterations in traditional endoscopy and with MB showed metaplasia and high grade dysplasia. In 4 / 30 (13. 3 %) patients MB guided biopsies showed significant lesions (3 intestinal metaplasia, 1 low grade dysplasia) while random biopsies showed only inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: After partial gastrectomy, the mucosa of the residual stomach usually undergoes severe changes, and these lesions {{are known to be}} pre-cancerous. The diagnostic accuracy of the MB technique seems to be superior to random biopsies for identification of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and may be helpful in targeting biopsies and early endoscopic treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: Bleeding from {{hemorrhoids}} is the commonest {{cause of}} rectal bleeding in adults. Injection sclerotherapy of internal hemorrhoids {{is one of}} the non-surgical treatments, and is simple, safe and feasible. Conventionally sclerotherapy is performed with rigid proctoscope which has limitations of maneuverability, narrower field of vision and documentation compared to flexible <b>videoendoscope.</b> Therefore, we assessed the efficacy and safety of video-colonoscopic sclerotherapy for bleeding internal hemorrhides. Methods: Seventy-nine patients of bleeding internal hemorrhoids were subjected to colonoscopic sclerotherapy using 1. 5 % polidocanol in retroflexed or forward viewing positions. Success of treatment was defined as cessation of bleeding for six weeks. Patients were observed for complications and were followed up regularly for 3 months. Results: A total of 79 evaluable patients, 61 had grade II and 18 had grade III hemorrhoids. There was no statistically significant differences in achieving excellent or good results for control of bleeding between patients with grade II and grade III hemorrhoids (100 % vs 94, 5 %; p> 0. 05). The number of sessions of sclerotherapy required were significantly more in grade II than grade III hemorrhoids (1. 1 ± 0. 3 vs 1. 3 ± 0. 7; p = 0. 04). No significant complications were noted except for bloating in ten patients (12. 6 %) and rectal pain in 6 (7. 6 %) patients. Median time taken for the procedure was 30 minutes. Conclusions: Video-endoscopic sclerotherapy is safe, well-tolerated and effective treatment for bleeding internal hemorrhoids...|$|E
40|$|Background: Wireless capsule {{endoscopy}} (WCE) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important investigations for small bowel examination. Although newer-generation WCE is equipped with a real-time viewer, the role of this advancement in daily practice remains unknown. Objective: Our purpose was to determine the role of the real-time viewer for monitoring of the <b>videoendoscope</b> passage through the upper GI tract. Design: Case-control comparison. Setting: Single tertiary referral center. Patients: Forty-five consecutive patients who underwent capsule endoscopy in a 12 -month period were studied. Twenty-seven patients received conventional WCE, whereas 18 patients were examined by real-time WCE. Passage into the small bowel was monitored with the real-time viewer in the second group of patients. Gastric transit time and the rate of complete small bowel examination were compared. Interventions: On-demand polyethylene glycol and erythromycin were prescribed according to the progress as viewed by the real-time monitor. Main Outcome Measurements: Small bowel examination completion rate and gastric transit time. Results: Small bowel examination was completed in 19 (70. 4 %) and 17 (94. 4 %) patients undergoing conventional and real-time WCE, respectively (P =. 048). With the real-time monitoring and on-demand preparations, gastric passage time was significantly reduced (100 vs 59 minutes, P =. 02). Limitations: Nonrandomized study. Conclusions: The use of the real-time viewer may help to secure the passage of the capsule endoscope into the small bowel and hence result in a higher rate of complete small bowel examination. © 2007 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Compared to rigid arthroscopic optics, a {{flexible}} camera system offers theoretically significant advantages: It {{has the potential}} to adapt to the naturally curved surface of joints, to move within the joint without stress to the cartilage or capsule and thereby {{to reduce the number of}} portals needed. Former studies evaluated flexible fiberoptic systems which were insufficient regarding image resolution. This is the first report on a new flexible <b>videoendoscope</b> with the so called "chip-on-the-tip" technology used in human joints. METHODS: With a plasma sterilized 3. 9 diameter flexible video endoscopy system (Visera ENF V, OLYMPUS) commonly used in diagnostic rhino-laryngoscopy, we performed preliminary testing in cadaveric knee joints. After successful feasibility testing we utilized the tool in two qualitative diagnostic knee and five hip arthroscopies in combination with conventional rigid 30 ° and 70 ° arthroscopes (STORZ). RESULTS: Qualitative evaluation showed superior visualisation of the posterior aspects of the knee joint as insertion of the posterior medial and lateral meniscal horn, tibial insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament and the posterolateral capsulo-ligamentous corner with acceptable image resolution and clarity compared to the rigid arthroscope. In the hip, it was possible to pass around the femoral neck, avoiding additional portals. There seemed to be virtually no risk for cartilage damage at all. Difficulties of the system were scope handling, navigation and orientation within the joint as well as potential damage to the tool itself. CONCLUSION: This is to our knowledge the first report on flexible videoarthroscopy. Some of the expectations were met, such as to reach virtually every corner the joint with minimal risk for the cartilage or other joint structures and with acceptable image quality. However, there are many significant disadvantages which question the routine use of such a videoendoscopic system with its present technical features...|$|E
