40|$|Dense enough compact {{objects were}} {{recently}} shown {{to lead to}} an exponentially fast increase of the vacuum energy density for some free scalar fields properly coupled to the spacetime curvature {{as a consequence of}} a tachyonic-like instability. Once the effect is triggered, the star energy density would be overwhelmed by the vacuum energy density in a few milliseconds. This demands that eventually geometry and field evolve to a new configuration to bring the <b>vacuum</b> <b>back</b> to a stationary regime. Here, we show that the vacuum fluctuations built up during the unstable epoch lead to particle creation in the final stationary state when the tachyonic instability ceases. The amount of created particles depends mostly on the duration of the unstable epoch and final stationary configuration, which are open issues at this point. We emphasize that the particle creation coming from the tachyonic instability will occur even in the adiabatic limit, where the spacetime geometry changes arbitrarily slowly, and therefore is quite distinct from the usual particle creation due to the change in the background geometry.

The parametric computational investigation considers rarefaction effects with Knudsen number Kn= 0. 481, 0. 962, 4. 81, geometric effects with nanochannel aspect ratios of (L/H) from AR= 1, 10, 100, and back-pressure effects with imposed pressures from 0 to 200 kPa. The computational domain features a buffer region upstream of the inlet and the nanochannel walls {{are assumed to}} be diffusively reflecting at the free stream temperature of 273 K. The flow analysis is based on the phase space distributions while macroscopic flow variables sampled in cells along the centerline are used to corroborate the microscopic analysis. The phase-space distributions show the formation of a disturbance region ahead of the inlet due to slow particles backstreaming through the inlet and the formation of a density enhancement with its maximum inside the nanochannel. Velocity phase-space distributions show a low-speed particle population generated inside the nanochannel due to wall collisions which is superimposed with the free stream high-speed population. The mean velocity decreases, while the number density increases in the buffer region. The translational temperature increases in the buffer region and reaches its maximum near the inlet. For AR = 10, 100 nanochannels the gas reaches near equilibrium with the wall temperature. The heat transfer rate is largest near the inlet region where nonequilibrium effects are dominant. For Kn = 0. 481, 0. 962, 4. 81, <b>vacuum</b> <b>back</b> pressure, and AR= 1, the nanoflow is supersonic throughout the nanochannel, while for AR= 10, 100, the nanoflow is subsonic at the inlet and becomes sonic at the outlet.

For Kn= 0. 962 and AR= 10, the outlet pressure nearly matches the imposed back pressure with the nanoflow becoming sonic at 40 kPa and subsonic at 100 kPa.

50|$|Turbomolecular pumps must {{operate at}} very high speeds, and the {{friction}} heat buildup imposes design limitations. Some turbomolecular pumps use magnetic bearings to reduce friction and oil contamination. Because the magnetic bearings and the temperature cycles allow for only a limited clearance between rotor and stator, the blades at the high pressure stages are somewhat degenerated into a single helical foil each. Laminar flow cannot be used for pumping, because laminar turbines stall when not used at the designed flow. The pump can be cooled down to improve the compression, but should not be so cold as to condense ice on the blades.When a turbopump is stopped, the oil from the <b>backing</b> <b>vacuum</b> may backstream through the turbopump and contaminate the chamber. One way to prevent this is to introduce a laminar flow of nitrogen through the pump. The transition from vacuum to nitrogen and from a running to a still turbopump has to be synchronized precisely to avoid mechanical stress to the pump and overpressure at the exhaust. A thin membrane and a valve at the exhaust should be added to protect the turbopump from excessive back pressure (e.g. after a power failure or leaks in the <b>backing</b> <b>vacuum).</b>|$|R

In the simplest case two possible equilibrium points exist, one at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature for an asymptotic de Sitter universe embedded in an Anti-de Sitter bulk and another with a non-zero density on the brane universe. We calculate various limiting cases of Wightman functions in N-dimensional AdS spacetime and show explicitly that the Unruh effect only occurs for accelerations above the mass scale of the spacetime.

Three meteorites, NWA 2828 (PEL ID 00000887), Al Haggounia (PEL ID 00000888), and Dhofar 959 (PEL ID 00000889), were used in this experiment. All the samples were reduced in the grain size fraction < 125 µm and stored in a desiccator before measuring. Each sample was poured in one from a set of identical stainless steel cups, having 5 mm thick bottom, internal diameter 50 mm, rim thickness 2 mm, and 20 mm total height. Emissivity of the samples was measured {{by means of a}} Bruker Vertex 80 V coupled to an emissivity chamber (equipped with a rotating carousel to measure several samples without breaking the vacuum), both evacuable to < 1 mbar. The dry samples were placed in the emissivity chamber, each of them having a temperature sensor in contact with the surface of the sample, reading the effective temperature of the emitting skin. The “dry” meteorites were measured in vacuum (0. 8 mbar) at 70 ° C on the sample surface, successively liquid formamide was vaporized on the samples surface, the cup was immediately transferred in the emissivity chamber, and evacuated. Each sample was measured at 70 °, 100 °, 140 °, and 200 ° C. Then each cup was cooled in <b>vacuum</b> and put <b>back</b> in the desiccator. For each sample after this thermal processing, a small amount of heated material was used to fill a cup for reflectance measurements. Since cold reflectance measurements cannot be compared with hot emissivity, those measurements have been taken to better understand the processes happening in the moisturized soil after heating. For all of the samples, when heating at 70 °C we noticed in the emissivity spectra strong signatures attributable to liquid formamide. We interpret them as being originated from a column of hot vaporized formamide, lying above the sample surface. For all the samples this effect vanished already at 100 °C, probably due to complete evaporation of liquid formamide that was deposited on the meteorite sample surfaces. However, all the spectra measured at 100 ° and 140 ° C show signs of the presence of formamide, that we infer from comparing them with the 70 ° C dry measurement of the same sample. For 2 samples out of 3, when heating at 200 °C (and only there) a new feature appears at 7. 08 µm. This band is very close to a similar band that liquid formamide has at 7. 19 µm, and that was even present in all the spectra of wet meteorites taken at 70 °C. We interpret this band shift as a possible sign of interaction of formamide with the catalyst (the meteorite powder) : the CH bend responsible for that is probably strengthening...|$|R
