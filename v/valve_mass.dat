Background. Estimates of the prevalence of valve disease in systemic lupus erythematosus have been higher in autopsy series than in clinical studies using transthoracic echocardiography. Antiphospholipid antibodies have been suggested to be a primary pathogenetic factor. Methods. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed on 1) 54 patients with lupus erythematosus, 22 of them with (group I) and 32 without (group II) antiphospholipid antibody; 2) on 10 patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (group III); and 3) on 35 normal subjects (group IV). Results. Patients in groups I and III had similar types and concentrations of antibodies. Leaflet thickeningwas found in 50 % of group I, 47 % of group II, 10 % of group III and 9 % of group IV patients (group I or II vs. group III or IV, p < 0. 03). Leaflet thickening in patients with lupus erythematosus was diffuse; it usually involved the mitral and aortic valves and was associated with valve regurgitation (73 %) or <b>valve</b> <b>masses</b> (50 %). <b>Valve</b> masseswere observed in 41 % of group I, 25 % of group II, 10 % of group III and in none of group IV patients (group I or II vs. group IV, p < 0. 002). Most <b>valve</b> <b>masses</b> in patients with lupus erythematosus were located near the base on the atrial side of the mitral valve or on the vessel side of the aortic valve, had variable size (0. 2 to 0. 85 cm 2), shape and echodensity.

Moderate or severe regurgitant lesions were noted in 27 % of group I and 25 % of group II patients. Conclusions. Lupus erythematosus valve disease is frequent (74 %) regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} antiphospholipid antipodies.

This valve {{will be used}} to inject air and to impart momentum to the flow inside the first stage of a multi-stage compressor. The valve was designed to deliver a maximum mass flow of 0. 22 lbm/s (0. 1 kg/s) with a maximum valve throat area of 0. 12 sq. in (80 sq. mm), a 100 psid (689 KPA) pressure difference across the valve and a 68 F, (20 C) air supply. It was assumed that the <b>valve</b> <b>mass</b> flow rate would be proportional to the valve orifice area. A static flow calibration revealed a nonlinear valve orifice area to mass flow relationship which limits the maximum flow rate that the valve can deliver.

40|$|Pressure-actuated {{reed valves}} play an {{important}} role in the compression process of a refrigerator compressor. The material properties and geometrical parameters of the valve and geometrical properties of valve port determine the flow coefficient which in turn impacts the compressor efficiency. Also, the moving mass of the valve and its stiffness governs the transient response (valve flutter) which impacts life and reliability of the valve in operation. Therefore, it is imperative to carefully design the reed valves to maximize compressor performance while meeting the above requirements. The design of reed valves involves determining the geometrical parameters (length, width and thickness) and material properties (type of steel etc.). These properties are chosen such that they correspond to the desired mass and stiffness of the valve. This work mainly focuses on determining the basic valve topology (geometrical parameters) with the desired mass and stiffness of the reed valve as design constraints. In order to obtain the optimum reed <b>valve</b> <b>mass</b> and stiffness values, an in-house system level performance simulation model is used. An analytical finite element based model has been built that searches for geometrical parameters which meets both target valve parameters and material limitations for reliability and life. This provides multiple valve designs with different geometrical parameters and gives the designer the flexibility to choose the most suitable valve design for a targeted application. Additionally, the basic valve topology will facilitate a more detailed performance analyses, viz. flow-thermal simulations and flow-structure interaction...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: This {{study was}} aimed to {{demonstrate}} {{growth in the}} pulmonary autograft after transplantation to the aortic position. Methods and materials: In 20 piglets (weight 25. 4 ± 3. 5 kg) (mean ± standard deviation) a Ross operation was performed and in five piglets (weight 9. 3 ± 0. 7 kg) (mean ± standard deviation) the ascending aorta was replaced with a valveless pulmonary autograft. Animals were allowed to grow as much as possible. Postmortem explanted autografts were studied by direct measurements of the valve cusps in the Ross group and of the wall segments in the valveless autograft group. Measurements of the first group were compared with the values of a separate control group, {{and values of the}} second group were compared with values of samples taken at operation. Results: In the Ross group, cuspal weight, height, and width increased significantly by comparison with body weight (p ≤ 0. 003). The rate of increase did not differ significantly from that of the control group with a native pulmonary valve. However, there was a rapid adaptation of the autograft valves resulting in a significantly higher mean cuspal weight, height, and width. In the valveless autograft group, wall circumference, thickness, and height increased significantly (p ≤ 0. 001). The circumference increased significantly more than that of the native pulmonary wall. Compared with the native aortic wall, the pulmonary autograft media showed retained pulmonary architecture on microscopic study. Conclusion: These data suggest that the dimensional increase of the pulmonary autograft in the aortic position in the growing pig is determined by growth and dilatation, that the <b>valve</b> <b>mass</b> increases more than that of the native pulmonary valve, and that the characteristic pulmonary microscopic architecture is retained.

5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the <b>valve</b> spring <b>mass</b> and all of the <b>valve</b> spring retainer <b>mass.</b> However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R
