40|$|ABSTRACT: This work aims {{to assess}} the bending {{properties}} of glued laminated timber beams (glulam) manufactured with species louro-vermelho (Sextonia rubra). Laminations were nondestructively tested using the transverse <b>vibration</b> <b>method</b> (EMlam). Then 10 glulam beams were manufactured and tested in static bending according to ASTM D 198 standard, having modulus of elasticity (EM), modulus of rupture (fM), and bending moment (M) determined. The finished beams were also tested by the transverse <b>vibration</b> <b>method</b> (EMvt). It was noted that the EMvt value was only 2 % lower than the EM value. Using laminations with a high modulus of elasticity did allow effective gain in stiffness. Therefore, {{results indicate that the}} transverse <b>vibration</b> <b>method</b> is a valid, reliable technique both for testing glulam laminations and for assessing stiffness in finished beams.

The results for dynamic Young’s moduli measured by a longitudinal <b>vibration</b> <b>method</b> and an in-plane flexural <b>vibration</b> <b>method</b> were almost the same.

The motion of CLT was detected using a microphone or an acceleration pickup at the edge. In general, the first, third, and fifth resonance frequencies were obtained through a fast Fourier transform (FFT) comparator (Ono Sokki Co., Ltd., CF- 4500). However, the true bending Young’s and shear moduli were not measured in 3 - 3 -Ma, 3 - 3 -Mi and 3 - 4 -Mi CLT along the out-of-plane direction because the resonance frequencies could not be detected.|$|E
