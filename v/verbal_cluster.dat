These three {{aspects of the}} verbal system are: 1. The relation between complex complementizers, a two-infinitive system, and split infinitives, previously discussed in van Gelderen (1993, 1998) and Schallert (2012, 2013), 2.

Similarly, little research has been done into CLIL discursive features and teacher student positioning in the Spanish university context. Focusing on university lectures by non-native speakers, the present paper explores the use of two relevant areas of stance: (i) pronominal forms, and their discursive functions; and (ii) modal verbs occurring within <b>verbal</b> <b>clusters</b> that accompany pronouns. The study is based on a quantitative analysis of these two linguistic devices in terms of number of occurrences and frequency. The results show that inclusive we {{is by far the most}} frequent pronominal form, functioning as a solidarity mechanism and helping to establish common ground.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will discuss}} the {{description}} {{of the end of the}} Middle Field in AMAZON, a structuralist parser for Dutch sentences. Within structuralist grammar, the Middle Field is defined as the sentence part between the finite verb in the main clause, or complementizer position in the subclause, and the verbal end cluster. The last part of the Middle Field has recently been subject of linguistic research. It seems to be strongly related to the <b>verbal</b> <b>cluster.</b> In particular, V-particles, R-particles (i. e. particles belonging to pronominal adverbs) and predicative elements seem to indicate the end of the Middle Field and the beginning of the <b>verbal</b> <b>cluster.</b> We will investigate these three elements in some detail.

40|$|Although {{sentence}} final verbal clusters in dialects of Dutch {{demonstrate a}} large amount of variation in the order of verbs, we argue that this is only apparently so. We take each dialect to allow just one order of verbs in three-verb clusters with a past participle. In the north of the Dutch language area, the order is descending (V 3 -V 2 -V 1) {{and the rest of the}} dialects show an ascending order (V 1 -V 2 -V 3). The large amount of apparent counterexamples will be explained by independently motivated, interfering properties. First, participles might be V-type or A-type. Only V-type participles occur in V-positions in the <b>verbal</b> <b>cluster.</b> Secondly, non-verbal elements (such as A-type participles) may interrupt a <b>verbal</b> <b>cluster.</b> We will show that the distribution of the different orders in dialects of Dutch strongly supports such a restrictive approach.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of Kayne's Antisymmetry Hypothesis and Linear Correspondence Axiom (LCA), {{there has been much}} {{fruitful}} research attempting to adjust syntactic analyses to those permitted by Kayne's restrictive system. In doing so, analyses which at first seem counter-intuitive may tum out to provide solutions to old problems. Two cases in point are the analysis of Malagasy involving extensive Remnant Movement [henceforth RM 1 described in Rackowski & Travis (2000), Pearson (2001), and elsewhere; on the one hand, and the analysis of Hungarian and Dutch <b>verbal</b> <b>clusters</b> in Koopman & Szabolcsi (2000) [henceforth R&T, Pearson, and K&Sz]. The original motivation (in part) for examining L&Sz and subsequently R&T was that it is the extensive use of iterated RM which increases the computational complexity of languages generatable in Stabler's "Strict Minimalist Grammar" formalism over that of context-free grammars. It has also been noted that allowing extraction from complex specifiers created by Merge (as opposed to Move) increases the level of complexity even further (lens Michaelis, p. e.). Both R&T and K&Sz make extensive use of RM; R&T allow extraction from complex specifiers, while K&Sz do not. Although the specifiers in both cases are created by Move, not Merge, we nevertheless feel that there is enough intrinsic linguistic interest in trying to limit extraction possibilities to pursue the comparison of these two systems with regard to this point...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares two constructions and two languages. Based on the {{difference}} between Dutch head particles and phrasal ones, I will propose that the same difference exists in Hungarian. Verbal modifiers (VMs) [...] which can include postpositions, adverbs, adjectives and nouns [...] behave identically to Dutch head particles when they consist of head material only (which I will term light verbal modifiers) in that they can incorporate into the verbal head. Heavy verbal modifiers, that are phrasal, must move to the specifier position of a PredP projection; again, similarly to Dutch. I will also suggest that the Dutch particle-like behavior is not only exhibited by the traditional class of verbal modifiers. Apart from this class of elements, I analyze the designated arguments of so-called Pred verbs (stress-avoiding verbs in the terminology of Komlsy 1992 and. Kiss 1994) as also similar to Dutch particles. I {{will argue that the}} properties of Pred verbs can be described by analyzing Pred verbs as phonologically defective [...] similarly to Hungarian auxiliaries [...] , and by assimilating designated arguments to verbal modifiers.

We show that there are appropriate complexity measures (motivated by the discussion in Bach, Brown, and Marslen-Wilson (1986)) according to which the processing of crossed dependencies is easier than the processing of nested dependencies. We also discuss a case of mixed dependencies. This EPDA characterization of the processing of crossed and nested dependencies is significant because EPDAs are known to be exactly equivalent to Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG), which are also capable of providing a linguistically motivated analysis for the crossed dependencies of Dutch (Kroch and Santorini 1988). This significance is further enhanced by the fact that two other grammatical formalisms, (Head Grammars (Pollard, 1984) and Combinatory Grammars (Steedman, 1987)), also capable of providing analysis for crossed dependencies of Dutch, have been shown recently to be equivalent to TAGS in their generative power.

The analyses were executed considering three (unifying the MCI subtypes) and four groups. As the data were not normally distributed, we carried out non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests) to evaluate the differences in performance in the measures of the verbal fluency test among the groups. The comparison demonstrated that the groups differed in the total of correct words produced, number of clusters and switching but the measure of new subcategories was the only with significant difference among the NC and all the clinical groups.

In order to measure and classify the multiple intelligences of graduate, Two Step Cluster Analysis is applied. The cluster is based on their demographic background and Howard Gardner’s nine intelligences which are musical, spatial/visual, verbal/linguistic, mathematics/logical, bodily-kinaesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalist and spiritual. A psychometric test which is Ability Test in Employment (ATIEm) has been used as the instrument to measure the level of nine intelligence types of management graduates for job placement purposes. This study was conducted at Faculty of Technology Management and Technopreneurship (FPTT), Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM). Therefore, 137 surveys were answered and these were considered to be legitimate data. The results represent the dominant intelligence of graduates which majority of the respondents obtains high score in spiritual n= 37 (27 %), followed by mathematical/logical n= 24 (17. 5 %) and interpersonal n= 23 (16. 7 %). In addition, another result also shows high score for each level of intelligences which majority of graduate has high level in interpersonal skills n= 130 (94. 8 %). The mediocre level n= 41 (29. 92 %) and weak/none level n= 10 (7. 3 %) are both in musical skills. The analysis from the Two Step Cluster presents four main clusters. The composition of clusters formed significant variables for Cluster 1 : n= 49 (35. 8 %) Malays, Islam, Musical and <b>Verbal.</b> <b>Cluster</b> 2 : n= 56 (40. 9 %) Musical, Spatial and <b>Verbal,</b> <b>Cluster</b> 3 : n= 11 (8 %) Malays (Islam), Non Malays (Buddhism), Musical, Kinaesthetic, Spatial, Verbal, Intrapersonal, Naturalist and Spiritual.

So far {{has not been an}} index to verbal fluency assessment and treatment, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine normative data of semantic fluency for 18 - 69 -year – old adult Persian speakers. Materials and Methods: This study was cross sectional and analytic. Participants were 540 normal adults 18 - 69 -year – old. They were divided in 4 age groups (18 - 30, 31 - 43, 44 - 56, 57 - 69) and 3 educational groups (0 - 8, 9 - 12, > 12). The peoples were asked to name animals and fruits in 60 seconds, words were recorded and analyzed whit Troyer method and SPSS 16 software. Results: The findings of this study did not show significant differences in semantic <b>verbal</b> fluency, <b>clusters</b> mean and number of switches between two genders. But significant differences were found in semantic verbal fluency (P= 0. 000) and number of switching (P= 0. 000) between educational groups.

In this study we investigated for the first time whether there was a disproportionate impairment in two cognitive subcomponents of <b>verbal</b> fluency: <b>clustering</b> (ability to generate words within the same subcategory) and switching (ability to change the subcategory). We also investigated a possible association between ecstasy use and verbal fluency in subjects genotyped for 5 -HTT (5 -HTTLPR and 5 -HTTVNTR) and COMT (val^ 108 / 158 met, rs 165599 and rs 2097603) polymorphisms, in order to find a potential implication of genetic factors. Ecstasy polydrug users (n= 30) and non-ecstasy users (n= 41) were evaluated in both semantic and phonemic fluency. Results showed that ecstasy users had poorer semantic (but not phonemic) fluency performance than controls. Detailed analysis of clustering and switching performance revealed that this impairment was {{associated with}} poorer clustering mechanisms. Clustering was also modulated by the COMT rs 165599 polymorphism independently of the group. A specific effect of the 5 -HTTLPR polymorphism on switching performance was also found, with ss carriers performing significantly worse than ls and ll carriers, suggesting a serotonin modulation of frontal-executive flexibility. Based on the impaired clustering and switching strategies observed in ecstasy users, it might be proposed that both semantic knowledge and retrieval are impaired in this population. The verbal fluency deficit in ecstasy users may be attributable to a disruption of frontal-striatal circuits directly related with the serotonin function as well as a depletion of lexical-semantic stores mediated by temporal structures.

The underlying generalization appears to be processing complexity: we show that a variety of factors that are related to <b>verbal</b> <b>cluster</b> word order, can also be related to the processing complexity of the cluster's context. This implies that one of the word orders might be easier to process [...] - when processing load is high, speakers will go for the easier option.

40|$|The {{central theme}} of the {{dissertation}} is an intriguing case of word order variation within the verbal phrase in modern Standard Dutch. In the subordinate clause, verbal phrases consisting of a perfect/passive auxiliary hebben (to have), zijn (to be) or worden (to become) and a past participles both allow the word order auxiliary – past participle and past participle – auxiliary, without any clear difference in meaning or function: (1) 	Het is normaal dat hij ooit fouten heeft gemaakt / gemaakt heeft. It is normal that he sometimes mistakes has-AUX made-PP / made-PP has-AUX This kind of variation is absent in other Germanic languages with a clause-final <b>verbal</b> <b>cluster</b> in the subordinate clause, such as Standard High German or Afrikaans. The dissertation seeks {{to account for the}} present-day word order situation in Dutch by looking into the history of the word order of the Dutch subordinate clause. The central claim of the dissertation is that the present-day word order variation can be considered as an intermediate stage in an ongoing language change whereby the auxiliary – past participle word order variant is gradually taking over from the other variant. Next to data on the changing verb order, the dissertation provides also a wealth of quantitative data on word order changes within the subordinate clause and {{on the development of the}} perfect and the passive periphrastic verbal phrase from the thirteenth century onwards...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of adjectival passives with adverbial modifiers poses {{a problem for}} current adjectival conversion analyzes of the adjectival passive. An influential proposal by Kratzer (1994, 2000) has been to explain the appearance of adverbial modifiers by assuming adjectival conversion {{not only at the}} lexical but also at the phrasal VP level. The present article develops an alternative account for the semantics of adjectival passives and their combination with adverbial modifiers and contrasts it with the verbal passive case. It takes adjectival passives in German to be a grammatical means for generating contextually shaped states of the subject referent that result from an (possibly complex) event type provided by the verb plus additional predicative mater-ial. The structural condition that allows adverbial modifiers {{to take part in the}} forma-tion of the event type predicate is that they attach structurally low (V-adjuncts). The pragmatic condition is that they provide an informative restriction to the resulting state type. The article provides evidence from different domains of the grammar—prosody, syntax and semantics—that point to the particular structural status of adverbial modi-fiers in adjectival passives (V-adjuncts) as opposed to verbal passives (VP-adjuncts). These findings are corroborated by two psycholinguistic experiments that test the different syntactic and semantic status of adverbial modifiers in adjectival and verbal passives. On this basis, the article develops a compositional semantics for adjectival passives and their adverbial modifiers. In more general terms, the study provides an interesting test case for exploring the semantics of the <b>verbal</b> <b>cluster</b> in German...|$|E
40|$|Language-delayed preschoolers are a {{heterogeneous}} population with diverse language skills and needs. Research has demonstrated {{the need for}} more psychometrically sound assessment instruments to accurately identify preschoolers with language delays and their specific subtypes in the general preschool population. Research has also demonstrated the Differential Ability Scales to be an effective and psychometrically sound assessment measure for differentiating among preschoolers across a broad range of skills and abilities. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the utility of the Differential Ability Scales in distinguishing language-delayed preschoolers and specific subtypes of language delays in the general preschool population. It was hypothesized that the response patterns of language-delayed preschoolers would significantly differ from those without language delays. It was further expected that the DAS would be effective in differentiating between preschoolers with expressive, receptive, pragmatic, articulation, and mixed speech delays. The present results indicated that language-delayed preschoolers had significantly lower GCA, <b>Verbal,</b> and Nonverbal <b>cluster,</b> and subtest scores on the DAS compared to preschoolers without language delays. These results also indicated that preschoolers with different types of language delays would have different response patterns across the DAS GCA, ability clusters, and subtests...|$|R

Relationships between verbal ability, semantic category clustering, and speed of retrieval were studied. Lists of 30 words were presented individually to subjects with high- and low-verbal ability under free recall, delayed free recall, and clustering recall conditions. In the first stage of recall (which corresponded to the first third of the subjects' recall output), high verbals displayed a significantly higher rate of <b>clustering</b> than low <b>verbals</b> in the <b>clustering</b> recall condition. Low verbals displayed a tendency to cluster at a higher rate than high verbals during the first stage of recall in the free recall condition. These results suggest that verbal ability is related to strategy, rather than capacity, for organizing information stored in memory. High verbals recalled significantly more words than low verbals in the delayed free recall and clustering recall conditions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that verbal ability is positively related to short-term memory storage capacity. High verbals were also faster than low verbals in the time required to orally recall their initial 10 correct words, suggesting that verbal ability is related to the speed of retrieval when relatively "deep" long-term memory processes are involved...|$|R
