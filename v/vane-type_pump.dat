40|$|BESSY II needs mobile turbomolecular pumps {{both for}} the vacuum {{laboratory}} and for user operation. The vacuum laboratory {{is equipped with a}} stationary test bench. The pumps must be oil-free, i. e. <b>vane-type</b> rotary <b>pumps</b> are avoided for the benefit of diaphragm pumps. Since the ultimate pressure of the latter does not exceed 10 mbar, the turbomolecular pumps must be equipped with prestage drag pumps or with integrated Holweck stages. Lubricated bearings but no oil reservoirs are allowed on the pumps. For acquisition of a larger number of turbomolecular pumps, concrete data must be available on the properties required for pumps which are operated at BESSY II. The basic properties to be determined were fixed in accordance with DIN 28428 (acceptance rules for turbomolecular pumps) and the PTB quality assurance manual, section 11, March 1992. The terms pumping capacity and pumping speed which one finds in the literature are identical with the term pumping performance which is used in the BESSY pump test. (orig.)

40|$|The {{low flow}} rate and high head rise {{requirements}} of hydrogen/oxygen auxiliary propulsion systems make the application of centrifugal pumps difficult. Positive displacement pumps are well-suited for these flow conditions, but {{little is known about}} their performance and life characteristics in liquid hydrogen. An experimental and analytical investigation was conducted to determine the performance and life characteristics of a <b>vane-type,</b> positive displacement <b>pump.</b> In the experimental part of this effort, mass flow rate and shaft torque were determined as functions of shaft speed and pump pressure rise. Since liquid hydrogen offers little lubrication in a rubbing situation, pump life is an issue. During the life test, the pump was operated intermittently for 10 hr at the steady-state point of 0. 074 lbm/sec (0. 03 kg/sec) flow rate, 3000 psid (2. 07 MPa) pressure rise, and 8000 rpm (838 rad/sec) shaft speed. Pump performance was monitored during the life test series and the results indicated no loss in performance. Material loss from the vanes was recorded and wear of the other components was documented. In the analytical part of this effort, a comprehensive pump performance analysis computer code, developed in-house, was used to predict pump performance. The results of the experimental investigation are presented and compared with the results of the analysis. Results of the life test are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{mechanical}} equipment failures at the Laboratory are due {{to the loss of}} cooling water. In order to insure the proper operating temperatures and to increase the reliability of {{the mechanical}} equipment in the D 0 Cryo Utilities Room it is necessary to provide an independent liquid cooling system. To this end, an enclosed glycoVwater cooling system which transfers heat from two <b>vane-type</b> vacuum <b>pumps</b> and an air compressor to the outside air has been installed in the Cryo Utilities Room. From the appended list {{it can be seen that}} only the Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D and Ingersoll-Rand WAC 16 deserve closer investigation based on price. The disadvantages of the WAC 16 are that: it runs a little warmer, it requires more valving to properly install a backup pump, inlet and outlet piping are not included, and temperature and pressure indicators are not included. Its only advantage is that it is $ 818 cheaper than the PFC- 121 -D. The advantages of the PFC- 121 -D are that: it has automatic pump switching during shutdown, it has a temperature regulator on one fan control, it has a switch which indicates proper operation, has a sight glass on the expansion tank, and comes with an ASME approved expansion tank and relief valve. For these reasons the Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D was chosen. In the past, we have always found the pond water to be muddy and to sometimes contain rocks of greater than 1 / 2 inch diameter. Thus a system completely dependent on the pond water from the accelerator was deemed unacceptable. A closed system was selected based on its ability to greatly improve reliability, while remaining economical. It is charged with a 50 / 50 glycol/water mixture capable of withstanding outside temperatures down to - 33 F. The fluid will be circulated by a totally enclosed air cooled Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D pump. The system will be on emergency power and an automatically controlled backup pump, identical to the primary, is available should the main pump fail. The fan unit is used as a primary cooler and the trim cooler cools the fluid further on extremely hot days. The trim cooler has also been sized to cool the system in the event of a total shutdown provided that the pond water supply has adequate pressure. Due to a broken filter, we found it necessary to install a strainer in the pond water supply line. The expansion tank separates air bubbles, ensures a net positive suction head, protects against surges and over pressurization of the system, and allows for the filling of the system without shutting it off. All piping has been installed, flushed, charged with the glycol/water mix, and hydrostatically tested to 55 psi. The condition of all pumps and flow conditions will be recorded at the PLC. It has been decided not to include the regulator valve in the pond water return line. This valve was designated by the manufacturer to reduce the amount of water flowing through the trim cooler. This is not necessary in our application. There is some concern that the cooling fluid may cool the mechanical eqUipment too much when they are not operating or during very cold days. This issue will be addressed and the conclusion appended to this engineering note...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} performance curves for a variety of positive displacement pumps in order to select an efficient and low cost option for use as a boiler feed pump in a 1 -kWe organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system built by the Solar Turbine Group in Lesotho. The pumps tested included OEM plunger and piston <b>pumps,</b> and rotary <b>vane-type</b> power steering <b>pumps</b> purchased from a junk yard. Motor speed and torque were measured at different flow rates to determine the power consumed to move fluid in the prescribed pressure regime. The test station was designed to pump deionized water; it was intended that measurements and calculations would then be non-dimensionalized and used to predict the ORC working fluid's properties. Unfortunately, deionized water caused the power steering pump shafts to seize; the efficiencies were below anticipated and the pumps were unable to operate under the specified pressures. It was discovered, after WD- 40 was added to the water, that power steering pumps performed best when moving fluids with more lubricity. The optimal pump was selected based on how the pump efficiency affected the overall ORC system efficiency, defined as the electrical work output divided by the heat input, and the net electric power output. Power steering pumps achieved efficiencies between 34 %- 54 % under the desired ORC operating conditions with water-oil emulsion as the working fluid. For that pump efficiency range, the overall solar thermal electric ORC system efficiency would be 7. 4 %- 8. 5 % and the overall system cost would be USD 4. 59 - 5. 27 per installed Watt. Made specifically for pumping hydroflurorcarbons, the working fluid used in STG's ORC, the OEM Dynex pump exhibited poorer performance than predicted. The pump efficiency of 31 % gave a system efficiency of 7. 1 % and a cost of USD 6. 40 per installed Watt. The OEM water piston and plunger pumps made by Hypro achieved efficiencies of 70 % and 81 %, respectively, under the same ORC operating conditions described above. (cont) For those pump efficiencies, the overall system efficiencies would be 9. 0 % and 9. 2 % and the costs would be USD 4. 58 and 4. 63 per installed Watt, respectively. The most optimal pump is the HyproPiston pump; although it costs nearly six times that of a power steering pump, the overall system cost is lower when normalized over the power output. by Cynthia Lin.
