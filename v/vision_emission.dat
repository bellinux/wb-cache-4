40|$|A new Monolithic InGaAs Active Pixel Multispectral Image Sensor is described. This Infrared sensor will utilize {{high quality}} InGaAs grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy on InP {{substrate}} for the fabrication {{of a high}} speed Junction Field Effect Transistor array. In-X Ga As is a Ill-V alloy whose cutoff wavelength can be tuned from 0. 8 jim (GaAs) to 3. 5 jim (InAs). Due to the spectral windows of 3 - 5 jim and 8 - 12 pin in atmosphere, this material has not received much attention to date for infrared focal plane arrays even though the responsivities for the 0. 8 - 1. 0 jtm, and 2. 0 - 2. 5 jun windows for the water and carbon dioxide molecules in air are excellent. Steady advancements of InGaAs material growth and devices have been made, primarily driven by the optoelectronics industry and the high speed electronics community. Most of this knowledge exists {{in the public domain}} and is readily accessible. Detectors at 1. 7 pm cutoff can be ideally implemented as lattice matched In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As/InP PIN devices. PIN detectors require high material quality to reduce dark current and decrease bit errors. Additionally, the high intrinsic mobility of In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As enables very high speed transistors for monolithic microwave integrated circuit applications. The new Active Pixel Sensor technology, a likely successor to charge coupled device, has been successfully developed for low noise, high signal transfer efficiency imaging circuits in silicon at JPL. The silicon active pixel sensor technology is being adapted to InGaAs/InP in this exploratory development efforts. In this paper, a preliminary result of the monolithic multispectral (visible/near infrared/shortwavelength infrared) active pixel imaging sensor will be discussed for application in transportable shipboard surveillance, night <b>vision</b> and <b>emission</b> spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to document part of a collaborative research program undertaken by the Centre for Computer Integrated Manufacture (CIM Centre) at Swinburne University of Technology in Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia and Australian Defence Industries (ADI) Ltd in the field of 'non-contact inspection'. This research program is one of two collaborative programs between the CIM Centre and ADI Ltd, related to inspecting the quality of components in an automated fashion, without the use of contacting sensors. There are a number of techniques currently being investigated at the CIM Centre, including lasers, <b>vision,</b> acoustic <b>emission</b> and X-ray based methods. This particular paper focuses on the research work undertaken by the first author in the detection of internal surface defects in forged, hollow cylindrical workpieces. The case study presented for consideration and discussion herein is related to the detection of cavity defects in forged pressure vessels. The paper provides a background into the range of alternative non-contact inspection techniques that are available (including lasers, ultrasonics, etc.) and the reasons why some of these failed to provide the functionality that was offered by the vision approach ultimately adopted. There is nothing unique about the application of vision systems in the detection of surface defects. However, in this research program, a number of factors have considerably complicated the application. These include lighting problems and the difficulties encountered in acquiring images within a confined cylindrical space. This paper documents the techniques that have been used to resolve some of these practical image acquisition and processing problems and the relative merits of each approach. The paper also examines some of the algorithmic problems involved in detection of particular surface anomalies in components through a range of techniques and concludes that the one most suited to the surfaces in the pressure vessel case-study is the so-called 'region-growing' approach...|$|R
3000|$|ZEP {{consistently}} presents CCS {{as a way}} {{to reconcile}} the EU’s ambitions for climate change mitigation with an expected rise in energy demand. As Claes and Frisvold have shown, CCS could completely alter the position of coal, turning it into “the most abundant, reliable and inexpensive energy source in Europe [43].” ZEP’s <b>vision</b> of zero <b>emissions</b> fossil fuel power plants implies that coal can be both legitimate from an environmental perspective, and profitable {{within the context of the}} European carbon market. In this respect, ZEP’s vision reformulates political problems and priorities by deferring to the prospects of interrelated change in technological systems and mechanisms of governance. Thus, the platform’s scenarios justifying the pursuit of CCS can be seen not simply as discursive moves to reframe narratives on fossil fuels, or as transparent and accountable policy advice, but also as sociotechnical imaginaries implying promises about material, social and political organization [20]. ZEPs imaginary of a European CCS-future implicates a diverse range of infrastructural and market networks connecting fossil fuel extraction with political and societal organization, ultimately shaping what Michell refers to as “the forms of democratic politics that carbon energy [makes] possible [44].” [...]...|$|R

This system is an integrated device, self-contained in a container, which provides and producers essential service and resources namely, electricity, hot water, clean water for washing and irrigation and a water purification process that pasteurized/distilled wastewater. The goal of study is to experiment the adoption in agriculture of technology solutions able to satisfy the energy needs (in terms of electricity) of small scale food producers in rural areas with high environmental and landscape value and to identify a compact modular system dedicated to family farming to reduce external inputs and waste.

40|$|Global Climate Models (GCMs) provide {{forecasts}} of future climate warming using {{a wide variety}} of highly sophisticated anthropogenic CO 2 emissions models as input, each based on the evolution of four emissions "drivers": population p, standard of living g, energy productivity (or efficiency) f and energy carbonization c. The range of scenarios considered is extremely broad, however, and this is a primary source of forecast uncertainty. Here, it is shown both theoretically and observationally how the evolution of the human system can be considered from a surprisingly simple thermodynamic perspective in which it is unnecessary to explicitly model two of the emissions drivers: population and standard of living. Specifically, the human system grows through a self-perpetuating feedback loop in which the consumption rate of primary energy resources stays tied to the historical accumulation of global economic production - or p times g - through a time-independent factor of 9. 7 +/- 0. 3 milliwatts per inflation-adjusted 1990 US dollar. This important constraint, and the fact that f and c have historically varied rather slowly, points towards substantially narrowed <b>visions</b> of future <b>emissions</b> scenarios for implementation in GCMs. Comment: 18 pages including 5 figures, 1 table, and appendices Accepted on 27 August 2009 to Climatic Chang...|$|R
3000|$|Six {{months after}} its {{official}} launch in December 2005 ZEP released its Vision Document for “Zero Emissions Fossil Fuel Power Plants [24].” The EC requires all ETPs to formulate such a document {{in order to}} unite platform members around a shared set of ambitions that can guide their efforts to recommend priorities and strategies {{for research and development}} in the European Union (EU) [10]. ZEP's members at the time included ENGOs and research units funded by member state governments, though the majority of members were from industry companies. 1 Their vision portrayed CCS as a way to reconcile ambitious European commitments to climate change mitigation with increasing energy demands and the need to maintain global competitiveness for European industry. The need for CCS was demonstrated with reference to warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) about the consequences of inaction on climate change, and to predictions by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that world energy demand would increase massively between 2004 and 2030, with fossil fuels continuing to dominate the global power generation market. ZEP laid out a <b>vision</b> of zero <b>emissions</b> fossil fuels power plants by 2020, to be achieved through EU and member state research support which would stimulate industry confidence and willingness to invest in CCS, and effective dissemination to “improve public understanding that the technologies are safe and reliable and that substantial benefits will be gained from their deployment [10].” [...]...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change and}} its {{resulting}} uncertainties challenge the concepts, procedures, {{and scope of}} conventional approaches to planning, creating a need to rethink and revise current planning methods. This paper proposes a new conceptual framework for assessing city plans {{based on the idea}} of sustainability and planning countering climate change. It applies this framework to assess the recent master plan for the city of New York City: PlaNYC 2030. The framework consists of eight concepts that were identified through conceptual analyses of the planning and interdisciplinary literature on sustainability and climate change. Using the proposed conceptual framework to evaluate PlaNYC 2030 reveals some of the merits of the Plan. PlaNYC promotes greater compactness and density, enhanced mixed land use, sustainable transportation, greening, and renewal and utilization of underused land. With regard to the concept of uncertainty, it addresses future uncertainties related to climate change with institutional measures only. From the perspective of ecological economics, the Plan creates a number of mechanisms to promote its climate change goals and to create a cleaner environment for economic investment. It offers an ambitious <b>vision</b> of reducing <b>emissions</b> by 30 % and creating a “greener, greater New York,” and links this vision with the international agenda for climate change. On the other hand, the assessment reveals that PlaNYC did not make a radical shift toward planning for climate change and adaptation. It inadequately addresses social planning issues that are crucial to New York City. NYC is “socially differentiated” in terms of the capacity of communities to meet climate change uncertainties, and the Plan fails to address the issues facing vulnerable communities due to climate change. The Plan calls for an integrative approach to climate change on the institutional level, but it fails to effectively integrate civil society, communities, and grassroots organizations into the process. The lack of a systematic procedure for public participation throughout the city’s neighborhoods and among different social groupings and other stakeholders is a critical shortcoming, particularly during the current age of climate change uncertainty. Practically, the proposed conceptual framework of evaluate appears to be an effective and constructive means of illuminating the Plan’s strengths and weaknesses, and appears to be an easy-to-grasp evaluation method, and should be easily understood and applied by scholars, practitioners and policy makers...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} energy {{production}} that {{is capable of}} low pollutant emissions is fundamental to one of the four pillars of NASA s Aeronautics Blueprint: Revolutionary Vehicles. Bubble combustion, a new engine technology currently being developed at Glenn Research Center promises to provide low emissions combustion in support of NASA s <b>vision</b> under the <b>Emissions</b> Element because it generates power, while minimizing the production of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxides (NOx), both known to be Greenhouse gases. and allows the use of alternative fuels such as corn oil, low-grade fuels, and even used motor oil. Bubble combustion is analogous to the inverse of spray combustion: the difference between bubble and spray combustion is that spray combustion is spraying a liquid in to a gas to form droplets, whereas bubble combustion involves injecting a gas into a liquid to form gaseous bubbles. In bubble combustion, the process for the ignition of the bubbles takes place on a time scale of less than a nanosecond and begins with acoustic waves perturbing each bubble. This perturbation causes the local pressure to drop below the vapor pressure of the liquid thus producing cavitation in which the bubble diameter grows, and upon reversal of the oscillating pressure field, the bubble then collapses rapidly with the aid of the high surface tension forces acting {{on the wall of the}} bubble. The rapid and violent collapse causes the temperatures inside the bubbles to soar as a result of adiabatic heating. As the temperatures rise, the gaseous contents of the bubble ignite with the bubble itself serving as its own combustion chamber. After ignition, this is the time in the bubble s life cycle where power is generated, and CO 2, and NOx among other species, are produced. However, the pollutants CO 2 and NOx are absorbed into the surrounding liquid. The importance of bubble combustion is that it generates power using a simple and compact device. We conducted a parametric study using CAVCHEM, a computational model developed at Glenn, that simulates the cavitational collapse of a single bubble in a liquid (water) and the subsequent combustion of the gaseous contents inside the bubble. The model solves the time-dependent, compressible Navier-Stokes equations in one-dimension with finite-rate chemical kinetics using the CHEMKIN package. Specifically, parameters such as frequency, pressure, bubble radius, and the equivalence ratio were varied while examining their effect on the maximum temperature, radius, and chemical species. These studies indicate that the radius of the bubble is perhaps the most critical parameter governing bubble combustion dynamics and its efficiency. Based on the results of the parametric studies, we plan on conducting experiments to study the effect of ultrasonic perturbations on the bubble generation process with respect to the bubble radius and size distribution...|$|R
40|$|Fostering {{fear and}} {{prejudice}} {{has become a}} political art-form in Australia, writes John Spoehr in the Adelaide Review.. Great big taxes, great big lies and video tape – the politics of fear are showing on a screen near you. Fostering fear and prejudice has become a political art-form in Australia. The age of shock jock politics {{is alive and well}} with the carbon tax its latest victim. So what happened to the emerging carbon price consensus in Australia?  The vast majority of Australians backed a price on carbon in the lead up to the 2007 Federal election. Vocal climate change sceptics were prominent but not dominant in the debate. The Coalition appeared to have plenty of sceptics within it but it agreed that a price on carbon was an essential ingredient of climate change policy in Australia. The Greens wanted a carbon tax and Labor pushed for the introduction of an emissions trading scheme. Both approaches targeted the largest emitters of greenhouse gases.   A hostile Senate stymied the Rudd Labor government’s attempts to get its emissions trading scheme off the ground, giving the government a double dissolution election trigger. Kevin Rudd probably wishes he took advantage of this now. He had captured the imaginations of most Australians when he proclaimed climate change to be the greatest moral challenge of our time. The failure to get the ETS off the ground left many in the community feeling dispirited. Even though the failure of the ETS was a product of the Coalition and the Greens opposing it, the strategy adopted by Labor to put it on ice until international circumstances were more politically favourable was viewed by many as defeatist and it annoyed them. The scene was set for Kevin Rudd’s demise. Expectations for a price on carbon were high and they couldn’t be ignored. Recognising this, the new PM, Julia Gillard, revived Labor’s <b>vision</b> for an <b>emissions</b> trading scheme and a price on carbon, arguing aggressively against a carbon tax. While differences between the schemes were lost on most Australians, Labor was determined to undermine the credibility of carbon taxes as a way of tackling climate change.   The outcome of the 2010 election forced Labor to rethink its approach. It had to cut a deal with The Greens if it was to deliver a price on carbon. The compromise carbon tax path to a carbon trading system is actually quite an elegant political solution, but it had to be sold incredibly well to overcome the inevitable accusations that Labor back-flipped on its promise not to introduce a carbon tax. The joint announcement with The Greens of a carbon tax/carbon trading model needed to make the obvious point again and again, that Labor had to compromise on its CRPS if it was deliver a price on carbon.   It also needed to drive home that the focus of the scheme was the largest greenhouse gas emitters, not households. Too little was said about the government’s intention to use the proceeds from a price on carbon to help cushion households against price rises.   While Labor didn’t need to announce all the details of the new scheme, it had to do more than it did to make itself a smaller target for the Opposition. Tony Abbott wielded the great big tax tag to great effect, fuelling and emboldening climate change sceptics in a troubling alliance with the Coalition. This strategy is already unravelling for the Opposition Leader who is being forced to distance himself from the dark forces he has played a role in unleashing.   Meanwhile the Gillard Government has been honing its carbon price message. The Prime Minister was in good form at a recent Don Dunstan Foundation lecture in Adelaide, where she admitted that she had broken a promise and explained why she had to. She said “ [...] . if I’d been leading a majority government I would have been getting on with an emissions trading scheme, just as I promised the Australian people. As it is, in this minority parliament, the only way I could act to price carbon was by working with the other Members of Parliament, or else do nothing. I had a stark choice. Do I act or not act? I chose to act. The Government’s plan means we start with a fixed price for a temporary transitional period that puts a price on carbon from day one. We still have an emissions trading scheme but we will get there by a different route. ” Most Australians want a price on carbon but they are worried about the implications of the new hybrid carbon tax/carbon trading scheme for them. They need more detail about how the scheme will operate. It is clear that Labor will deliver packages of assistance to help industry and households adjust to a price on carbon. As more details are released over coming weeks, the Opposition’s campaign against Labor’s plan is likely to lose momentum, particularly if Tony Abbott continues to flirt with the more extreme climate change sceptics. There will be many in the Liberal Party who are deeply disturbed by this development and wondering whether Tony Abbott might become the next victim of climate change politics in Australia. Malcolm Turnbull and Joe Hockey are probably feeling a little more hopeful that their leadership ambitions might be fulfilled. Julia Gillard and Greg Combet have a hard job ahead of them but they look much more sure- footed than they were a few weeks ago. We look much more likely to get a price on carbon now than a few years ago. It will be an ugly political contest that will probably make or break a few careers.     John Spoehr is the Executive Director of the Australian Institute for Social Research and the Centre for Labour Research, University of Adelaide.
