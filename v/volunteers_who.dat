5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second Boer War in 1899, Guest was below the minimum age of 18 for enlisting. He nevertheless managed to join the First City Volunteers, a Grahamstown regiment in which his father had served. Its task of guarding a bridge over a railway line was unappealing, so he took the opportunity of joining the Eastern Province Light Horse, attached to the Highland Brigade, which was recruiting <b>volunteers</b> <b>who</b> could both ride and shoot. Early in the Brigade's advance into the Orange Free State {{on its way to the}} relief of Kimberley, Guest got food poisoning and he returned to Grahamstown.|$|E

5|$|Captain Fabius {{established}} a volunteer artillery unit. According to the Austrian government, the <b>volunteers</b> <b>who</b> bombarded the rebels were {{recruited by the}} Albanian Committee in Vienna. Till the end of June1914 Dutch officers were captured by rebels {{in most of the}} central Albania. They were gradually replaced with officers from Austria-Hungary and Germany, who arrived in Durrës on July4. On July27,1914 Colonel De Veer officially tendered the officers' resignations. Soon the First World War broke out and by August4 most of the officers had returned home. The rebels captured Berat on July12 and Vlore, without fight, on August21. The last two captured officers (Verhulst and Reimers) were released on September19, 1914.|$|E
5|$|During the Bush War, the Rhodesian Army {{augmented}} {{its ranks}} with foreign <b>volunteers,</b> <b>who</b> were accepted into regular regiments {{with the same}} pay and conditions of service as locals. Most foreign recruits enlisted in the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), which launched an overseas recruitment programme in 1974, but required successful applicants to speak good English. The Army attempted to alleviate the strain on its troops during late 1977 by recruiting French-speakers as well, and formed a designated company in the Rhodesia Regiment for them. The regiment already had six independent companies, so the Francophone unit became 7 Independent Company.|$|E
5|$|Frome {{is served}} by two newspapers, the Frome & Somerset Standard and the Frome Times. In 2008, a 'not for profit' company called Frome Community Productions was formed {{by members of the}} {{community}} in order to develop and deliver FromeFM, an internet based community radio station. The station broadcasts 24 hours per day and is completely staffed by <b>volunteers</b> <b>who</b> produce features, interviews and music shows. In 2009, FromeFM commenced a service to stream the broadcasts to mobile phones. In late 2011 FromeFM was granted a broadcast licence and on 16 July 2012 began broadcast on 96.6FM in the Frome area.

5|$|He was {{transferred}} to command of the 177th (2/1st Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade, part of the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division in January 1916. The 59th was a second-line Territorial Force division, formed from those Territorials and new <b>volunteers</b> <b>who</b> had not volunteered for overseas service. As a result, it was generally undermanned and underequipped, with priority given to equipping its first-line counterpart, and tasked mostly with home defence duties. The 177th Brigade had been formed as the duplicate of the 138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade, with two second-line battalions of the Lincolnshire Regiment {{and two of the}} Leicestershire Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Herchmer {{recruited}} and {{commanded a}} group of 144 mounted police <b>volunteers,</b> <b>who</b> made up {{almost half of the}} new 2nd Battalion of the Canadian Mounted Rifles; many of the other volunteers in the battalion were also ex-policemen. Soon after the battalion's arrival in South Africa, however, Herchmer's superior, Major General Edward Hutton, concluded that Herchmer was unsuited for military command and retired him from duty. Herchmer complained to the Prime Minister, who then dismissed him from the police altogether, replacing him with Aylesworth Perry, a career policeman and a supporter of the Liberal government.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Morton Blackwell, then a field {{representative}} for the CRNC to Kentucky, developed many of the principles now used by the College Republicans. As the college organizer supporting Louie Nunn's campaign for Governor of Kentucky, Blackwell organized approximately 5,000 college student <b>volunteers</b> <b>who</b> dropped 93,000 pieces of literature, posted 20,000 flyers, mailed 15,000 hand-addressed and signed postcards to friends of known student supporters of Nunn, and processed over 8,000 absentee ballots. On election day, Nunn became the first Republican Governor of Kentucky in 20 years. The New York Times and Louie Nunn himself credited the efforts of Blackwell's volunteers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1942, when there were fears of a German victory in the Middle East, Mishmar HaEmek {{was used as a}} {{training}} camp by the British army. 160 Jewish <b>volunteers,</b> <b>who</b> would later become members of the Palmach branch of the Haganah, were trained by Royal Engineers in sabotage and wireless operation. Several tons of explosives were hidden in caches in case the area came under German occupation. This program was terminated immediately upon the training of the volunteers, and orders issued for the collection of all equipment and explosives to be returned to the British.|$|E
5|$|The JNA forces around Vukovar were {{reinforced}} by local Serb-manned TO units and Serbian paramilitary <b>volunteers</b> <b>who</b> {{were meant to}} replace those reservists that had {{failed to respond to}} their call-up. The volunteers were often motivated by ethnic hatred, looted countless homes and committed numerous atrocities against Croatian civilians. After more than two months of fighting, the Croatian forces in the city surrendered on 18 November. Vukovar suffered great destruction from JNA artillery and rocket barrages against the town. By the end of the battle, over 700,000 shells and other missiles had been fired at Vukovar at a rate of up to 12,000 a day.|$|E

5|$|The Trylon Cinema (formerly Trylon Microcinema) is a 92-seat {{movie theater}} in the Longfellow {{neighborhood}} of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The cinema was founded and is currently run by Take-Up Productions, a group of <b>volunteers</b> <b>who</b> got their start at the Oak Street Cinema before establishing the Trylon in 2009 within a former warehouse. A 2017 expansion led {{to an increase in}} the cinema's seating capacity and accessibility. Throughout its history, the venue has featured a variety of regular programming, ranging from career retrospectives of famous directors to B movies and cult films. The Trylon has been well received by critics who have praised its film lineup, intimacy, and atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|With these {{reinforcements}} {{and smaller}} numbers of local <b>volunteers</b> <b>who</b> joined his forces, Washington's forces now totaled about 6,000 troops fit for duty. This total was then reduced {{by a large}} portion due to forces who were detailed to guard the ferries at Bristol and New Hope, Pennsylvania. Another group was sent to protect supplies at Newtown, Pennsylvania and to guard the sick and wounded who had to remain behind when the army crossed the Delaware River. This left Washington with about 2,400 men able to take offensive action against the Hessian and British troops in Central New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 1992 {{there was}} a {{hardened}} nuclear bunker, built for No 16 Group Royal Observer Corps Shrewsbury, who provided the field force of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation and would have sounded the four-minute warning alarm {{in the event of}} war and warned the population of Shrewsbury in the event of approaching radioactive fallout. The building was manned by up to 120 <b>volunteers</b> <b>who</b> trained on a weekly basis and wore a Royal Air Force style uniform. After the breakup of the communist bloc in 1989, the Royal Observer Corps was disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995. However, the nuclear bunker still stands just inside Holywell Street near the Abbey as a lasting reminder of the Cold War, but is now converted and used as a veterinary practice.|$|E
