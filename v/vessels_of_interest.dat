The process begins with the draining of blood from vessels to prevent blockage from clotting, this can be achieved by perfusing blood vessels with a physiological fluid such as phosphate buffered saline. Subsequently, the blood <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> are filled with resin (or alternate solidifying material). The resin is allowed to cure resulting in the blood vessel network containing a solid plastic material. Surrounding tissue is dissolved away using a corrosive chemical, commonly potassium hydroxide. Corrosion should not affect the resin, only dissolving tissue. The final product is a 3D network of blood vessels.|$|E

The accuracy of the registration was retrospectively evaluated on 12 silicone phantoms with coronary stents implanted, and on 24 patients who underwent both coronary angiography and IVUS examinations of the left anterior descending artery. Stent borders or sidebranches were used as markers for the validation. While the most proximal marker was set as the baseline position for the distance mapping algorithm, the subsequent markers were {{used to evaluate the}} registration error. The correlation between the registration error and the distance from the evaluated marker to the baseline position was analyzed. The XA-IVUS registration error for the 12 phantoms was 0. 03  ±  0. 32  mm (P =  0. 75). One OCT pullback series was excluded from the phantom study, since it did not cover the distal stent border. The XA-OCT registration error for the remaining 11 phantoms was 0. 05  ±  0. 25  mm (P =  0. 49). For the in vivo validation, two patients were excluded due to insufficient image quality for the analysis. In total 78 sidebranches were identified from the remaining 22 patients and the registration error was evaluated on 56 markers. The registration error was 0. 03  ±  0. 45  mm (P =  0. 67). The error was not correlated to the distance between the evaluated marker and the baseline position (P =  0. 73). In conclusion, the new XA-IVUS/OCT co-registration approach is a straightforward and reliable solution to combine X-ray angiography and IVUS/OCT imaging for the assessment of the extent of coronary artery disease.

The misclassification of a W as an R is a false positive. An overhead sensor follows (or tracks) any vessel it classifies as R until it is relieved by another platform, perhaps a destroyer pair (DD).

Deterministic and stochastic models are formulated and studied to evaluate the probability that Rs are successfully neutralized before reaching their destination. The model results quantify the effect of the resources and time needed to prosecute misclassified Ws (false positives) on the probability of successfully neutralizing R. The results indicate that the probability of neutralizing an R vessel is very sensitive to the false positive rate.

40|$|The {{heart and}} microvasculature have {{characteristics}} of a complex adaptive system. Extreme challenges faced by these organ systems cause structural changes which lead to global adaptation. To {{assess the impact of}} myocardial interstitial edema on the mechanical properties of the left ventricle and the myocardial interstitium, we induced acute and chronic interstitial edema in dogs. With chronic edema, the primary form of collagen changed from type I to III and left ventricular chamber compliance significantly increased. The resulting functional adaptation allows the chronically edematous heart to maintain left ventricular chamber compliance when challenged with acute edema, thus, preserving cardiac function over a wide range of interstitial fluid pressures. To asses the effect of microvascular occlusions, we reintroduced the Pallid bat wing model and developed a novel mathematical model. We hypothesized that microvessels can switch from predominantly pressure-mediated to shear-mediated responses to ensure dilation during occlusions. Arterioles of unanesthetized Pallid bats were temporarily occluded upstream (n= 8) and parallel (n= 4) to <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> (20 - 65 mm). In both cases, the <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> rapidly dilated (36 + 24 %, 37 + 33 %), illustrating that they responded appropriately to either decreased pressure or increased shear stress.

40|$|Background The {{clinical}} {{applicability of}} time-resolved 3 D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) remains compromised {{by the long}} scan times associated with phase-contrast imaging. The present work demonstrates the applicability of 8 -fold acceleration of Cartesian time-resolved 3 D flow CMR in 10 volunteers and in 9 patients with different congenital heart diseases (CHD). It is demonstrated that accelerated 3 D flow CMR data acquisition and image reconstruction using k-t PCA (principal component analysis) can be implemented into clinical workflow and results are sufficiently accurate relative to conventional 2 D flow CMR to permit for comprehensive flow quantification in CHD patients. Methods The fidelity of k-t PCA was first investigated on retrospectively undersampled data for different acceleration factors and compared to k-t SENSE and fully sampled reference data. Subsequently, k-t PCA with 8 -fold nominal undersampling was applied on 10 healthy volunteers and 9 CHD patients on a clinical 1. 5 T MR scanner. Quantitative flow validation was performed in <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> on the 3 D flow datasets and compared to 2 D through-plane flow acquisitions. Particle trace {{analysis was used to}} qualitatively visualise flow patterns in patients. Results Accelerated time-resolved 3 D flow data were successfully acquired in all subjects with 8 -fold nominal scan acceleration. Nominal scan times excluding navigator efficiency were on the order of 6 min and 7 min in patients and volunteers. Mean differences in stroke volume in selected <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> were 2. 5 [*]±[*] 8. 4 ml and 1. 63 [*]±[*] 4. 8 ml in volunteers and patients, respectively.

Methods: In this open-label, randomized, dose-ranging, crossover design, 14 patients in whom the assessment <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> patency was difficult because of poor visibility (low-flow state) or extensive wall calcifications were studied. Contrast-enhanced duplex scanning was performed on the upper leg (n = 4), lower leg (n = 6), or pedal (n = 4) arteries after intravenous injection of four different dosages of SF 6. The results were compared with those from selective angiography <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Contrast duration and agreement about the diagnosis and the confidence in the diagnosis were obtained before and after administration of the contrast agent. Results: No adverse effects of the contrast agent were seen. Overall agreement was reasonable with regard to vessel patency between contrast-enhanced duplex scanning and angiography (71 %). Nine <b>of</b> 14 <b>vessels</b> (64 %) appeared open when contrast was applied. In four cases this could not be confirmed by angiography; in two of these cases this was due to the presence <b>of</b> collateral <b>vessels.</b> All vessels that appeared occluded with the contrast agent were also occluded on the angiogram. The confidence in the diagnosis increased from 56 % to 91 % after contrast administration (P <. 0001).

Detection and monitoring of ISR relies primarily on serial catheter angiography, because noninvasive imaging methods are typically hampered by stent-related artifact.

Material and Methods—Records of patients undergoing stenting for intracranial symptomatic stenosis 50 % between 2005 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Angiographic images were graded by a blinded neurointerventionalist for stenosis pretreatment, immediately after treatment, and during follow-up. Flow in the affected vessel measured by QMRA was recorded; 25 % reduction in flow was considered indicative of an adverse change. Clinical data regarding neurological outcome were also collected. Results—Twenty-eight patients underwent stenting during the time interval studied. Of these, 12 patients (mean age, 55. 5 years; 8 female) had contemporaneous angiography and QMRA and were analyzed.

Duplex scanning correctly detected the presence of disease in 252 of 259 carotid arteries studied (97 %). The extent of involvement varied from plaques that produced less than 10 % diameter reduction to those that resulted in a total occlusion.

All pediatric patients who underwent cardiac catheterization at Mattel Children’s Hospi-tal from July 2003 through June 2006, and at Rady Children’s Hospital from July through December 2006, were considered for the wire-target technique when access could not be achieved in <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> via traditional methods. Fifteen wire-target procedures were undertaken in 14 patients (ages, 4 d– 11 yr). By use of a directional catheter, a Wholey or 0. 014 -inch coronary wire was positioned in a vessel to which access was desired. Anterior–posterior and lateral fluoroscopic views were used to target the wire and attain vascular access. The patients ’ diagnoses, ages, vessels to which access was gained via traditional methods and via the wire-target technique, and wire routes were retrospectivel...|$|E

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{endothelium}} in {{the pathogenesis}} of cardiovascular disease is an emerging field of study, necessitating the development of appropriate model systems and methodologies to investigate the multifaceted nature of endothelial dysfunction including disturbed barrier function and impaired vascular reactivity. We aimed to develop and test an optimized high-speed imaging platform to obtain quantitative real-time measures <b>of</b> blood flow, <b>vessel</b> diameter and endothelial barrier function {{in order to assess}} vascular function in live vertebrate models. We used a combination of cutting-edge optical imaging techniques, including high-speed, camera-based imaging (up to 1000 frames/second), and 3 D confocal methods to collect real time metrics of vascular performance and assess the dynamic response to the thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) analogue, U- 46619 (1 µM), in transgenic zebrafish larvae. Data obtained in 3 and 5 day post-fertilization larvae show that these methods are capable of imaging blood flow in a large (1 mm) segment <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> over many cardiac cycles, with sufficient speed and sensitivity such that the trajectories of individual erythrocytes can be resolved in real time. Further, we are able to map changes in the three dimensional sizes <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> and assess barrier function by visualizing the continuity of the endothelial layer combined with measurements of extravasation of fluorescent microspheres. We propose that this system-based microscopic approach can be used to combine measures of physiologic function with molecular behavior in zebrafish models of human vascular disease...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This was a dose-finding and {{effectiveness}} {{study of a}} newly developed contrast-enhancing agent, Sulphur hexafluoride (SF.), in patients with peripheral arterial disease in whom the therapeutic policy could not be established {{on the basis of}} standard color-flow duplex scanning of the leg arteries. Methods: In this open-label, randomized, dose-ranging, crossover design, 14 patients in whom the assessment <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> patency was difficult because of poor visibility (low-flow state) or extensive wall calcifications were studied. Contrast-enhanced duplex scanning was performed on the upper leg (n = 4), lower leg (n = 6), or pedal (n = 4) arteries after intravenous injection of four different dosages of SF 6. The results were compared with those from selective angiography <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Contrast duration and agreement about the diagnosis and the confidence in the diagnosis were obtained before and after administration of the contrast agent. Results: No adverse effects of the contrast agent were seen. Overall agreement was reasonable with regard to vessel patency between contrast-enhanced duplex scanning and angiography (71 %). Nine <b>of</b> 14 <b>vessels</b> (64 %) appeared open when contrast was applied. In four cases this could not be confirmed by angiography, in two of these cases this was due to the presence <b>of</b> collateral <b>vessels.</b> All vessels that appeared occluded with the contrast agent were also occluded on the angiogram. The confidence in the diagnosis increased from 56 % to 91 % after contrast administration (P <. 0001). Conclusion: SF. -enhanced color-flow duplex scanning is a safe method that may improve the assessment of the patency of leg arteries, particularly in low-flow states. The visualization of collateral vessles during (enhanced) duplex scanning may be misleading because they may be regarded as the <b>vessel</b> <b>of</b> interes...|$|R
