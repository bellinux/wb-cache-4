50|$|The later {{iteration}} of the Amiga - the Amiga 3000 had {{a custom}} chip called Amber which could perform flicker-fixing on any signal. The ECS and AGA chipset could also output VGA display modes. Commodore offered the A2320 Display Enhancer Board for this purpose, The board fit neatly in a <b>video</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> slot on the A2000 series computer. It supported the new video modes {{offered by the}} Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) and AmigaOS 2.0, including the Productivity Mode. Also, the earlier A2024 'Hedley' greyscale monitor featured an integrated flicker fixer, supporting up to 8 shades of grey.|$|E
5000|$|Tandy 1000 {{computers}} {{were some of}} the first IBM PC clones to incorporate a complete set of basic peripherals on the motherboard using proprietary ASICs, the forerunner of the chipset. All Tandy 1000 computers featured built-in Tandy video hardware with color graphics (CGA-compatible with enhancements), enhanced sound (based on one of several variants of the Texas Instruments SN76496 sound generator), game ports compatible with those on the TRS-80 Color Computer, an IBM-standard floppy-disk controller supporting two drives, and a parallel printer port, all integrated into the motherboard. This is in addition to the hardware standard on the IBM PC, PC/XT, and PC/AT motherboards: keyboard interface, expansion slots, memory subsystem, interrupt controller, and math coprocessor socket. (Hard disks were high-end, not standard, equipment for home computers until the late years of the Tandy 1000 line, explaining the absence of an integrated hard-disk controller from most Tandy 1000 motherboards.) An IBM PC, XT or AT would require at least 4 expansion cards for similar hardware: one <b>video</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> card, one floppy-disk controller (FDC) card, one serial and parallel port card, and one sound card with a joystick port. (A third-party multi-IO card might merge the ports and FDC onto one card.) Therefore, the 5 XT slots of the original Tandy 1000, 1000 TX, 1000 SX, and similar models remained available for other hardware, making them equivalent or better than the 8 slots in IBM's XT and AT models (which had 8 slots because the original PC's 5 proved inadequate.) ...|$|E

Current cellular and PCS handsets primarily target voice telephony, but the next generation will also support data services. In this paper we review the current offerings in wireless handsets that support both voice and data services and also present our design for a next-generation wireless handset. We discuss the tradeoffs in selecting an operating system and input device, and in designing a user interface. The physical design of our user interface and the wired network infrastructure support applications such as telephone directory, electronic mail, and Web browsing. The result is a small, user-friendly handset featuring handwriting recognition, foldable <b>video</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> (VGA) -sized liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, and the Inferno™ operating system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—this paper aims to {{contribute}} to the efforts of design community to demonstrate the effectiveness {{of the state of the}} art Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), in the embedded systems development, taking a case study in the biomedical field. With this design approach, we have developed a System on Chip (SoC) for cardiac monitoring based on the soft processor MicroBlaze and the Xilkernel Real Time Operating System (RTOS), both from Xilinx. The system permits the acquisition and the digitizing of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) analog signal, displaying heart rate on seven segments module and ECG on <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (VGA) screen, tracing the heart rate variability (HRV) tachogram, and communication with a Personal Computer (PC) via the serial port. We have used the MIT_BIH Database records to test and evaluate our implementation performance. In terms of the resources utilization, the implementation occupies around 70 % of the used FPGA, namely the Xilinx Spartan 6 XC 6 SLX 16. The accuracy of the QRS detection exceeds 96 %...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: picture caught more {{attention}} than verbal voice. A <b>video</b> <b>graphic</b> <b>adapter</b> provides interface between the computer and monitor. The main purpose of this project is to design and implement VGA controller on FPGA. The proposed VGA controller is written based on the block diagram using verilog HDL. Also functions required for the VGA controller {{are included in the}} verilog code and test bench is created to test the functions written to ensure the FPGA VGA works correctly and accurately without an errors. This design has display capability supported by a virtually every video adapter on the market, and can be extendable up to 1368 x 768. we have generated the shapes of coordinate geometry to get in motion, any moving geometric objects can be implemented. The motion can be generated using finite state machines (FSM), with raster pattern from left to right and top to bottom, many shapes can be generated and motion can be in zigzag. We used FILE OUT operations, so that the generated object can be verified before it gets implemented, no need of storage devices like FIFO(leads to complexity with FIFO depth calculations), More economic, we can even check the implementation results without FPGA in static image format. Cadence tool is used for observation and verification in terms of performance. And the code coverage of the design is achieved. Index Terms—Xilinx 12. 3, modelsim SE 6. 3 f, spartan 3 E...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} work properly, a <b>video</b> card or <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> must set a mode [...] - a {{combination}} of screen resolution, color depth and refresh rate - [...] that is {{within the range of}} values supported by itself and the attached display screen. This operation is called mode-setting, and it usually requires raw access to the graphics hardware [...] - i.e. the ability to write to certain registers of the video card. A mode-setting operation must be performed prior to start using the framebuffer, and also when the mode is required to change by an application or the user.|$|R
5000|$|... the DRI client [...] - an X client {{performing}} [...] "direct rendering" [...] - [...] needs {{a hardware}} specific [...] "driver" [...] {{able to manage}} the current <b>video</b> card or <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> in order to render on it. These DRI drivers are typically provided as shared libraries to which the client is dynamically linked. Since DRI was conceived {{to take advantage of}} 3D graphics hardware, the libraries are normally presented to clients as hardware accelerated implementations of a 3D API such as OpenGL, provided by either the 3D hardware vendor itself or a third party such as the Mesa 3D free software project.|$|R
50|$|In {{the classic}} X Window System {{architecture}} the X Server {{is the only}} process with exclusive access to the graphics hardware, and therefore the one which does the actual rendering on the framebuffer. All that X clients do is communicate with the X Server to dispatch rendering commands. Those commands are hardware independent, meaning that the X11 protocol provides an API that abstracts the graphics device so the X clients don't need to know or worry about {{the specifics of the}} underlying hardware. Any hardware specific code lives inside the Device Dependent X, the part of the X Server that manages each type of <b>video</b> card or <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> and which is also often called the <b>video</b> or <b>graphics</b> driver.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the access}} to the <b>video</b> card or <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> is {{regulated}} by a kernel component called the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM). Both the X Server's DDX driver and each X client's DRI driver must use DRM to access to the graphics hardware. DRM provides synchronization to the shared resources of the graphics hardware [...] - resources such as the command queue, the card registers, the video memory, the DMA engines, ... [...] ensuring that the concurrent access of all those multiple competing user space processes don't interfere with each other. DRM {{also serves as a}} basic security enforcer that doesn't allow any X client to access the hardware beyond what it needs to perform the 3D rendering.|$|R

50|$|The 5151 was {{designed}} {{to work with the}} PC's Monochrome Display <b>Adapter</b> (MDA) text-only <b>graphics</b> card, but the third-party Hercules Graphics Card became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution bitmapped 720×348 pixel monochrome graphics capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> 320×200 pixel, or 640×200 pixel graphic standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA card's standard graphics modes. Monochrome monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution color IBM Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> and <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> Array standards in the late 1980s, for dual-monitor applications.|$|R
500|$|Bart's House of Weirdness was {{developed}} by Distinctive Software and published by Konami.

Writers for UGO Networks have commented {{that the fact that}} Bart's House of Weirdness was released exclusively for DOS [...] "more than likely tells why its critical acclaim is zilch and fan support non-existent. It's surprising it got such a limited release, seeing it was published by Konami, who usually have no problem distributing games on a variety of platforms." [...] Similarly, a 1UP.com editor wrote that the game is [...] "unknown (there's not even a single video of it on YouTube)" [...] and that it [...] "deserves a little more coverage, if only to acknowledge its existence".|$|R

50|$|Most often those {{programs}} used a blue {{background for the}} main screen, with white or yellow characters, although commonly they had also user color customization. They often used box-drawing characters in IBM's code page 437. Later, the interface became deeply influenced by graphical user interfaces (GUI), adding pull-down menus, overlapping windows, dialog boxes and GUI widgets operated by mnemonics or keyboard shortcuts. Soon mouse input was added - either at text resolution as a simple colored box or at graphical resolution thanks {{to the ability of}} the Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) and <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> Array (VGA) display adapters to redefine the text character shapes by software - providing additional functions.|$|R

2500|$|Early {{personal}} computers {{of the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, such as those from Apple, Atari and Commodore, did not use RGB as their main method to manage colors, but rather composite video. [...] IBM introduced a 16-color scheme (four bits—one bit each for red, green, blue, and intensity) with the Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) for its first IBM PC (1981), later improved with the Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) in 1984. The first manufacturer of a truecolor graphic card for PCs (the TARGA) was Truevision in 1987, {{but it was not}} until the arrival of the <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> Array (VGA) in 1987 that RGB became popular, mainly due to the analog signals in the connection between the adapter and the monitor which allowed a very wide range of RGB colors. Actually, it had to wait a few more years because the original VGA cards were palette-driven just like EGA, although with more freedom than VGA, but because the VGA connectors were analogue, later variants of VGA (made by various manufacturers under the informal name Super VGA) eventually added truecolor. In 1992, magazines heavily advertised truecolor Super VGA hardware.|$|R
