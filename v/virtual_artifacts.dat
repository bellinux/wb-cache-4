50|$|VR {{systems that}} include {{transmission}} of vibrations and other sensations {{to the user}} through a game controller or other devices are known as haptic systems.

40|$|Any form of use {{of virtual}} reality or {{augmented}} reality in history and archaeology is based on 3 D digitized models that are obtained in various ways (3 D modeling, 3 D scan-ning, photogrammetry, etc.). These represent virtual replicas of real arti-facts/monuments. In the authors’ vision, a digital artifact {{is represented by the}} digitized form of a histori-cal artifact/monument. A <b>virtual</b> <b>artifact</b> is a concept that embodies not only the digital form, but also includes metadata, interactive elements, feedback elements, multimedia files, etc. coupled with stereo vision and the ability to interact with them by specific methods involving VR/AR. The quality of the 3 D models used in AR/VR applications is influencing the visual experience of the users, and this represents a property of a <b>virtual</b> <b>artifact</b> that can be defined and quantified. The authors propose the introduction of the maximum permissible deviation term as the unit of measurement for the fidelity of the digitized 3 D model. The quality of a 3 D model does not depend only on the precision of the instrument/equipment used in the primary digitization phase and subsequent operations but also on operations prior to this step, such as mesh creation, surface creation, solid generation, optimization etc. The qual-ity of the virtual/digital model is influenced not only by the methods used in order to obtain the 3 D model, but also by the purpose for which it will be used (level of details are influenced by the limited amount of storage capabilities on some devices – AR). Other properties of a 3 D model will be defined and exemplified, such as the traceabil-ity of the digital/virtual artifact, compatibility, interactivity and portability.

This social interaction encourages critical thinking and understanding.(p. 309) When learning occurs through social interaction, knowledge building can also be observed through text analysis or discourse analysis. One way to assess knowledge construction in online collaborative settings is by collecting and analyzing the discursive events recorded and kept as history in computer conferencing systems in the form of <b>virtual</b> <b>artifact.</b> Transcripts can be used to determine {{the quantity and quality of}} interactions in negotiating meaning of the course material.(p. 379) The instructor evaluates the messages exchanged by the students for meaningfulness and pertinence in regards to the target content.|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} age has provided exciting challenges for designers and users to interact {{and work in}} virtual environments. This has resulted in new interpretations to the representation of places as they begin to develop, interact and communicate their ideas in this medium. Can designers shape the many sites that are beginning to form and can the sites serve as places for interaction/communication linked only through this virtual world? How can designers react to such a landscape? Can we begin to create this environment so that an effective communication between the environment and user can take place How should this environment be represented to the user? Finally, can we begin to "experience" the <b>virtual</b> <b>artifact</b> {{in a way that}} is flexible enough in its representation to allow for simultaneous communication of the physical space and the perceptual representation of that place. These will be some of the main issues addressed in the thesis. My investigation seeks to develop a virtual interface for communication of an architectural artifact, that designers can use as a representation to assist them in contextualizing their understanding of that place and to facilitate an environment that aids in communicating within a <b>virtual</b> setting? The <b>artifact</b> created are the virtual design spaces here at MIT and the site for the project will be the World Wide Web. The thesis addresses three main issues. The first will discuss navigating through the artifact. The second issue will endeavor to coalesce the fragmented views of representation though a simulation. The third will explore supplementing current representations into a experiential model to better understand the spaces and the ideas that generated them. Daniel J. Brick. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|Self-reflexive {{videogames}} are videogames {{designed to}} materialize critical and/or satirical {{perspectives on the}} ways in which videogames themselves are designed, played, sold, manipulated, experienced, and understood as social objects. This essay focuses on the use of virtual worlds as mediators, and in particular on the use of videogames to guide and encourage reflections on technical, interactive, and thematic conventions in videogame design and development. Structurally, it is composed of two interconnected parts: 1. 	In {{the first part of this}} essay I will discuss NECESSARY EVIL ([URL] an ex-perimental videogame that I designed as a self-reflexive <b>virtual</b> <b>artifact.</b> With the objective of clarifying the philosophical aspirations of self-reflexive videogames – and in order to under-stand how those aspirations can be practically pursued – I will dissect and examine the design decisions that contributed to the qualities of NECESSARY EVIL as an example of ‘playable phi-losophy’. 2. 	Taking off from the perspectives on self-reflexive videogames offered in the first part of the essay, the second half will focus on virtual worlds as viable mediators of philosophical thought more in general. In this section, I will argue that, both through the practice of game design and through the interactive experiences of virtual worlds, twenty-first century philosophers have the possibility to challenge the often-unquestioned understanding of written discourse as the only context in which philosophical thought can emerge and be developed. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of digital technology, a new category of design artifacts, usually described with the term virtual, has emerged. <b>Virtual</b> <b>artifacts</b> have gained further prominence due to the advances made in collaboration software and networking technologies. These technologies have {{made it easier to}} communicate design intentions through the transfer and sharing of virtual rather than physical artifacts. This becomes particularly true in the case of long-distance or international collaborative efforts. This paper compares the two major categories of artifacts - the physical and the computer-based - and places them in relationship to an observed collaborative design process. In order to get at their specific roles in collaboration, two case studies were conducted in which designers in academic and professional settings were observed using a methodology which focused on participation in the everydayness of the designer as well as casual discussions, collection of artifacts, note-taking, and detailed descriptions of insightful events. The collected artifacts were then categorized according to the setting in which they were created and the setting in which they were intended to be used. These two attributes could have one of two values, private or public, which yield a matrix of four possible categories. It was observed that artifacts belonging in the same quadrant shared common qualities such as parsimony, completeness, and ambiguity. This paper finds that distinguishing between physical and <b>virtual</b> <b>artifacts</b> according to their material and imagined attributes is neither accurate nor useful. This research illustrates how <b>virtual</b> <b>artifacts</b> can obtain the qualities of their physical counterparts and vice versa. It also demonstrates how a new meta-artifact can emerge from the inclusion and unification of its material and imagined components. In conclusion, the paper calls for a seamless continuity in the representation and management of physical and <b>virtual</b> <b>artifacts</b> as a prerequisite to the success of: (1) computer-supported collaborative design processes, (2) academic instruction dealing with making and artifact building, and (3) executive policies in architectural practice addressing the management of architectural documents...|$|E

Our denoising method exploits typical characteristics of archaeological artifacts, such as repetitive decoration motifs and a limited palette of colors.

40|$|Digital {{scanning}} technology offers many benefits to archaeology and curation {{in its ability}} to preserve <b>virtual</b> representations of <b>artifacts</b> in databases without harming the object.

Scans which inaccurately portray the surface detail of an artifact may be ignored by those who edit and process the files in favor of a more attractive scan. Scanning efforts designed for public outreach may favor certain artifacts over others. These selective pressures may produce unintentional bias in the digital artifact databases, which could potentially limit the applicability to certain scopes of archaeological research. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{interferometry}} is {{a technique}} used to estimate the Green’s function (GF) between two receiver locations, {{as if there were}} a source at one of the locations. By crosscorrelating the recorded seismic signals at the two locations we generate a crosscorrelogram. Stacking the crosscorrelogram over sources generates an estimate of the inter-receiver GF. However, in most applications, the requirements to recover the exact GF are not satisfied and stacking the crosscorrelograms yields a poor estimate of the GF. For these non-ideal cases, we enhance the real events in the virtual shot gathers by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the crosscorelograms before stacking. The SVD approach preserves energy that is stationary in the crosscorrelogram, thus enhancing energy from sources in stationary positions, which interfere constructively, and attenuating energy from non-stationary sources that interfere distructively. We apply this method to virtual gathers containing the <b>virtual</b> refraction <b>artifact</b> and find that using SVD enhances physical arrivals. We also find that SVD is quite robust in recovering physical arrivals from noisy data when these arrivals are obscured by or even lost in the noise in the standard seismic interferometry technique...|$|R

40|$|Virtual design {{concerns}} {{itself with}} artifacts which are purchased and consumed solely within the online, participatory virtual worlds {{in which they}} are created: Edward Castranova estimates the revenue generated by current virtual economies, which are based upon the trade of such <b>virtual</b> <b>artifacts</b> to be in the ballpark of several billions of US Dollars per annum. Of further interest is the fact that despite the severe recessions which their physical counterparts have undergone in recent times, virtual economies seem to show a steady upward trend of growth. Although the present state of health of virtual economies is of significance when examining the relevance of virtual design, what is also of interest is an exploration of <b>virtual</b> <b>artifacts</b> as a means for establishing cultural bridges. These bridges may manifest themselves not only between virtual worlds and the real world, but also between diverse cultures within the physical world itself. The virtual design object is freed from many of the constraints of its physical counterpart as far as functionality, utility and ergonomics are concerned. Virtual objects are utilized for fantastical, playful activity inside virtual worlds and as such it would be appropriate to examine their ultimate function as the messengers of novel amalgamated ways of being; and indeed as pathways between cultures and cultural identities. ...|$|E
