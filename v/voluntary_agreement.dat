40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is a national}} priority for China as rapid energy consumption growth aggravates its greenhouse gas emissions, local air pollution and energy scarcity. In the 1990 s, {{a large number of}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> emerged in industrialised countries in order to improve industrial energy efficiency. These experiences are now taken into account in China. This article analyses the drivers for <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> on industrial energy efficiency in China, based on a case study of three enterprises in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. Furthermore, the article reviews the institutional set-up of energy policy and investigates the pertaining policy culture. From the findings, conclusions are drawn on the role of <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> within China's larger policy context. We conclude that opposed to avoiding stricter regulation, <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> in Nanjing are reinterpreted in view of more stringent national provisions on energy efficiency in the 11 th Five Year Plan. Hence, agreements have evolved into an implementation tool of national policy at the local level.

40|$|Abstract: Energy {{labelling}} {{and minimum}} efficiency performance standards {{have proved to}} be very effective in stimulating energy efficiency improvement in the domestic appliance sector. But standards suffer from long and often difficult implementation periods because of the resistance of the industrial sector. As a consequence, the question has been raised as to whether similar results could not be obtained more easily and at lower cost with <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements,</b> which offer flexibility margins in the achievement of commitments. This paper analyses the specific advantages of <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> compared with efficiency standards in the domestic appliance sector. We conclude that <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> may be an effective instrument in this respect but in certain conditions. The alternative of regulatory measures must remain a credible, realistic threat if <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> are to have a really significant impact on performance improvement. 1...|$|R

At the time {{there was a lot of}} theoretical analysis and discussions on this policy instrument and in particular on its effectiveness and cost efficiency. Before the debate was over, a number of important <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> to improve energy efficiency or reduce CO 2 emissions were implemented in Europe both at national and European levels. These <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> cover end-use equipment and appliances (e. g. cars, electric motors, residential appliances, etc.), industrial processes, and industrial energy management policies and practices. The paper classifies and analyses the different types of <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> aiming at improving energy efficiency in Europe, and reviews <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> and other initiatives of similar nature (voluntary programmes, unilateral commitments, self-regulation) in industrial sectors in a number of Member States of the European Union.

40|$|Various {{parties have}} {{expressed}} serious concerns regarding {{the effect of}} environmental taxes on innovation. The argument is that innovation and investment in emission-abatement technology frequently require capital for investment. Pollution taxes siphon working capital from firms, and new investment becomes more difficult and/or more costly if {{it is necessary to}} borrow the capital from banks. In recent years, <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> have gained increased popularity and have become a central instrument in several countries’ environmental policies, the Netherlands perhaps being the most notable example. A core rationale behind <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> is that they permit collective targets to be set for the entire sector, allowing for a different pace of realization of energy-efficiency improvements among the various individual companies within a sector. This provides the flexibility for firms to set their own goals in a cost-effective manner and to use their own resources to innovate and effect changes in the manner which suits them best. It has been claimed that <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> provide an improved climate for innovation. How <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> rate with regard to innovation incentives relative to environmental taxes depends on several factors, in particular the specific design of the agreement and whether the agreements are renegotiated after the market penetration of new technology. The author claims that, whatever advantages <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> have over the traditional regulatory approach, which makes mandatory particular forms of behavior or specific technological approaches, {{it is difficult to see}} that agreements would provide better incentives for innovation. Incentives for innovation may be particularly poor if the regulator requests renegotiation of the agreement with the arrival of new technology that substantially changes marginal conditions. It is proposed that if the authorities for various reasons nevertheless choose to use <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> as instruments, the agreements should be designed to be incentive-based. ...|$|R

25|$|In 1948 the {{government}} {{set up a}} Land Planning Committee, whose first report recommended that government should re-acquire land which was either undeveloped or occupied by large numbers of Africans. This included the projected re-purchase of {{about two-thirds of the}} British Central Africa Company’s freehold land. The company had long fought to retain its landholdings, much of which was undeveloped, claiming that soil exhaustion and erosion, deforestation and poor husbandry would result if the land were resettled by smallholders. In 1948, the company was still unwilling to sell its better land to {{the government}}. However, it was prepared to sell inferior land, and in 1948 the government bought freehold land from the British Central Africa Company in the Chingale area {{in the western part of}} Zomba District to convert it to land held by customary tenure and resettle Africans evacuated from other estates in the Shire valley and highlands on it. The Chingale resettlement scheme took place from 1948 to 1954. Following a serious famine in 1949, Geoffrey Colby, the Governor of Nyasaland from 1948 to 1956, attempted to get the major estate companies to sell the under-used parts of their land to the government for resettlement. However, Colby made it clear he would not use the compulsory purchase powers he had been granted, preferring <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreement.</b> By ruling compulsion out, he gave unintended encouragement to the British Central Africa Company’s plans to retain its estates. In 1955, the Nyasaland government agreed to purchase almost 36,470 acres in Cholo District with 24,600 residents from the British Central Africa Company for resettlement. Before this, the company had owned 74,262 acres with 36,400 residents. The company retained 38,143 acres, but of the 11,800 residents, 3,240 were moved onto Crown lands. However, it was only in 1962, when independence was clearly in prospect, that the company accepted the need to sell its surplus land, retaining only its most profitable assets. At the time of its takeover by Lonrho (Malawi) Ltd in 1964, the Central Africa Company Ltd owned a 3,500 acre tea plantation, two tea factories and some other small estates. The Central Africa Company Ltd, with its remaining agricultural assets, was sold by Lonrho to African Plantations Corporation June 1997.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{existing}} Italian regulation regarding the so-called "administration by agreements" {{and the possibility}} to adapt the existing legal system to <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> in the environmental field {{in the light of}} the European guidelines on this issue. The research consists of two parts. The first one presents a valuation of the Italian public administration system and a comparison of the relevant laws. It also discusses the principles of "subsidiarity", flexibility and administrative simplification. The second part is aimed at highlighting the results of an empirical study of some selected <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> signed by Italian local and regional administrations with the private sector. This empirical part relies on a general survey carried out by Feem with the aid of questionnaires addressed both to public and private sectors. The paper assesses a number of existing environmental <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> {{in the light of the}} check-list suggested by the European Commission in its Communication on environmental agreements (COM(96) 561 final, 27 / 11 / 96). It also illustrates that in Italy there is no univocal definition of "voluntary agreements" and no "ad hoc" legal framework for regulating them. Nowadays, the only definition of "voluntary agreements" as such is provided in the Ronchi Decree and it is specifically related to the waste sector. Moreover both the Ronchi Decree and the recent Legislative Decree no. 152 / 99 on water protection stimulate public authorities to promote and sign <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements.</b> As the research shows, the absence of a legal framework of reference leads public administrations to stipulate <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> having the form of "protocol of intent", which is a common policy instrument without any binding juridical structure. However, it is now recognised by those public administrations and private parties having experience in co-operating together that a more formal structure for <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreements</b> is important in order to ensure their transparency and effectiveness as policy instruments.
