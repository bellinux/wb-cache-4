5|$|Tracheal tubes {{can be used}} {{to ensure}} the {{adequate}} exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as helium, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, xenon, or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as desflurane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane. They may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and drugs used in treating cardiac arrest such as atropine, epinephrine, lidocaine and <b>vasopressin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or <b>vasopressin</b> receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|The lateral {{hypothalamus}} contains orexinergic neurons {{that control}} appetite and arousal through their projections to the ascending reticular activating system. The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland through {{the release of}} peptides such as oxytocin, and <b>vasopressin,</b> as well as dopamine into the median eminence. Through the autonomic projections, the hypothalamus is involved in regulating functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, sweating, and other homeostatic mechanisms. The hypothalamus also {{plays a role in}} thermal regulation, and when stimulated by the immune system, is capable of generating a fever. The hypothalamus is influenced by the kidneys – when blood pressure falls, the renin released by the kidneys stimulates a need to drink. The hypothalamus also regulates food intake through autonomic signals, and hormone release by the digestive system.|$|E
5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine <b>vasopressin</b> and nitrous oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vasopressin</b> {{agonists}} {{are used}} therapeutically in various conditions, and its long-acting synthetic analogue desmopressin {{is used in}} conditions featuring low <b>vasopressin</b> secretion, {{as well as for}} control of bleeding (in some forms of von Willebrand disease and in mild haemophilia A) and in extreme cases of bedwetting by children. Terlipressin and related analogues are used as vasoconstrictors in certain conditions. Use of <b>vasopressin</b> analogues for esophageal varices commenced in 1970.|$|E
25|$|The hormone <b>vasopressin,</b> {{stimulates the}} {{activity}} of NKCC2. <b>Vasopressin</b> stimulates sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the nephron by activating signaling pathways. <b>Vasopressin</b> increases the traffic of NKCC2 to the membrane and phosphorylates some serine and threonine sites on the cytoplasmic N-terminal of the NKCC2 located in the membrane, increasing its activity. Increased NKCC2 activity aids in water reabsorption in the collecting duct through aquaporin 2 channels by creating a hypo-osmotic filtrate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vasopressin</b> is used {{to manage}} anti-diuretic hormone deficiency. It has off-label uses and {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of vasodilatory shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular defibrillation. <b>Vasopressin</b> {{is used to}} treat diabetes insipidus related to low levels of antiduretic hormone.It is available as Pressyn.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vasopressin</b> is {{available}} {{for use as a}} medication.|$|E
25|$|There {{may be a}} {{connection}} between arginine <b>vasopressin</b> and autism.|$|E
25|$|During a {{recorded}} autonomic seizure, {{there was a}} small increase in blood pressure (+5/4mm Hg, systolic/diastolic), pronounced increases in heart rate (+59 bpm) and plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (+242 pg/mL), epinephrine (+175 pg/mL), and <b>vasopressin</b> (+22.1 pg/mL); serum glucose was also elevated (206mg/dL). The significant increase in plasma <b>vasopressin</b> may explain the emetic autonomic symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Other hormones {{secreted}} {{from the}} median eminence include <b>vasopressin,</b> oxytocin, and neurotensin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vasopressin</b> was elucidated and {{synthesized}} for {{the first}} time by Vincent du Vigneaud.|$|E
25|$|Desmopressin is used {{to improve}} {{platelet}} function by activating arginine <b>vasopressin</b> receptor 1A.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vasopressin</b> is {{released}} into the brain in a circadian rhythm by neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vasopressin</b> receptors {{activated}} by <b>vasopressin</b> are {{found on the}} basolateral membrane of the cells lining the collecting ducts of the kidneys. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage(aSAH) results in hyponatremia which leads to water retention and antidiuretic hormone release causing increase in intracranial pressure and formation of cerebral edema. This can be prevented by administration of conivaptan, a safe FDA approved drug that treats euvolemic hyponatremia. Through the process of aquaresis, conivapten which is a <b>vasopressin</b> receptor antagonist improves serum sodium concentration while eliminating free water without having any negative effect on systolic blood pressure and pulse rate. Since it can decrease cerebral volume and ICP, it has a potential to treat many forms of cerebral edema.|$|E
25|$|The {{hormonal}} neuropeptides <b>vasopressin</b> and oxytocin play a {{key role}} in complex social behaviours in many mammals such as regulating attachment, social recognition, and aggression. <b>Vasopressin</b> has been implicated in male-typical social behaviors which includes aggression. Oxytocin may have a particular role in regulating female bonds with offspring and mates, including the use of protective aggression. Initial studies in humans suggest some similar effects.|$|E
25|$|Nephrogenic {{diabetes}} insipidus {{is due to}} the inability of the kidney to respond normally to <b>vasopressin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin and <b>vasopressin</b> are {{the only}} known hormones {{released}} by the human posterior pituitary gland to act at a distance. However, oxytocin neurons make other peptides, including corticotropin-releasing hormone and dynorphin, for example, that act locally. The magnocellular neurosecretory cells that make oxytocin are adjacent to magnocellular neurosecretory cells that make <b>vasopressin.</b> These are large neuroendocrine neurons which are excitable and can generate action potentials.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for {{an effect}} of AVP on monogamy vs {{promiscuity}} comes from experimental studies in several species, which indicate that the precise distribution of <b>vasopressin</b> and <b>vasopressin</b> {{receptors in the brain}} is associated with species-typical patterns of social behavior. In particular, there are consistent differences between monogamous species and promiscuous species in the distribution of AVP receptors, and sometimes in the distribution of vasopressin-containing axons, even when closely related species are compared.|$|E
25|$|A {{very similar}} substance, lysine <b>vasopressin</b> (LVP) or lypressin, {{has the same}} {{function}} in pigs and is used in human AVP deficiency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vasopressin</b> infusions {{are also}} used as second line therapy in septic shock {{patients}} not responding to fluid resuscitation or infusions of catecholamines (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine).|$|E
25|$|Modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity: Oxytocin, {{under certain}} circumstances, {{indirectly}} inhibits release of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol and, in those situations, {{may be considered}} an antagonist of <b>vasopressin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} gestational DI {{can be treated}} with {{desmopressin}} (ddAVP), but not <b>vasopressin.</b> In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used.|$|E
25|$|To {{distinguish}} between the main forms, desmopressin stimulation is also used; desmopressin can be taken by injection, a nasal spray, or a tablet. While taking desmopressin, a patient should drink fluids or water only when thirsty and not at other times, as {{this can lead to}} sudden fluid accumulation in the central nervous system. If desmopressin reduces urine output and increases urine osmolarity, the hypothalamic production of ADH is deficient, and the kidney responds normally to exogenous <b>vasopressin</b> (desmopressin). If the DI is due to renal pathology, desmopressin does not change either urine output or osmolarity (since the endogenous <b>vasopressin</b> levels are already high).|$|E
25|$|Dynorphin acts through κ-opioid receptors, and {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the CNS, including in the spinal cord and hypothalamus, including in particular the arcuate nucleus and in both oxytocin and <b>vasopressin</b> neurons in the supraoptic nucleus.|$|E
25|$|The second {{ability that}} helps people stay dry is waking when the bladder is full. This ability {{develops}} {{in the same}} age range as the <b>vasopressin</b> hormone, but is separate from that hormone cycle.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} types of DI, each with a {{different}} set of causes. Central DI (CDI) is {{due to a lack of}} the hormone <b>vasopressin</b> (antidiuretic hormone). This can be due to damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland or genetics. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) occurs when the kidneys do not respond properly to <b>vasopressin.</b> Dipsogenic DI is due to abnormal thirst mechanisms in the hypothalamus while gestational DI occurs only during pregnancy. Diagnosis is often based on urine tests, blood tests, and the fluid deprivation test. Diabetes mellitus is a separate condition with an unrelated mechanism, though both can result in the production of large amounts of urine.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{similarity}} to <b>vasopressin,</b> it {{can reduce the}} excretion of urine slightly. In several species, oxytocin can stimulate sodium excretion from the kidneys (natriuresis), and, in humans, high doses can result in low sodium levels (hyponatremia).|$|E
25|$|Indometacin readily {{crosses the}} {{placenta}} and can reduce fetal urine production to treat polyhydramnios. It does so by reducing {{renal blood flow}} and increasing renal vascular resistance, possibly by enhancing the effects of <b>vasopressin</b> on the fetal kidneys.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} ethanol {{is involved}} in the inhibition of L-type calcium channels. One study showed the nature of ethanol binding to L-type calcium channels is according to first-order kinetics with a Hill coefficient around 1. This indicates ethanol binds independently to the channel, expressing noncooperative binding. Early studies showed a link between calcium and the release of <b>vasopressin</b> by the secondary messenger system. <b>Vasopressin</b> levels are reduced after the ingestion of alcohol. The lower levels of <b>vasopressin</b> from the consumption of alcohol have been linked to ethanol acting as an antagonist to voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Studies conducted by Treistman et al. in the aplysia confirm inhibition of VGCC by ethanol. Voltage clamp recordings have been done on the aplysia neuron. VGCCs were isolated and calcium current was recorded using patch clamp technique having ethanol as a treatment. Recordings were replicated at varying concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mM) at a voltage clamp of +30 mV. Results showed calcium current decreased as concentration of ethanol increased. Similar results have shown to be true in single-channel recordings from isolated nerve terminal of rats that ethanol does in fact block VGCCs.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects during {{treatment}} with <b>vasopressin</b> are dizziness, angina, chest pain, abdominal cramps, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, trembling, fever, water intoxication, pounding sensation in the head, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and paleness.flatulence. The most severe adverse reactions are mycardial infarction and hypersensitivy.|$|E
25|$|There is {{tentative}} {{evidence that}} <b>vasopressin</b> receptor antagonists (vaptans), such as conivaptan, may be slightly {{more effective than}} fluid restriction in those with high volume or normal volume hyponatremia. They {{should not be used}} in people with low volume. Their use in SIADH is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Dipsogenic DI or primary {{polydipsia}} {{results from}} excessive intake of fluids {{as opposed to}} deficiency of arginine <b>vasopressin.</b> It {{may be due to}} a defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, located in the hypothalamus; or due to mental illness. Treatment with DDAVP may lead to water intoxication.|$|E
25|$|AVP {{also may}} {{have a variety of}} {{neurological}} effects on the brain. It may influence pair-bonding in voles. The high-density distributions of <b>vasopressin</b> receptor AVPr1a in prairie vole ventral forebrain regions have been shown to facilitate and coordinate reward circuits during partner preference formation, critical for pair bond formation.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the known}} actions of Ang II are {{mediated}} through the AT1 receptors, for example vasoconstriction, aldosterone release, renal sodium reabsorption and <b>vasopressin</b> secretion. The AT2 receptor also takes part in regulation of blood pressure and renal function but mediates antagonistic effects compared to the AT1 receptor.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>vasopressin</b> is {{contraindicated}} in {{the presence}} of hypersentivity to beef or pork proteins, increased BUN and chronic renal failure. It recommended that it be cautiously used in instances of perioperative polyuria, sensitivity to the drug, asthma, seizures, heart failure, a comatose state, migraine headaches, and cardiovascular disease.|$|E
