There {{is a lack}} of {{research}} about how to manage the advising role in purely <b>virtual</b> <b>universities.</b> This paper highlights the need for <b>virtual</b> <b>universities</b> to coordinate a large, distributed teaching staff through virtual workgroups. In the particular case of academic advising, these groups may function in a virtual, matrix structure –as occurs in the Open University of Catalonia-, thus generating specific coordination challenges.
