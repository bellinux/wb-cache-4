5|$|Potential {{antiviral}} therapies include topical microbicide {{treatments that}} use RNAi to treat infection (at Harvard Medical School; in mice, so far) by {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2 and the inhibition of <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> expression in cancerous cells, knockdown of host receptors and coreceptors for HIV, the silencing of hepatitis A and hepatitis B genes, silencing of influenza gene expression, and inhibition of measles viral replication. Potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases have also been proposed, with particular attention to polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington's disease.|$|E
25|$|This {{approach}} of using viruses as gene vectors is being pursued in the gene therapy of genetic diseases. An obvious {{problem to be}} overcome in <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> therapy is {{the rejection of the}} transforming virus by the immune system.|$|E
25|$|The latent {{programs}} reprogram and subvert infected B-lymphocytes to proliferate {{and bring}} infected cells to the sites {{at which the}} virus presumably persists. Eventually, when host immunity develops, the virus persists by turning off most (or possibly all) of its genes, only occasionally reactivating to produce fresh virions. A balance is eventually struck between occasional viral reactivation and host immune surveillance removing cells that activate <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> expression.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, {{swine flu}} {{was found in}} pigs in four U.S. states. Within a year, it had spread through pig populations across the United States. Scientists found this virus had {{originated}} in pigs as a recombinant form of flu strains from birds and humans. This outbreak confirmed that pigs {{can serve as a}} crucible where novel influenza viruses emerge {{as a result of the}} reassortment of genes from different strains. Genetic components of these 1998 triple-hybrid stains would later form six out of the eight <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> segments in the 2009 flu outbreak.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the virus}} has {{successfully}} gained entry into the host cell, the endosome acidifies, which alters virus topology by causing capsid components to disband. These changes, {{as well as the}} toxic nature of the pentons, destroy the endosome, resulting in the movement of the virion into the cytoplasm. With the help of cellular microtubules, the virus is transported to the nuclear pore complex, whereby the adenovirus particle disassembles. Viral DNA is subsequently released, which can enter the nucleus via the nuclear pore. After this the DNA associates with histone molecules. Thus, <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> expression can occur and new virus particles can be generated.|$|E
25|$|HPV {{associated}} cancers {{are caused}} by high-risk strains of HPV, mainly HPV-16 and HPV-18. HPV is a small non-enveloped DNA virus of the papillomavirus family. Its genome encodes the early (E) oncoproteins E5, E6 and E7 and the late (L) capsid proteins L1 and L2. The virus gains access to the mucosa through microlesions, where it infects the basal layer of cells, which are still able to proliferate. While the virus does not replicate in these cells, expression of its early genes stimulates proliferation and lateral expansion of the basal cells. As this moves the virus particles into the overlying suprabasal layers, late <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> expression occurs, enabling replication of the circular viral genome (see figure) and structural proteins. As these are pushed into the most superficial mucosal layers, complete viral particles are assembled and released.|$|E
5000|$|Wasps perhaps use microRNA {{to control}} the <b>viral</b> <b>genes</b> they carry.|$|R
50|$|During {{symptomatic}} infection, infected cells transcribe lytic <b>viral</b> <b>genes.</b> In some host cells, a {{small number}} of <b>viral</b> <b>genes</b> termed latency associated transcript (LAT) accumulate instead. In this fashion the virus can persist in the cell (and thus the host) indefinitely. While primary infection is often accompanied by a self-limited period of clinical illness, long-term latency is symptom-free.|$|R

2500|$|CoREST and NRSF {{combine with}} another {{cellular}} protein, histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC) {{to form a}} HDAC/CoREST/NRSF complex. This complex silences production of the HSV-1 protein ICP4 by interfering with chromatin remodeling of the viral DNA {{that is necessary to}} allow <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> transcription; it deacetylates histones associated with viral DNA in viral chromatin. [...] Furthermore, an NRSF-binding region is located between the viral genes expressing proteins ICP4 and ICP22. [...] ICP0 interacts with coREST, dissociating HDAC1 from CoREST/NRSF in the HDAC/CoREST/NRSF complex and preventing the silencing of the HSV genome in non-neuronal cells.|$|E
2500|$|The retroviruses include T-cell Leukemia virus type I, HIV, and Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV). The <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> tax is {{expressed}} when the T-cell Leukemia virus transforms a cell altering {{the expression of}} cellular growth control genes and causing the transformed cells to become cancerous. [...] HIV works differently by not directly causing cells to become cancerous but by instead making those infected more susceptible to lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Many other retroviruses contain the three genes, gag, pol, and env, which do not directly cause transformation or tumor formation.|$|E
2500|$|T-Vec is a {{biopharmaceutical}} drug; {{it is an}} oncolytic {{herpes virus}} that was created by genetically engineering a strain of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) taken from a person infected with the virus, rather than a laboratory strain. [...] Both copies of the <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> coding for ICP34.5 were deleted and replaced with the gene coding for human GM-CSF, and the gene coding for ICP47 was removed. [...] In wild herpes virus, ICP47 suppresses the immune response to the virus; it was removed because the drug was designed {{with the intention of}} activating the immune system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Viral</b> <b>genes</b> are {{expressed}} {{through the use}} of the host cell's replication machinery; therefore, many <b>viral</b> <b>genes</b> have promoters that support binding of many transcription factors found naturally in the host cells. These transcription factors along with the virus' own proteins can repress or activate genes from both the virus and the host cell's genome. Many viruses can also increase the production of the cell's regulatory proteins.|$|R

2500|$|Human Herpes Virus (HHV) Infected Cell Polypeptide 0 (ICP0) is a protein, encoded by the DNA of herpes viruses. It is {{produced}} by herpes viruses during the earliest stage of infection, when the virus has recently entered the host cell; this stage {{is known as the}} immediate-early or α ("alpha") phase of <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> expression. [...] During these early stages of infection, ICP0 protein is synthesized and transported to the nucleus of the infected host cell. Here, ICP0 promotes transcription from viral genes, disrupts structures in the nucleus known as nuclear dots or promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, and alters the expression of host and viral genes in combination with a neuron specific protein. At later stages of cellular infection, ICP0 relocates to the cell cytoplasm to be incorporated into new virion particles.|$|E
2500|$|Gene {{therapy is}} a {{technique}} for correcting defective genes responsible for disease development. In the future, gene therapy may provide a way to cure genetic disorders, such as severe combined immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis or even haemophilia A. Because these diseases result from mutations in the DNA sequence for specific genes, [...] gene therapy trials have used viruses to deliver unmutated copies of these genes to {{the cells of the}} patient's body. There have been a huge number of laboratory successes with gene therapy. However, several problems of <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> therapy must be overcome before it gains widespread use. Immune response to viruses not only impedes the delivery of genes to target cells but can cause severe complications for the patient. In one of the early gene therapy trials in 1999 this led to the death of Jesse Gelsinger, who was treated using an adenoviral vector.|$|E
2500|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{proved to}} be a topic that thrust biotechnology into the public scene, and the interaction between scientists, politicians, and the public defined the work that was accomplished in this area. Technical developments during this time were revolutionary and at times frightening. In December 1967, the first heart transplant by Christian Barnard reminded the public that the physical identity of a person was becoming increasingly problematic. While poetic imagination had always seen the heart {{at the center of the}} soul, now there was the prospect of individuals being defined by other people's hearts. [...] During the same month, Arthur Kornberg announced that he had managed to biochemically replicate a <b>viral</b> <b>gene.</b> [...] "Life had been synthesized," [...] said the head of the National Institutes of Health. Genetic engineering was now on the scientific agenda, as it was becoming possible to identify genetic characteristics with diseases such as beta thalassemia and sickle-cell anemia.|$|E

25|$|Identification: Viral vectors {{are often}} given certain genes that help {{identify}} which cells {{took up the}} <b>viral</b> <b>genes.</b> These genes are called Markers. A common marker is antibiotic resistance to a certain antibiotic. The cells can then be isolated easily as those that have not taken up the <b>viral</b> vector <b>genes</b> do not have antibiotic resistance and so cannot grow in a culture with antibiotics present.|$|R
2500|$|Responses to {{scientific}} achievements were colored by cultural skepticism. Scientists and their expertise were looked upon with suspicion. In 1968, an immensely popular work, The Biological Time Bomb, {{was written by}} the British journalist Gordon Rattray Taylor. The author's preface saw Kornberg's discovery of replicating a <b>viral</b> <b>gene</b> as a route to lethal doomsday bugs. The publisher's blurb for the book warned that within ten years, [...] "You may marry a semi-artificial man or woman…choose your children's sex…tune out pain…change your memories…and live to be 150 if the scientific revolution doesn’t destroy us first." [...] The book ended with a chapter called [...] "The Future – If Any." [...] While it is rare for current science to be represented in the movies, in this period of [...] "Star Trek", science fiction and science fact seemed to be converging. [...] "Cloning" [...] became a popular word in the media. Woody Allen satirized the cloning of a person from a nose in his 1973 movie Sleeper, and cloning Adolf Hitler from surviving cells was {{the theme of the}} 1976 novel by Ira Levin, The Boys from Brazil.|$|E

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{is unusual}} among DNA tumour viruses {{in that the}} virus {{particle}} is able to infect and immortalize resting cells with very high efficiency. Mutation of the viral genome has indicated that at least six <b>viral</b> <b>genes</b> (LMP- 1 and EBNAs 1, 2, 3 A, 3 C and LP) are essential for immortalization. We demonstrate that the activation of a G 1 cyclin, cyclin D 2, is an early event following infection with EBV and that cyclin D 2 activation {{is dependent on the}} expression of <b>viral</b> <b>genes.</b> The different levels of cyclin D 2 transcripts in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines expressing different subsets of EBV immortalizing genes suggest an involvement of EBNA- 2 or EBNA-LP in cyclin D 2 regulation. By exposing resting primary B cells to a purified preparation of the EBV surface glycoprotein gp 340, {{we have been able to}} achieve efficient expression of plasmid DNAs introduced by electroporation. Vectors encoding two <b>viral</b> <b>genes,</b> EBNA- 2 and EBNA-LP, are sufficient to activate the expression of cyclin D 2 in this system. Thus, the progression of resting B lymphocytes into the G 1 phase of the cell cycle can be reconstituted in the absence of virus by the cooperation of two of the six <b>viral</b> <b>genes</b> required for immortalization...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) has a complex life cycle {{in which both}} cellular and virus-encoded factors participate to determine the level of virus production. Two of the <b>viral</b> <b>genes,</b> tat and rev, are essential for virus replication and encode novel trans-activators that interact specifically with their cognate RNA target elements. Elucidation of their mechanisms of action is likely to expand our knowledge of gene regulation at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels in the eukaryotic cell. Several <b>viral</b> <b>genes</b> (vif, vpu, and vpr) facilitate virus infection and/or release and {{may play a role}} in target cell tropism and infection in vivo. The functions of yet other <b>viral</b> <b>genes</b> (nef, vpt) remain unclear.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{baculovirus}} infection promotes high-frequency recombination between its genomes and plasmid DNA during the construction of recombinant viruses for foreign gene expression. However, {{little is known about}} the <b>viral</b> <b>genes</b> necessary to promote homologous recombination (HR). We developed an assay to identify <b>viral</b> <b>genes</b> that are necessary to stimulate HR. In this assay, we used two plasmids containing extensive sequence homology that yielded a visible and quantifiable phenotype if HR occurred. The plasmids contained the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) that was mutated at either the N or the C terminus and a viral origin of DNA replication. When the plasmids containing these mutant gfp genes were transfected into insect cells alone or together, few green fluorescent protein (GFP) -positive cells were observed, confirming that the host cell machinery alone was not able to promote high levels of HR. However, if viral DNA or <b>viral</b> <b>genes</b> involved in DNA replication were cotransfected into cells along with the mutant gfp-containing plasmids, a dramatic increase in GFP-positive cells was observed. The <b>viral</b> <b>genes</b> ie- 1, ie- 2, lef- 7, and p 35 were found to be important for efficient HR in the presence of all other DNA replication genes. However, ie- 1 and ie- 2 were sufficient to promote HR in the absence of other <b>viral</b> <b>genes.</b> Recombination substrates lacking a viral origin of replication had similar genetic requirements for recombination but were less dependent on ie- 1. Interestingly, even though HR was stimulated by the presence of a viral origin of DNA replication, virally stimulated HR could proceed in the presence of the DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin...|$|R
