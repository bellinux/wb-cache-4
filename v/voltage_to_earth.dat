25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and line connections, both of which carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|E
50|$|Schuko sockets are unpolarised, {{there is}} no way of {{differentiating}} between the two live contacts (line which is approximately 230 V to earth and neutral which is approximately 0 V to earth) unless the <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> is measured prior to use.|$|E
50|$|A {{permanently}} installed current transformer (CT) fixed around the neutral leg feeder to the LNER senses the current. The CT sends a signal current to an external sensing circuit (the protection system) which then sends {{a signal to}} the relevant circuit breaker to open and disconnect the supply or isolate the generator (or transformer) from the fault.The ohmic value of the resistor is calculated {{as a function of the}} permissible fault current and the system <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> <b>earth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In IT systems, {{a single}} {{insulation}} fault {{is unlikely to}} cause dangerous currents to flow through a human body in contact with earth, because no low-impedance circuit exists for such a current to flow. However, a first insulation fault can effectively turn an IT system into a TN system, and then a second insulation fault can lead to dangerous body currents. Worse, in a multi-phase system, {{if one of the}} line conductors made contact with earth, it would cause the other phase cores to rise <b>to</b> the phase-phase <b>voltage</b> relative <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> rather than the phase-neutral voltage. IT systems also experience larger transient overvoltages than other systems.|$|R
5000|$|Industrial {{power is}} {{normally}} supplied as three phase power. There are two forms: three wire, or four wire {{with a system}} neutral. In [...] "three wire" [...] or [...] "three wire delta," [...] , there is no neutral but an earth ground is the safety ground. The three phases have <b>voltage</b> only relative <b>to</b> each other. This distribution method has one fewer wire, is less expensive, and is common in Asia, Africa, and many parts of Europe. In regions that mix residences and light industry, {{it is common for}} this to be the only distribution method. A meter for this type normally measures two of the windings relative to the third winding, and adds the watts. One disadvantage of this system is that if the safety earth fails, it is difficult to discover this by direct measurement, because no phase has a <b>voltage</b> relative <b>to</b> <b>earth.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stray voltage is {{any case}} of {{undesirable}} elevated electrical potential, but more precise terminology gives {{an indication of}} the source of the <b>voltage.</b> Neutral <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> <b>voltage</b> (NEV) specifically refers to a difference in potential between a locally grounded object and the grounded return conductor, or neutral, of an electrical system. The neutral is theoretically at 0 V potential, as any grounded object, but current flows on the neutral back to the source, somewhat elevating the neutral voltage. NEV is the product of current flowing on the neutral and the finite, non-zero impedance of the neutral conductor between a given point and its source, often a distant substation. NEV differs from accidentally energized objects because it is an unavoidable result of normal system operation, not an accident or a fault in materials or design.|$|R
5000|$|The IET / BSI (BS 7671) also define Reduced {{low voltage}} (RLV) {{which can be}} either single phase or three phase A.C. This system {{has been used for}} many years on {{construction}} sites. Both single and three phase. The single phase voltage is 110 V a.c. though having a [...] "centre tapped Earth" [...] reducing the <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth</b> to 55 V a.c. The three phase is 110 V phase to phase, 63 V to Neutral / Earth. This system is slightly outside ELV but still very commonly used for cord powered hand tools and temporary lighting in hazardous areas (and is worth noting here).|$|E
50|$|In type NM cable, {{conductor}} insulation is color-coded for identification, typically one black, one white, and a bare grounding conductor. The National Electrical Code (NEC) specifies {{that the black}} conductor represent the hot conductor, with significant <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> ground; the white conductor represent the identified or neutral conductor, near ground potential; and the bare/green conductor, the safety grounding conductor not normally used to carry circuit current. Wires may be re-colored, so these rules are commonly excepted. In 240-volt applications not requiring a neutral conductor, the white wire {{may be used as}} the second hot conductor, but must be recolored with tape or by some other method. Four-wire flexible equipment connection cords have red as the fourth color; unlike older European practices, color-coding in flexible cords is the same as for fixed wiring.|$|E

50|$|These devices sense a <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> {{decide the}} <b>Earth</b> leakage. A {{single-phase}} voltage ELCB will have six terminals. Line in and out, neutral in and out, Earth (E), and fault (F). Metal {{body of the}} load {{is connected to the}} fault terminal of ELCB and Earth terminal is connected to the ground. For normal working, voltage across the trip coil is zero, because, the body of the load is isolated from the supply line. When an Earth fault occur on the load, due to the contact of line wire to the metal body, a current will flow through F to the ground. This current will set up a voltage across the trip coil, which is connected between E and F. The energized trip coil will trip the circuit to protect the load device and the user.|$|R

5000|$|Various {{earthing}} {{systems are}} used {{to ensure that the}} ground and neutral wires have zero <b>voltage</b> with respect <b>to</b> <b>earth,</b> <b>to</b> prevent shocks when touching grounded electrical equipment. In some installations, there may be two line conductors which carry alternating currents in a single-phase three-wire. Small portable electrical equipment is connected to the power supply through flexible cables (these exist with either two or three insulated conductors) terminated in a plug, which is inserted into a fixed receptacle (socket). Larger household electrical equipment and industrial equipment may be permanently wired to the fixed wiring of the building. For example, in North American homes a window-mounted self-contained air conditioner unit would be connected to a wall plug, whereas the central air conditioning for a whole home would be permanently wired. Larger plug and socket combinations are used for industrial equipment carrying larger currents, higher voltages, or three phase electric power. These are often constructed with tougher plastics and possess inherent weather-resistant properties needed in some applications.|$|R

30|$|Two {{major power}} {{conversion}} technologies have traditionally dominated by HVDC projects, namely, the line-commutated converter (LCC) and the voltage source converter (VSC); {{both have been}} commercialized and deployed and are standard technological solutions across today’s global networks. In LCC technology, a large smoothing reactors are connected at the power converters’ DC side, and pulses of DC current flow through the switching devices into the AC side to configure a current source converters (CSC) [6]. On the other hand, a DC link based on conventional VSC technology has large capacitors at the power converters’ DC side and the switching devices transfer the instantaneous DC <b>voltage</b> level <b>to</b> the AC side [7]. Two-and three-level power conversion topologies with symmetrical bipolar DC <b>voltage</b> respect <b>to</b> the <b>earth</b> electrode, in opposite polarity, have been generally used in VSC for HVDC applications [8, 9]. However, new modular multi-level converters (MMC), which synthesize the output AC voltage by combining direct voltages from multiple cascade connected cells, are becoming popular in recent years since they are a very flexible solution for processing high-power levels {{and they do not}} require any link filter at their AC side [10].|$|R

The paper illustrates the benefit of ATP / EMTP to finding the best type of line against the lightning. The paper has proven that for negative polarity of current wave, range of overvoltage caused by lightning is the lowest for the Multistory model, Moreover the paper considering the same negative polarity, range of <b>voltages</b> from arms <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> is the lowest for Multistory model.
