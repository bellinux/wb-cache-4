50|$|Velour: <b>Velour</b> is {{a fabric}} with cut loops. <b>Velour</b> bathrobes are {{typically}} made with terry inside, as terrycloth absorbs water better than <b>velour.</b> <b>Velour</b> gives the bathrobe luxury, coziness, {{and makes the}} garment softer to the touch.|$|R

[540] [The [...] "Man in the Iron Mask," [...] or, more correctly, the [...] "Man in the Black Velvet Mask," [...] {{has been}} {{identified}} with Count Ercole Antonio Mattioli, Secretary of State at the Court of Ferdinando Carlo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua.

6000|$|There {{seems so}} much {{confusion}} in the minds, {{or at least the}} language, of ornithologists, between the Water Rail and Water Hen, that I give this latter bird under the number XII.A. rather than XIII., (which would, besides, be an unlucky number to end my Appendix with); and it would be very nice, if at all possible or proper, to keep these two larger dabchicks connected pleasantly in school-girl minds by their costumes, and call one 'Silken Runner,' and this,--which, as said above, Gesner seems to mean, Velvet Runner, or Velvet Hen.--Poule de Soie or Poule de <b>Velours?</b> I am getting a little confused myself, however, I find at last, between Poules, Poussins, Pullets, and Pullas; and must for the present leave the matter to the reader's choice and fancy, till I get some more birds looked at, and named:--only, for a pretty end of my Appendix, here are two bits of very precious letters, sent me by friends who know birds better than most scientific people, but have been too busy--one in a 'Dorcas Society,' and the other in a children's hospital--to write books, and only now write these bits of letters on my special petition.

40|$|The electrodeposits {{of silver}} on <b>velour</b> copper underlayers from dicyanoargentate-thiocyanate {{solutions}} were obtained. The surface relief, morphology and hardness of silver deposits were studied and their dependences on deposition conditions were examined. The gloss and specular reflectance spectra {{in the infrared}} region were measured and modelled. The morphology of thin silver coatings with the thickness of about 1 µm, exhibiting good <b>velour</b> effect, {{was found to be}} consistent with the underlayer one. With increasing silver layer thickness, the specific morphology with smaller dimensions of surface crystallites forms and <b>velour</b> effect disappears.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 73) A two part study, {{a consumer}} questionnaire and laboratory investigation, {{was conducted on}} the absorbency qualities of <b>velour</b> versus terry cloth towels when laundered with and without fabric softeners. Consumer opinions on preference of type of towels for aesthetic value were obtained. Chi Square statistical test was utilized for comparative analysis based on marital status, age, educational level, and family income. Fifty per cent of the respondents owned <b>velour</b> bath towels: of these 52 per cent rated <b>velour</b> towels as not very absorbent. All of the respondents owned terry cloth towels and 70 per cent of these rated terry cloth as very absorbent. The majority of the respondents who used fabric softeners stated the fabric softener made no difference in the absorbency of the towels. <b>Velour</b> towels were preferred for aesthetic value, but the overall preference was for the terry cloth towels. The laboratory investigation included weight, and wick-up tests. The results revealed that terry cloth was superior to <b>velour</b> in absorbency. The addition of fabric softeners greatly reduced the absorbability of both types of towels. Light weight towels, terry cloth and <b>velour,</b> are more absorbent than are heavy weight towels...|$|R
