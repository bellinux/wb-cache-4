5|$|Ravalomanana's family origins are Merina, the island's {{largest and}} most {{politically}} prominent ethnic group. The Ravalomanana family tomb is outside the historic walls of the village, a placement that would typically indicate the family's origins lie with the hova (commoners' caste), rather than the andriana — the traditional ruling caste among the Merina that continues to exert considerable influence over political affairs in modern Madagascar. His later entry into the political sphere has made the question of his caste background one of popular interest and ongoing debate among the Malagasy public and press. Biographer <b>Vivier</b> (2007) maintains that the Ravalomanana family is andriana in origin.|$|E
5|$|At {{its height}} {{during the period}} of Ravalomanana's presidency, Tiko {{provided}} direct salaried employment to between 1,000 and 3,000 staff and indirect employment to over 10,000. The group was the largest dairy producer in the country and a leader in the national agribusiness sector. The success of his enterprises made Ravalomanana a wealthy man. In the mandatory self-disclosure of wealth submitted to the High Constitutional Court in 2000 by all presidential candidates, Ravalomanana declared ownership of 27 properties valued at over two billion Malagasy francs. He owned 90 per cent of Tiko Inc., 80 per cent of Tiko Agri and 50 per cent of Tiko Oil Products, a portfolio worth 13.1 billion Malagasy francs, and declared 77 million Malagasy francs in annual revenues. <b>Vivier</b> (2007) demonstrates that the valuation of Ravalomanana's holdings and his annual revenue in particular were significantly underestimated.|$|E

5|$|On 11October 1900, Beerschot AC honorary {{president}} Jorge Díaz announced that Antwerp would host {{a series of}} challenge matches between Europe's best football teams. After some organisational problems, on 28April 1901, Beerschot's pitch hosted its first tournament, in which a Belgian A-squad and a Dutch B-team contested the Coupe Vanden Abeele. Belgium won, and beat the Netherlands in all three follow-up games; FIFA does not recognise these results because Belgium fielded some English players. On 1 May 1904, the Belgians played their first official game, against France at the Stade du <b>Vivier</b> d'Oie in Uccle; their draw left the Évence Coppée Trophy unclaimed. Twenty days later, the football boards of both countries were among the seven FIFA founders. At that time, the Belgian squad was chosen by a committee drawn from the country's six or seven major clubs. In 1906, the national team players received the nickname Red Devils because of their red jerseys, and four years later, Scottish ex-footballer William Maxwell replaced the UBSSA committee as their manager. From 1912, UBSSA governed football only and was renamed UBSFA. During the Great War, the national team only played unrecognised friendlies, with games in and against France.|$|E

25|$|By 1960, {{the shoes}} {{designed}} by Roger <b>Vivier</b> for Dior {{were made at}} Rayne's UK factory and personally supervised by Edward Rayne. Four years later, <b>Vivier</b> began selling Rayne brand shoes in his Rue François store in Paris. The company also stayed in tune with mainstream direction of fashion – Mary Quant shoes were first displayed in its flagship store. The company also retained {{a stake in the}} mass market, with an interest in both H.E. Randall and Lotus chainstores. By 1966, Rayne was showcasing what were known as 'Young Design quartet' – Jean Muir, Roger Nelson, Moya Bowler and Gerald McCann – capitalising on London's thirst for younger designers by getting them to design fashionable shoes in a more affordable price bracket, with designs being sold in Harrods and some high-street shoe shops. Rayne also maintained a strong foothold in the couture end of shoe production – indeed his role as chair of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers from 1960 meant his shoes were shown as part of the twice annual fashion events held by the society. He also enlisted designers such as Norman Hartnell to create shoes for Rayne.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, critics {{began to}} take note of the growth of new Canadian guitar works {{energized}} by Laucke. In La Presse, a Canadian newspaper, music critic Claude Gingras found in Laucke [...] "an interpreter who could not be more convincing".

500|$|Barber's {{design for}} the Lafayette dollar has often been criticized. [...] Swiatek and Breen complained about the [...] "lifeless head of the President [...] ". Q.

According to Don Taxay, [...] "When one compares Barber's portraits to those by Du <b>Vivier</b> [...] and Caunois, it is clear why [...] Saint-Gaudens used to refer contemptuously to the 'commercial medalists of the Mint'. [...] The difference here is not merely in the relief, but in elementary modeling skill." [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that, [...] "the Lafayette dollar lacks the quaint, dated appeal of the Isabella quarter or the amusing originality of the Columbian half-dollar. [...] Despite the necessity for low relief the jugate busts are too linear. The reverse suffers from too much lettering of uniform size. [...] The words 'Paris 1900' might have been enough; at most, the addition of 'From the Youth of the United States' would have conveyed the matter." ...|$|E

500|$|The Antoinist {{literature}} is mainly composed of Antoine's writings, which are considered as sacred by followers {{and should not}} be modified. They include three doctrinal books grouped into two volumes which are sold in the temples and read during the worship: Revelation of the Father (La Révélation par le Père), The Coronation of the Revealed Work (Le Couronnement de l'Œuvre révélée) and Development of the Teaching of Father (Le Développement de l'Enseignement du Père). According to Debouxhtay, [...] "the writings of Antoine do not shine by their qualities of style", a view shared by other observers. Many statements from the Antoines are gathered into 14 books called Tomes, which remain only accessible to dressed members. From May 1907 to April 1909, the religion published the journal The Halo of Consciousness, then from September 1911 to August 1914, The Unitive. In 1936, Belgian writer Robert <b>Vivier</b> published a hagiographic biography—although based on real facts—of Louis Antoine, which is also used by Antoinists to strengthen their faith, and thus sold in the temples.|$|E

60|$|The {{ruins of}} <b>Vivier</b> belong to M. Parquin, a {{distinguished}} lawyer of Paris. This gentleman {{has a small}} country-house near by, and General Lafayette took us all to see him.

60|$|The {{third day}} of our visit, we all drove three or four leagues across the country, to see an old ruin of a royal castle called <b>Vivier.</b> This name implies a pond, and sure enough we found {{the remains of the}} {{buildings}} in the midst of two or three pools of water. This has been a considerable house, the ruins being still quite extensive and rather pretty. It was originally the property of a great noble, but the kings of France were in possession of it, as early as the year 1300. Charles V. had a great affection for <b>Vivier,</b> and very materially increased its establishment. His son, Charles VI. who was at times deranged, was often confined here, and it was after his reign, and by means of the long wars that ravaged France, that the place came to be finally abandoned as a royal abode. Indeed, {{it is not easy to}} see why a king should ever have chosen this spot at all for his residence, unless it might be for the purpose of hunting, for even now it is in a retired, tame, and far from pleasant part of the country.|$|E
