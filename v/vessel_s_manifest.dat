40|$|A {{life cycle}} cost {{comparison}} study between a newly built LNG ferry and a 21 year old conventional ferry {{was carried out in}} this study. The objective was to study the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> cost effectiveness compared to an equivalent existing vessel of mature age. It has been assumed that both vessels are to be operating according to the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> current production pattern at a specific ferry service. The study has a time span of 30 years. Another assumption is that both vessels are assumed to be procured from respectively the newbuilding market and the second-hand market. This study emphasises primarily vessel generated costs. The cost elements that are investigated are among other: capital costs, fuel costs, lube oil costs, maintenance costs, downtime costs, NOx emission costs and income due to scrapping. Costs such as port fees and management costs are not included. Due to the high level of uncertainty related to many of the cost elements, a sensitivity analysis is performed. A cost breakdown structure has been derived to identify the relevant cost elements which are to be studied. Data are gathered from the shipping company that owns the vessels. This is done by use of their databases and records. Documentations and specifications are also provided by the shipping company s suppliers. Estimations which lacked sufficient input data have been partly founded on expert opinions. It has been found that the total {{life cycle cost}}s of the conventional vessel are 12 % lower than the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s.</b> The most significant cost elements are identified to be the capital costs, fuel costs, maintenance costs, NOx emission costs and downtime costs. If an internal rate of return is applied, the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> disadvantage when it comes to total life cycle costs will increase. This is due to the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> high initial costs. The results show that the capital costs related to the procurement of the conventional vessel in real term value are only 8 % of the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> capital cost. It has been found that the conventional vessel has 19 % lower energy consumption than the LNG vessel. Despite of this, it is estimated that the conventional vessel will have 9 % higher total fuel cost over the time period. The main {{reason for this is that}} the existing gap between the two energy prices is forecasted to increase over the time period. It is estimated that the LNG vessel has 9 % lower maintenance cost over the time period. One of the reasons for this is the expectation of reduced deterioration of the fuel supply system and other components such as engine nozzles and exhaust valves. The LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> total NOx emission costs are estimated to be only 15 % of the conventional <b>vessel</b> <b>s,</b> which is one of the most significant differences between the ferries. This is due to the LNG engine s ability to operate at very low NOx emission rates. An analysis regarding a measure that may reduce the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> life cycle cost is also conducted. The vessel has installed a hybrid shaft generator system. The main engine is able to deliver power to the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> electricity grid by use of the shaft generator. Vice versa, the shaft generator is able to function as a motor and thus use electric power for propulsion. In other words, the shaft generator gives the vessel flexibility with respect to power consumption and power production. The measure is to replace the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> shaft generator with a new unit which has sufficient capacity to supply all the main switchboard s consumers without having to run the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> standby generator. Then the main engine will alone be able to provide sufficient electricity power to the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> grid. This is assessed to enable savings of fuel, NOx tax and maintenance cost due to among other increased efficiency of electricity production. Data for this analysis regarding the current operation of the propulsions system is gathered from the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> power management system. Information regarding the system s components is provided by the suppliers. It has been found that the yearly savings due to the reduced fuel, maintenance and NOx expenditures are in lower edge of 1 million NOK. This measure will reduce the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> NOx emission significantly. The measure therefore qualifies to a significant support from the Norwegian NOx fund, which may reduce the financial cost of the replacement to about 1 million NOK. Consequently, the payback time is about one year, which is a relatively short time period. However, it is important to underline that there is uncertainty related to these calculations and the inherent limitations which are associated with the measure...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a Real Options (RO) {{approach}} to valuing flexibility in ship design. The overall {{object is to}} find the value of owning a Multipurpose Offshore Construction Vessel (MOCV) by applying the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The MOCV holds the option of switching into an Offshore Subsea Construction Vessel (OSCV), a Well Intervention Vessel or a Pipe Laying Vessel. The thesis aims to discuss the owner s economic benefit of owning an MOCV instead of three separate single purpose vessels. Dimensions, equipment types and capacities on the MOCV are based on the reference vessel, The Island Performer. To solve this task, the problem has been limited by the following boundaries: at the time T= 0, the vessel will be completed as an OSCV with options for further evolvement. At the end of each contract the owner has the option to switch to a different market by switching vessel type. Each of the three markets have different contract lengths and the analysis only considers the first four contracts of the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> service time. In the RO Analysis, the time to maturity of the option is considered equal to the remaining time of the current contract. The stock prices and the stock price volatility are estimated based on the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> daily hire rates under long-term contracts in the North Sea. The strike price is equal to the cost of switching vessel types and each switching option has a different strike price. Lastly, ten-year government bonds underlie the risk- free rate.

40|$|The {{maritime}} {{activity in}} the Arctic waters has increased during the recent years due to diminishing ice and exploration of resources. Arctic operation involves an increased risk level all year around compared to operation in other open waters. The remoteness of the area and low temperatures can cause severe consequences if an accident would occur due to the possibilities for long waiting time for Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. For the cruise tourism industry the diminishing ice levels entail that more areas become accessible for exploration. The popular cruise tourism areas, around Svalbard, Franz Josef Land and the coast of Greenland are exposed to high concentration of icebergs and succeeding bergy bits and growlers. These smaller ice pieces pose large threats to the vessels operating in the area as they are difficult to detect and can induce large forces on the ship hull in case of impact. In order {{to ensure the safety}} of passengers and crew, it is necessary to evaluate measures for improved damage stability. In case of damage of the vessel resulting in water ingress, it is vital that measures have been taken to increase the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> capability to remain afloat. By increasing the survivability of the vessel, emergency evacuation can be avoided as the vessel function as it s own lifeboat. Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) has been performed to assess the risk of cruise ship operation in Arctic, where probabilistic damage stability (PDS) and cost benefit assessment (CBA) is used to evaluate changes in the arrangement for risk reduction. Two risk control options (RCOs) have been developed on the basis of the general arrangement to MS Fram. Risk control option I considers implementation of longitudinal bulkheads in the forward area of the vessel, between the shell and crew cabins located between 1 st and 2 nd deck. A part of this area is located beneath the waterline, and is therefore exposed for damages caused by impact with drifting ice. Risk control option II considers changes in the arrangement for symmetrical flooding. The tanks located below tank top and below 1 st deck are changed from heading in the longitudinal direction to the transverse direction. In case of damages to this area, implementation of RCO II ensures symmetrical flooding to improve the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> capability to remain afloat. The two RCOs have been implemented in the software DELFTShip, and compared with the initial arrangement on the basis of the probabilistic damage stability calculations. The increase in the attained index, as a result of the implemented RCOs, is considered as improved capability to remain afloat. The results from the PDS calculations show a slight increase in the attained index for both risk control options. This slight increased index improves the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> survivability by increasing the amount of damages where the time to capsize is longer than 30 minutes. The results from the cost benefit assessment show that both RCOs are cost effective and can thus be recommended for implementation. The analyses are done based on numerous assumptions causing uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the results. However, the results are considered to give an indication on the effect of implementing the measures. Based on the results of the analyses, it is demonstrated that the measures for risk reduction can improve the damage stability of the vessel for cruise ship operation in Arcti...|$|R
40|$|The {{new book}} by Jonas Pontusson joins two themes which play a {{prominent}} role in recent social sciences debates: first, the so-called “big trade-off ” originally described by Arthur Okun in the early 1970 <b>s</b> <b>manifests</b> the non-concurrence of full employment and income equality in capitalist market economies (see Okun 1975). Growing income ine-quality as a worldwide phenomenon and a marked variety of labor market and unemploy-ment performances since the early 1980 s revitalized the belief that an appropriate labor market functioning requires a degree of wage and income dispersion sufficient to match productivity differences between receding industrial and growing service sector employ-ment. Second, since the publication of Andrew Shonfield’s Modern Capitalism (Shonfield 1965), political scientists and political economists have been aware that the institutional features of market economies crucially influence their economic performance and, more-over, this institutional set-up varies considerably across nations. Politically with the down-fall of the “iron curtain ” in Europe in the late 1980 s and economically with the intensification of world-wide economic integration known as “globalization ” at around the same time, different institutional set-ups – “models ” or “economic systems ” – appear t...|$|R
