40|$|Abstract—Traffic safety can be {{improved}} by using a vehicular dedicated communication protocol. The standard IEEE 802. 11 p is being developed for this purpose. The physical layer properties of this draft {{are based on the}} already widely used IEEE 802. 11 a standard. Nevertheless, the propagation conditions in vehicular communications are different to the ones considered for 802. 11 a, which is focusing on nomadic indoor usage, and well studied until now. In this paper we present the simulation results obtained from an implemented physical layer model for this standard. The used channel model describes the very peculiar characteristics of the <b>vehicular</b> <b>radio</b> channel, specially the nonstationarity. Several channel estimators are tested based on the pilot structure defined in the standard focusing on low complexity implementations. The results show that diffuse components, present in vehicular channels on highways, have a very significant impact on the system performance. Furthermore, in situations of poor line-of-sight contribution, an acceptable frame error rate is not achievable even at high signal-to-noise ratio values. Therefore, more complex channel estimation and equalization techniques based on the current standard pilot pattern have to be developed that are able to cope with the properties of the <b>vehicular</b> <b>radio</b> channel.

50|$|Without <b>vehicular</b> <b>radios,</b> patrolmen {{were issued}} 2 rolls of dimes each week {{so they could}} phone in for calls on a regular basis. Though the {{legislature}} authorized the patrol to establish a one-way statewide radio system in 1937, it had many areas of no reception (dead spots), especially in the far eastern coastal areas and more so in the rugged western mountains. The system was flawed in that patrolmen could not answer back. Poor reception made it hard for patrolmen to tell which patrolman was being called, even when {{they could hear the}} radio. If dispatchers could not locate a patrolman, they would call certain selected stores, gas stations and post offices in the particular patrolman's district and ask the employees or personnel to watch for and to flag the patrolman down the next time he was seen passing by and to tell him to call in. If patrolmen arrested a violator, they would have minor offenders follow them to the justice of the peace office or courthouse. If they physically arrested a violator, the patrolmen would hide their motorcycle in brush and drive an offender to the local jail in his own vehicle.|$|R

40|$|In {{vehicular}} environments, {{the scattering}} environment can change very rapidly, {{owing to the}} mobility of the Tx and Rx vehicles, the relatively low height of the antennas and the potentially large number of scatterers in the surrounding environment. <b>Vehicular</b> <b>radio</b> propagation channels thus differ significantly from those of other wireless cellular networks, so that dedicated measurement campaigns and realistic radio propagation channel models are required to fully exploit their potentialities. The main contributions of this thesis are summarized as follows: - Two measurement campaigns of MIMO <b>vehicular</b> <b>radio</b> propagation channels were conducted at 5. 3 GHz, - The validity of the WSS and US assumptions is assessed using the CMD, which characterizes the amount {{of change in the}} spatial structure of MIMO radio propagation channels. Stationarity distances and frequency bandwidth are 10 to 40 m long and 40 to 50 MHz wide, respectively, depending on the variability and richness of the scattering environment, - The non-stationary fading statistics are characterized stochastically, in terms of Ricean K-factor and RMS delay spread. Their time- and space-variations are strongly related to changes in the richness of the scattering environment and on the presence (or not) of a strong LoS component. They are modeled by multi-modal Gaussian distributions, - A vehicular GSCM is proposed, in which each scatterer is defined and characterized separately: the radio wave propagation with simplified ray-tracing tools and the scattering aspects with a classical fading model. The diffuse scattering is modeled in a purely stochastic manner. The GSCM is then completely parameterized and validated for SISO systems. (FSA - Sciences de l'ingénieur) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The first {{generation}} of inter-vehicle communication networks {{will most likely be}} based on the IEEE 802. 11 p stan-dard. That is, they are going to deploy Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) to coordinate channel access among neighboring vehicles. Recently, concerns have been raised that fast-fading propagation conditions, i. e. a time- and frequency-selective fading as reported by several measurement campaigns in highway environments, might challenge the effectiveness of CSMA. These concerns also lead to the situation that alternative medium access control solutions are being discussed in standardization bodies. In this paper, we evaluate whether these concerns are justified or not. In comparison to previous studies, we use a high fidelity network simulator to study the extent by which the effectiveness of CSMA is reduced if such fading propagation conditions are considered. We also resolve the two reasons that may cause incoordination – either simultaneous transmission times or hidden terminal situations – and conclude that CSMA is able to effectively coordinate multiple access in <b>vehicular</b> <b>radio</b> channels as long as the load offered to the channel does not approach the maximum capacity.

40|$|Abstract—Vehicular {{safety systems}} for {{collisions}} or sensing rapid changes in traffic typically use two methods to communi-cate and disseminate traffic hazards. Many current systems use RADAR systems that transmit a radio wave and sense the re-flective waves for angle-of-arrival or time-of-arrival information. Several proposed systems use vehicular networks to disseminate information about braking, emergencies or road conditions; when coupled with accelerometer or GPS information, these radio systems may also offer information on speed, traffic density or distance. In-vehicle RADAR systems are relatively expensive; <b>vehicular</b> <b>radio</b> based systems are less expensive. In this paper, {{we present a}} cooperative technology that combines these two techniques, seeking to adopt characteristics of both systems by employing a software defined radio for “co-operative RADAR ” and vehicular networking.

S., efficiently extracting copper and molybdenum sulfide from the low-grade San Manuel ore body. This ellipsoidal ore-shell body, with major workings located 2000 - 3000 feet mbelow the surface, has ore shell thickness varying between 100 and 1000 feet over a longitudinal extent of some 8000 feet, and with major & minor crossectional axes of about 5000 and 2500 feet respectively. The San Manuel mine operation employs in excess of 1000 men/shift with gross ore production between 60, 000 and 70, 000 tons/day. The mining operation employs the block caving technique; actively being implemented on three levels (2075, 2375, 2675 feet for haulage, and 2015, 2315, 2615 product/grizzly levels). The ore haulage is largely via D. C. trolley trains to four (3 A, 3 B, 3 C, 3 D) product shafts for skipping to the surface. An additional three shafts at two locations are used to convey men, materials, and developmental rock extractions {{into and out of the}} mine. On each haulage level, the trains carry ore an average of two miles one-way from the ore raises to the dump points. 1. 2 TOPOLOGICAL BRIEF OF THE HAULAGE LEVELS The 2375 level, on which all the testing was conducted, is illustrated i...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} position-based routing {{protocol}} for cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>vehicular</b> ad hoc networks (CR-VANETs) using a Kalman filter algorithm. The protocol first selects an idle channel from {{among all the}} channels available to a vehicle while moving on a straight road and then finds the best relay node to deliver the packet to the destination. The selection of a relay node is done by dividing the vehicular transmission range into five regions, and then the source/relay node selects {{the one that is}} in the region having a higher preference than other regions. Communication between two vehicles occurs only when both the vehicles are on the same channel. Delay may increase while sensing the channel and selecting the relay node. To reduce the delay, we use a Kalman filter to predict the future positions of all moving vehicles in the network. We consider vehicle-to-vehicle communication and compare our protocol for different probabilities of primary user being idle. Our proposed protocol shows improvement in both packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay...|$|R

In this setting, however, gauging system performance through field trials can be very expensive especially {{when the number of}} studied vehicles is high. Therefore, many existing studies have been conducted using either network or physical layer simulators; both approaches are problematic. Network simulators typically abstract physical layer details (coding, modulation, radio channels, receiver algorithms, etc.) while physical layer ones do not consider overall network characteristics (topology, network traffic types, and so on). In particular, network simulators view a transmitted frame as an indivisible unit, which leads to several limitations. First, the impact of the <b>vehicular</b> <b>radio</b> channel is typically not reflected in its appropriate context.

30|$|According to an {{estimate}} by the US Department of Transportation (DoT), with {{the deployment of}} DSRC standard, about 82 % of the road accidents can be reduced. It has been observed that road traffic is increasing day by day. For example, in the UK, the traffic has increased from 26 billion vehicle miles to nearly 70 billion vehicle miles from the year 1949 to 2012 [7]. This trend of increasing road traffic will cause increased need of communication among vehicles and between vehicles and road side units which will overburden the proposed DSRC spectrum. Therefore, other means for vehicular communication have to be explored to maintain a reliable, high-bandwidth, and low-latency transfer of messages within the <b>vehicular</b> infrastructure. Cognitive <b>radios</b> (CR) are an emerging technology, which may be exploited by vehicles to at least convey emergency messages on underutilized wireless frequencies such as TV bands (VHF and UHF), Wi-Fi, Wi-MAX, cellular phone, Bluetooth, and satellite communication [8]. Due to a regulatory framework, only licensed users are allowed to utilize the respective spectrum {{and no one else}} is allowed to use the spectrum resources on their own. In CR, unlicensed (secondary) users are allowed to borrow unutilized bandwidth from licensed (primary) users. Sharing of network resources continues in this fashion until primary users need more of the spectrum, in which case secondary users have to vacate the spectrum [9, 10]. Cognitive radios can be built so they are smart enough to use parameters (such as carrier frequency, bandwidth, and transmission power) of that particular spectrum band and particular wireless technology [11].|$|R
