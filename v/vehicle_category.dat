5|$|The A2 is a tolled motorway, {{based on}} the vehicle {{classification}} in Croatia, using a closed toll system. As of July 2011, the toll charged along the A2 route between the Zaprešić and Trakošćan mainline toll plazas varies depending {{on the length of}} route travelled, ranging from 1.00 kuna (0.13 euros) to 42.00 kuna (5.48 euros) for passenger cars and 47.00 kuna (6.13 euro) to 187.00 kuna (24.40 euro) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major credit and debit cards. A prepaid toll collection system is also used. The A2 is the only motorway in Croatia which does not provide for use of the ENC—an electronic toll collection (ETC) system shared by most motorways in Croatia that provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. In addition to the vehicle classification in Croatia, the motorway operator maintains an additional <b>vehicle</b> <b>category</b> for motorbikes, which are charged from 7.00 kuna (0.91 euros) to 25.00 kuna (3.26 euros) toll. The southernmost Jankomir–Zaprešić section of the motorway is not tolled, as {{it is part of the}} Zagreb bypass.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} single-seat model Buccaneer XA {{was introduced}} in 1984 and qualified for the US FAR 103 Ultralight <b>Vehicle</b> <b>category.</b> The aircraft was commercial success and sold well until being replaced by the Buccaneer SX in 1988. The SX remained available on the market until general production ended in 1998, although in 2001 the model was still available as a special order from Aero Adventure Aviation. The SX {{was replaced by the}} improved derivative Aero Adventure Aventura UL and HP single seaters.|$|E
25|$|Until 2013, the Croatian {{driving licence}} had a pink booklet format, which was common in Europe at the time. A {{separate}} booklet {{was required for}} each <b>vehicle</b> <b>category</b> endorsement. This was before the European Parliament adopted the Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Commission, which mandated {{the creation of a}} single European driving licence. Since 2013, Croatian driving licences are issued in a EU-standard, credit-card-style format. Only one card is required per licence holder as it contains information on all vehicle categories that the holder is allowed to operate. Old (pre-2013) licences remain to be valid until their expiry, or until year 2033, whichever comes sooner.|$|E

25|$|Public {{transportation}} {{vehicles are}} not usually included in the green <b>vehicle</b> <b>category,</b> but Personal rapid transit (PRT) vehicles probably should be. All vehicles that are powered from the track {{have the advantage of}} potentially being able to use any source of electric energy, including sustainable ones, rather than requiring liquid fuels. They can also switch regenerative braking energy between vehicles and the electric grid rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles. Also, they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors, not just the vehicle surface. The potential PRT energy efficiency is much higher than that which traditional automobiles can attain.|$|E
500|$|In 2011 the European Commission {{drafted a}} {{guideline}} for Acoustic Vehicle Alerting Systems (AVAS). The {{goal is to}} present recommendations to manufacturers for a system to be installed in vehicles to provide an audible signal to pedestrians and vulnerable road users. This interim guideline is intended to provide guidance until the completion of on-going research activities {{and the development of}} globally harmonized device performance specifications. The guidelines are intended for hybrid electric and pure electric highway-capable vehicles. The guideline recommends that the [...] AVAS shall automatically generate a continuous sound in the minimum range of vehicle speed from start up to approximately [...] and during reversing, if applicable for that <b>vehicle</b> <b>category,</b> and list the types of sounds that are not acceptable. It also states that the AVAS may have a pause switch to stop its operation temporarily.|$|E
