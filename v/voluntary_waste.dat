Possessing the same consciousness of what she had seen in the trance which persons in general possess of what they have seen in a dream--believing in the vision as a supernatural revelation--Clara's worst forebodings were now, to her mind, realized as truths. Her last faint hope of ever seeing Frank again was now at an end. Intimate experience of her told Mrs. Crayford what was passing in Clara's mind, and warned her that the attempt to reason and remonstrate would be little better than a <b>voluntary</b> <b>waste</b> of words and time. The disposition which she had herself felt on the previous night, to attach a superstitious importance to the words that Clara had spoken in the trance, had vanished with the return of the morning. Rest and reflection had quieted her mind, and had restored the composing influence of her sober sense. Sympathizing with Clara in all besides, she had no sympathy, as they sat together in the pleasant sunshine, with Clara's gloomy despair of the future. She, who could still hope, had nothing to say to the sad companion who had done with hope. So the quiet minutes succeeded each other, and the two friends sat side by side in silence.|$|E

This estimate was based on construction and demolition waste collected and managed at licensed and permitted facilities throughout the country. There was no data available on construction and demolition waste production from Irish construction projects sites. An original audit tool was designed and tested on 58 construction projects throughout the country generating waste production indicators (kg/m 0) for new construction in 2005. These factors were applied to estimated construction output to benchmark national waste production in 2005. Two detailed surveys were also carried out to assess the management and collection of C&D W in 2005. A set of waste production indicators for new construction was produced: 70. 27 kg/m 2 for new residential construction. 86. 82 kg/m for new private non-residential construction. 138. 94 kg/m for new social infrastructure construction. 48. 48 kg/m 2 for new productive infrastructure construction. A compositional analysis identified inert waste (excluding excavated materials); wood; paper, plastics and packaging; and metals as the major contributors to the construction waste stream. The indicators were applied to construction output to produce a total national construction and demolition waste estimate of 20. 8 million tonnes for 2005. Construction and demolition waste accounted for 12. 3 million tonnes with soil and stones accounting for 8. 5 million tonnes (E P A, 2005 a).

40|$|Food {{waste is}} a {{significant}} public policy problem. My research focus is on consumer and retail/service industry food waste because these sectors offer the largest opportunity to reduce overall food waste in the supply chain. Two categories of policy interventions are chosen to reduce food waste: food waste prevention and food recovery and donation. Academic and government literature are used to inform the background context of the policy problem and select applicable case studies. Case studies from Europe and the United States identify existing policy and program activities in other jurisdictions. My analysis highlights common elements of successful food waste reduction policies and also discusses their limitations. Policy alternatives to prevent food waste are developed and assessed, as is food recovery and donation program design. I recommend a sequential combination of optimal food waste prevention policies. The results of my analysis demonstrate that an educational and awareness campaign can target {{the root causes of}} food waste in the food service and retail industry as well as in households. I recommend that increased research and consultation should follow the implementation of an awareness campaign for the formulation of <b>voluntary</b> food <b>waste</b> reduction targets that will ultimately evolve into mandatory, legislated targets. The voluntary targets will inform new research, consultation and baseline data that will assist in the development of regulatory food waste reduction targets.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} public attitudes on waste {{recycling}} and avoidance and the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) of four places in South China, namely, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Dongguan, and Yuanzhou in southern China. It {{was found that}} rural Chinese were the most acceptant of the NEP view, followed by people from Hong Kong. The current acceptance of the NEP view by Guangdong citizens {{was similar to that}} of the Hong Kong citizens and the late 1970 s U. S. citizens. Also, the present level of acceptance of NEP by Hong Kong public at large is higher than that of 7 years ago. On domestic waste recycling, it was found that source separation of domestic waste in mainland China was supported by 85 % of the urban population and about 11 - 13 % of the household waste was recovered and sold by the householders for financial gains. It was also found that the lower income group tended to recover a greater portion of waste, indicating that <b>voluntary</b> <b>waste</b> recovery activities in mainland China were carried out largely due to economic reasons. Thus, the Western type of source separation program in which residents are requested to separate recyclables for the community may not be welcomed in mainland China. In Hong Kong, despite the presence of community waste recovery programs, the recovery of domestic waste is only about 6 % and is therefore less than those of the mainland Chinese cities surveyed. On the choice of source separation programs, it was found that Hong Kong people ranked familiarity a more important criterion than convenience. Therefore, the collection frequency of recyclables and time and place for setting out recyclables should be as similar to those of normal waste collection as possible to attract high participation in source separation programs.

40|$|Few {{environmental}} problems exemplify market-failure better than {{municipal solid waste}} does: A direct by-product of economic production and consumption, its collection and disposal (still mainly at landfills, in many countries) incurs high capital and running costs, creates environmental and health impacts and, in European Union countries, risks incurring heavy financial penalties. The main remedy proposed in environmental economics is a marginal tax on the disposal of mixed household waste, intended to incentivise its reduction and separation for recycling. But taxes are politically unpopular, expensive to administer and generate variable response − sometimes stimulating illegal disposal of waste instead of its reduction. Taxes also risk undermining the moral benefits people seem to enjoy from cooperating voluntarily. Inducing voluntary cooperation could cultivate moral motives and generate cooperation, but this has received less attention in environmental economics to date. The aim of this thesis {{is to examine the}} determinants of cooperation by households in waste management activities, investigating the role that government policy can play in stimulating it, and focusing on the role of price incentives and of scheme promotion. Chapter 1 introduces the issue of waste management as an economic problem, and the role of household cooperation as a promising solution. Chapter 2 surveys the literature on the topic of what determines household cooperation in waste management and identifies the key gaps which the thesis seeks to address. Three manuscripts are presented in Chapters 3, 4 and 5, each of which examines a distinct question on the determinants of household cooperation in waste management. Chapter 6 concludes with a synthesis of main findings, key policy cues and suggestions for future research. The first manuscript titled “Voluntary recycling despite financial disincentives” employs a unique merged panel data set (n = 4, 644) using data from 58 localities over 86 weeks to assess the determinants of participation in a <b>voluntary</b> <b>waste</b> separation scheme in Malta. The two manuscripts that follow are based on a nationally-representative telephone survey (n = 1, 037), containing two embedded experiments, and conducted during 2013, in Malta, for this thesis. Manuscript 2 titled “Partisanship, priming and participation in voluntary recycling” tests whether party identification, as distinct from environmental or political ideology, can act as a determinant of participation in a recycling scheme, particularly if the scheme is promoted in a manner that associates it with the party in government. Manuscript 3 titled “The impact of a Pay as You Throw tax level and label on home-composting” examines the potential of a Pay As You Throw (PAYT) tax, and of its labelling, to induce substitution of biodegradable waste away from mixed kerb-side disposal and into home-composting. It also examines the prospect that this type of intervention stimulates illegal disposal. Synthesising the results of three studies, the thesis finds that: 1. 	The type of households most likely to cooperate in waste management schemes are multiple-person ones facing lower constraints of space and time, where members hold pro-environmental preferences. This confirms findings of similar studies in other contexts, helps forecast uptake and may guide the design and promotion of schemes to target low-lying fruit and tackle relevant constraints. 2. 	Driven mainly by moral motives, households are willing to recycle voluntarily even if it is less convenientc e than disposing of un-separated waste, and they {{are willing to pay for}} it. This is a useful finding for municipalities with low budgets, unable to institute taxes or fearing illegal disposal as a reaction. 3. 	Political preferences are relevant to recycling: Where negative sentiment towards the party in government exists, (even subtle cues) promoting the scheme as a government scheme and associating it with the party in government can suppress participation. Decoupling political communication from scheme promotion can release more households into cooperative effort. 4. 	Responses to waste taxes are not just a matter of price level but also of tax salience: A tax label can significantly increase waste separation and home-composting but it also boosts higher illegal-disposal intent. The way a fee is labelled therefore itself forms part of the intervention tool-kit, meriting pre-testing and capable of manipulation. These findings make a marginal contribution to gaps in the environmental economics literature by integrating insights from psychology. They are also intended to offer simple and applicable ideas to policy-makers and to scheme-operators aiming to increase household cooperation in waste management...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{dissertation}} is {{to evaluate}} waste management policies to limit municipal solid waste (MSW) production and disposal of garbage. Understanding MSW production and disposal is of prime importance for communities to choose appropriate policy instruments to attain their garbage disposal targets. Notwithstanding the extensive interest of scholars during the last decades, {{new developments in the}} MSW market reveal important shortcomings in both empiric and theoretic research. In particular we identify three potential sources of bias when evaluating economic and political incentives for reducing MSW disposal. It is our goal to tackle these three shortcomings and demonstrate their impact by means of specific case studies. First, as indicated by Besley and Case (2000), if policy intervention is responsive to economic and political conditions within its jurisdiction, then {{it may be necessary to}} control or to correct for the forces that cause the policy to change if one wishes to obtain estimates of a policys incidence. Techniques to circumvent this endogeneity problem, such as difference-in-differences, matching, instrumental variables and, Heckmans two-stage estimator, are commonly used methods for program evaluation. However, when assessing effectiveness of waste reduction policies these statistical methods are rarely used. In the first chapter (published in waste Management, see De Jaeger and Eyckmans, 2008) we will give an introduction to one of these techniques the difference-in-differences (or DD) estimator and argue that it is a useful tool for assessing waste management policies. We start by showing that existing dynamic DD techniques can be extended to accommodate for more than one treatment group. Next, we apply this technique to a Flemish <b>voluntary</b> <b>waste</b> policy program to demonstrate its relevance for evaluating MSW management policies. In the second chapter (published in Waste Management and Research, see De Jaeger, 2009) we further extend the DD methodology in order to evaluate the real impact of weight-based pricing schedules in MSW. The main idea is to use historical observations on MSW production to determine which version of the difference-in-differences technique is most suitable to assess the impact of a policy action on MSW quantities. Second, numerous empirical studies in the field of strategic tax policy interaction among local governments have shown the existence of spatial policy interaction. Heyndels and Vuchelen (1998), for instance, show that local income and property tax policies are strongly correlated among neighbouring municipalities in Belgium. A similar principle appears to be true for MSW taxes. In chapter 3 we set up a two-stage theoretical model of consumers demand and municipalities pricing policy for residual MSW collection and processing. We test the predictions from this model using the proper techniques in spatial econometrics. The results indicate, as predicted by our model, local governments strategically interact with each other when setting the price for MSW. Based on chapter 3 we can conclude local policy makers mimic waste tax rates because they believe voters try to overcome information asymmetries by comparing the local policies with neighbouring municipalities when evaluating the performance of their incumbents. In chapter 5 we go a step further and explicitly test for political costs in terms of popularity scores. We test if voters indeed use neighbouring tax rates as a yardstick, or if other principles drive their attitude towards tax rates. As expected, voters do not engage in yardstick voting, but are rather averse to increases in MSW tax rates in general. Third, in responses to financial incentives to reduce waste, like unit based-pricing, households might be tempted to engage in illicit behaviour as an alternative to recycling, composting or adjusting purchasing habits. The possibility of increasing illegal forms of waste disposal has always been an important concern for local policy makers when deciding on the payment schemes. New (but anecdotic) evidence suggests the existence of a form of illegal waste dumping which has not yet been analysed in the literature. If neighbouring municipalities charge significantly different prices at their recycling sites, residents have an incentive to present their waste at the cheapest location. As the prices often do not reflect the true processing costs for the municipalities, waste import is perceived as problematic by the local policy makers. In chapter 4 we present a simple theoretical model of consumers demand for waste collection and processing facilities and test the predictions from the model using a set of spatial econometric tools. Our estimation results indicate that bulky household refuse levels indeed depend on the prices charged in neighbouring municipalities. For other waste fractions like demolition waste, garden waste, scrap metal and wood waste we find no proof for waste export. This is not surprising as we argue some waste fractions are more sensitive to spatial differences in prices than others. Finally chapter 6 (published in Waste Management, see De Jaeger et al., 2011) studies the impact of some local policies aimed at MSW reduction on the cost efficiency of MSW collection and disposal. We explicitly account for endogeneity of local policies by using a bootstrapped version of the Data Envelopment Analysis methodology in combination with a matching technique. Our results indicate that municipalities that are member of a waste collection joint venture, or that subscribe to a voluntary agreement to reduce MSW at the highest ambition level, collect and process MSW more efficiently than other municipalities. Weekly instead of two-weekly waste collection, or using a weight-based pricing system appears to have no impact on efficiency. Our results show that aiming at MSW reduction does not lead to lower efficiency of public service provision, even on the contrary. Key references Besley, T. J. and A. C.

40|$|The <b>voluntary</b> and {{community}} <b>waste</b> sector makes {{an important contribution}} to waste objectives (Williams et al, 2006). The community composting sector would appear to be leading the development of innovative biowaste collection and processing systems in areas unsuitable for traditional kerbside. Such schemes can contribute to developing local areas by improving local soils and green spaces as well as diverting waste from landfill. However, this is often only part of the story. Well managed community activity has huge potential for providing work and volunteering opportunities, as well as bringing people together and improving skills, knowledge and self-confidence. Considered collectively these factors may contribute to local sustainability more effectively than reliance on meeting particular targets. Although there is some anecdotal and financial evidence for the growth in, and diversity of, community composting, there is very little comprehensive data that draws together the activity of the sector as a whole. The paper addresses this gap by presenting findings from a national survey profiling community based composting. Results show that a range of activities fall under the umbrella of community composting and these include: collecting / receiving and processing material, running education campaigns, promoting home composting and facilitating others to develop / promote community composting.

40|$|This book is {{available}} online at: [URL] inform {{the efforts to}} address this new policy challenge now under way across Canada, this paper explores experiences in Britain, Europe and the United States. Governments there started earlier than Canada and have progressed much further, by adopting the four key elements of place-based framework: a) tapping into local knowledge, b) balancing a mix {{of economic and social}} policies which combine place-based programs with broad income security and services such as health and education, c) governing through collaboration with civil society and each other, and d) recognizing the emerging roles of municipal governments. Bradford extracts the learnings from these experiences, and then proposes action on four fronts: creating a new intergovernmental framework, adopting an urban policy lens based on knowledge flowing up from cities to provincial and federal departments, recognizing and resourcing local governments, and building on the Winnipeg and Vancouver experiences with Urban Development Agreements. These Agreements can be applied to one large city or to a cluster of cities with similar challenges –such as cross-border cities and immigrant-settlement cities.
