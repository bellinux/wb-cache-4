5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who had helped him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the landed aristocracy that formed the backbone of the Party of Order. With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E

The streets curve in many directions, while {{the center of}} the town occupies the same crossroads that have been used for centuries. There are no apartments in the city proper, and no buildings more than two stories high, allowing the skyline to be dominated by the domes of local minarets, mosques, and mausoleums, some more than 1,000 years old.|$|E

25|$|According to {{lawyer and}} human rights activist K. Balagopal, Kashmiris have a {{distinct}} sense of identity and this identity is certainly not irreligious, as Islam is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the identity that Kashmiris feel strongly for. He opined that if only non-religious identities deserve support, then no national self-determination movement can be supported, {{because there is no}} national identity – at least in the Third World – devoid of the religious dimension. Balagopal says that if India and Pakistan cannot guarantee existence and peaceful development of independent Kashmir then Kashmiris may well choose Pakistan because of religious affinity and social and economic links. But if both can guarantee existence and peaceful development then most Kashmiris would prefer independent Kashmir.|$|E

They took that 'Jenny from the Block' side of me, which is still <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of who I am and will always be, and they put it right there on that track".

50|$|In 1990, {{an island}} emerged about two {{thousand}} kilometers south-east {{of the country}} of Samoa. It was named New Austral Island because of its close proximity to Austral Island. However, due to a secret concerning the new landmass, an organization called GAIL covered up its existence.

New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because I had always been so careful about nudity, it was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E
500|$|Following {{her first}} {{appearance}} in 1969, Driver remained {{in the role of}} Betty continuously. She suggested in 1999 that if she gave up she would die [...] "within a month from sheer boredom". In a 2006 interview she laughed off the notion of retirement, saying: [...] "From day one on The Street everyone has been very kind to me. In fact, I'm godmother to Bill Roache's son. So as long as they want me, I'm happy to stay. The Street is like home and they really are my family." [...] She confirmed her intention to remain on the show in 2010, when the character celebrated her 90th birthday. In May 2010, the News of the World reported that Driver had decided to retire, just prior to the actress's 90th birthday. Driver was distressed by the rumour, and assured producer Phil Collinson of her intention to remain with the soap, and was told that Betty was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of plans for the series' upcoming 50th anniversary celebrations. Driver died on 15 October 2011, having appeared in over 2,800 episodes of Coronation Street.|$|E
500|$|Judicial review, {{the means}} by which the High Court {{controls}} the exercise of legislative and executive power, is part of the Court's supervisory jurisdiction. The basis of this jurisdiction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Ng Chye Huey v. Public Prosecutor (2007) as inherent in nature, that is, deriving from the common law rather than statute. The Court noted that this jurisdiction had [...] "existed historically at common law" [...] and [...] "is still <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of our judicial system". The inherent power of the High Court to review the decisions of inferior courts and other administrative bodies does not, however, extend to co-ordinate bodies. In other words, one High Court judge may not exercise judicial review over a decision by another High Court judge. In addition, there are no provisions in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act which confer on the Court of Appeal the power to exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the High Court or – as pointed out in Ng Chye Huey – the Subordinate Courts.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{driver for}} the {{adoption}} of acronyms was modern warfare with its many highly technical terms. While there is no recorded use of military acronyms in documents dating from the American Civil War (acronyms such as ANV for [...] "Army of Northern Virginia" [...] post-date the war itself), they had become somewhat common in World War I and were <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> even of the vernacular language of the soldiers during World War II, who themselves were referred to as G.I.s.|$|E
2500|$|Speech {{impairments}} {{may be seen}} {{in children}} with CP depending on the severity of brain damage.

Problems with language or motor dysfunction can lead to underestimating a student's intelligence. In summary, children with CP may experience difficulties in school, such as difficulty with handwriting, carrying out school activities, communicating verbally and interacting socially.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with many}} other young artists, Salmon {{believed}} that his artistic future lay in the United States.

Since jinn [...] "were part of the culture of the Arabs at the time when the Quran was revealed" [...] (and still are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of Arab folk culture), without their inclusion [...] "the notion of divine revelation" [...] would have been difficult to accept.|$|E

In her introduction to the novel, Wharton talks of the [...] "outcropping granite" [...] of New England, the austerity of its land and the stoicism of its people. The connection between land and people is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of naturalism; the environment is a powerful shaper of man's fate, and the novel dwells insistently on the cruelty of Starkfield's winters.|$|E

5000|$|The epic {{recounts the}} story of the {{exploits}} of three Sulodnon demigod brothers, Labaw Donggon, Humadapnon and Dumalapdap of ancient Panay. Jocano, assisted by a radio technician from the Central Philippine University, convinced Sulod folk chanters Ulang Udig and Hugan-an to recount the story, and allow them to record it on cassette. The process of acquiring this permission took years, from Jocano's first contact with Ulang Udig in 1955 to the recording of Hugan-an's 30-hour performance of the epic in 1957. Jocano eventually also published the text in his book [...] "Hinilawod: Adventures of Humadapnon Tarangban I" [...] (The epic was once again recorded in 1999, by researcher Alejo Zata, working among Sulod natives who still performed it and for whom the epic was still <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> active <b>part</b> of their culture.) ...|$|R

2500|$|According to jazz {{historian}} Al Rose, {{the popular}} {{image of an}} early 20th-century saloon pianist being flashily dressed with arm garters {{was inspired by the}} way Tony Jackson used to dress while performing. [...] Sleeve garters are still worn not only by pianists who play ragtime and other turn of the 20th century American music, but also by Dixieland banjo players and many other types of musicians who perform music of that general period. Because sleeve garters are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the costume of contemporary barbershop music performance, an activity for which unimpeded manual dexterity does not play a vital role, the association between sleeve garters and the contemporary performance of turn of the 20th century music may {{have more to do with}} evoking the fashion of the era than with utility or a tradition begun at some later time.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to the 1970s, the 1980s were {{a time of}} {{restrained}} optimism in New York. The boom on Wall Street was {{fueling the}} speculative real estate market, and unemployment numbers dropped noticeably, however, the city's reputation for crime and disorder was still <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of New Yorkers' daily lives. Mayor Ed Koch repeatedly warned that filth, crime, and racial tensions were weakening the city. He put a high priority on rebuilding neighborhoods and infrastructure. One result was that gentrification brought new businesses to decrepit neighborhoods corners and converted low-end rental housing to co-ops and condos that attracted young upscale professionals and business people.

Everything that’s normal development, that we experience, he was excluded from, by design. In the design of the character and the engineering of the character, that was the idea.Mann made James Caan do research as a thief for his role.I always find it interesting, people who are aware, alert, conscious of what they do and are pretty good at it… People who want to put in 50-60 hours a week and go home and are not really conscious of life moving by, don’t really interest me <b>very</b> <b>much...</b> <b>As</b> <b>part</b> of the curriculum designed for an actor getting into character, I try to imagine what’s going to really help bring this actor more fully into character.

Bergamín's writings for Índice would make him part of the Generation of '27 (he preferred the term “Generation of the Republic”), although scholars also place him in the earlier Generation of 1914 or a member of the movement known as Novecentismo. However, his activities were <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> integral <b>part</b> of the Generation of '27, and he collaborated in all of the publications of this group, and served as editor of its various books.
