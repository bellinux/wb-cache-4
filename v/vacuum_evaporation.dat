2500|$|The {{beginning}} of the 20th century saw construction {{of the first of}} the [...] "modern" [...] large research reflectors, designed for precision photographic imaging and located at remote high altitude clear sky locations such as the 60-inch Hale telescope of 1908, and the [...] Hooker telescope in 1917, both located at Mount Wilson Observatory. These and other telescopes of this size had to have provisions to allow for the removal of their main mirrors for re-silvering every few months. John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the California Institute of Technology, developed a technique for coating a mirror with a much longer lasting aluminum coating using thermal <b>vacuum</b> <b>evaporation.</b> In 1932, he became the first person to [...] "aluminize" [...] a mirror; three years later the [...] and [...] telescopes became the first large astronomical telescopes to have their mirrors aluminized. 1948 saw the completion of the [...] Hale reflector at Mount Palomar which was the largest telescope in the world up until the completion of the massive [...] BTA-6 in Russia twenty-seven years later. The Hale reflector introduced several technical innovations used in future telescopes, including hydrostatic bearings for very low friction, the Serrurier truss for equal deflections of the two mirrors as the tube sags under gravity, and the use of Pyrex low-expansion glass for the mirrors. The arrival of substantially larger telescopes had to await the introduction of methods other than the rigidity of glass to maintain the proper shape of the mirror.|$|E

5000|$|Naturally {{occurring}} underground brine {{from the}} Wincham brinefield was pumped {{to the surface}} via a borehole. Such natural or wild brine pumping differs from controlled brine pumping, where water is pumped underground into rock to dissolve rock salt deposits. The process has historically been associated with subsidence, {{which has been a}} major problem in the Northwich area. The brine was purified by treatment with sodium carbonate and lime, and the salt extracted using a closed-pan partial <b>vacuum</b> <b>evaporation</b> method. The technique was adapted from the sugar industry, and had first been applied to salt extraction in 1887 in Silver Springs, New York. First tried commercially in the UK as early as 1901, several British manufacturers started up vacuum evaporator plants using a small Mirlees-type evaporator in parallel with their open-pan operations after the First World War. James Stubbs had learned about the method of <b>vacuum</b> <b>evaporation</b> in Michigan in 1905, and the New Cheshire Works was one of the early companies to adopt the <b>vacuum</b> <b>evaporation</b> method, importing an evaporator in the 1930s. Described as [...] "magnificent" [...] by journalist Mark Kurlansky, the company's first evaporator had three chambers; it had an Art Deco design, and was decorated with stripes in dark and pale wood, with brass fittings. The company updated the evaporator in the 1950s and the 1990s. In the 2000s, the works was using a small Svenson system with three evaporator chambers (termed [...] "effects").|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{threading}} individual {{ferrite cores}} on wires, thin-film memory consisted of 4 micrometre thick dots of permalloy, an iron-nickel alloy, deposited on small glass plates by <b>vacuum</b> <b>evaporation</b> techniques and a mask.

50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>evaporation</b> {{is also a}} form of {{physical}} vapor deposition used in the semiconductor, microelectronics, and optical industries and {{in this context is}} a process of depositing thin films of material onto surfaces. Such a technique consists of pumping a vacuum chamber to pressures of less than 10−5 torr and heating a material to produce a flux of vapor in order to deposit the material onto a surface. The material to be vaporized is typically heated until its vapor pressure is high enough to produce a flux of several Angstroms per second by using an electrically resistive heater or bombardment by a high voltage beam.|$|E
5000|$|Low-alcohol beer {{starts out}} as regular {{alcoholic}} beer, {{which is then}} cooked in order to evaporate the alcohol.
