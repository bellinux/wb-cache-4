50|$|The oldest lava dated from <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> {{are about}} 3.9 million years old. About 3.2 million years ago, <b>the</b> <b>volcano's</b> {{activity}} changed, <b>the</b> rate of eruption started to decrease and {{the composition of}} the lava erupted from <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> changed. <b>The</b> <b>volcano</b> is thought to have last erupted about 2.5 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|As eruptions {{become more}} and more {{frequent}} {{at the end of the}} preshield stage, the composition of the lava erupted from <b>the</b> Hawaiian <b>volcano</b> changes from alkalic basalt to tholeiitic basalt and <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> enters <b>the</b> submarine phase of the shield stage. In this phase, <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> continues to erupt pillow lava. Calderas form, fill, and reform at <b>the</b> <b>volcano's</b> summit and <b>the</b> rift zones remain prominent. <b>The</b> <b>volcano</b> builds its way up to sea level. The submarine phase ends when <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> is only shallowly submerged.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> becomes dormant, <b>the</b> {{forces of}} erosion {{gain control of}} <b>the</b> mountain. <b>The</b> <b>volcano</b> {{subsides}} into <b>the</b> oceanic crust due to its immense weight and loses elevation. Meanwhile, rain also erodes <b>the</b> <b>volcano,</b> creating deeply incised valleys.

50|$|For years <b>the</b> <b>volcano's</b> formal {{name was}} Alba Patera. Patera (pl. paterae) is Latin for a shallow {{drinking}} bowl or saucer. The term {{was applied to}} certain ill-defined, scalloped-edged craters that appeared in early spacecraft images to be volcanic (or non-impact) in origin. In September 2007, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) renamed <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> Alba Mons (Alba Mountain), reserving the term Alba Patera for <b>the</b> <b>volcano's</b> two central depressions (calderas). Nevertheless, <b>the</b> entire <b>volcano</b> is still commonly called Alba Patera in the planetary science literature.The term Alba is from the Latin word for white and refers to the clouds frequently seen over the region from Earth-based telescopes. <b>The</b> <b>volcano</b> was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1972 and was initially known as the Alba volcanic feature or the Arcadia Ring (in reference to the partial ring of fractures around <b>the</b> <b>volcano).</b> <b>The</b> IAU named <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> Alba Patera in 1973. <b>The</b> <b>volcano</b> is often simply called Alba when the context is understood.|$|R
