Throughout its length, it has {{numerous}} openings at regular intervals to allow the working fluid to impinge on the blades of the runner. These openings convert the pressure energy of the fluid into momentum energy just before the fluid impinges on the blades.

50|$|The Francis turbine {{is a type}} of {{reaction}} turbine, a category of turbine in which the working fluid comes to the turbine under immense pressure and the energy is extracted by the turbine blades from the working fluid. A part of the energy is given up by the fluid because of pressure changes occurring in the blades of the turbine, quantified by the expression of Degree {{of reaction}}, while the remaining part of the energy is extracted by the <b>volute</b> <b>casing</b> of the turbine. At the exit, water acts on the spinning cup-shaped runner features, leaving at low velocity and low swirl with very little kinetic or potential energy left. The turbine's exit tube is shaped to help decelerate the water flow and recover the pressure.|$|E
50|$|Degree of {{reaction}} {{can be defined}} as the ratio of pressure energy change in the blades to total energy change of the fluid. This means that it is a ratio indicating the fraction of total change in fluid pressure energy occurring in the blades of the turbine.

For example, if the degree {{of reaction}} is given to be 50%, that means that half of the total energy change of the fluid is taking place in the rotor blades and the other half is occurring in the stator blades. If the degree of reaction is zero it means that the energy changes due to the rotor blades is zero, leading to a different turbine design called Pelton Turbine.|$|E

This tekst covers {{fluid energy}} shape which uses in pump system. A pump is machine that imparts energy to a liquid to {{increase}} its pressure and move it from one point to another. There are many pump classification. One classification is acording to the method energy is imparted to the liquid: kinetic energy, or positive displacement. A centrifugal pump is of kinetic energy type because it imparts energy to a liquid by means of centrifugal force produced by a rotating impeller. Displacement pumps are of lower flow range and have pulsating flow rate. Centrifugal pump is rotodinamic pump that uses a rotating impeller to increase the pressure of liquid. They are commonly used to move liquids through a piping system. The liquid enters to the pump impeller along or near to the rotating axis and is accelerated bay the impeler, flowing radially outward into diffuser or <b>volute</b> chamber (<b>casing),</b> from where it exist into the downstream piping system. Like most pumps, a centrifugal pumps converts mechanical energy from a motor to energy of a moving fluid (liquid). Some of energy goes into kinetic energy of liquid motion and some into potential energy, represented by a liquid pressure or by lifting the liquid against gravity to higher level. The two major components of a centrifugal pumps are impeller and the casing in which it rotates. The transfer of energy from mechanical rotation of the impeller to the motion and pressure of the liquid is usually described by means of centrifugal force. Power from the driver, which is an electric motor, a diesel engine or a steam turbine (not for firefigting use) is transmitted to the pump through the shaft, rotating the impeller at high speed. In the modern centrifugal pump, most of the energy conversation {{is due to the}} outward force that curved impeller blades impart on the liquid. Invariability, some of the energy also pushes the liquid into a circular motion, and this circular motion can also convey some energy and increase the pressure at the outlet. The pumps are identified by the direction of the flow through impeller, with refernce to the axis of rotation. The total head of the pump is the energy imparted to the liquid as it passes through the pump. It may be expressed in various units of pressure, but for fire protection it’s generally given in units for pressure-bar or in units for long-m. The total head is calculated by subtracting the energy in the incoming fluid from the energy in the discharging liquid. Neto positive suction head (NPSH) is the pressure head that causes liquid to flow through the suction pipe and fitting into the eye of a pump impeller. The pump itself has no ability to ‘lift’ and the suction pressure depends {{on the nature of the}} supply. There are a two kinds of NPSH to consider. Pump NPSH is a function of the pump design and varies with the capacity and speed of any pump and with the design of different pumps. Available NPSH is a function of the system in which the pump operates and can be calculated readily. When the water source is above the pump, available NPSH is equal atmospheric pressure plus static head on suction minus friction and fitting losses in suction pipping minus vapor pressure of liquid. For any pump installation, the available system NPSH must be equal or greater than the pump NPSH at the desired operating condition. Pumps suppliers set the NPSH required (NPSHR) for a given pump. The (NPSHR) takes into account any potential head losses that might occur between the pump’ suction nozzle and impeller, thus ensuring that the liquid doesn’t drop below it’s vapour pressure...|$|R

The maximum pressure fluctuation amplitude in the sidewall gaps is larger than that in the <b>volute</b> <b>casing,</b> and different spectrum characteristics show up in the three models due to the interaction between the clearance flow and the main flow as well as the rotor-stator interaction.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} pressure fluctuation of a single-suction volute-type centrifugal pump, particularly <b>volute</b> <b>casing,</b> by using numerical and experimental methods. A new type of hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes/Large Eddy Simulation, {{referred to as the}} shear stress transport-scale-adaptive simulation (SAS) model, is employed to study the unsteady flow. Statistical analysis method is adopted to show the pressure fluctuation intensity distribution in the volute channel. A test rig for pressure pulsation measurement is built to validate the numerical simulation results using eight transient pressure sensors in the middle section of the volute wall. Results show that the SAS model can accurately predict the inner flow field of centrifugal pumps. Radial force acting on the impeller presents a star distribution related to the blade number. Pressure fluctuation intensity is strongest near the tongue and shows irregular distribution in the pump casing. Pressure fluctuation is distributed symmetrically at the cross-section of the <b>volute</b> <b>casing</b> because the volute can eliminate the rotational movement of the liquid discharged from the impeller. Blade passing frequency and its multiples indicate the dominant frequency of the monitoring points within the volute, and the low-frequency pulsation, particularly in the shaft component, increases when it operates at off-design condition, particularly with a small flow rate. The reason is that the vortex wave is enhanced at the off-design condition, which has an effect on the axle and is presented in the shaft component in the frequency domain...|$|E
30|$|The above {{results suggest}} that the stagger angle {{definitely}} affects the pressure fluctuation characteristics in the volute casing; in particular, it decreases the amplitude on the blade passage frequency.

40|$|AbstractWith a {{decrease}} in orders for their regular standard cargo-pump for chemical tankers, Frank Mohn Fusa started developing a new cargo-pump for the Offshore Supply Vessel market. This meant designing a pump which both {{should be able to}} pump high viscous oil-emulsion and a fluid called drilling-mud, which is a mixture of salt-water and small particles of barite stone. The first test performed when the thesis started showed that their initial design would not withstand the erosion from the particles for a long enough period of time; this because both the pump impeller and the pump <b>volute</b> <b>casing</b> suffered from heavy erosion. This master thesis has the objective of first quantifying the erosion in the original design and then comparing the CFD-simulations with real physical tests. From these results, together with analytical estimations of the erosion on the components and in compliance with erosion and fluid mechanical theory, a recommendation for a new design will be given. CFD-results for this new design will also be given. There is also a focus on finding the areas where erosion often occurs. Recommendations for material choice and coating are given for the original design. The results from the impeller simulations show that there are still some unknown variables in the prediction of erosion in CFD. While the steady state simulation differs quite much from the physical test, the transient simulation gives a better prediction for the pump impeller. It is found that the boundary layer in the grid has a large influence for the prediction of particle erosion. For the impeller it is found that the new design is a better solution than the original open impeller in regards to erosion rates, both at full-load and in the best efficiency point, while they are almost equal at part-load. The result from the pumps <b>volute</b> <b>casing</b> gives a good representation of the measured erosion from the physical test. The volute casings inlet tongue in the original design is a region where design changes are needed, since it has a high erosion rate caused by high velocity and high impinging angle. The new <b>volute</b> <b>casing</b> designed in this thesis, where the volume expansion is changed from radial to axial, gives better results, having approximately three times less maximum erosion rate at the inlet tongue. The analytical model used in this thesis gives a good estimation for some of the surfaces, while others differs to some degree from the CFD calculations. This is mainly caused by forces acting on the particles that are not accounted for in the analytical model. </p...|$|E
