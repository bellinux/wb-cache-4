40|$|The {{international}} security environment, {{characterized by the}} horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>proliferation</b> {{of nuclear weapons and}} technology holds manifold implications for India. In fact, it is the emergence of offensive nuclear attitudes of other states reflected in their doctrines which are open to the first use of nuclear weapons and even towards use against non-nuclear weapon states, which galvanized Indian efforts towards a military nuclear programme. The May 1998 tests gave to India an unalterable new identity- of a de facto nuclear weapons state- for which India sought international diplomatic recognition. A doctrine which would justify India’s nuclear status and policies was an important step in thi...|$|E
40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between nuclear postures and nonproliferation policies and the spread of nuclear weapons? At first blush, this might appear to be an obvious question. After all, states go to great lengths—extending nuclear security guarantees to nonnuclear weapon states, forward-deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of allies, sizing their own nuclear arsenals with the proliferation decisions of other states in mind, supporting international institutions in conducting inspections of nuclear facilities in nonnuclear weapon states, restricting the availability of sensitive nuclear technology, applying and enforcing sanctions against would-be prolifera-tors, conducting military strikes against nuclear facilities, and promoting nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes, among many other steps—to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It would be strange to imagine that states pursue such actions unless they can expect a policy payoff in terms of peace or security. Yet, there is little systematic evidence to suggest that nuclear postures and policies have a mean-ingful impact on the spread of nuclear weapons. Correctly understanding the effects of nuclear posture and policy on both horizontal proliferation (the spread of nuclear weapons to new states) and <b>vertical</b> <b>proliferation</b> (increases in the size and sophistication of nuclear arsenals within existing nuclear states) is a subject of extreme real-world importance.

40|$|Inspired by some newly emerged topics {{from the}} real world, this thesis {{comprises}} of four essays that study firms’ strategic incentives, {{as well as the}} vertical and horizontal agreements between firms. The first essay assesses theoretically firms’ incentives to engage in quality proliferation. We show that it is possible for <b>vertical</b> <b>proliferation</b> to be completely undesirable in the absence of entry threats, therefore proliferation of any level might be anticompetitive. Nevertheless, when proliferation is optimally conducted, it always benefits consumers. The second and third essays focus on vertical contracts between successive stages of production. The second essay places the controversial agency model involved in the e-book case in the context of antitrust treatment to vertical restraints, and examines its effects on competition and welfare relative to the wholesale model. The third essay goes beyond and develops a framework allowing us to clarify the ceteris paribus effects of changing each of the two key elements written in a vertical contract: decision roles and forms of the transfer payment. Based on this framework, we show that it is meaningful to distinguish between classic RRM, by which a manufacturer sets the transfer payment as well as the retail price, and agency RPM, by which a retailer is able to set the transfer payment before a manufacturer set the retail price. The final essay focuses on horizontal cartel agreements and experimentally investigates the effects of endogenous enforcement on cartel prices. We highlight the strategic uncertainty in cartel coordination as a channel of composition deterrence, as well as the potential trade-off between frequency and composition deterrence...|$|E
40|$|Following its {{election}} in 2007, the Labour government imposed {{a moratorium on}} export of Australian uranium to India. This article argues that with the Indo-US deal and concomitant agreements now in place, Australia should agree to export uranium to India. It does so {{on the grounds that}} the agreements will adequately protect Australian uranium from misuse, will not unduly test the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime, could open out oppor-tunities to meet important safety concerns, could help stabilise potentially dangerous <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>proliferation</b> and could also mitigate the region’s burgeoning production of greenhouse gases. In supporting the agreements through nuclear trade with India, however, Australia should use any infl uence it is able to garner thereby to ensure that the Indo-US agreement itself is not seen as part of an attempt on the part of the United States (US), or any other power, to harness India as a means of containing China, and thus exacerbating what could become a destabilising tendency in the region. Important strategic, moral, safety and environmental outcomes hinge on Australia’s decision whether to sell uranium to India. Following Labour’s win in the 2007 Australian national election, Foreign Minister Stephen Smith reversed the previous government’...|$|R
40|$|Stopping nuclear {{proliferation}} {{is at the}} top of the international agenda for years. With 182 signatures and 153 ratifications most states recognize the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as substantially inhibiting further <b>vertical</b> nuclear <b>proliferation</b> and in some extend halting the horizontal spread of nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, the entry into force of the treaty is in limbo due to nine hold-out states - China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and the United States. Why do they oppose it? Are there any windows of opportunity for the CTBT? The qualitative analysis distinguishes the inter-state, intra-state and decision-maker-level arguments. It is conducted in form of nine case studies and is primarily based upon official documents. Governmental statements rarely reveal full reasons for states’ reluctance concerning the CTBT, but outline necessary conditions for its success and provide a framework to work out policy approaches aiming at the treaties entry into force. The study points at a complex interrelation of technical reasons, security related arguments, arms-control related motivations and domestic policy issues. The most important findings to grapple with are seeking regionally comprehensive solutions and closing all outstanding loopholes accompanying the treaty. India and North Korea will be the toughest parties to sign and ratify the treaty, as there is either no interest in a treaty text as negotiated or no interest in banning nuclear testing at all, respectively. According to most hold-out states nuclear weapon states bear the highest responsibility for the treaty entry into force. This Working Paper is based on a master’s thesis submitted within the postgraduate course "Master of Peace and Security Studies – M. P. S. " as a joint programme of the University of Hamburg and the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy (IFSH). The thesis has been submitted in July 2010. The time frame, thus, focuses primarily on the debate until July 2010 and only briefly indicates on current occurrences...|$|R
40|$|Nine {{countries}} {{currently have}} nuclear weapons and of these only three have acquired {{them in the past}} 40 years. The primary reason for this has been the establishment of a powerful nuclear non-proliferation regime and its associated norms. The powerful influence of both the regime and the resulting norms on state behaviour is unquestionable. However a limited amount of state proliferation continues and some states’ behaviour suggests that they either reject, or believe that they are outside of the influence of the regime and its norms. My study is looking at the problem of non-conformity to the non-proliferation norm to see why it occurs. The issue is specifically a nuclear one however non-conformity to norms has wider implications in the study of international relations (IR). Regimes and norms clearly do not exist in a vacuum but operate within an international social environment. This nuclear issue remains a central consideration for state foreign policy and hence has justified extensive examination in the field of IR. The intellectually and ethically complex issues that surround access to this technology were acknowledged from its devastating baptism in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. International regulation was seen as the most appropriate form of control of nuclear weapons. This was in part due to the potential consequence of the misuse and the impact of accidents transcending national boundaries. This ultimate destructive capability has only been {{in the hands of a}} few states and the dissemination and control of this capability has been contentious from the day it was first used. Initially its power came from its potential to completely dominate militarily. As soon as the second country gained the same capability it became a lot more complicated. The destructive capability of nuclear weapons is such that any future war that saw their use could result in the annihilation of the human species. The Cold War and its extreme <b>vertical</b> nuclear <b>proliferation</b> actualised this fear. Nuclear technologies dual purpose functionality, of both peaceful power generation and the creation of a military nuclear capability make for a complex situation. There is an obvious power imbalance between the nuclear haves and have-nots and a self protective desire to stop or at least limit the number of countries attempting to join the ‘nuclear club’. Both realism and neo-liberal institutionalism are able to explain, in part, conformity and non conformity to regimes and their associated norms within today’s social environment. In this study I will use a social constructivist approach, which is based on the outcomes of persuasion, identification and social conformity, to see if it can add to the current explanations of state nuclear proliferation...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} study was to describe occupational therapists' experiences of evidence based practice (EBP) in municipal healthcare in northern Sweden. Method: Ten {{interviews were conducted with}} a qualitative interview method with occupational therapists working in municipal healthcare in three municipalities in northern Sweden. Collected data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis which resulted in three categories: EBP contributed to increased security and safer interventions in clinical work, Support from management and colleagues promoted implementation of EBP in clinical work and Driving functions are needed for <b>vertical</b> <b>proliferation</b> of EBP. Results: The occupational therapists stated that documentation was a way to ensure occupational therapy measures within the profession and the organization. The documentation was experienced as a verification of the occupational therapy skills and constituted a basis for decisions of measures. As a decisive factor for successful implementation of EBP and continuous improvement in municipal health care the occupational therapists experienced a need of daily dialogues and knowledge based exchanges with colleagues within the profession. Management support, with the provision of time and facilitators (individuals with special features) was experienced as a precondition to effectively drive EBP. Although municipal health care lacked access to scientific databases, occupational therapists experienced alternative paths to evidence and initial contacts with the academy contributed to increased opportunities for EBP in municipal health care. Conclusion: The results show that various forms of support had a central role in EBP for occupational therapists in municipal health care. Experiences of support occupational therapists stated came from management and colleagues, as well as from access to evidence and proven experience. Implementation of EBP was experienced as a long-term process that toke time and relied on the support functions, and on a management that prioritized EBP. This indicates that more research is needed in this area in order to obtain a deeper knowledge and understanding of how the identified factors and functions may be supported for the successful implementation of EBP in municipal health care.

40|$|Whilst {{developments}} in military hardware receive critical attention {{almost as a}} matter of course, innovations in police technology are only rarely focused upon. In this article an attempt is made to rectify this anomaly by providing a detailed survey of some recent devel-opments in police technologies, as well as directing concern towards the unanticipated consequences associated with their integration into systems of socio-political control. The technology of socio-political control is by definition more or less repressive. Since it appears to offer a flexible solution to many of the problems of internal control, there is a grave danger of its becoming a technological panacea substituted for real political authority when this is absent. Politicians are increasingly prone to hand over their most problematic difficulties to the police or military for solution, only to get them back later in a more intractable form. Consideration is given to the social implications of the <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>proliferation</b> of these technologies and their role in effecting the militarization of the society in which they are deployed. The article concludes that new police technologies facilitate the creation and maintenance of totalitarian societies. They pose a real threat to civil liberties and human rights, a threat likely to increase over time. The most repressive forms are currently being transferred to the Third World to service existing systems of cultural imperialism. By frustrating the struggles of the peoples in these countries to obtain a more just and equitable social order, the transfer of political control technology will escalate the processes leading to domestic arms races and thus increase the overall level of violence in the long term. 1...|$|R
40|$|While mergers, both {{horizontal}} and vertical, have been shaping {{the landscape of}} the agri-food industry in Europe, the implications of the changing market structure on the level of innovation has not been studied yet. In this paper we deal with the link between innovation and market structure using the empirical example of the Danish agri-food industry. The {{purpose of this paper is}} two-fold. First we test for the importance of vertical integration on innovation. While there exist several studies on this linkage, to our knowledge, this is the first that deals with the agri-food industry. Secondly, we examine both product proliferation and innovation. To our knowledge, there are no other similar studies that examine both aspects using the same data set. We follow the hypothesis put forward by Armour and Teece (1980) that vertical integration enhances technological innovation, mainly because vertical integration may resolve hold-up problems. Our paper is related also to recent work by Weiss and Witkopp (2005) on the German food industry, although their work is mostly related to the role of the retail sector. We are able to examine both innovation (measured as investment on R&D) as well as product proliferation (measured as number of new products). We also examine the effects of network relationships and the importance of countervailing power. We use data from an extensive survey of 444 Danish firms over two years, 2000 and 2005 to estimate two different models: a bootstrapped zero-inflated Poisson regression and a robust Heckman sample selection model. The results verify the hypotheses formulated for both models with various degrees of significance.

40|$|Sea-level rise {{will change}} {{environmental}} conditions on coral reef flats, which comprise extensive habitats in shallow tropical seas and support {{a wealth of}} ecosystem services. Rapid relative sea-level rise of 0. 6  m over a relatively pristine coral reef in Solomon Islands, caused by a subduction earthquake in April 2007, generated {{a unique opportunity to}} examine in situ coral reef response to relative sea-level rise of the magnitude (but not the rate) anticipated by 2100. Extent of live coral was measured from satellite imagery in 2003, 2006, 2009 and 2012. Ecological data were obtained from microatolls and ecological surveys in May 2013. The reef was sampled at 12 locations where dense live hard coral remained absent, remained present or changed from absent to present following subsidence. Ecological data (substratum depth, live coral canopy depth, coral canopy height, substratum suitability, recruitment, diversity and Acropora presence) were measured at each location to identify factors associated with coral response to relative sea-level rise. <b>Vertical</b> and horizontal <b>proliferation</b> of coral occurred following subsidence. Lateral expansion of live coral, accomplished primarily by branching Acropora spp., resulted in lower diversity in regions which changed composition from pavement to dense live coral following subsidence. Of the ecological factors measured, biotic factors were more influential than abiotic factors; species identity was {{the most important factor in}} determining which regions of the reef responded to rapid sea-level rise. On relatively pristine reef flats under present climatic conditions, rapid relative sea-level rise generated an opportunity for hard coral to proliferate. However, the species assemblage of the existing reef was important in determining response to sea-level change, by providing previously bare substrate with a source of new coral colonies. Degraded reefs with altered species composition and slower coral growth rates may be less able to respond to climate change-induced sea-level changes...|$|R
