25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each <b>valve</b> <b>stem,</b> the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> also locks the collet halves in place to the <b>valve</b> <b>stem.</b> To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
25|$|The Walschaerts gear can {{be linked}} to inside or outside {{admission}} valves. This article has only considered inside-admission piston valves until now, but outside-admission valves (slide valves and some piston valves) can use Walschaerts valve gear. If the valves have outside admission the radius bar connects to the combination lever below the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> rather than above.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the flight}} the {{loosened}} nut caused increasingly excessive valve clearance eventually allowing collision of the valve {{head with the}} rising piston fracturing the <b>valve</b> <b>stem,</b> which then allowed the inlet valve to drop open, resulting in the ignition by the spark plug of the pressurised fuel/air mixture within the inlet manifold and, eventually, the pumping of the ignited fuel outboard of the rocker cover and along {{the outside of the}} engine, leading to an extensive fire in the engine nacelle. Due to the fire [...] originating in the induction system, where the supercharged fuel/air mixture was at higher pressure than atmospheric, the heart of the fire was much hotter burning and intense than would be the case in a simple fuel fire.|$|E

50|$|The outer <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is {{manufactured}} in various lengths for different applications, {{and has a}} narrower diameter (6 mm) than Dunlop and Schrader valves (8 mm). The weakest point of a bicycle rim is usually the hole for the <b>valve</b> <b>stem.</b> The smaller hole for a Presta valve {{makes it possible to}} have extremely narrow wheels while maintaining sufficient strength in the wheel.|$|E
50|$|Inexpensive engines {{may have}} valve seats that are simply {{cut into the}} {{material}} of the cylinder head or engine block (depending {{on the design of}} the engine). Some newer engines have seats that are sprayed on rather than being pressed into the head, allowing them to be thinner, creating more efficient transfer of heat through the valve seats, and enabling the <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> to function at a lower temperature, thus allowing the <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> (and other parts of the valvetrain) to be thinner and lighter.|$|R
50|$|TPM sensors can {{be fitted}} to the wheels {{in a number of}} ways. They can be mounted {{on the back of the}} tire <b>valves</b> <b>stem</b> or {{attached}} using adhesive or to a band which is then securely wrapped around the rim inside the tire, usually in the drop zone.|$|R
50|$|Valve burn (overheating) {{is another}} problem. It causes {{excessive}} valve wear and defective sealing, {{as well as}} engine knocking (the hot valve causes the fuel to prematurely ignite). It can be solved by valve cooling systems that use water or oil as a coolant. In high performance or turbo charged engines sometimes sodium filled <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> are used. These <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> then act as a heat pipe. A major cause of burnt valves {{is a lack of}} valve clearance at the tappet; the valve cannot completely close. This reduces its ability to conduct heat to the cylinder head via the seat, and may allow hot combustion gases to flow between the valve and its seat. Burnt valves will cause a low compression in the affected cylinder and loss of power.|$|R

50|$|The hemi head {{always has}} {{intake and exhaust}} <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> that point in {{different}} directions, requiring a large, wide cylinder head and complex rocker arm geometry in both cam-in-block and overhead cam engines.

50|$|For {{motorcycle}} tires, {{a device}} {{similar to the}} internal beadlock of 4-wheel drive vehicles can be used. A special inner tube is inflated via its own <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> to high pressure to push the bead of the tire tight against the wheel. Like the rim lock, this clamps both beads at once. The regular <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is used to inflate the tire to the desired pressure.|$|E

50|$|The <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is a tube made {{of metal}} or rubber, {{through which the}} tire is inflated, with a check valve, {{typically}} a Schrader valve on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a Presta valve on high-performance bicycles. Valve stems usually protrude through the wheel for easy access. They mount directly to the rim, {{in the case of}} tubeless tires, or {{are an integral part of}} the inner tube. The rubber in valve stems eventually degrades, and, in the case of tubeless tires, replacement of the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> at regular intervals or with tire replacement reduces the chance of failure. Some may notice that their <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is all metal with a nut retaining it (as opposed to the typical rubber stem with brass threads). Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a tire pressure monitoring system which usually consists of a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> attached to an electronic module. The module is hidden inside and is only visible when the tire has been removed from the wheel.|$|E
50|$|If the {{camshaft}} {{is located in}} the crankcase, a valve train of pushrods and rocker arms will be required to operate overhead valves. Mechanically simpler are side valves, where the <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> rested directly on {{the camshaft}}. However, this gives poor gas flows within the cylinder head as well as heat problems and fell out of favor for automobile use, see flathead engine.|$|R
50|$|The two DOHC, 16-valve heads {{incorporate}} a fuel-efficient, low-emission design, with a 'tumble swirl air' motion {{created by a}} specially shaped intake port and increased valve angle and lift. The belt-driven camshafts act directly on hollow <b>valve</b> <b>stems.</b> Intake <b>valves</b> are hollow (reducing their mass from 51.6 to 48.4 grams) and the exhaust valves (46.7 versus 50.5 grams) are sodium-filled for more efficient heat transfer.|$|R
50|$|On June 27 1962 {{a larger}} Twin Cam {{appeared}} in the just-released Giulia. The obvious change was that displacement was increased to 1567 cc, but the engine was also now being produced using a different casting method. The diameter of the <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> had been increased by 1 mm to 9 mm, the bore centre spacing was different, the timing chain longer and the crank had been revised, among other changes.|$|R
50|$|Since {{flow rates}} are low and many turns of the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> are {{required}} to completely open or close, needle valves are not used for simple shutoff applications.|$|E
50|$|The '3E' and '3E-E' {{engines are}} {{considered}} slightly less reliable than other Toyota engines, {{although they are}} also among the easiest engines to service. The most common problems affecting these engines are premature <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> seal (nitrile) failure, carbon buildup on the intake valves, and collapse of the oil control ring on the piston. Any of these conditions can lead to rough idling, stalling, and fouled spark plugs, and therefore need to be differentially diagnosed. The <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> seals, at least, can be replaced with silicone or viton-based seals which last much longer.|$|E
50|$|In {{competition}} engines, where aggressive cam {{action is}} common, top-hat shims {{are used to}} protect {{the tip of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>stem.</b> For this reason they are necessary with titanium valves.|$|E

50|$|The {{other major}} {{difference}} {{with the first}} GSX engines was the move from direct overhead cam actuation of the valve by shim and bucket of the GS engines, to valve actuation via short forked rocker arms in the GSX -the <b>valves</b> <b>stems</b> and springs being located inboard from the camshafts due to the reduced included angle between inlet and exhaust valves. Apart from the heads the GS/GSX engines were of a common design.|$|R

Output was 89 kW (119 hp) and 202 N·m (149 lb·ft). It was replaced in 2001 by the Mazda-derived Duratec 23, but Ford Power Products continues to sell this engine as the LRG-425.|$|R
