5000|$|In {{historical}} contexts, Flanders originally {{refers to}} the County of Flanders (Flandria), which around AD 1000 stretched from the Strait of Dover to the Scheldt estuary. The core of historical Flanders is situated within modern-day Flanders and corresponds to the provinces West Flanders and East Flanders, but it sometimes stretched into what is now France and the Netherlands. Nevertheless, during the 19th and 20th centuries it became increasingly commonplace in English and some other languages {{to use the term}} [...] "Flanders" [...] to refer to the entire Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, stretching {{all the way to the}} River Maas, as well as cultural movements such as Flemish art. In accordance with late 20th century Belgian state reforms the area was made into two political entities: the [...] "Flemish Community" [...] (Vlaamse Gemeenschap) and the [...] "Flemish Region" [...] (<b>Vlaams</b> <b>Gewest).</b> These entities were merged, although geographically the Flemish Community, which has a broader cultural mandate, covers Brussels, whereas the Flemish Region does not.|$|E
