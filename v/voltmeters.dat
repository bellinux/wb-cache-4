25|$|A {{voltmeter}} is {{an instrument}} used for measuring {{electrical potential difference}} between two points in an electric circuit. Analog <b>voltmeters</b> move a pointer across a scale {{in proportion to the}} voltage of the circuit; digital <b>voltmeters</b> give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital converter. The digital voltmeter was invented in 1953 by Andrew Kay, founder of Kaypro.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum Tube <b>Voltmeters</b> or valve <b>voltmeters</b> (VTVM, VVM) {{were used}} for voltage {{measurements}} in electronic circuits where high input impedance was necessary. The VTVM had a fixed input impedance of typically 1megohm or more, usually through use of a cathode follower input circuit, and thus did not significantly load the circuit being tested. VTVMs were used before the introduction of electronic high-impedance analog transistor and field effect transistor <b>voltmeters</b> (FETVOMs). Modern digital meters (DVMs) and some modern analog meters also use electronic input circuitry to achieve high input impedance—their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs. The input impedance of some poorly-designed DVMs (especially some early designs) would vary {{over the course of}} a sample-and-hold internal measurement cycle, causing disturbances to some sensitive circuits under test.|$|E
25|$|To {{avoid the}} loading of the {{measured}} circuit {{by the current}} drawn by the meter movement, some analog multimeters use an amplifier inserted between the measured circuit and the meter movement. While this increases the expense {{and complexity of the}} meter, by use of vacuum tubes or field effect transistors the input resistance can be made very high and independent of the current required to operate the meter movement coil. Such amplified multimeters are called VTVMs (vacuum tube <b>voltmeters),</b> TVMs (transistor volt meters), FET-VOMs, and similar names.|$|E

50|$|A vector <b>voltmeter</b> is a two-channel {{high-frequency}} sampling <b>voltmeter</b> {{that measures}} phase {{as well as}} voltage of two input signals of the same frequency.|$|R
25|$|Nixies {{were used}} as numeric {{displays}} in early digital <b>voltmeters,</b> multimeters, frequency counters and many other types of technical equipment. They also appeared in costly digital time displays used in research and military establishments, and in many early electronic desktop calculators, including the first: the Sumlock-Comptometer ANITA Mk VII of 1961 and even the first electronic telephone switchboards. Later alphanumeric versions in fourteen segment display format found use in airport arrival/departure signs and stock ticker displays. Some elevators used Nixies to display floor numbers.|$|E
25|$|For a decade, colleges had {{required}} {{science and}} engineering majors to take a course in computer programming, typically using the FORTRAN or BASIC languages. This meant there was a sizable customer base who knew about computers. In 1970, electronic calculators were not seen outside of a laboratory, but by 1974 they were a common household item. Calculators and video games like Pong introduced computer power to the general public. Electronics hobbyists were moving on to digital projects such as digital <b>voltmeters</b> and frequency counters. The Altair had enough power to be actually useful, and was designed as an expandable system that opened it up {{to all sorts of}} applications.|$|E
2500|$|Capacitive {{coupling}} is {{the mechanism}} used by electrical tester pen devices. [...] Because the capacitance between an object and a current source is typically small, only very small currents can {{flow from the}} energized source to the coupled object. [...] High-impedance digital or analog <b>voltmeters</b> may measure elevated voltages from non-energized objects due to this coupling, in effect providing a misleading reading. [...] For this reason, high-impedance voltage measurements of normally non-energized objects must be verified.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:In modern {{electronics}} laboratory a <b>voltmeter</b> {{with high}} precision and digital displaying mechanism {{is an essential}} device. This paper describes the mechanism of a <b>voltmeter</b> that can measure voltage up to 30. 00 V with a resolution of 10 mV. In this <b>voltmeter</b> the achieved accuracy is quite good {{so that it can}} be used where precise voltage measurement is required...|$|R
50|$|A {{multimeter}} is {{a combination}} of a multirange DC <b>voltmeter,</b> multirange AC <b>voltmeter,</b> multirange ammeter, and multirange ohmmeter. An un-amplified analog multimeter combines a meter movement, range resistors and switches; VTVMs are amplified analog meters and contain active circuitry.|$|R
50|$|Specifying {{a voltage}} {{measurement}} requires explicit or implicit specification {{of the points}} across which the voltage is measured. When using a <b>voltmeter</b> to measure potential difference, one electrical lead of the <b>voltmeter</b> must {{be connected to the}} first point, one to the second point.|$|R
2500|$|The {{control room}} also had switchboards, {{a row of}} four periscopes, manometers, {{frequency}} gauges, <b>voltmeters</b> and ammeters, green/red/white signal lamps, and switches at the propulsion console and guidance panel to dynamically display approximately 15 measurement points within the rocket. Additionally, the control room had a big [...] "X-time" [...] countdown clock that display the time until launch, which was announced via loudspeakers as [...] "X minus four minutes", etc. [...] In addition to the control room, the blockhouse also contained offices, a conference room, a small dormitory with double bunks and an adjoining shower, a wash room, and a workshop. A long underground corridor led from the measurement blockhouse to {{a room in the}} concrete foundation by the flame pit, and multiple rows of measurement cables covered the walls of the tunnel. A different gradually rising tunnel led from the long flame pit room to the exterior of the arena near the pumphouse (...) [...] Near the pumphouse were high wooden towers to cool the water, and [...] high tanks for the recooling water were integrated into the ellipse wall.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide range}} of {{instrumentation}} is used by electrical engineers. [...] For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic multimeter measuring voltage, current, and resistance may suffice. [...] Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the oscilloscope is also an ubiquitous instrument. [...] In RF engineering and high frequency telecommunications, spectrum analyzers and network analyzers are used. [...] In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation. [...] For instance, medical electronics designers {{must take into account}} that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids. Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although <b>voltmeters</b> may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different. [...] Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline. [...] Audio electronics engineers use audio test sets consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as harmonic distortion and noise. [...] Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and {{the same is true of}} television broadcasting.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to multimeters, solenoid <b>voltmeters</b> {{have no other}} built-in functions (such {{as the ability to}} act as an ammeter, ohmmeter, or capacitance meter); they are just simple, easy-to-use power <b>voltmeters.</b> Solenoid <b>voltmeters</b> are useless on low-voltage circuits (for example, 12 volt circuits). The basic range of the voltmeter starts at around 90V (AC or DC).|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after taking}} up {{his work in}} the Edison {{laboratories}} at Menlo Park, Mr. Howell invented the first reliable electric current pressure indicator, known as the Howell <b>voltmeter,</b> which was the standard for central station switchboards until the development of the Weston <b>voltmeter</b> in 1890.|$|R

The setup used for this demonstration is shown in Figure 1. When a small resistance is wired in parallel with the galvanometer, it functions as an ammeter, as in Figure 2. The ammeter is used to measure the current in several circuits. When a large resistance is wired in series with the galvanometer, it functions as a <b>voltmeter,</b> as in Figure 3.

50|$|Note {{that the}} voltage shift {{expressed}} by the Seebeck effect cannot be measured directly, since the measured voltage (by attaching a <b>voltmeter)</b> contains an additional voltage contribution, due to the temperature gradient and Seebeck effect in the measurement leads. The <b>voltmeter</b> voltage is always dependent on relative Seebeck coefficients among the various materials involved.|$|R
5000|$|Electrostatic <b>voltmeter</b> {{utilizes}} {{the attraction}} force between two charged surfaces {{to create a}} deflection of a pointer directly calibrated in volts.
