Particular emphasis is laid on evaluating policies consisting of multiple programmes, {{which is of}} high relevance in practice. For example, active labour market policies may consist of different training programmes, employment programmes and wage subsidies. Similarly, sickness rehabilitation policies often offer different vocational as well as non-vocational rehabilitation measures. First, the <b>main</b> <b>identification</b> strategies (control-for-confounding-variables, difference-in-difference, instrumental-variable, and regression-discontinuity identification) {{are discussed in the}} multiple-programme setting. Thereafter, the different nonparametric matching and weighting estimators of the average treatment effects and their properties are examined.

There is {{no significant difference in}} result in comparison to <b>main</b> <b>identification</b> strategy of my paper when I borrowed all baseline trade cost coefficient from Felbermayr et al.

40|$|<b>Main</b> verb <b>identification</b> is {{the task}} of {{automatically}} identifying the predicate-verb in a sentence. It is useful for many applications in Chinese Natural Language Processing. Although most {{studies have focused on}} the model used to identify the main verb, the definition of the main verb should not be overlooked. In our specification design, we have found many complicated issues that still need to be resolved since they haven’t been well discussed in previous works. Thus, the first novel aspect of our work is that we carefully design a specification for annotating the main verb and investigate various complicated cases. We hope this discussion will help to uncover the difficulties involved in this problem. Secondly, we present an approach to realizing <b>main</b> verb <b>identification</b> based on the use of chunk information, which leads to better results than the approach based on part-of-speech. Finally, based on careful observation of the studied corpus, we propose new local and contextual features for <b>main</b> verb <b>identification.</b> According to our specification, we annotate a corpus and then use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to integrate all the features we propose. Our model, which was trained on our annotated corpus, achieved a promising F score of 92. 8 %.
