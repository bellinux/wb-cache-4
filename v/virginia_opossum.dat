40|$|Meso-mammals are {{frequent}} cave visitors whose role in cave ecology is poorly understood. Understanding meso-mammal cave use is essential because caves are often managed for United States federally endangered, cave-obligate arthropods. My objectives {{for this study}} were to quantify annual meso-mammal cave visitation, determine behaviors of meso-mammals while in the caves, to develop multinomial regression to determine which variables best differentiate caves use by each species, and to determine how North American porcupines incorporate caves into their home range and habitat use. North American porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) were the most common cave visitor (64 %), followed by raccoons (Procyon lotor; 14 %) and <b>Virginia</b> <b>opossums</b> (Didelphis virginiana; 10 %). These results are noteworthy because central Texas caves were historically associated with raccoons and the additional nutrient inputs of North American porcupines could facilitate replacement of cave-obligate species by more competitive, or predatory, terrestrial species. Videos recorded in cave passages showed North American porcupines used caves for denning and grooming, while <b>Virginia</b> <b>opossums</b> used caves for feeding. The strongest multinomial model showed that, compared to North American porcupine, raccoons and <b>Virginia</b> <b>opossums</b> had greater odds of using caves with gates (2. 36, 4. 10, respectively) and pit entrances (6. 11, 2. 23, respectively). Conversely, raccoons and <b>Virginia</b> <b>opossums,</b> compared to North American porcupine, had lower odds of using caves that were constructed or excavated (0. 42, 0. 14, respectively), and visiting during the spring (0. 46, 0. 28, respectively) and winter (0. 43, 0. 37, respectively). These variables all likely relate to either <b>Virginia</b> <b>opossums?</b> and raccoons? greater dexterity or restricted movements after entering torpor during low temperatures. North American porcupine home range estimates (46 ? 421 ha) and overlap indices (42 % and 93 %) were larger than expected with females spending a majority of their time near a cave entrance. All individuals selected forested cover at the landscape and point scales. Bare ground was selected at the home range scale likely to be used as trails. The results from my study represent an initial step in understanding meso-mammal cave use in central Texas. Should cave nutrient levels need to be managed, my data can be used to manipulate habitats to make caves less desirable to North American porcupine...|$|R

500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a <b>Virginia</b> <b>opossum.</b> Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E
