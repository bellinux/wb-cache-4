However, we know much less about the effect of catch crops on phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) mobilisation and availability for the next crop. After several years of organic cash crop production, e. g. vegetables and cereals, yield levels may gradually be limited by soil P and K availability, depending on the initial status at conversion to organic production principles. This is particularly the case during the establishment phase of certain <b>vegetable</b> <b>cultures</b> with a limited rooting system (e. g. lettuce, leeks, onions). Therefore, it has often been hypothesized that certain catch crops are capable of increasing the availability of P and K when the soil status becomes low.

The original migration of DNAPL and dissolved organic compounds occurred through a sand and gravel unit locally in contact with the underlying rock aquifer and through windows in the till overlying the bedrock. The Quebec Environment Ministry controlled this problem with a pump-and-treat system intercepting the dissolved contaminant plume, and by the definition of a controlled area within which groundwater pumping is prohibited. The area surrounding Ville-Mercier, within and outside the controlled zone, is a very active agricultural area dedicated mostly to <b>vegetable</b> <b>culture</b> and groundwater is needed to support this growing industry.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 39). This internship report {{is based on the}} Corporate Social Responsibilities of Chevron Bangladesh and how a single project named Alternative Livelihood Project can benefit the local community people where the company operates its businesses. In the beginning of the report the industry and company background, organization structure and vision for the future are being presented. In the following chapter, there is a brief description of my internship experience of four months as an intern for Government Affairs Department followed by the chapters where the community engagement programs of Chevron Bangladesh is explained. Some marketing analysis of the key products of the Village Development Organization is also illustrated here in the report. Finally the report concludes by suggesting some recommendations for the Village Development Organization of Alternative Livelihood Project. Chevron defines its corporate social responsibilities as Community Engagement. The company believes that since they are operating in some parts of Sylhet area, they are socially responsible for the betterment of those local people‟s lives. In order to enrich their lives and contribute to the community, Chevron provides different community engagement programs which in theoretical language we call the Corporate Social Responsibilities or CSR activities. Village Development Organization falls under the Community Engagement Projects which helps the local community people to improve their livelihood and socio-economic condition. The members of these organizations take loans and receive training in different areas and after that they open up their own enterprises. In their enterprises, they conduct some marketing activities to sell the products. The paper illustrates the marketing activities and provides recommendation to improve their enterprises further. Chevron‟s community development programs help over 30, 000 people every year, through a focus on livelihoods, education and health. As part of their CSR activities, Chevron conducts blood donation campaign, building saplings near the roadsides; building homes for the local people, offering improve cooking stoves and solar panel. Chevron introduced an innovative idea that enables communities to raise the capital necessary to launch their own income-generating enterprises. Under the program, Chevron provided environmentally-friendly cooking and lighting solutions - improved stoves and solar panels - that allow people to save in monthly fuel and lighting costs. Most of Chevron‟s social investment programs in Bangladesh focus on improving the quality of life and economic opportunities for the communities where they work. Through nongovernmental organizations, these livelihood development programs have organized the villagers into self-help groups and provided skills training and seed funds, enabling them to launch a wide variety of small and medium enterprises. Working with the nongovernmental organizations Health Service Delivery Project and the U. S. Agency for International Development, Chevron helped start three community clinics near the Bibiyana and Moulavi Bazar fields. Each year, these facilities provide about 72, 000 treatments and services to their patients. Chevron is also helping to fund a five-year program that offers scholarships to students from across Asia and the Middle East who attend the Asian University for Women. Chevron has extended a three-year pre-primary program with Save the Children that will serve 1, 800 out-of-school children in 60 schools in the Bibiyana and Jalalabad area. Forming a Village Development Organization is a two phase process. The first phase is Initiation where the idea of creating the VDO takes place. The second phase is the Execution phase where the VDO starts their operation. For the sake of the project, three different kinds of emprises of the village development organization are portrayed throughout the paper. These are- fish culture, <b>vegetable</b> <b>culture</b> and poultry. By practicing this VDO method, the enterprise owners are getting the business benefits and earning more as an alternative source of income. At the end of the report, some recommendations are provided for the betterment of the project such as- to record the income and expenses on a daily basis and introducing integrated cultivation methods. Through this village development organization, Chevron is introducing an alternative source of income for the local people and contributing to their economy as a part of their corporate social responsibility.

40|$|Recently, four genes {{encoding}} putative copper pumping ATPases {{have been}} cloned from widely different sources: two genes from Enterococcus hirae {{that are involved}} in copper metabolism and two human genes that are defective in the copper-related Wilson and Menkes disease. The predicted gene products are P-type ATPases. They exhibit extensive sequence similarity and appear to be members of a new class of ATP driven copper pumps involved in the regulation of cellular copper. Key worak: Conner; ATPase; Transport; Menkes disease; Wilson disease; Enterococcus hirae 1. Copper is a toxic but essential element Copper functions as cofactor in various redox en-zymes such as lysyl oxidase, cytochrome c oxidase, su-peroxide dismutase, dopamine B-hydroxylase, and ty-rosinase. Copper is also a component of bacterial azurins and plastocyanins. At the same time, copper is very toxic to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Copper ions can bind to proteins and nucleic acids and can cause the oxidation of lipids and proteins. The formation of delete-rious free radicals is also enhanced by copper ions. In-deed, this toxicity is put to use in disease prevention in <b>vegetable</b> <b>cultures.</b> For cell viability, regulation of intra-cellular copper activity is thus crucially important and mechanisms must exist for the homeostasis of copper. Recent studies of copper resistance in the Gram-posi-tive bacterium Enterococcus hirae has led to the discov-ery of two putative copper transporting ATPases. Inter-estingly, these enzymes exhibit extensive sequence identity to two human ATPases that are defective in the copper-related Menkes and Wilson disease. Copper ho-meostasis has also been extensively studied in other bac-teria, notably Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas syrin-gae. However, there is at present no evidence for ATP driven copper transport in these organisms and they will not be considered here. 2.

Of 35 food samples tested, 11 were positive for acholeplasmas; acholeplasmas isolated from 6 of these samples were recovered only in SP 4 medium. In seven single vegetable samples, two or more Acholeplasma spp. were isolated. A. laidlawii was isolated from all three vegetables and A. axanthum was found in broccoli and kale. Four isolates were serologically identified as A. oculi. Mycoplasma verecundum was the only Mycoplasma species recovered. Several isolates could not be typed serologically, as they reacted with antisera to both A. morum and A. hippikon. these isolates may include new Acholeplasma spp...|$|R
40|$|Research has {{established}} {{the most effective}} lactic acid bacteria used for fermentation of fruit and <b>vegetables</b> juices. The <b>cultures</b> were used for Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus and culture of micro flora obtained spontaneous shoots. Lactic fermented juice was obtained from cabbage, carrots and beetroot. Working in these variants were determined lactic fermentation parameters {{and some of the}} bioactive compounds from this process: pH, reducing sugars, viable cell counts. Determination of reducing sugars calculated as glucose was conducted using the 3. 5 dinitrosalicilic acid method (DNS method), pH was determined with a pH meter electronics. Chemical parameters listed were determined every two hours during the first 24 hours, then 48 and 72 hours in thermostatic conditions at 37 degrees C and 7 days storage at refrigerator temperature. At the end of the lactic fermentation, the lowest pH 4. 31, which also provide juice conservation was obtained using a pure culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus. Reducing sugar is metabolized significantly when the juice of beetroot, fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus culture, 75. 19 %. The results may be an argument for obtaining juice fermented lactic acid, which are popular functional foods, to obtain a chemical composition and sensory their optimum...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) quality and iits decomposibility is {{influenced}} by cropping pattern. However, little is known on this matter, particularly so far rice monoculture or comination of <b>vegetables</b> with rice <b>culture.</b> Therefore, four pairs of fields having vegetable-rice and rice-rice cropping pattern were selected from four different locations in Bangladesh, covering floodplain and terrace soils. Soils were first physically fractionated into particulate organic matter (POM) and silt and clay sized OM. The silt and clay sized OM was further chemically fractionated by oxidation with 6 % NaOCl to isolate an oxidation-resistant OM fraction, followed by extraction of mineral bound OM with 10 % HF (HF-res OM). The results {{show that there is}} a small increase in POM in vegetable compared with rice soils. Among the chemical treatments, NaOCl oxidized the largest amount of OC and N from the silt and clay fractions of vegetable soils. The silt and clay N in vegetable soil was found to be more susceptible to NaOCl treatment compared with OC. Both the HF-extracted (HF-ex) and HF-res OM fractions were found to be lower in vegetable soils compared with rice soils. Results from both physical and chemical fraction of SOM suggest that SOM accumulated in vegetable-rice cropping pattern are more labile than the solely rice based cropping pattern and prone to decompose quickly in any change of land use...|$|R
40|$|Making {{the deserts}} bloom {{may soon be}} more than just a dream. Researchers at the Scottish Agricultural College have {{developed}} a hydrogel, a water-retentive swelling gel, which makes it possible to grow crops and trees in arid areas where saline water is a problem. The hydrogel, based on polyethylene oxide, has been developed with the University of Strathclyde. It has three distinct uses: firstly, {{it can be used to}} coat seeds before planting in soils where saline water may be a problem. This coating allows moisture through but 'filters out' the salt which would destroy the seedling. The hydrogel can also catch and retain water from mist and fog that sweeps over deserts in the cool nights. A second use for the hydrogel is to mix it with soil when planting trees. If the hydrogel is saturated at planting, then moisture will be gradually released over a period of time. Eventually the hydrogel will degrade by which time the roots will be established. The hydrogel can be used also for growing <b>vegetables</b> in soil-less <b>cultures.</b> lt allows tomatoes and cucumbers to be grown with water as saline as 16. () () 0 ppm (seawater contains roughly 35, 000 ppm and freshwater less than 1 25 ppm). It is possible to combine the hydrogel with a unique valve which opens when the hydrogel is dry and closes when sufficient water has been fed to the surrounding crop: the valve requires no electricity.

40|$|Abstract: Nutrition {{is linked}} with {{construction}} worker {{health and safety}} (H&S) performance. Some accidents, injuries and in some cases, deaths on construction sites are direct or indirect results of physical and psychological distresses (chronic health conditions and mental instability) arising from poor nutrition of construction workers. However, despite the undeniable contribution of nutrition to H&S performance improvements, {{there seems to be}} very little research on the nutrition of construction workers, especially in South Africa. The study therefore investigated the predominant nutritional intake of construction workers in the Gauteng Province of South Africa, the factors which influence the predominant intake, and the influence of nutrition on worker safety performance, and recommended possible interventions to improve construction workers‟ nutrition. A theoretical framework showing interrelationships between nutrition and its influencing factors as well as between nutrition and safety performance was developed based on the literature reviewed. Empirical data was collected through a field questionnaire survey. The questionnaire, which was first piloted, was administered to construction workers in order to determine how often they consumed various foods in a week, the factors which influenced their food choice and their safety performance on construction sites. Reliability test (Cronbach‟s alpha) was applied to the measurement sub-scales. Using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 software, empirical data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Principal components analysis (PCA) and multiple regression analysis (MRA) were used to analyse the data. Results revealed that construction workers‟ weekly consumption consisted mainly of corn meal, meat, fruits and <b>vegetables.</b> Nutritional knowledge, <b>culture</b> and resources were found to influence construction workers‟ nutrition. Other influencers were economic factors as well as personal ideas and systems. Nutrition was indicated to influence leading safety performance, whereas no significant effect was found on lagging safety performance. This research provides valuable evidence for improving the nutrition of construction workers and thus H&S performance on construction sites. Knowledge of the factors which influence the nutrition of construction workers will allow for the design of explicit, feasible and effectual [...] . M. Tech. (Construction Management...|$|R
