This study focuses on employees who are often shapers of brand identities by being able to influence both internal (e. g. other employees) as well as external stakeholders (e. g. customers). More specifically, this paper contributes to the internal branding literature by developing and testing a model of antecedents and consequences of employee’s responses to branding (measured by proxy of brand knowledge, employee-based brand equity (EBBE) and brand identification). The research identifies organisational context specific variables (i. e. internal market orientation and manger’s brand leadership) as significant antecedents of employee’s responses to the employer brand. It also demonstrates the importance of employee’s responses to the employer brand with regards to two extra-role behaviors: customer orientation and brand <b>value</b> <b>dissemination.</b> The proposed model highlights the significant role of EBBE in customer orientation and brand <b>value</b> <b>dissemination</b> while it indicates differential behaviors for cognitive versus affective paths of internal branding...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{evaluates the}} impact of Mexican trade and {{productive}} integration processes during the last 20 years. It finds evidence that growing per capita income in Mexico {{is directly related to}} its “trade opening”, but is inversely related to the growth of its manufacturing export industry. Specifically, for each point of growth in “trade opening” (as a proportion of GDP) per capita income grew by 0. 22 %; while each point of increase in the share of industrial exports reduced income per person by 0. 09 %. To explain this apparent contradiction between the positive effect of “trade opening” and the negative impact of productive manufacturing specialization, we examined the characteristics of Mexico's industry. Results show that although Mexico's export-led industrialization successfully adapted to the world market and transformed its productive, business, organizational and technological structure, it did not translate into adequate macroeconomic benefits due to the absence of strong <b>value</b> <b>dissemination</b> forces over the rest of the economy. In this sense, poor internal linkages in the maquila industry, its high propensity to import, and its limited value added generation, among other elements, led the Mexican industry to operate as an export enclave. In those circumstances, manufacturing does not generates positive externalities nor articulations, nor strong disseminations that increase and multiplies value in other sectors of industry, thus limiting expansion effects and restraining or even reducing–under some specific circumstances–per capita income growth...|$|R

40|$|The Faculty of Education at CCCU, as the {{regional}} <b>dissemination</b> <b>centre</b> {{in the south}} east for the Cambridge Primary Review (CPR) (Alexander et al, 2010), has been supporting a number of primary school-based action research projects by injecting the ideas and evidence presented in the CPR into the school development process. This paper reports on this process through two case studies. Each case study has a unique focus. One focuses on promoting children’s meta-cognition; the other on how organisational structures create barriers to learning. 1. What are the perceived school-specific outcomes and benefits of the CPR action research projects for teachers, children and schools? 2. To what extent has the CPR project initiative, in terms of higher education institution (HEI) involvement, supported teacher and school development? 3. Which factors have helped or hindered progress? Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} teachers and their head teachers. The interviews explored their perceptions of the benefits and challenges of the CPR action research projects and their views about collaboration with the HEI. Some focus groups of children were conducted to explore their perceptions of their experiences. Following Seidel’s model (1998), the data was analysed in the following stages: noticing and coding; collecting and sorting; thinking and analysing. The ideas and evidence of the final CPR report and research surveys underpin this study and have been used selectively and specifically to support the case study schools and their chosen focus. In addition, theories about professional development from the report have been heeded, for example Berliner’s (2004) work on expertise and stages in teacher development. The model of essential factors in the management of change developed by Knoster (2000) has also been influential in our thinking about whole school development, as has the notion of ‘intellectual capital’ (Hargreaves 2003), especially in relation to the role that can be played by the HEI. The research is in the early stages. Indications at this stage, however, suggest that the CPR initiative is promoting teachers’ involvement in critical debate and the development of innovative approaches within their schools. The findings also suggest that there is a strong relationship between the scope given to teachers to explore new ideas and take risks, and the success of school-led innovation. However, the project needs to be underpinned by active support in the form of resourcing and structured opportunities - an idea that is very much in tune with the CPR’s recommendations. The role of the HEI has had some significance in introducing new ideas, raising awareness of the macro context and providing and sustaining momentum...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{impact of}} meningeal {{dissemination}} in primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is debated, and the reported frequency varies. We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of PCR {{in comparison with}} CSF cytomorphology and MRI for diagnosing meningeal dissemination in PCNSL. METHODS: We evaluated 282 patients from a multicenter therapy study for PCNSL {{for the presence of}} meningeal dissemination: 205 with CSF cytomorphology, 171 with PCR of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes in CSF, and 217 with cranial MRI. RESULTS: Meningeal dissemination was found in 33 of 205 patients (16 %) by cytomorphology, in 19 of 171 (11 %) patients evaluated by PCR, and in 8 of 217 patients (4 %) by MRI. Considering either of these methods, the relative frequency of meningeal dissemination was 17. 4 % (49 of 282 patients). PCR was monoclonal in 6 of 19 (32 %) samples with positive cytomorphology, 1 of 13 samples (8 %) with suspicious cytology, and in 10 of 105 (10 %) cytologically negative samples. In 11 samples with positive and 12 with suspicious cytology, PCR showed only a polyclonal pattern. The probability of meningeal dissemination detection was higher in cases with CSF pleocytosis (> 5 /microL) with an OR of 2. 48 (95 % CI 1. 15 - 5. 34, p = 0. 018). CSF protein had no predictive <b>value</b> for meningeal <b>dissemination</b> detection.
