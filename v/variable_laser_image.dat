A comprehensive qualitative and quantitative image enhancement performance evaluation is presented to verify the proposed theory and algorithm validity, efficiency and reasonability. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can greatly improve the global and local contrast for both near infrared images and far infrared <b>laser</b> <b>images</b> while efficiently reducing noise in the infrared laser images，and the visual quality of enhanced image is obviously better than the enhancement of the traditional histogram equalization, double plateaus histogram equalization algorithm, etc...|$|R

Based on machine {{version and}} <b>laser</b> <b>image</b> analysis, the <b>lasers</b> with {{wavelength}} of 980 nm, 938 nm, and 780 nm {{were used to}} detect the water and soluble solids content(SSC) of honey samples.

The results showed that the models based on mean value of intensities had the r value of 0. 4268 for water and 0. 3882 for SSC, the model based on the frequency of intensities had the r value of 0. 6465 for water and 0. 6226 for SSC, the model of the frequency of intensities had the r value of 0. 7061 for water and 0. 7083 for SSC after correction, which demonstrated that the <b>laser</b> <b>image</b> technology had potential to detect the quality of honey.
