40|$|It is a {{fact that}} virtual {{training}} has been a scope of interest for vocational training for a very long time. However, it needs more time to be more common in all specific training fields. This paper presents the development of a <b>Virtual</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Centre</b> (VTC) to promote and reinforce Vocational Training in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Machines. “Virtual Training Centre for CNC ” is a multilateral LdV project and of high importance in terms of virtual teaching and learning in vocational education and training. This virtual training environment is based on a common curriculum developed by the project partners. Since it is an interactive training tool, accessibility is the most important advantage over other training tools in VET...|$|E
40|$|<b>Virtual</b> {{assembly}} <b>training</b> systems show a {{high potential}} to complement or even replace physical setups for training of assembly processes in {{and beyond the}} automotive industry. The precondition for the breakthrough of <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> is that it overcomes the problems of former approaches. The paper presents the design approach taken during {{the development of a}} game-based, <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> system for procedural assembly knowledge in the EU-FP 7 project VISTRA. One key challenge to address when developing <b>virtual</b> assembly <b>training</b> is the extensive authoring effort for setting up virtual environments. Although knowledge from the product and manufacturing design is available and could be used for <b>virtual</b> <b>training,</b> a concept for integration of this data is still missing. This paper presents the design of a platform which transfers available enterprise data into a unified model for <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> and thus enables <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> of workers at the assembly line before the physical prototypes exist. The data requirements and constraints stemming from industrial partners involved in the project will be discussed. A second hurdle for <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> is the insufficient user integration and acceptance. In this context, the paper introduces an innovative hardware set-up for game-based user interaction, which has been chosen to enhance user involvement and acceptance of <b>virtual</b> <b>training...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of a <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> environment for testing UK gas pipeline emergency response plans. Interviews, observations and desk research were used to identify current methods for testing plans. A <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> environment was developed and evaluated with industry experts using participatory design techniques. Key themes relating to both the current methods for testing plans and for a <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> environment were identified using thematic analysis. Improved training performance, remote participation and evidence of decision testing are benefits a <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> environment can bring to current practice. It is suggested that a <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> environment can enhance, rather than replace the current process of testing emergency response plans. Analysis of the <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> environment being used to test plans in a live context would give further ecological validity to the findings. A study of the prototype used to test plans for incidents involving sectors outside the gas industry would further validate the findings. The application of a <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> environment to facilitate testing plans and the decision making processes for major incidents involving high-pressure gas pipelines and storage sites, {{is yet to be}} documented. This paper contributes to the literature by documenting the decision making process and {{evaluation of}} a <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> environment for testing plans in this context...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The new Advanced Construction Technologies (ACT-UK) centre in Coventry uses {{state of the}} art, innovative, <b>virtual</b> reality <b>training</b> in a {{simulated}} environment to train students and employees from the construction industry. However, before the training facility could become operational, {{it was necessary to}} collect as much information as possible from a specified construction project to help create scenarios {{to be used in the}} <b>virtual</b> reality <b>training.</b> Therefore, the approach used to capture the project information needed to be appropriate. It was the ‘project monitors’ role to obtain the necessary information by monitoring a construction project on a weekly basis. Data was collated in the form of photographs of the building during its construction and documentation from the site office was also collected so that trainees within the <b>training</b> <b>centre</b> could use it. In addition, the project-monitoring provided written descriptions of the activities that occurred during the construction of the building. The production of these activity sheets, which were used to help produce the <b>virtual</b> reality <b>training</b> scenarios, is outlined along with the data collection methodology. The success of the methodology undertaken is reviewed so that if the approach was to be replicated, for new <b>virtual</b> reality construction <b>training</b> scenarios, then the issues that the ‘project monitor’ encountered could be minimised...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{interest}} for RF-based indoor localization, {{and in particular}} for WiFi RSSI-based fingerprinting, is growing at a rapid pace. This is despite {{the existence of a}} trade-off between the accuracy of location estimation and the density of a laborious and time consuming survey for collecting training fingerprints. A generally accepted concept of increasing the density of a training dataset, without an increase in the amount of physical labor and time needed for surveying an environ-ment for additional fingerprints, is to leverage a propagation model for the generation of <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> fingerprints. This process, however, burdens the user with an overhead in terms of implementing a propagation model, defining locations of <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> fingerprints, generating <b>virtual</b> fingerprints, and storing the generated fingerprints in a training database. To address this issue, we propose the Enriched Training Database (ETD), a web-service that enables storage and management of training fingerprints, with an additional “enriching ” func-tionality. The user can leverage the enriching functionality to automatically generate <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> fingerprints based on propagation modeling in the <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> points. We further propose a novel method for defining locations of <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> fingerprints based on modified Voronoi diagrams, which removes the burden of defining <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> points manually and which automatically “covers ” the regions without sufficient density of training fingerprints. The evaluation in our testbed shows that the use of automated generation of <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> fingerprints in the ETD results in more than 25 % increase in point accuracy and 15 % in room-level accuracy of fingerprinting.

40|$|Virtual {{reality and}} {{simulation}} {{are becoming increasingly}} important in modern society and {{it is essential to}} improve our understanding of system usability and efficacy from the users’ perspective. This paper introduces a novel evaluation method designed to assess human user capability when undertaking technical and procedural <b>training</b> using <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> systems. The evaluation method falls under the user-centred design and evaluation paradigm and draws on theories of cognitive, skillbased and affective learning outcomes. The method focuses on user interaction with haptic-audio-visual interfaces and the complexities related to variability in users’ performance, and the adoption and acceptance of the technologies. A large scale user study focusing on object assembly training tasks involving selecting, rotating, releasing, inserting and manipulating 3 D objects was performed. The study demonstrated the advantages of the method in obtaining valuable multimodal information for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> system efficacy. The study investigated how well users learn, perform, adapt to and perceive the <b>virtual</b> <b>training.</b> The results of the study revealed valuable aspects of the design and evaluation of <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> systems contributing to an improved understanding of more usable <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study which {{demonstrates}} {{the advantages of}} using virtual-reality based systems for training automotive assembly tasks. Sixty participants {{were randomly assigned to}} one of the following three training experience to learn a car service procedure: i) observational training through video instruction; ii) an experiential <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> and trial in a CAVE; and iii) an experiential <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> and trial through a portable 3 D interactive table. Results show that <b>virtual</b> <b>trained</b> participants, after the training, can remember significantly better (p <. 05) the correct execution of the steps compared to video-trained trainees. No significant differences were identified between the experiential groups neither in terms of post-training performances nor in terms of proficiency, despite differences in the interaction devices. The relevance of the outcomes for the automotive fields and for the designers of <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> applications are discussed in light of the outcomes, particularly that <b>virtual</b> <b>training</b> experienced through a portable device such as the interactive table can be effective, as can training performed in a CAVE. This suggests the possibility for automotive industries to invest in advanced portable hardware to deliver effectively long-distance programmes of training for car service operators placed all over the world...|$|R
