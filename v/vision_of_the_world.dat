5|$|Janáček's {{deep and}} lifelong affection for Russia and Russian culture {{represents}} another {{important element of}} his musical inspiration. In 1888 he attended the Prague performance of Tchaikovsky's music, and met the older composer. Janáček profoundly admired Tchaikovsky, and particularly appreciated his highly developed musical thought {{in connection with the}} use of Russian folk motifs. Janáček's Russian inspiration is especially apparent in his later chamber, symphonic and operatic output. He closely followed developments in Russian music from his early years, and in 1896, following his first visit of Russia, he founded a Russian Circle in Brno. Janáček read Russian authors in their original language. Their literature offered him an enormous and reliable source of inspiration, though this did not blind him to the problems of Russian society. He was twenty-two years old when he wrote his first composition based on a Russian theme: a melodrama, Death, set to Lermontov's poem. In his later works, he often used literary models with sharply contoured plots. In 1910 Zhukovsky's Tale of Tsar Berendei inspired him to write the Fairy Tale for Cello and Piano. He composed the rhapsody Taras Bulba (1918) to Gogol's short story, and five years later, in 1923, completed his first string quartet, inspired by Tolstoy's Kreutzer Sonata. Two of his later operas were based on Russian themes: Káťa Kabanová, composed in 1921 to Alexander Ostrovsky's play, The Storm: and his last work, From the House of the Dead, which transformed Dostoyevsky's <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> into an exciting collective drama.|$|E
25|$|Great art is {{the outward}} {{expression}} of an inner life in the artist, and this inner life will result in his personal <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> No amount of skillful invention can replace the essential element of imagination. One of the weaknesses of much abstract painting is the attempt to substitute the inventions of the human intellect for a private imaginative conception.|$|E
25|$|Our {{ideas about}} God are {{important}} indicators {{of how we}} view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> – and our place in it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced {{with the idea that}} people have evolved by natural selection. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.|$|E

25|$|Also {{during that}} stage, Macedonski was {{exploring}} the numerous links between Symbolism, mysticism and esotericism. Earlier pieces had already come to explore macabre themes characteristic {{for an early}} branch of Symbolism. Influenced by Maurice Rollinat, they include the somber Vaporul morții ("The Ship of Death") and Visul fatal ("The Fatal Dream"). Likewise, the piece titled Imnul lui Satan ("Satan's Hymn") was placed by critics in connection with Les Litanies de Satan (part of Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal), but, Vianu argues, the source of Macedonski's satanic themes may have been lodged in his own <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> This interest also reflected in his 1893 Saul, where Cincinat Pavelescu's contribution is supposedly minimal. Echoing satanic themes, Ernest Legouvé's dramatic version of the Medea myth (which Macedonski translated {{at some point in}} his life) and the classical work of Jean Racine, it shows the dark powers of political conflict intervening between the eponymous king and his ephebos-like protégé David, the latter of whom {{turns out to be the}} agent of spiritual revolution.|$|E
25|$|Religion, Unger argues, is a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> {{within which}} we anchor our {{orientation}} to life. It is within this orientation that {{we deal with}} our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because {{we are unable to}} grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.|$|E

500|$|Bauer {{illustrated}} the 1913–15 editions, {{printed in the}} same three colors as previously. 1913 marked {{the peak of his}} performance in these books, and Bauer's illustrations from that edition are among the most reproduced of his works. In 1914, his illustrations started to be influenced by the Italian Renaissance. At that time Bauer wanted to stop illustrating the series, but was contractually obligated to illustrate one more edition. 1915 was the last year he worked with trolls and gnomes; he said he [...] "was done with them and wanted to move on". The war in Europe had altered Bauer's <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and he stated that he could no longer imagine it as a fairy tale.|$|E
500|$|While deconstructionists have {{concluded}} that we must abandon any further attempts to create a comprehensive <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> Cobb and other constructive postmodernists believe that metaphysics and comprehensive world-models are possible and still needed. [...] In particular, they have argued for a new Whiteheadian metaphysics based on events rather than substances. [...] In this formulation, it is incorrect {{to say that a}} person or thing ("substance") has a fundamental identity that remains constant, and that any changes to the person or thing are secondary to what it is. [...] Instead, each moment in a person's life ("event") is seen as a new actuality, thus asserting that continual change and transformation are fundamental, while static identities are far less important. [...] This view more easily reconciles itself with certain findings of modern science, such as evolution and wave-particle duality.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the book {{suggests}} a pilgrimage, and yet the narrator does not stray far from her home near the creek: the journey is metaphysical. [...] Margaret Loewen Reimer, in one of the first critical studies based on the book, noted that Dillard's treatment of the metaphysical {{is similar to that of}} Herman Melville. [...] While [...] "Melville's eyes saw mainly the darkness and the horror" [...] of the natural world, possibly stemming from his New England Puritan roots, Dillard's [...] "sinister" [...] <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> comes [...] "more from a horror at the seeming mindlessness of nature's design than from a deeply pervasive sense of evil." [...] Unlike Melville, however, Dillard does not moralize the natural world or seek to find parallels in human cultural acts; focusing largely on observation as well as scientific analysis, Dillard follows the example of Charles Darwin and other naturalists.|$|E

500|$|Academic Dominique Ranaivoson {{characterized}} {{his poetry}} in two broad categories. The first category are poems that are imbued with rich detail of daily life, using short stanzas and simple vocabulary. These poems recall the Malagasy poetic tradition of hainteny with {{their emphasis on}} nostalgia and longing. The second category consists of poems that offer philosophical musings {{on the nature of}} identity, and are rich with Malagasy proverbs and Madagascar's symbolic places and objects. Both types reflected the sensibilities and conventions of romanticism. The majority of the poetic works written by Dox were in the form of sonnets. He would frequently compose poems spontaneously and give them away to friends or passers by. His work often explored the theme of [...] "Malagasy love" [...] (amour a la Malgache), and he was among the first Malagasy poets to write on themes related to sexuality and desire. The themes of Malagasy identity and everyday beauty also feature prominently in his work. According to writer François-Xavier Razafimahatratra, the former theme allowed the poet to express his personal <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> while the latter allowed him to use poetry to educate the Malagasy public.|$|E
500|$|When Arsenal {{moved to}} the Emirates Stadium, Wenger prioritised {{investing}} in youth instead of purchasing experienced players. He {{described it as a}} way of creating an [...] "identity" [...] with Arsenal: [...] "I felt it would be an interesting experiment to see players grow together with these qualities, and with a love for the club. It was an idealistic <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of football". The departure of Dein, coupled with the saturation of the transfer market, meant Wenger struggled to recruit players as efficiently as before. The youth set-up did not replicate the success of the late 1990s and early 2000s, though Arsenal consistently finished fourth or higher in the league between 2006 and 2011. The club earnt a reputation of functioning as a [...] "feeder club" [...] to bigger teams, as Wenger struggled to keep hold of his best players. He described this period as [...] "very sensitive" [...] because of the financial restrictions that came with the stadium move. Since the 2011–12 season, Wenger has reverted to buying proven talent, and blended experience with youth in domestic cup competitions. Arsenal have benefited from increased revenue since the Emirates move, and negotiating new sponsorship deals has allowed Wenger to make marquee signings such as Özil and Sánchez.|$|E
500|$|During the 1960s, various {{philosophers}} such as Donald Davidson, Hilary Putnam, and Fodor {{tried to}} resolve the puzzle of developing a way to preserve the explanatory efficacy of mental causation and so-called [...] "folk psychology" [...] while adhering to a materialist <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> which did not violate the [...] "generality of physics". Their proposal was, first of all, to reject the then-dominant theories in philosophy of mind: behaviorism and the type identity theory. The problem with logical behaviorism was that it failed to account for causation between mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation, especially if one considers that behavior is not an effect of a single mental event/cause but is rather {{the effect of a}} chain of mental events/causes. The type-identity theory, on the other hand, failed to explain the fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in the identical mental state. Besides being deeply anthropocentric (why should humans be the only thinking organisms in the universe?), the identity-type theory also failed to deal with accumulating evidence in the neurosciences that every single human brain is different from all the others. Hence, the impossibility of referring to common mental states in different physical systems manifests itself not only between different species but also between organisms of the same species.|$|E
