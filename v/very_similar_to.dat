5|$|The area's {{population}} has declined {{from a peak}} of around 2700 in 1926 to its current level of around 1200. This decline has halted in recent decades, with 2008 figures being <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of 1986.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the main stand is <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the one at Springfield Park, former home of Wigan Athletic. This was also built in 1953.|$|E

5|$|A. n. nisosimilis was {{described}} by Samuel Tickell in 1833. It breeds from central and eastern Siberia east to Kamchatka and Japan, and south to northern China. This subspecies is wholly migratory, wintering from Pakistan and India eastwards through South-East Asia and southern China to Korea and Japan; some even reach Africa. It is <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to,</b> but slightly larger than, the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|An ancient carved {{slab of slate}} {{depicting}} {{an animal}} <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the blue wildebeest has been discovered. Dating back to around 3000 BC, it was found in Hierakonopolis (Nekhen), {{which used to be}} the religious and political capital of Upper Egypt at that time. This may be evidence that the animal used to occur in North Africa and was associated with the ancient Egyptians.|$|E

50|$|RNA is a <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> {{molecule}} <b>to</b> DNA, {{and only}} has two chemical differences. The overall structure of RNA and DNA are immensely similar—one strand of DNA {{and one of}} RNA can bind to form a double helical structure. This makes the storage of information in RNA possible in a <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> way <b>to</b> the storage of information in DNA. However, RNA is less stable.|$|R

5|$|Another {{formation}} with tyrannosaur {{remains is}} the Lance Formation of Wyoming. This {{has been interpreted}} as a bayou environment similar to today's Gulf Coast. The fauna was <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> Hell Creek, but with Struthiomimus replacing its relative Ornithomimus. The small ceratopsian Leptoceratops also lived in the area.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, {{domestic}} sheep reproduction occurs sexually. Their reproductive strategy is <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> other domestic herd animals. A {{flock of sheep}} is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|At Takalik Abaj the potbelly style monuments all {{date to the}} Late Preclassic. Stylistically, {{the monuments}} are <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of Kaminaljuyu and Monte Alto. Seven monuments are potbelly sculptures (Monuments 2, 3, 19, 40, 69, 94 and 117), six of these {{represent}} complete figures. Three monuments are small potbelly sculptures (Monuments 100, 107 and 109) and one sculpture is a colossal head in potbelly style (Monument 99).|$|E

5|$|Before {{its main}} release, Dynasty Warriors 4 was already looking {{promising}} after GameSpot UK’s preview {{two months before}} the game was released. Although still <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> previous titles in the series, the graphics engine had been tweaked and the gameplay been expanded, featuring more characters and stages.|$|E
5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids look <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> sea anemones, but belong to {{an entirely different}} subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a fibrous material, which is made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{along these}} lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX {{outlined}} a deployment that started out <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as {{the nature of the}} threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment sequence that added more and more terminal defenses as the sophistication of the Nth Country missiles increased over time.|$|E
