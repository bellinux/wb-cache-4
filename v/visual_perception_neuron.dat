50|$|Models {{represent}} {{signals in}} the following way. Suppose that signal X(n) is coming from sensory neurons n activated by object m, which is characterized by parameters Sm. These parameters may include position, orientation, or lighting of an object m. Model Mm(Sm,n) predicts a value X(n) of a signal at neuron n. For example, during <b>visual</b> <b>perception,</b> a <b>neuron</b> n in the visual cortex receives a signal X(n) from retina and a priming signal Mm(Sm,n) from an object-concept-model m. Neuron n is activated if both the bottom-up signal from lower-level-input and the top-down priming signal are strong. Various models compete for evidence in the bottom-up signals, while adapting their parameters for better match as described below. This is a simplified description of perception. The most benign everyday <b>visual</b> <b>perception</b> uses many levels from retina to object perception. The NMF premise {{is that the same}} laws describe the basic interaction dynamics at each level. Perception of minute features, or everyday objects, or cognition of complex abstract concepts is due to the same mechanism described below. Perception and cognition involve concept-models and learning. In perception, concept-models correspond to objects; in cognition models correspond to relationships and situations.|$|R

40|$|Segregation {{of images}} into figures and {{background}} is fundamental for <b>visual</b> <b>perception.</b> Cortical <b>neurons</b> respond more strongly to figural image elements than to background elements, but {{the mechanisms of}} figure-ground modulation (FGM) are only partially understood. It is unclear whether FGM in early and mid-level visual cortex is caused by an enhanced response to the figure, a suppressed response to the background, or both. We studied neuronal activity in areas V 1 and V 4 in monkeys performing a texture segregation task. We compared texture-defined figures with homogeneous textures and found an early enhancement of the figure representation, and a later suppression of the background. Across neurons, the strength of figure enhancement was independent {{of the strength of}} background suppression. We also examined activity in the different V 1 layers. Both figure enhancement and ground suppression were strongest in superficial and deep layers and weaker in layer 4. The current-source density profiles suggested that figure enhancement was caused by stronger synaptic inputs in feedback-recipient layers 1, 2, and 5 and ground suppression by weaker inputs in these layers, suggesting an important role for feedback connections from higher level areas. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms for figure-ground organization...|$|R

40|$|The {{idea that}} our body plays an {{important}} role in <b>visual</b> <b>perception</b> has a long history in storytelling and philosophy. Some ideas are very intuitive. For example, few will disagree with the notion that smaller people perceive the world to be bigger, and vice versa, that larger people perceive the world to be smaller. In contrast, more controversial ideas regarding the role of our body in <b>visual</b> <b>perception</b> have been debated by philosophers. According to these philosophers, the very nature of <b>visual</b> <b>perception</b> lies in the fact that we have a body that moves in space. Since George Berkeley (1685 – 1753) first formalized such a fundamental role for our body in <b>visual</b> <b>perception,</b> different philosophical theories have branched out to account for the latest scientific findings. Although experimental psychologists and neuroscientists have long neglected these intriguing philosophical accounts, the recent development of body-ownership illusions allowed for a more rigorous investigation of the supposed link between our body and <b>visual</b> <b>perception.</b> In body-ownership illusions, research participants experience an artificial body (or body-part) to be their own. These illusions allow for the dissociation between the subjective experience that your body belongs to you (i. e. body-ownership) and the mere visual impression of your body from a first-person perspective. The studies that comprise this thesis use different ownership illusions to investigate the role of body-ownership in <b>visual</b> <b>perception,</b> and the role of <b>visual</b> <b>perception</b> in body-ownership, with <b>visual</b> <b>perception</b> being an umbrella-term for both visuospatial <b>perception</b> and <b>visual</b> awareness. In Study I and Study II we investigated the mechanisms by which body-size influences the perceived size of the world, by having participants experience ownership of different sized (and sometimes invisible) bodies. Our results show that this own-body-size effect does not rely on visual information per se, but instead, on the recalibration between visual and tactile information that updates the representation of external space. In Study III we combine the rubber hand illusion with binocular rivalry to show that body-ownership promotes visual awareness of a fake hand. And in Study IV we combine the rubber hand illusion with continuous flash suppression to show that ownership can be induced in the absence of visual awareness. Such unconscious ownership calls for a reevaluation of the standard definition of body-ownership. Taken together, these studies illuminate the intricate relationship between body-ownership and <b>visual</b> <b>perception.</b> In addition to the scientific research fields of visuospatial <b>perception,</b> <b>visual</b> awareness, and body-ownership, these results are valuable to the philosophical debate on the nature of <b>visual</b> <b>perception</b> and might provide future applications in clinical psychology...|$|R
