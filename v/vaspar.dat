40|$|We {{evaluated}} the aerobic thioglycolate broth disk and the <b>vaspar</b> overlay broth disk methods for antibiotic susceptibility testing of 144 strains of anaerobes. For penicillin, carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, and metrionidazale, both broth disk methods yielded at least 95 % agreement with results {{obtained by the}} National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution procedure. For cefoxitin and clindamycin, the agreement was ca. 90 %. Overall, the aerobic thioglycolate broth disk and <b>vaspar</b> overlay broth disk methods yielded agreements of 93. 3 and 93 %, respectively, with the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards method...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) â€”Boston UniversityEndamoeba histolytica, the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} amoebiasis, was first cultivated {{in the presence}} of associated bacteria by Boeck and Drbohlav (Am. J. Hyg., 5 : 371 - 407, 1925). Since that time numerous workers have attempted to culture the amebas free of bacteria but have been unsuccessful. The majority of studies on the cultural requirements of this protozoan has been complicated by the presence of more than one species of bacteria. Therefore, the nutritional studies on E. histolytica have been very meager. A pure culture of this organism is essential to the elucidation of its metabolism, physiology, and immunology. It was the purpose of this investigation to identify growth factors required by the amebas so that a pure culture may become available. 	In order to control the associated bacteria during the assay of growth factors, penicillin and streptomycin were added to the culture medium in high concentrations. This concentration of the antibiotics was shown to sterilize the bacterial flora yet have no detrimental effect on the amebas. Many compounds were tested for their ameba-growth-promoting activity under bacteria free conditions. The test medium consisted of egg slants over-layed with normal horse serum in Ringer solution, dextrose, sodium thioglycollate, rice starch, antibiotics and a <b>vaspar</b> anaerobic seal [TRUNCATED...|$|E
40|$|This study {{started as}} an attempt to {{determine}} if well waters have a flora of attached bacteria comparable to that of surface waters and to cultivate any species that might be found. The isolation of one species has led to studies of its characteristics and recommendations on its taxonomy. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND RESULTS Occurrence of attached bacteria in well waters. Samples were collected from several wells using sterile glass jars of approximately one gal capac-ity. After the samples had been brought to the laboratory, they were examined for attached bacteria by the method of Henrici (1933). Slides, attached to rubber-covered wire, were suspended in the water, either in the original sample jars or in smaller jars containing 750 ml amounts of the sample. After various periods of time the slides were removed and examined, either after fixing and staining oIr as wet mount preparations. For the latter purpose a drop of rose bengal staining solution was placed in the water re-maining on the slide immediately after it was withdrawn from the sample jar. A cover glass was placed then over the preparation and sealed to the slide with <b>vaspar.</b> A phase microscope was found to be better than a bright field microscope for the examination of the wet mounts. Attached bacteria were seen on slides from water from every well. The results from one well will be described in some detail. Figure 1 shows a typical field on a slide that had been immersed for 12 days. Numerous stalked rods, varying in length from 2 to 6,u, sometimes straight, but usually slightly curved, were seen. The width o...|$|E
