40|$|This is {{the fourth}} part in the series of {{articles}} [4], [5], [6] (see also [3]) where the theory of <b>valuations</b> on manifolds is developed. In this part it is shown that the filtration on <b>valuations</b> introduced in [5] {{is compatible with the}} product. Then it is proved that the Euler-Verdier involution on smooth <b>valuations</b> introduced in [5] is an automorphism of the algebra of <b>valuations.</b> Then an integration functional on <b>valuations</b> with compact support is introduced, and a property of selfduality of <b>valuations</b> is proved. Next a space of generalized <b>valuations</b> is defined, and some basic properties of it are proved. Finally a canonical imbedding of the space of constructible functions on a real analytic manifold into the space of generalized <b>valuations</b> is constructed, and various structures on <b>valuations</b> are compared with known structures on constructible functions...|$|R

40|$|Combinatorial mixed <b>valuations</b> {{associated}} to translation-invariant <b>valuations</b> on polytopes are introduced. In {{contrast to the}} construction of mixed <b>valuations</b> via polarization, combinatorial mixed <b>valuations</b> reflect and often inherit properties of inhomogeneous <b>valuations.</b> In particular, it is shown that under mild assumptions combinatorial mixed <b>valuations</b> are monotone and hence nonnegative. For combinatorially positive <b>valuations,</b> this has strong computational implications. Applied to the discrete volume, the results generalize and strengthen work of Bihan (2015) on discrete mixed volumes. For rational polytopes, it is proved that combinatorial mixed monotonicity is equivalent to monotonicity. Stronger even, a conjecture is substantiated that combinatorial mixed monotonicity implies the homogeneous monotonicity in the sense of Bernig [...] Fu (2011).

40|$|This paper {{considers}} combinatorial auctions among such submodular buyers. The <b>valuations</b> of such {{buyers are}} placed within {{a hierarchy of}} <b>valuations</b> that exhibit no complementarities, a hierarchy that includes also OR and XOR combinations of singleton <b>valuations,</b> and <b>valuations</b> satisfying the gross substitutes property. Those last <b>valuations</b> are shown to form a zero-measure subset of the submodular <b>valuations</b> that have positive measure. While we show that the allocation problem among submodular <b>valuations</b> is NP-hard, we present an efficient greedy 2 -approximation algorithm for this case and generalize it {{to the case of}} limited complementarities. No such approximation algorithm exists in a setting allowing for arbitrary complementarities. Some results about strategic aspects of combinatorial auctions among players with decreasing marginal utilities are also presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} optimal pricing {{to consumers}} who are privately informed about both their <b>valuations</b> {{for the product}} and when they learn their <b>valuations.</b> Initially, consumers have private information about the distribution of their <b>valuations</b> and when they will learn their <b>valuations,</b> and over time, consumers privately learn their <b>valuations.</b> Because of its importance in many revenue management problems, we focus mainly on the case in which consumers with higher expected <b>valuations,</b> e. g., business travelers, learn their true <b>valuations</b> later than consumers with lower expected <b>valuations,</b> e. g., leisure travelers. Using a mechanism design approach, we show that the optimal selling mechanism is a menu of expiring refund contracts. Consumers purchase the good in advance but {{have the option to}} return it for a refund immediately after learning their <b>valuations.</b> We identify conditions under which the firm can implement the first-best or complete information allocation, thereby extracting the entire (expected) consumer surplus. We also characterize the optimal menu of refund contracts when the first best cannot be achieved. ...|$|R
