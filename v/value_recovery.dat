Reasons for increases in fine <b>value</b> mineral <b>recovery</b> from ores with fully electrochemically inert grinding media are discussed in relation to reduced surface contamination by iron hydroxide emanating from the grinding media. The application of stirred milling technology, which allows the use of fully inert grinding media, to primary grinding applications may lead to increased fine <b>value</b> mineral <b>recovery</b> in flotation rougher applications. It is suggested that the effect of the grinding media, which is important for fine particles and progressively becomes more important as the grind size becomes finer, is principally due to the abrasion mechanism of the minerals with the grinding media in the production of fine particles. Opportunities for research and industry application are discussed. Stephen Gran...|$|R

50|$|The largest brownfields {{redevelopment}} {{project to}} date is {{the closure of the}} Bedford I Landfill, completed in late 2007. The closure was a result of a 2005 public-private development partnership with private firm <b>Value</b> <b>Recovery</b> Group, of Columbus, Ohio, and non-profit Central Ohio Community Improvement Corporation to remediate and redevelop the abandoned Bedford I Landfill. The 200 acre site was transformed into Central Park of Gahanna, a major greenfield development campus that features a golf academy known as The Golf Depot. The City of Gahanna and <b>Value</b> <b>Recovery</b> Group, which owns nearly 60 acres of the developable land, have been working to attract recreational, brewing industry, and office development and continue to solicit development opportunities. Funding for this major project included $3,000,000 from the Clean Ohio Redevelopment Fund, $200,000 from the US EPA, $150,000 from the Community Development Block Grant program, significant assistance with assessment, stormwater remediation, and staff time from Gahanna, and other investments by the Central Ohio CIC.

As a result, the dissolution behaviour of metallic nickel and cobalt is strongly influenced by the behaviour of metallic iron.
