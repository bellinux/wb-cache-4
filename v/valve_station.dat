The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) developed and tested multiple tools to perform the gasket replacement tasks. Separate pneumatic snap-ring removal tools that use the connector skirt as a reaction surface were developed for removal of the snap ring and spent gasket on both vertical and horizontal Hanford connectors. A pneumatic tool that clamps and centers on the jumper pipe ID was developed to simultaneously install the new gasket and snap ring. A pneumatic snap-ring-loading tool was developed that compresses the snap ring and places it in a groove in the installation tool. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>station</b> that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the immediate and short-term outcome of inserted cryopreserved vein valve allografts and the clinical outcome of treated limbs. Method: Twenty-seven cryovalves were inserted in 25 postthrombotic limbs because of active leg ulcer (20 limbs) or severe disabling leg pain (five limbs) as a procedure of last resort. Previous venous surgery had been performed in 80 % of the limbs. Main stem superficial reflux and iliac venous outflow obstruction were controlled before cryovalve insertion. The most common insertion site was the superficial femoral or popliteal vein. Patients were followed up with clinical examination and with intermittent duplex Doppler scanning or ascending venography to assess patency and competency of the <b>valve</b> <b>station.</b> Results: After thawing, but before insertion, 74 % of the cryovalves were incompetent and needed repair with transcommissural valvuloplasty. After insertion, mortality was zero. Morbidity was 48 %, mainly because of seroma formation and deep wound infection. One cryovalve was explanted because of acute rejection. Six cryovalves occluded early (< 6 weeks), and five occluded late. Cumulative rates of patent cryovalves and both patent and competent cryovalves at 24 -month follow-up were 41 % and 27 %, respectively. Cumulative ulcer recurrence-free rate at 36 months was 50 %. Pain relief was poor, and degree of swelling remained the same. Conclusion: Compared with autologous vein transfer, cryovalve insertion is associated with high morbidity, high occlusion rate, poor cumulative midterm rate of patent graft with competent valve, and poor clinical results. The procedure should not be used as a primary technique for valve reconstruction, and it is questionable whether it is useful even in patients in whom autologous reconstruction techniques have been exhausted. The basis of the high failure rate is unclear; it may be immunologic or due to loss of endothelial cover after implantation. If cryovalves are to be a viable valve repair alternative, improved cryopreservation technique, immunologic modifications, or better matching must be achieved.

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop tooling {{and equipment to}} remotely replace gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors to reduce personnel radiation exposure {{as compared to the}} current hands-on method. It is also expected that radiation levels will continually increase with future waste streams. The equipment is operated in the Remote Equipment Decontamination Cell (REDC), which is equipped with compressed air, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and an electro-mechanical manipulator (EMM) arm for operation of the remote tools. The REDC does not provide access to electrical power, so the equipment must be manually or pneumatically operated. The MSM's have a load limit at full extension of ten pounds, which limited the weight of the installation tool. In order to remotely replace Hanford connector gaskets several operations must be performed remotely, these include: removal of the spent gasket and retaining ring (retaining ring is also called snap ring), loading the new snap ring and gasket into the installation tool and installation of the new gasket into the Hanford connector. SRNL developed and tested tools that successfully perform all of the necessary tasks. Removal of snap rings from horizontal and vertical connectors is performed by separate air actuated retaining ring removal tools and is manipulated in the cell by the MSM. In order install a new gasket, the snap ring loader is used to load a new snap ring into a groove in the gasket installation tool. A new gasket is placed on the installation tool and retained by custom springs. An MSM lifts the installation tool and presses the mounted gasket against the connector block. Once the installation tool is in position, the gasket and snap ring are installed onto the connector by pneumatic actuation. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>station</b> that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed. Extensive testing of tooling operation was performed in the DWPF manipulator repair shop. This testing allowed the operators to gain confidence before the equipment was exposed to radioactive contamination. The testing also led to multiple design improvements.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the technique of a variation of closed external venous valve repair (transcommissural valvuloplasty), its complication rate, and duplex scan durability. Methods: The “blind” transcommissural valve repair of the vein was performed by placing transluminal sutures along the valve attachment lines, which simultaneously closed the valve attachment angle and also tightened the valve cusps. A total of 179 successfully repaired valve sites of 141 limbs in 129 patients were followed up 1 to 42 months through clinical observation and with duplex Doppler ultrasound scan. Results: Postoperative complications (< 30 days) occurred in 12 (9 %) of 141 limbs: superficial (1) and deep (1) wound infection, large wound hematoma (4), seroma (1), and deep vein thrombosis (5), with associated pulmonary embolus in one patient. Seventy-eight percent (reflux time ≤ 0. 5 seconds) and 81 % (reflux time ≤ 1. 0 seconds) of valve sites were competent. The cumulative competency rate at 30 months was 59 % and 63 %, respectively. The cumulative ulcer recurrence-free interval was 63 % at 30 months (n = 92). The pain score and swelling grade substantially improved. Conclusion: Transcommissural valvuloplasty is a safe procedure with low morbidity. It is relatively rapid and simple to perform, and its competency rates are comparable to those of internal valvuloplasty. Advantages over the internal repair are that venotomy is not required, repair can be extended to small-caliber veins, and multiple <b>valve</b> <b>stations</b> can be repaired in a single stage.
