5|$|An ally of Senator Richard Mentor Johnson, who was {{a primary}} voice against the {{practice}} of debt imprisonment, Rowan made a notable speech denouncing the practice on the Senate floor in 1828. A consistent opponent of internal improvements and tariffs, even those that would benefit his own constituents, he voted against a measure allocating federal funds {{for the construction of}} a road connecting the cities of Lexington and Maysville. The vote was ill-received by the people of the state, and Rowan's popularity took a significant hit. When the bill was re-introduced in the next congressional session, Rowan <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> only after receiving significant pressure from the state legislature to do so. The bill passed in this session, but newly elected president Andrew Jackson vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|Despite the IAU's declaration, {{a number}} of critics remain unconvinced. The {{definition}} is seen by some as arbitrary and confusing. A number of Pluto-as-planet proponents, in particular Alan Stern, head of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. Stern's claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially {{wanted nothing to}} do with the bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of the bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of the bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it)</b> after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E

5|$|The Declaration became {{official}} when Congress <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> on July 4; {{signatures of}} the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed {{it has long been}} the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} time in the United States {{includes}} DST during both world wars, but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966. In May 1965, for two weeks, St. Paul, Minnesota and Minneapolis, Minnesota were on different times, when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting Daylight Saving Time while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law. In the mid-1980s, Clorox (parent of Kingsford Charcoal) and 7-Eleven provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to U.S. DST, and both Idaho senators <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> {{based on the premise that}} during DST fast-food restaurants sell more French fries, which are made from Idaho potatoes.|$|E
5|$|Tsongas is an {{advocate}} for universal health care and supports a public health insurance option. In 2010 she voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. In 2012 Tsongas joined a Republican-led effort to repeal a 2.3% sales tax on medical-device manufacturers, which passed the House 270–146; 36 other Democrats <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Tsongas is pro-choice and received a 100% approval rating from Planned Parenthood in 2008. A supporter of LGBT rights, Tsongas cosponsored the Respect for Marriage Act to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act; and voted for the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which allows homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces.|$|E

5|$|Mason {{retained}} {{his interest}} in western affairs, hoping in vain to salvage the Ohio Company's land grant. He and Jefferson were among the few delegates to be told of George Rogers Clark's expedition to secure control of the lands north of the Ohio River. Mason and Jefferson secured legislation authorizing Governor Henry to defend against unspecified western enemies. The expedition was generally successful, and Mason received a report directly from Clark. Mason sought to remove differences between Virginia and other states, and although he felt the 1780 settlement of the boundary dispute with Pennsylvania, the Mason-Dixon line (not named for George Mason) was unfavorable to Virginia, he <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> enthusiastically. Also in 1780, Mason remarried, to Sarah Brent, from a nearby plantation, {{who had never been}} married and was 52 years old. It was a marriage of convenience, with the new bride able {{to take some of the}} burden of parenting Mason's many children off his hands.|$|E

25|$|On 27 April 2015, the Northern Ireland Assembly voted {{again on}} the {{recognition}} of same-sex marriage. The motion for recognition was introduced by Sinn Féin and was defeated {{by a majority of}} 49 votes to 47; all DUP members in the Assembly voted against it, while all Sinn Féin, Green Party and NI21 members <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the Italian republican Felice Orsini {{tried to}} assassinate the French emperor with a bomb made in Britain, the French were outraged (see Orsini affair). Palmerston {{introduced}} a Conspiracy to Murder Bill {{which made it}} a felony to plot in Britain to murder someone abroad. At first reading, the Conservatives <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> but at second reading they voted against it. Palmerston lost by nineteen votes. Therefore, in February 1858 {{he was forced to}} resign.|$|E
25|$|If the {{majority}} of Puerto Ricans were to choose the Free Association option - and only 33% <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in 2012 - {{and if it were}} granted by the US Congress, Puerto Rico would become a Free Associated State, a virtually independent nation. It would have a political and economical treaty of association with the U.S. that would stipulate all delegated agreements. This could give Puerto Rico a similar status to Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, countries which currently have a Compact of Free Association with the United States.|$|E

25|$|Trigg {{arrived on}} the second day the Fifth Congress of the United States convened, Tuesday, May 16, 1797, and was in time to hear the new President's speech to Congress about his {{position}} in regards to France. At this time, Trigg, a Democratic-Republican/Anti-Federalist was in the minority party, as the House was majority Federalist, as was John Adams, the President of the United States. After the President's speech, which caused an uproar among Anti-Federalists as not being sympathetic enough to France and too hawkish, the House debated until May 31 on their response to his address. Their response, with an amendment, basically supported the President's speech. Trigg voted against the response, while his brother Abram <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|In late 1951, Iran's Parliament in a near {{unanimous}} vote {{approved the}} oil nationalization agreement. The bill was widely popular among most Iranians, and generated a huge wave of nationalism, and immediately put Iran at loggerheads with Britain (the handful of MPs that disagreed with it <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> {{as well in}} the face of overwhelming popular support, and the Fadaiyan's wrath). The nationalization made Mossadegh instantly popular among millions of Iranians, cementing him as a national hero, and placing him and Iran at the center of worldwide attention. Many Iranians felt {{that for the first time}} in centuries, they were taking control of the affairs of their country. Many also expected that nationalization would result in a massive increase of wealth for Iranians.|$|E
25|$|In the men's free skating, Brian Joubert slashed {{his hand}} on his skate blade and left drops of blood all over the ice; he {{completed}} the program but later required medical attention. Also during the free skating, a screw in Daisuke Takahashi's skate came loose on his first jump. He was able to get it repaired and resumed his program within the three minutes allowed. Oda ruined his chances of a medal by doing an extra triple jump, resulting in a loss of 13 points. Florent Amodio used music with lyrics, which is not allowed in competitive skating with the exception of ice dancing. He was not given the normally required one-point penalty because not enough judges <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
50|$|On January 8, 2016, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1927 {{by a vote}} of 211 to 188. The {{vote was}} largely along party lines, with no Democrats <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> and sixteen Republicans voting against it.|$|R

25|$|After liberation on 29 November 1944, several Albanian {{partisan}} divisions {{crossed the}} border into German-occupied Yugoslavia, where they fought alongside Tito's partisans and the Soviet Red Army in a joint campaign which succeeded in driving out the last pockets of German resistance. Marshal Tito, during a Yugoslavian conference in later years, thanked Hoxha for the assistance that the Albanian partisans had given during the War for National Liberation (Lufta Nacionalçlirimtare). The Democratic Front, dominated by the Albanian Communist Party, succeeded the National Liberation Front in August 1945 and the first post-war election was the held on 2 December. The Front was the only legal political organisation allowed {{to stand in the}} elections, and the government reported that 93% of Albanians <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the phrase}} [...] "Crime of 1873" [...] in congressional debate was by Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller, who on July 10, 1890, stated, [...] "the fight for free coinage [...] is on, and it will stay on, too, till {{the will of the}} people shall be heard in the enactment of a law that shall put silver back where it belongs and where it would have been but for the blunder or the crime of 1873". The act had long been referred to as a [...] "crime" [...] without the exact phrase being used; in one 1889 speech, Nevada Senator William M. Stewart called it a [...] "crime" [...] seven times. He had <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in 1873.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} some {{resistance}} within the astronomical community toward the reclassification. Alan Stern, principal investigator with NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, derided the IAU resolution, stating that [...] "the definition stinks, for technical reasons". Stern contended that, {{by the terms of}} the new definition, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune, all of which share their orbits with asteroids, would be excluded. He argued that all big spherical moons, including the Moon, should likewise be considered planets. He also stated that because less than five percent of astronomers <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Marc W. Buie, then at the Lowell Observatory petitioned against the definition. Others have supported the IAU. Mike Brown, the astronomer who discovered Eris, said [...] "through this whole crazy circus-like procedure, somehow the right answer was stumbled on. It's been a long time coming. Science is self-correcting eventually, even when strong emotions are involved." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Labor Party then {{launched}} a high-profile media {{campaign against the}} Coalition's GST.

Campaigning against the consumption tax dominated Keating's Election Campaign launch at the Bankstown Town Hall.|$|R
