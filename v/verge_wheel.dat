50|$|The Great wheel turns once in 3600 seconds (1 hour), so the <b>verge</b> escape <b>wheel</b> turns once in 360 seconds. One full foliot swing thus takes 8 seconds, or 4 seconds per half swing.|$|R
50|$|The <b>verge</b> (or crown <b>wheel)</b> {{escapement}} is {{the earliest}} known type of mechanical escapement, the mechanism in a mechanical clock that controls its rate by allowing the gear train to advance at regular intervals or 'ticks'. Its origin is unknown. Verge escapements were used from the 14th century until the mid 19th century in clocks and pocketwatches. The name verge comes from the Latin virga, meaning stick or rod.|$|R
