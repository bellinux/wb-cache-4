40|$|The {{road traffic}} {{accident}} (RTA) is a global misfortune and {{the leading cause of}} death among young drivers. In safeguarding and developing innovative safety strategies to curtail the situation, the factors causing this menace needs proper attention and investigation. The objective of this study is to identify the potential factors responsible for causing a traffic accident in Ghana. In studying these factors extensively, a descriptive study with quantitative technique was employed. Analyses used data between 2001 and 2011 obtained from the Building and Road Research Institute (BRRI) with specific focus on the age, drinking, <b>vehicle</b> <b>defect,</b> driver/rider error, injury, road surface type and weather. A total of 200, 528 cases of drivers/riders were analysed and discovered that, people with younger age (21 - 40) contribute 62. 97 % of total crashes. Crashes reduce steadily as drivers/riders age increases. Also, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>defect</b> analysis shows that 87. 46 % of accidents cannot be linked to the fault of the vehicle before incidence, while the majority (75. 38 %) of drivers/riders had no injury during a traffic accident. Higher number of fatalities are recorded on tar good roads (81. 57 %) and clear weather (91. 75 %). The fight against this canker by the authorities must consider periodic refresher courses for younger drivers/riders on traffic law to bring to bear the adherence of good driving/riding principles and attitudes to ensure that safety is guaranteed for all road users in the country...|$|R

5000|$|On March 12, 2010, Autoline Detroit {{argued that}} {{searches}} for additional <b>vehicle</b> <b>defects</b> were likely fruitless, as driver error {{was the primary}} cause of the 0.009 per million rate of Toyota sudden acceleration incidents from 1999 to 2009, with [...] "demographics and psychographics", namely elderly drivers and pedal misapplication as factors. Also noted was that drivers with Type II diabetes (adult onset), which is more common among the elderly, are subject to reduced sensation in their lower extremities (peripheral neuropathy) with related impairment in positional knowledge of foot placement (proprioception). Wired wrote that since investigators have been [...] "unable to find evidence supporting drivers’ claims their Toyotas suddenly raced out of control" [...] operator error is the most likely explanation. However, victims and relatives of sudden acceleration cases are commonly unwilling to suspect involved loved ones, and blame the vehicle instead. [...] Analysis of alleged Toyota acceleration reports in The Atlantic and other sources have found the highest distribution of involved drivers between 70 and 80 years old, with the average age skewing over 55; with elderly susceptibility to [...] "neuronal misfiring" [...] and pedal misapplication as a possible cause. While many alleged cases lack exact details, over half of reported incidents occurred from a complete stop or low speed, providing a window for the pedal misapplication to occur. A prior GM study found that 60- and 70-year-olds were six times more likely to experience sudden acceleration than 20- to 30-year-olds. In the New York Times, Richard Schmidt concluded that a brake override system could prevent acceleration cases where a vehicle defect existed, but would not prevent sudden acceleration cases caused by pedal misapplication.|$|E
5000|$|The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} on February 25, 2010 that [...] "safety regulators, human-error experts and auto makers say driver error {{is the primary}} cause of sudden acceleration." [...] Regarding the 2009-10 Toyota recalls, Wards Auto noted that NHTSA investigations over past years have found that the majority of sudden unintended acceleration cases are due to driver error. In such cases, accidents are the result of drivers mistakenly stepping on the accelerator pedal instead of the brake. On November 29, 2009, the Los Angeles Times quoted a motor skills consultant stating that the fault in sudden acceleration cases [...] "almost always lies with drivers who step on the wrong pedal." [...] In February 2010, Car and Driver suggested that the alleged accident rate of 1 in 200,000 recalled Toyotas was [...] "highly unlikely" [...] to result from <b>vehicle</b> <b>defects,</b> pointing to an increased danger for drivers who [...] "arent smart or calm enough to shift to neutral". The same month, Forbes referred to auto industry experts as [...] "skeptical" [...] of defect explanations, suggesting that [...] "driver error and panic account for many reported problems" [...] with recalled Toyotas. On February 4, Leonard Evans, author of Traffic Safety, claimed that driver behavior was the main factor in Toyota accidents, and that the consensus of 70 years of scientific research is that driver error is the prominent explanation for automotive fatalities. [...] In March 2010, Forbes Michael Fumento, The Atlantics Megan McArdle and attorney Ted Frank argued that {{the fact that most of}} the incidents of sudden acceleration in Toyota occur in elderly drivers strongly suggest that there is not an electronics problem as opposed to one of pedal misapplication. Fumentos article was titled: [...] "Why Do Toyotas Hate the Elderly?", and McArdle noted that immigrants were also twice as likely to be involved. However, lawsuits filed regarding sudden unintended acceleration cases, along with related third-party investigation reports, have typically avoided the driver error explanation.|$|E

A series of qualitative participants observations were conducted in Oman with 49 drivers. These observations also involved discussion and interviews with drivers. The observations occurred at two road-side locations where heavy vehicle drivers gather for eating, resting, vehicle check-up, etc. Data collection was conducted over a three week period. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. A broad number of factors were identified as contributing to the driving of vehicles with defects. Participants indicated that tyres and vehicle mechanical faults were a common issue in the heavy vehicle industry. Participants regularly reported that their companies use cheap, poor quality standards parts and conducted minimal maintenance. Drivers also indicated that they felt powerless to resist company pressure to drive vehicles with known faults. In addition, drivers reported that traffic police were generally in effective and lacked skill to appropriately conduct roadside inspection on trucks. Further, participants stated that it was possible for companies to avoid being fined during annual or roadside vehicle inspections if members of the company knew the traffic police officer conducting the inspection. Moreover, fines issued by police are generally directed to the individual driver rather than being applied to the company, thus providing no incentive for companies to address vehicle faults.

40|$|Special reportThis study {{examines}} {{the relationship of}} heavy truck mechanical condition and crash risk. The LTCCS presents an opportunity to examine in more detail than previously possible the relationship of vehicle condition to crash risk. The report includes {{a review of existing}} literature, a full analysis {{of the results of the}} post-crash truck inspections, and a series of logistic regression models to test the association of vehicle condition and crash role. Two specific hypotheses are tested: The first hypothesis is that trucks with defects and out of service conditions are statistically more likely to be in the role of precipitating a crash than trucks with no defects or out of service conditions. The second hypothesis is that defects in specific systems, such as the brake system, are associated with crash roles in which those systems are primary in crash avoidance, and that there is a physical mechanism that links the <b>vehicle</b> <b>defect</b> with the crash role. Post crash inspections showed that the condition of the trucks in the LTCCS is poor. Almost 55 percent of vehicles had one or more mechanical violations. Almost 30 percent had at least one out of service condition. Among mechanical systems, violations in the brake (36 percent of all) and lighting system (19 percent) were the most frequent. A brake OOS condition increased the odds of the truck assigned the critical reason (identifying the precipitating vehicle) by 1. 8 times. Both HOS violations and log OOS increased by a larger amount— 2. 0 and 2. 2 times respectively.

Overview of the global motorcycle crash situation was conducted using data and various information sources, including the World Health Organization, Science Direct and Transportation Research Institute, the University of Michigan. Non-English publications on motorcyclists and motorcycles were consulted. Sources of motorcycle accident information in Thailand included those of the Royal Thai Police, Department of Land Transport, and Road Accident Victims Protection. Key words used in the search included motorcycle safety, motorcycle crash/accident, motorcycle stability/balance, motorcycle defects, and motorcyclist. The results show that human errors, speeding, alcohol impairment, disregard of traffic laws, and inexperience are the most common factors involved in a motorcycle crash. Although <b>vehicle</b> <b>defects</b> such as defective components, (e. g. head lamp, stop lamp, front brake, rear brake, improper tire pressure) played a relatively small part of all the factors affecting motorcycle crash, but the effect was significant and increasing. One finding was clear from the review, very few research works have been done on the mechanism of motorcycle crashes due to motorcycle defects, especially those involving light weight motorcycle (101 - 125 cc) which is the most popular model in Thailand. Thus the study of the influence of the motorcycle and its components on a crash is needed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) is an {{association}} of industry representatives, and state, territorial, provincial, and federal government officials in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The CVSA's goal is to improve commercial vehicle safety. The CVSA concentrates its safety focus on three areas; driver, vehicle, and hazardous materials. Since 1981, the CVSA has developed a set of criteria {{for each of the}} three areas that define conditions which are so unsafe that a truck and/or driver should not be allowed to operate. These criteria are known as out of service (OOS) criteria. To check the compliance of motor carriers with the CVSA criteria, a series of road side inspections is conducted by state and local governments. If the driver and/or vehicle are found in violation of the CVSA OOS criteria, they are placed "out of service" until the conditions are completely remedied. Due to criteria growth, the CVSA wanted to examine the OOS criteria in the vehicle and hazardous materials areas. This study, focused on the vehicle portion of the OOS criteria, attempted to correlate commercial <b>vehicle</b> <b>defects</b> to commercial vehicle accidents. For a major portion of this project, actual accident reports from six states of the United States were evaluated. The states and reports were selected via a stratified two stage cluster sampling system. The results were used to form estimates of the proportion and number of commercial vehicle accidents in the United States with a mechanical defect as a contributing factor.
