A brief review of the results for a flame without <b>volumetric</b> heat <b>loss</b> is presented. The results are compared to those obtained recently for a flame suffering combined upstream/ downstream <b>volumetric</b> heat <b>loss.</b> For the structure, the analysis predicts that the expressions for the burning rate and the specific heat loss rate to the burner are not identical, unlike that shown for the freely propagating flame with <b>volumetric</b> heat <b>loss.</b> This is in agreement with earlier investigations of a flame suffering the three separate heat loss modes studied using thin-flame theory. Also in agreement with these earlier studies, the analysis predicts that the downstream heat loss mode is larger in magnitude than the upstream heat loss mode. For the diffusional-thermal instability, the analysis demonstrates that for the linear stability model considered, the effects of upstream and downstream heat loss appear in additive form.

PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify wear of artificial teeth in vivo and to relate it to subject and tooth variables. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects treated with complete dentures received 2 artificial tooth materials (polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) /double-cross linked PMMA fillers; 35 %/ 59 % (SR Antaris DCL, SR Postaris DCL); experimental 48 %/ 46 %). At baseline and after 12 months, impressions of the dentures were poured with improved stone. After laser scanning, the casts were superimposed and matched. Maximal vertical <b>loss</b> (mm) and <b>volumetric</b> <b>loss</b> (mm(3)) were calculated for each tooth and log-transformed to reduce variability. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>loss</b> was related to the occlusally active surface area. Linear mixed models were used to study the influence of the factors jaw, tooth, and material on adjusted (residual) wear values (alpha=. 05). RESULTS: Due to drop outs (n= 5) and unmatchable casts (n= 3), 69 % of all teeth were analyzed. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>loss</b> had a strong linear relationship to surface area (P<. 001); this was less pronounced for vertical loss (P=. 004). The factor showing the highest influence was the subject. Wear was tooth dependent (increasing from incisors to molars). However, these differences diminished once the wear rates were adjusted for occlusal area, and only a few remained significant (anterior versus posterior maxillary teeth). Another influencing factor was the age of the subject. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical wear of artificial teeth is higher than previously measured or expected.

However, they have some limits: brittleness {{is a major concern}} for ceramic, and ion release is a drawback for metal. To reduce the effect of these limitations, a hybrid coupling of ceramic-on-metal has been proposed. The theoretical advantage of this new coupling might lead orthopedic surgeons to use it indiscriminately. We asked whether the wear rate of this innovative solution was comparable with that of ceramic-on-ceramic, which is considered to be the gold standard for wear resistance. In a hip simulator study, we tested the wear pattern of a hybrid ceramic-on-metal coupling supplied by the same distributor; in particular, three different configurations were tested for 5 million cycles: 36 -mm ceramic-on-ceramic, 32 -mm and 36 -mm ceramic-on-metal. These combinations were gravimetrically and geometrically evaluated. After 5 million cycles, the <b>volumetric</b> <b>loss</b> for the metal acetabular cups (Theta 36 -mm) was 20 -fold greater than that of the ceramic cups of the same size (Theta 36 -mm); a <b>volumetric</b> <b>loss</b> of 4. 35 mm 3 and 0. 26 mm 3 was observed, respectively, for ceramic-on-metal and ceramic-on-ceramic combinations. Significant statistical differences were observed between all 36 -mm different combinations (P < 0. 0001). The increased diameter of the 36 -mm ceramic-on-metal configuration resulted in a lower <b>volumetric</b> <b>loss</b> compared with that of the 32 -mm ceramic-on-metal configuration. Our findings showed an increase in wear for the proposed hybrid specimens with respect to that of the ceramic-on-ceramic ones.

The most popular solution is a system where a throttling control valve is fed by a constant capacity pump cooperating with an overfl ow valve. This system, working with a constant pressure, achieves a high energy effi ciency value η only at the point of maximum motor load coeffi cient MM and maximum motor speed coeffi cient ωM. Energy savings in a constant capacity pump operation may be achieved by means of an overfl ow valve controlled by the oil outlet point pressure between the directional control valve and the cylinder.

To this purpose, 14 ceramic and 14 metallic femoral heads retrieved at revision surgery were examined. Scanning electron microscopic analysis provided visual evidence that some metallic heads presented crescent wear more often than the ceramic ones; the former showed a higher <b>volumetric</b> <b>loss</b> (as determined by Coordinate Measuring Machine) than the latter, but less negative Rsk values. This apparent lack of correlation between <b>volumetric</b> <b>loss</b> (i. e., wear factor) and roughness data may be explained by considering that they are two temporally variant parameters. No significant differences were observed between the Ra values of the two sets of femoral heads. The cups articulating against metal heads were characterized by higher mean wear volumes than those articulating against alumina although this difference was not statistically significant; metal heads displayed significantly higher mean wear volumes than alumina heads. The micro-Raman analysis of the cup articulated against the most worn alumina femoral head showed an orthorhombic into monoclinic phase transformation that was not observed in the cups coupled to metal heads.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Background: Non-carious {{cervical}} lesions (NCCLs) can {{be defined}} as the loss of dental hard tissue near the cemento-enamel junction without bacterial involvement. Abrasion, erosion and abfraction have been mentioned as common etiological factors of NCCLs. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure due to friction by materials such as toothbrushes or abrasives in toothpaste. In contrast, dental erosion is the loss of tooth structure driven by acids. Abfraction, on the other hand, starts due to the weakening of the tooth structure in areas of concentrated stress as a result of cuspal flexure from heavy and repeated occlusal loading, which progresses to dental hard-tissue loss. Purpose: The present study focused on the abrasion aspect of NCCLs. Specifically, it aimed to investigate the influence of dentifrice abrasivity and toothbrush stiffness on the development of NCCLs in vitro Hypothesis: NCCL development is affected by both the abrasive level of the dentifrice and the stiffness of the toothbrush, as well as their interaction. Materials and Methods: A total of 288 extracted human upper first premolars, free of any dental caries and root defects, were selected. The teeth were be cleaned with a hand periodontal scaler and randomly assigned into twelve groups (total of 24 teeth/group). Specimens were brushed in an automated toothbrushing machine, using simulated toothpaste slurries of varying abrasivity and toothbrushes of varying stiffness. This study examined three experimental factors: 1. Toothpaste abrasivity, at four levels: high, medium, low, and non-abrasive slurry (as negative control); 2. Toothbrush stiffness, at three levels: soft, medium, and hard; 3. Toothbrushing cycles at three levels: baseline, 35 k, and 65 k strokes. Specimens were analyzed by optical profilometry at baseline and after each brushing level. The response variable was the dentin <b>volumetric</b> <b>loss,</b> in mm 3. All toothbrushes caused significantly higher tooth wear when associated to the high abrasive slurry, compared to medium- and low-abrasive slurries. Medium- caused more tooth wear than low-abrasive slurry, which in turn led to more tooth wear than the control. Hard and medium toothbrushes were not significantly different, but both caused significantly higher <b>volumetric</b> <b>loss</b> than Soft toothbrushes. There were no differences among toothbrushes, when used with the non-abrasive (control) and low- abrasive slurries.

The scale of loss was found to be pronounced (mean: 3. 1 mm 3, 0. 02 - 11. 4 mm 3), with a mean rate of 0. 5 mm 3 /year (0. 003 - 1. 9 mm 3 /year). These results demonstrate that material loss from the cement-stem interface of is comparable to that of a taper interface, even in apparently well-fixed stems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The new {{epidemic}} of Zika virus infection raises grave concerns, {{especially with the}} increasingly-recognized link between emerging cases of microcephaly and this infectious disease. Besides small cranial dimensions, there are striking morphologic anomalies in the fetal brain. Key anomalies include cortical developmental malformations and a peculiar distribution of pathologic calcifications. These potentially indicate a new pattern of congenital central nervous system infection. Methods: Eight women underwent fetal MRI. Four infants also underwent postnatal CT. Five of the women underwent amniocentesis. Results: All neonates were born with microcephaly. On fetal MRI, ventriculomegaly, marked reduction of white matter thickness, severe sylvian fissure simplification, abnormal sulcation, and diffuse <b>volumetric</b> <b>loss</b> of cerebellar hemispheres were consistently seen. On postnatal CT, diffuse subcortical and basal ganglia calcifications were observed. The Zika virus was detected in two amniocenteses by polymerase chain reaction assays. Conclusion: We hope to assist the medical community in recognizing the spectrum of encephalic changes related to congenital Zika virus infection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Magnetic drive pump {{has gotten}} great {{achievement}} {{and has been}} widely used in some special fields. Currently, the researches on magnetic drive pump have focused on hydraulic design, bearing, axial force in China, and a new magnetic drive pump with low flow and high head have been developed overseas. However, low efficiency and large size are the common disadvantages for the magnetic drive pump. In order to study the performance of high-speed magnetic drive pump, FLUENT is used to simulate the inner flow field of magnetic drive pumps with different rotate speeds, and get velocity and pressure distributions of inner flow field. According to analysis the changes of velocity and pressure to ensure the stable operation of pump and avoid cavitation. Based on the analysis of velocity and pressure, this paper presents the pump efficiency of magnetic drive pumps with different rotated speeds by calculating the power loss in impeller and volute, hydraulic <b>loss,</b> <b>volumetric</b> <b>loss,</b> mechanical loss and discussing the different reasons of power loss between the magnetic drive pumps with different rotated speeds. In addition, the magnetic drive pumps are tested in a closed testing system. Pressure sensors are set in inlet and outlet of magnetic drive pumps to get the pressure and the head, while the pump efficiency can be got by calculating the power loss between the input power and the outlet power. The results of simulation and test are similar, which shows tha...|$|R
