40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the capability for computing internal pressures throughout flight for compartments located within space shuttle vehicles. A test program was conducted at a 6 x 6 foot supersonic wind tunnel to determine orifice efficiencies for the flow of air into a compartment from a flowing external stream. Measurements were made over a Mach number range of 0. 7 to 1. 9 for varying orifice geometry, <b>vent</b> orientation, <b>vent</b> <b>plate</b> thickness, flat plate boundary layer thickness, and pressure ratio across the <b>vent</b> <b>plate.</b> A computer program developed for outflow venting was modified for use in computing compartment pressures for inflow conditions. Results from both the outflow and inflow computer programs are included. A user's manual and program listing of the inflow venting program are also included...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{geometrical}} optimization of two infinitive plates for {{the enhancement}} of heat transfer between the plates is investigated by considering free convection and thermal radiation as heat transfer mechanisms. It is assumed that heat sources with specified length are placed in a linear array with infinitive length on the lower plate. These heat sources are placed at a specified distance between them. Heat flux of the heat sources and {{the temperature of the}} upper cold plate are the given data, and the mean temperature of the heat sources, the temperature difference between the upper cold plate and the mean temperature of the heat sources and the Nusselt number are the major parameters for optimizing the geometry of the plates. First, the problem is solved for two familiar geometries: when there exists an upper plate and when it is omitted. Eventually, a situation in which there are vents in the lower and the upper plate is investigated, and the optimum position of these vents as well as their sizes are obtained. The results show that placing <b>vents</b> on the <b>plates</b> can be very effective for enhancing heat transfer from the heat sources. For a particular array of heat sources and <b>vents</b> on the <b>plates,</b> the Nusselt number has the highest magnitude in comparison with other geometries, and consequently, the maximum heat transfer is available...|$|R

The 32-bit PowerPC G4s were replaced {{with one or}} two 64-bit PowerPC 970 processors running at 2 GHz. Ventilation issues restricted it to three SATA hot-swap drive bays, with the original space for the fourth drive bay used for air <b>vents.</b> The front <b>plate</b> and slot-loading optical drive were retained from the last Xserve G4. The higher memory capacity and bandwidth as well as the stronger floating-point performance of the PowerPC 970 made it more suitable for high-performance computing (HPC) applications. System X is one such cluster computer built with Xserves.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} shown that temperature, pressure, sulfur {{fugacity}} (fS 2), and oxygen fugacity (fO 2) influence the Fe content of sphalerite. We present compositional in situ data on sphalerite from submarine volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) ores of hydrothermal <b>vents</b> from different <b>plate</b> tectonic settings and with variable host-rock compositions. Sphalerite from sediment-hosted vents has systematically higher S contents and Fe/Zn ratios than those of the sediment-starved vents, reflecting an influence of fS 2 and fO 2 on Fe partitioning between fluid and sphalerite. The Fe/Zn ratios of sphalerite from sediment-starved vent systems apparently increase systematically with the fluid temperatures of the corresponding vents. We conclude that the composition of sphalerite can be used to (1) distinguish between sediment-hosted and sediment-starved hydrothermal processes, and (2) estimate minimum fluid temperatures of sphalerite precipitation from inactive sediment-starved hydrothermal vent sites and fossil VHMS deposits...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{develop and}} {{characterize}} the required detectors for uniform scanning optimization and characterization, {{and to develop}} the methodology and assess their efficacy for optimizing, characterizing and commissioning a novel proton beam uniform scanning system. Methods and Materials: The Multi Layer Ion Chamber (MLIC), a 1 D array of <b>vented</b> parallel <b>plate</b> ion chambers, was developed in-house for measurement of longitudinal profiles. The Matrixx detector (IBA Dosimetry, Germany) and XOmat V film (Kodak, USA) were characterized for measurement of transverse profiles. The architecture of the uniform scanning system was developed and then optimized and characterized for clinical proton radiotherapy. Results: The MLIC detector significantly increased data collection efficiency without sacrificing data quality. The MLIC was capable of integrating an entire scanned and layer stacked proton field with one measurement, producing results with the equivalent spatial sampling of 1. 0 mm. The Matrixx detector and modified 1 D water phantom jig improved data acquisition efficiency and complemented the film measurements. The proximal, central and distal proton field planeswere measured using these methods, yielding better than 3 % uniformity. The binary range modulator was programmed, optimized and characterized such that the proton field ranges were separated by approximately 5. 0 mm modulation width and delivered with an accuracy of 1. 0 mm in water. Several wobbling magnet scan patterns were evaluated and the raster pattern, spot spacing, scan amplitude and overscan margin were optimized for clinical use. Conclusion: Novel detectors and methods are required for clinically efficient optimization and characterization of proton beam scanning systems. Uniform scanning produces proton beam fields that are suited for clinical proton radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} to make the Centaur Vehicle a Space Transportation System (STS) payload meant that new ground support equipment provisions at Launch Pads Pads 39 A and 39 B were required. These new equipment provisions were needed to service the Centaur vehicle while it was installed in the Orbiter's payload bay prior to launch. This paper describes {{the design of a}} new rolling beam umbilical syste (RBUS) being added to the pad fixed service structure (FSS) in order to provide the primary functions of liquid hydrogen (LH 2) fill, drain, and <b>vent.</b> The carrier <b>plate</b> itself is a Government-furnished equipment item and of necessity became a T-O disconnect. This permits quick offloading {{in the event of an}} abort prior to lift-off. In addition to the rolling beam structure, mechanisms, and fluid lines, it was necessary to design and build a carrier plate simulator to support early development testing of the mast at the Launch Equipment Test Facility at Kennedy Space Center. The RBUS is designed to be compatible with the rotating service structure (RSS) to the extent that the umbilical may be deployed with the RSS mated with the vehicle. It is also designed to clear the RSS as the RSS rotates back out of the way. Accessibility to the Orbiter aft compartment via the 50 - 1 door had to be maintained...|$|R
40|$|Microwear {{analysis}} has been severely underutilized as a dietary technique due to numerous constraints involved in employing traditional scanning electron microscopy. A new methodology is described that greatly simplifies {{the assessment of}} microwear scar features for the discernment of the trophic adaptations of living and fossil taxa. A standard stereomicroscope and a fiber-optic light source have replaced specimen preparation tools such as <b>venting</b> and <b>plating</b> apparatus and the high-tech scanning electron microscope. Several new microwear variables supplement traditional quantification of pits and scratches. Significant niche partitioning in extant browsers, grazers, and mixed feeders is apparent and habitat differences within each broad trophic group are discernible by scoring relative pit sizes, scratch textures, and gouges in addition to quantifying scratches and pits. ^ Variations in scratch number ranges, scratch textures, and relative pit sizes are the most useful variables for partitioning living ungulates into more refined trophic categories. Pit numbers and scratch textures are most effective for distinguishing fine versus coarse browsing, as well as leaf browsing versus fruit browsing. Scratch textural differences and scratch numbers distinguish fresh grass grazing versus coarse or mixed grass grazing; C 3 versus C 4 grazing, coarse bark and stem feeding, and seasonal or regional mixed feeding versus a meal-by-meal alternation between browse and grass. Heavy gouging is used to distinguish significant grit encroachment upon food items. Seasonal or regional mixed feeders have microwear that is more similar to browsers, whereas meal-by-meal mixed feeders have wear more similar to grazers. ^ Three trophic phases are identified within extant ungulates by partitioning taxa into three potential raw scratch ranges: traditional browsing and grazing phases, comprised by surprisingly few species, and a browsing-to-grazing transitional phase {{where the majority of}} taxa are found, including all of the mixed feeders. The new microwear methodology is used to test two hypotheses regarding large shifts in dietary strategies in fossil ungulates from the North American Great Plains region: the supposed browsing-grazing transition in the fossil record of North American equids and the supposed shift to coarser browse in the fossil ruminant artiodactyl family known as the Dromomerycidae. ...|$|R
40|$|A shallow solar-pond {{integrated}} with a baffle plate is investigated theoretically and experimentally under Tanta prevailing weather conditions. A transient mathematical model is presented for the pond. The energy-balance equations for {{various parts of}} the pond are solved analytically using the elimination technique. In order to validate the theoretical model, experiments are performed under the batch mode of heat extraction with a black painted baffle plate made of stainless steel, with and without <b>vents</b> in the <b>plate,</b> for different masses of water in the upper and lower layers. It is found that the pond-water temperature decreases with increasing vent area; therefore, the baffle plate should be used without vents with shallow depths of the upper water-layer. Experiments have also been carried out using baffle plates made from Al and mica in order to study the effect of the thermal conductivity of the baffle plate on the pond's performance. The average temperature of the pond water is found to be less dependent on the thermal conductivity of the baffle plate. It is also inferred that the present system could provide 88 L of hot water at a maximum temperature of 71 Â°C at 3 : 00 pm with a daily efficiency of 64. 3 % when the baffle plate is used without vents. The pond can retain hot water until 7 : 00 am of the next day at a temperature of 43 Â°C, which can be used for most domestic applications. Comparisons between experimental and theoretical results indicated that the theoretical model could be used for estimating the pond's performance with good accuracy.

40|$|Discovering if {{hotspots}} {{observed on}} the Earth’s surface are explained by underlying plumes {{rising from the}} deep mantle or by a shallow plate-cracking mechanism {{continues to be an}} essential goal in Earth Science. Key evidence underpinning the mantle plume concept is the existence of narrow, age-progressive volcanic trails recording past plate motion relative to surface hotspots and their deep causal plumes. Using the icebreaker RV Polarstern we sampled scattered hotspot trails on the 2, 000 km-wide southeast Atlantic hotspot swell, which projects down to one of the Earth’s two largest and deepest regions of slower-than-average seismic wave speed – the Africa Low Shear Wave Velocity Province – caused by a massive thermo-chemical ‘pile’ on the core-mantle boundary. We showed recently using 40 Ar/ 39 Ar isotopic ages – and crustal structure and seafloor ages – that these hotspot trails are age progressive and formed synchronously across the swell, consistent with African plate motion over plumes rising from the stable edge of a Low Shear Wave Velocity Province (LLSVP) (O’Connor et al., 2012). We showed furthermore that hotspot trails formed initially only at spreading boundaries at the outer edges of the swell until roughly 44 million years ago, when they started forming across the swell, far from spreading boundaries in lithosphere that was sufficiently weak (young) for plume melts to reach the surface. We concluded that if plume melts formed synchronous age progressive hotspot trails whenever they could penetrate the lithosphere, then hotspot trails in the South Atlantic are controlled by the interplay between deep plumes and the shallow motion and structure of the African plate. Our observations reveal a plate tectonic-controlled cycle from the creation of deep thermo-chemical piles (LLSVP) and initiation of deep mantle plumes at the CMB to the shallow formation of the resulting hotspot trails. Moreover, suppression of plume melts from <b>venting</b> to the <b>plate</b> surface for tens of millions of years implies that the plumes responsible for the southeast Atlantic hotspot swell and hotspot trails transported more material and heat from the core mantle boundary than measured by hotspot volcanism. ...|$|R
